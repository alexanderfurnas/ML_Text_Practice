JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.839 --> 00:06.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Donald Trump's attack on the
integrity of

00:10.978 --> 00:17.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
U.S. elections has both
Democrats and Republicans
coming to the defense of a
pillar of democracy.

00:17.484 --> 00:22.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Then: a ground
report from
swing state North Carolina --
how Americans

00:22.589 --> 00:25.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
struggling with poverty in rural
areas view
this election.

00:25.492 --> 00:30.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TRUDELL, North Carolina: I
mean, if they
came down here and saw how
people are actually

00:30.530 --> 00:35.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
living in rural America, then
maybe they would
change it.

00:35.535 --> 00:37.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maybe they would do something.

00:37.371 --> 00:42.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the
surprising split over
a proposed carbon tax in
Seattle, Washington,

00:42.910 --> 00:46.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting residents in a dead heat
over how
to keep the state green.

00:46.280 --> 00:50.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL BRUNE, Executive
Director, Sierra
Club: Two of the biggest
challenges we face

00:50.083 --> 00:55.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this country are climate
change and economic
inequality.

00:55.555 --> 01:00.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If we pit one of those
challenges against
the other, neither will be
successful.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.697 --> 01:08.135 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:08.168 --> 01:20.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On this day
after the final
debate, Donald Trump is at the
center of a

01:20.147 --> 01:22.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political storm again.

01:22.115 --> 01:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It blew up last night with his
refusal to
say he'd acknowledge next
month's outcome.

01:26.787 --> 01:32.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I will totally accept the
results of this

01:32.225 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
great and historic presidential
election,
if I win.

01:39.866 --> 01:41.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:41.702 --> 01:45.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Donald Trump
in Delaware,
Ohio, today, stirring the pot
again on what

01:45.906 --> 01:47.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happens if he loses.

01:47.674 --> 01:54.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Of course, I would
accept a
clear election result, but I
would also reserve

01:54.081 --> 02:01.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my right to contest or file a
legal challenge
in the case of a questionable
result.

02:01.421 --> 02:07.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All of that
after the nominee
touched off a furor during his
final debate

02:07.594 --> 02:09.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Hillary Clinton.

02:09.529 --> 02:11.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS WALLACE, Moderator: Are
you saying you're
not prepared now to commit to
that principle?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: What I'm saying is
that I will
tell you at the time.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will keep you in suspense.

02:14.434 --> 02:16.370 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

02:16.403 --> 02:17.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, Chris, let me respond to
that, because

02:17.137 --> 02:19.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's horrifying.

02:19.172 --> 02:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Clinton went
further post-debate
while flying from Las Vegas
early this morning.

02:22.943 --> 02:28.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: So, what
he said tonight
is part of his whole effort to
blame somebody

02:28.215 --> 02:31.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else for his campaign and for
where he stands
in this election.

02:31.351 --> 02:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Trump also got
pushback
from fellow Republicans,
including John Thune,

02:35.956 --> 02:38.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the number three Republican in
the Senate.

02:38.291 --> 02:43.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said all such talk -- quote
-- "undermines
an electoral system that is a
model for nations

02:43.263 --> 02:44.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the world."

02:45.032 --> 02:48.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another Republican senator, Bob
Corker, who
has campaigned with Trump,
tweeted: "It is

02:48.902 --> 02:53.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imperative that Donald Trump
clearly state
that he will accept the
results."

02:53.573 --> 02:56.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell declined
comment today.

02:56.476 --> 03:00.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And House Speaker Paul Ryan's
office said
he is fully confident the states
will carry

03:00.847 --> 03:02.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out this election with
integrity.

03:02.949 --> 03:07.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, late today, President Obama
weighed in,
stumping for Clinton in Miami.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
That is not a joking matter.

03:09.756 --> 03:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, no, no, I want everybody to
pay attention
here.

03:12.692 --> 03:20.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is dangerous, because when
you try to
sow the seeds of doubt in
people's minds about

03:20.567 --> 03:23.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the legitimacy of our elections,
that undermines
our democracy.

03:23.970 --> 03:28.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile, in
New York,
another woman came forward to
accuse Donald

03:28.875 --> 03:30.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump of groping her.

03:30.310 --> 03:35.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Karena Virginia says it happened
in New York
in 1998.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Trump today accused Clinton
of political
cheating.

03:38.151 --> 03:42.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He cited a hacked e-mail that
showed she was
tipped about a death penalty
question during

03:42.989 --> 03:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a primary season town hall.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: That is cheating
at the highest
level.

03:47.961 --> 03:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As for last
night's final
face-off, early ratings show
about 68 million

03:52.699 --> 03:57.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans watched, more than the
second debate,
but far fewer than the first.

03:57.070 --> 04:02.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, both candidates share a
stage again,
this time, at the gala Al Smith
Dinner in

04:02.042 --> 04:03.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New York.

04:03.844 --> 04:08.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: A
Russia-Syrian humanitarian pause
took effect

04:08.315 --> 04:11.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria in the besieged city of
Aleppo.

04:11.518 --> 04:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could run as long as four
days.

04:14.054 --> 04:19.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Using loudspeakers, the Syrian
military urged
residents to leave and gunmen to
lay down

04:19.159 --> 04:20.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their weapons.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Syrian army also dropped
leaflets.

04:22.195 --> 04:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the U.N.'s special envoy
said he doubts
the effort will work.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: Certainly, my
feeling is

04:28.401 --> 04:34.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, from what I'm hearing,
that the people
do not want to leave their
places.

04:34.407 --> 04:37.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do not want to become
refugees.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want to stay in their
place.

04:39.112 --> 04:44.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they do request, stop the
bombings, which
needs to be, by the way, from
both sides.

04:44.184 --> 04:48.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, a
separate fight
north of Aleppo.

04:48.255 --> 04:53.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey attacked Syrian Kurds
who've been fighting
Islamic State forces.

04:53.193 --> 04:58.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Military footage showed
airstrikes on Kurdish
fighters linked to a group the
U.S. supports.

04:58.698 --> 05:02.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey says they're also tied to
militants
fighting the Turkish government.

05:02.402 --> 05:06.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Iraq, the
battle for
Mosul claimed its first American
casualty,

05:06.473 --> 05:09.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a soldier killed by a roadside
bomb.

05:09.075 --> 05:13.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. forces are advising Iraqis
in their campaign
to retake the city from the
Islamic State.

05:13.346 --> 05:16.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, they have to capture
outlying towns.

05:16.216 --> 05:20.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And John Irvine of Independent
Television
News reports on the harrowing
trip of one

05:20.353 --> 05:22.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
such unit.

05:22.222 --> 05:27.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN IRVINE: A new day brought a
fresh assault,
and taking the fight I.S. for
the first time,

05:27.227 --> 05:32.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where Iraq special forces came
to quickly
make their mark.

05:32.933 --> 05:37.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The attack was a pincer
movement, and we were
in the lead vehicle with a team
of (INAUDIBLE)

05:37.671 --> 05:41.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who had to find safe passage
through the land
mines.

05:41.775 --> 05:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two led the way on foot, but
soon came under
sniper fire.

05:46.980 --> 05:51.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A gunship was called in.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The sniping was ended.

05:54.321 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The explosives experts called
for a tank to
join them before leaving the
Kalamoff (ph)

05:59.492 --> 06:03.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Road and on to the safer ground
that is the
countryside.

06:03.563 --> 06:10.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were venturing into the
so-called caliphate,
and the Iraqi forces put down a
lot of suppressing

06:10.103 --> 06:11.871 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fire.

06:11.905 --> 06:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the telltale pings on our
vehicle indicated
that I.S. were still putting up
a night.

06:17.611 --> 06:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're coming under sniper fire
and firing
back.

06:22.449 --> 06:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the problem with being in
the lead
vehicle in an offensive which
right now is

06:28.421 --> 06:30.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pretty slow-going.

06:30.257 --> 06:38.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, the special forces fired
on a saloon
car which had overturned
speeding down a road.

06:38.632 --> 06:43.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When nothing happened, we
wondered if the
driver had been an innocent just
trying to

06:43.069 --> 06:45.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
flee the battlefield.

06:45.839 --> 06:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, he was a suicide bomber who
had missed
us.

06:53.580 --> 06:58.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were just glad that, at the
end of the
day, all of us and our battered
vehicle had

06:58.318 --> 06:59.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come through.

06:59.886 --> 07:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only, it wasn't the end of the
day -- a fourth
car bomb attack on the convoy.

07:14.401 --> 07:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mosul is still a few days away
for Iraqi forces,
and the closer they get, the
harder it will

07:20.640 --> 07:21.808 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
become.

07:21.841 --> 07:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There are
5,000 U.S. troops
in Iraq.

07:25.245 --> 07:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About 100 are embedded with
Iraqi and Kurdish
forces around Mosul.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will talk later to retired
General David
Petraeus.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He commanded U.S. troops in
Mosul in 2003.

07:33.920 --> 07:38.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. military
confirms
that North Korea test-fired
another ballistic

07:38.825 --> 07:42.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
missile overnight, but it
crashed shortly
after launch.

07:42.329 --> 07:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the second failed test
since Saturday.

07:45.165 --> 07:50.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It came hours after the U.S. and
South Korea
agreed to strengthen military
and diplomatic

07:50.537 --> 07:52.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
efforts against the North.

07:52.505 --> 07:56.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
of the Philippines,
Rodrigo Duterte, announced today
what he calls

07:56.042 --> 08:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a separation from the U.S.
Duterte spoke in
Beijing after meeting with
Chinese President

08:01.981 --> 08:05.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Xi Jinping and signing a major
commercial
deal.

08:05.352 --> 08:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afterward, he said that in
military and economic
terms, America has lost.

08:10.657 --> 08:16.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President: Maybe
I will also go to Russia to talk
to Putin

08:16.963 --> 08:24.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and tell him that there are
three of us against
the world, China, Philippines
and Russia.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

08:25.905 --> 08:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Duterte also
said he will
work with Xi to settle their

in the South China Sea.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Washington, the State
Department called
the comments baffling and said
it will seek

08:34.681 --> 08:36.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an explanation.

08:36.449 --> 08:40.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A super typhoon
blasted the
Northern Philippines overnight
with winds

08:40.520 --> 08:42.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of 140 miles an hour.

08:42.655 --> 08:47.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the most powerful storm
to hit the
country in three years, but the
death toll

08:47.093 --> 08:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of seven was far lower than
feared.

08:49.863 --> 08:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The storm did trigger flooding,
landslides
and power outages.

08:53.967 --> 08:57.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly 100,000 people had been
evacuated ahead
of time.

08:57.570 --> 09:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The European
Space Agency
now says its latest Mars lander
may have crashed.

09:03.510 --> 09:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ground controllers lost contact
with the experimental
probe yesterday as it dropped
toward the surface.

09:07.881 --> 09:12.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Animation showed how the lander
was supposed
to use a parachute and thrusters
to make a

09:12.852 --> 09:14.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
soft landing.

09:14.320 --> 09:18.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Europe's last attempt at a Mars
landing also
failed back in 2003.

09:18.158 --> 09:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wall Street,
stocks closed
lower, giving up yesterday's
modest gains.

09:23.129 --> 09:27.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 40 points
to close at 18162.

09:27.667 --> 09:33.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell four, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped
nearly three.

09:33.506 --> 09:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And for wine
lovers, it's
a case of sour grapes.

09:36.643 --> 09:41.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A global survey out today finds
this year's
production is the lowest since
2012.

09:41.147 --> 09:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Floods, drought and other bad
weather took
a toll across Europe and South
America.

09:45.718 --> 09:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wine output in the U.S. actually
went up slightly.

09:49.355 --> 09:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
an in-depth
look at some of the key moments
from last

09:53.259 --> 09:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night's debate; rural voters
feeling abandoned
by today's politicians; General
David Petraeus'

09:59.199 --> 10:05.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take on the fight in Mosul;
Washington state
divided over a tax on carbon
pollution; and

10:05.371 --> 10:09.409 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

10:09.442 --> 10:20.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we heard
earlier, Donald
Trump continued to suggest today
that he might

10:20.720 --> 10:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not accept the results of the
November election
if he doesn't win.

10:25.425 --> 10:29.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But should he lose, could Trump
legally challenge
the results?

10:29.596 --> 10:31.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And how would that process work?

10:31.531 --> 10:35.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
To examine some of these
questions, we are
joined now by Chris Ashby.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's a Republican election
lawyer.

10:37.904 --> 10:42.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Beverly Gage, she's
professor of American
history at Yale University.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

10:44.777 --> 10:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Beverly Gage, to you first.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have we ever seen anything quite
like this
before?

10:48.147 --> 10:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE, Yale University:
We have not
seen anything like this before,
Judy.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been contested
elections in the
past.

10:55.788 --> 11:00.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those are often close
elections, where,
once the results are in, they
seem uncertain,

11:00.860 --> 11:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and so you have a variety of
appeals.

11:03.062 --> 11:09.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have never had a major
party candidate
say this far in advance that the
only legitimate

11:09.669 --> 11:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outcome of only an election is
his own victory.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is unprecedented.

11:14.541 --> 11:18.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as you say,
we have had
contested elections after the
fact.

11:18.811 --> 11:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we certainly -- everyone who
is at least
of a certain age remembers 2000,
Bush v. Gore.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there have been others in
American history,
haven't there?

11:27.453 --> 11:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: Right, there have
been contested
elections and really fiercely
fought elections

11:32.225 --> 11:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a lot of bad feelings
almost since the
beginning of the republic.

11:37.196 --> 11:42.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What those have always produced
is, with one
pretty big exception, is the
peaceful transition

11:42.535 --> 11:44.370 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of power.

11:44.404 --> 11:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That exception, of course, is
1860, where
much of the white South said
that they wouldn't

11:48.975 --> 11:54.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
accept Abraham Lincoln's
election as president,
and we got the Civil War as a
result.

11:54.581 --> 12:01.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But with that pretty big
exception, everyone,
despite challenges, has
ultimately come around.

12:01.521 --> 12:07.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other than 2000, probably the
famous one in
recent memory was 1960, which
was this squeaker

12:07.393 --> 12:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an election between Kennedy
and Nixon,
in which Nixon to some degree
challenged the

12:14.500 --> 12:16.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, but himself stepped
aside.

12:16.502 --> 12:19.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we know there
was a dispute
about that one.

12:19.038 --> 12:22.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chris Ashby, let me just play
devil's advocate
here, because what Donald Trump
is saying

12:22.842 --> 12:27.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and he said this today -- he
said, I want
to reserve the right to file a
challenge in

12:27.347 --> 12:30.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
case of a questionable result.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that not a reasonable thing
for him to
do?

12:32.185 --> 12:34.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS ASHBY, GOP Campaign
Lawyer: No, it's
not because it's a statement of
the obvious.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He doesn't waive his right.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't need to claim that
right now.

12:38.291 --> 12:42.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he should do is say what
every major,
indeed every presidential
candidate before

12:42.895 --> 12:44.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him has said, which is, I will
accept the
outcome.

12:44.664 --> 12:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, after the election, if
there is
some evidence that an election
of electors

12:49.836 --> 12:52.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a particular state was
tainted by fraud,
then he could pursue that.

12:52.839 --> 12:57.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But by saying it now, he's
undermining the
legitimacy of this election and
the individuals

12:57.877 --> 12:59.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who it elects.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's very dangerous and it's
destructive
to the country.

13:01.581 --> 13:07.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
for a moment
about what would it take to
trigger a challenge.

13:07.353 --> 13:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How off would the results have
to be in order
to -- for there to be warranted
a legitimate

13:14.594 --> 13:16.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
challenge to the results?

13:16.496 --> 13:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CHRIS ASHBY: Well, the
standard here
in a challenge would be a
significant number

13:20.967 --> 13:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of votes that could be proven,
right?

13:23.736 --> 13:26.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't just say that there
was generally
fraud.

13:26.172 --> 13:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to know how many votes
either from
fraud or by mistake.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it has to be enough votes to
cover the
margin between the candidates.

13:33.780 --> 13:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if you think that you
have to go out
and actually get this evidence,
you have to

13:37.350 --> 13:41.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
find voters, you have to
election records,
and you have to quantify this,
and you have

13:41.888 --> 13:44.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do it in a time period of
about a month.

13:44.557 --> 13:48.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The election would have to be
pretty close
in order for them to have any
chance of quantifying

13:48.728 --> 13:50.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a difference between the two
candidates.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when you say
pretty close,
how close do you mean?

13:53.700 --> 13:57.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CHRIS ASHBY: Maybe a few
hundred,
maybe in the low thousands of
folks.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And even that would be a high
bar.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're talking
state by
state.

14:00.239 --> 14:04.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CHRIS ASHBY: That's
right, because
the contest is not of the
presidential election.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's of the electors.

14:05.611 --> 14:09.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that happens in 51 different
states and
the District of Columbia.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you are bringing a
contest to the election
of the electors.

14:13.586 --> 14:18.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you would have to bring
enough state contests
to cover the difference in the
Electoral College.

14:18.491 --> 14:23.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if this election heads the
way that it
appears that it's heading, that
could be hundreds

14:23.396 --> 14:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of electoral votes that we need
to swing in
a contest decided by multiple
states at once.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very, very high bar.

14:29.569 --> 14:34.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Beverly Gage,
back to what
we have seen historically in
American elections,

14:34.540 --> 14:39.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's an example of a time when
-- I mean,
you can talk about 1960, 2000.

14:39.345 --> 14:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, dig a little bit deeper
into what
it would take to trigger
something and then

14:45.518 --> 14:46.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to pursue it.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEVERLY GAGE: Right.

14:48.454 --> 14:53.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, one thing to note about
the 20th century,
for the most part, we haven't
had particularly

14:53.226 --> 14:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
close presidential elections.

14:55.161 --> 15:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Chris is right, that it
would need to
be incredibly close for anything
like this

15:00.066 --> 15:01.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to happen.

15:01.801 --> 15:05.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's actually fairly
unusual, though
we have gotten a little bit more
used to it

15:05.104 --> 15:06.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in recent years.

15:06.773 --> 15:11.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, 1960 was really a razor-thin
count.

15:11.744 --> 15:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at that point, Nixon didn't
concede overnight,
but he did concede in the
morning.

15:18.084 --> 15:24.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican Party itself,
however, went
ahead and challenged various
election results

15:24.257 --> 15:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in states like Illinois, in
Texas.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sometimes, that was through the
courts.

15:29.228 --> 15:30.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sometimes, that was through
recounts.

15:31.030 --> 15:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there was never any truth
that there had
been any fraud significant
enough to change

15:35.935 --> 15:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the outcome of the election.

15:37.703 --> 15:42.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Nixon himself actually
always took it
as a point of political pride
that, though

15:42.175 --> 15:48.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he harbored a heavy heart in
that moment,
he in fact conceded to Kennedy
for the good

15:48.915 --> 15:50.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

15:50.683 --> 15:56.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Chris Ashby,
let's talk
for a moment about 2004, Ohio,
John Kerry.

15:56.389 --> 16:02.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats challenged some of
how that
state, the state of Ohio came
out.

16:02.428 --> 16:06.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It went for Bush in 2004, but
there were questions
raised.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CHRIS ASHBY: Sure.

16:08.167 --> 16:11.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they raised those questions
in Congress,
and Congress disposed of those
questions pretty

16:11.070 --> 16:12.839 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
quickly.

16:12.872 --> 16:18.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the absence of some kind of
compelling
evidence of fraud or of mistakes
in the conduct

16:18.077 --> 16:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the election that affects the
outcome,
I just don't see people having
much patience

16:22.348 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or time for this type of a
challenge.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other
question, Chris Ashby
-- and we have discussed this on
the program

16:27.253 --> 16:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier this week -- Donald
Trump is saying
to his supporters -- and he's
said this in

16:31.724 --> 16:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several different parts of the
country -- you
need to go and watch what's
happening at polling

16:38.231 --> 16:39.198 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
places.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would that mean, if that
happened?

16:41.000 --> 16:44.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CHRIS ASHBY: Well, that's
a very
dangerous situation, because, in
most states,

16:44.103 --> 16:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're not going to be allowed
in.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Most states require poll
watchers to have
some sort of credential, some
type of training

16:49.942 --> 16:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and potentially understanding of
the process
that they're observing.

16:52.645 --> 16:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even in those states where any
member of the
public can walk in and observe,
they're not

16:57.350 --> 17:01.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to get anywhere near a
voter, anywhere
near a poll booth, anywhere near
an election

17:01.487 --> 17:03.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
official.

17:03.322 --> 17:06.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if they try to interfere
with the conduct
of the election, they're going
to be removed.

17:06.392 --> 17:10.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they either can't get
in or are taken
out, I think that's just going
to feed right

17:10.296 --> 17:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the suspicion that led them
there in
the first place.

17:12.899 --> 17:16.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now you play this out in
polling places
across the country, and you
broadcast it on

17:16.402 --> 17:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the news, and it gets picked up
on the Internet,
it's a very, very flammable
situation on Election

17:21.407 --> 17:23.142 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day.

17:23.175 --> 17:27.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Beverly
Gage, remind
us what it means in our
democracy that we

17:27.079 --> 17:31.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are able to count on and respect
the results
of our elections.

17:31.517 --> 17:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: One of the most
important things
really since our founding has
been the peaceful

17:37.556 --> 17:38.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
transition of power.

17:38.991 --> 17:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is something that every
president has really
prided himself on.

17:43.362 --> 17:49.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you think back to the
founders, those
were people with a living memory
of revolution.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They had seen it in Europe.

17:51.370 --> 17:56.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They had experienced it
themselves, and they
understood that it was
absolutely critical

17:56.142 --> 18:00.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to affirm the electoral system
and to see
that power could pass
peacefully.

18:00.947 --> 18:06.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was one of the great
points of pride
for the country and has been
almost always

18:06.152 --> 18:07.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ever since.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is
another moment
for us to think about that and
remember what

18:10.890 --> 18:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it does mean for our country and
for our system
of government.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beverly Gage, Chris Ashby, we
thank you both.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /CHRIS ASHBY: Thank you.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEVERLY GAGE: Thanks.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Unlike the
first two debates,
last night, we heard a lot more
about policy

18:23.269 --> 18:24.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from both candidates.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here to help break them down is
our own Lisa
Desjardins.

18:27.173 --> 18:32.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the first exchanges that
was substantive
was about Supreme Court nominee
decisions

18:32.678 --> 18:37.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that these -- one of these two
presidents,
in whoever wins, would have and
what kind

18:37.883 --> 18:42.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of impact that person would have
in the courts
and on cases like Roe v. Wade.

18:42.421 --> 18:44.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's a clip.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Based on what she's saying, and
based on where

18:46.058 --> 18:50.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's going, and where she's
been, you can
take the baby and rip the baby
out of the

18:50.997 --> 18:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
womb in the ninth month on the
final day.

18:55.201 --> 18:56.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's not acceptable.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How many
late-term abortions
are there?

18:59.238 --> 19:02.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Because it usually gets
distilled down into
these worse-case scenarios.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention
is really a good -- the best
resource we have

19:06.712 --> 19:07.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for these kinds of statistics.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we only know after 21 weeks.

19:10.349 --> 19:11.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's what they say.

19:11.784 --> 19:17.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the U.S., roughly 1.3 percent
of all abortions
happen after 21 weeks.

19:17.189 --> 19:21.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's considered late term, but
it's still
the middle of the second
trimester.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That translates into about 6,100
abortions.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was in 2012.

19:26.232 --> 19:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is out of almost 700,000.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it's a small percentage.

19:31.070 --> 19:32.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What is
Hillary Clinton's
position on this?

19:32.905 --> 19:34.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says that she would favor
restrictions
in the third trimester on
abortion, but only

19:38.277 --> 19:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if the life of the mother or
health of the
mother was considered.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's specifically her policy.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It has been consistent.

19:44.617 --> 19:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And then what
about that
larger context that Donald Trump
and Hillary

19:48.154 --> 19:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton was asked about what
happens If justices
get appointed that overturn Roe
v. Wade?

19:52.691 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What happens next?

19:53.959 --> 19:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is where
it gets really
fascinating.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is thought by most legal
scholars that
it would return to the states,
that state

19:58.998 --> 20:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
law would take over abortion.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know right now there are
states that
have laws on the books saying if
Roe vs. Wade

20:05.838 --> 20:09.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is overturned, they would make
abortion unlawful.

20:09.508 --> 20:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Other states would increase
restrictions.

20:11.410 --> 20:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a real question over
whether the
next president will have enough
seats on the

20:15.915 --> 20:18.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court to in fact overturn Roe
vs. Wade.

20:18.350 --> 20:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And there was
also another
exchange about nuclear arms and
kind of the

20:22.855 --> 20:23.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
race with Russia.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's take a listen.

20:25.825 --> 20:31.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We have a country
with tremendous
numbers of nuclear warheads --
1,800, by the

20:31.063 --> 20:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way -- where they expanded and
we didn't,
1,800 nuclear warheads.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she's playing chicken.

20:38.270 --> 20:43.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are so outplayed on missiles,
on cease-fires.

20:43.142 --> 20:44.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are outplayed.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, I think
both sides would
agree that there's not going to
be a winner

20:47.613 --> 20:49.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a nuclear war around the
world.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But why does this numbers games
matter?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right, 1,800,
he's saying.

20:53.219 --> 20:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's talking about strategic
deployed
nuclear weapons by Russia.

20:57.423 --> 21:00.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let's look real quick at
where we are,
just as some background.

21:00.326 --> 21:06.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, in 2016, Russia has
about 1,735
deployed nuclear strategic
nuclear weapons.

21:06.232 --> 21:08.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Those are basically
ready-to-launch weapons.

21:08.501 --> 21:12.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S., 1,481 -- that's from
the Arms Control
Association.

21:13.005 --> 21:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here's the thing, Hari, is
that those
numbers are misleading, because
both countries

21:17.209 --> 21:19.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are under a treaty.

21:19.345 --> 21:22.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By 2018, both countries have to
have less
than 1,550.

21:22.081 --> 21:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both Russia and the U.S. right
now are decreasing
their nuclear arsenals.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These matter for strategic and
political reasons
both.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And so aren't
all nukes
the same?

21:31.690 --> 21:34.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's the decrease --
what's the cause
in the decrease besides the
treaty?

21:34.593 --> 21:35.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Not all nukes are the same.

21:37.396 --> 21:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we talked to one expert who
counts the
nukes and knows the different
types of nukes,

21:41.167 --> 21:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and says, overall, you step away
from all
of the details, what matters
here is the difference

21:46.105 --> 21:52.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in numbers between the U.S. and
Russia really
doesn't matter in terms of the
amount of number

21:52.478 --> 21:53.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of nuclear weapons.

21:53.979 --> 21:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The size of these arsenals are
so huge, they
can do tremendous damage.

21:57.349 --> 21:59.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Difference of a few hundred
nukes is not great.

21:59.418 --> 22:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's also a
clip here
I want to play.

22:02.521 --> 22:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chris Wallace brought up a
revelation from
WikiLeaks which tried to
highlight the discrepancy

22:08.194 --> 22:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between Hillary Rodham Clinton's
public positions
on immigration and an excerpt
from a speech

22:13.832 --> 22:14.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that she gave.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's take a listen.

22:16.101 --> 22:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS WALLACE, Moderator: Is
that your dream,
open borders?

22:18.037 --> 22:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, if you went on to read the
rest of the

22:19.972 --> 22:22.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sentence, I was talking about
energy.

22:22.942 --> 22:28.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we trade more energy
with our neighbors
than we trade with the rest of
the world combined.

22:28.581 --> 22:32.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And, you know,
this is a
sentence that was just one -- a
couple of

22:32.718 --> 22:33.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sentences.

22:33.719 --> 22:34.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't have the full speech.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the problem here.

22:36.422 --> 22:39.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know what Hillary
Clinton was saying
before she talked about open
borders.

22:39.592 --> 22:43.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Was she talking about
immigration or was she
talking about energy, as she
claimed?

22:43.596 --> 22:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can look at a few other
excerpts we have
here and there from that speech,
Hari.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She did talk about energy a lot
in that speech.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She also talked about trade.

22:51.103 --> 22:53.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't know that she talked
about immigration.

22:53.038 --> 22:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is a problem, because
Hillary Clinton
has not released the full
transcript of that

22:56.909 --> 22:58.444 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speech.

22:58.477 --> 23:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know for sure what she
was talking
about when she said open
borders.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
this was your
assignment for today, but since
the election

23:03.649 --> 23:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is so close, we have got you
working on lots
of different things.

23:05.918 --> 23:09.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as part of our Chasing the
Dream series,
you just recently went out to
rural North

23:09.421 --> 23:10.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Carolina.

23:10.422 --> 23:12.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

23:12.258 --> 23:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And out there, we found a large
group of people
and a very large issue that the
truth is the

23:15.194 --> 23:17.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaigns have nearly ignored.

23:17.930 --> 23:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a place rich in landscapes
and in spirit,
fiercely proud of its
Appalachian heritage.

23:27.673 --> 23:32.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But amid that beauty and
strength, the towns
of Western North Carolina are
struggling,

23:32.745 --> 23:34.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and many feel no one is
listening.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK TRUDELL, North Carolina: I
don't have
a savings.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is pretty much paycheck to
paycheck.

23:38.751 --> 23:43.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARLA DIETZ, North Carolina And
I don't think
politicians realize how many of
us.

23:43.822 --> 23:45.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is the face of poverty.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE DIETZ, North Carolina:
They don't understand
that there are people that
actually try to

23:48.961 --> 23:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get by and honestly make a
living, and they
automatically assume the worst.

23:56.368 --> 24:00.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's a
conversation happening
far outside of Washington.

24:00.506 --> 24:04.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the economy slowly improves
in many places,
here in Wilkes County, at the
edge of the

24:04.643 --> 24:08.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Blue Ridge Mountains, by many
accounts, times
are getting tougher.

24:08.213 --> 24:14.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wilkes saw median income plunge
30 percent
since the year 2000 down to
$33,000 per household.

24:14.820 --> 24:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the second steepest drop
in wealth
in the nation.

24:18.724 --> 24:21.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Every day is Saturday
in these thriving
mountain towns.

24:21.894 --> 24:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This was
Wilkesboro, the
county seat, in 1948, then a
prosperous mountain

24:27.800 --> 24:33.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town with bustling shops, a
booming furniture
industry and thriving
agriculture.

24:33.806 --> 24:38.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now 23.4 percent of people
here live in
poverty.

24:38.877 --> 24:42.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's well above the national
rate of 14.5
percent.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does poverty mean?

24:44.316 --> 24:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An individual making just under
$12,000 a
year.

24:48.387 --> 24:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, the poultry industry is
one of the few
remaining large employers.

24:53.359 --> 24:58.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tyson Foods employs 2,600 people
across the
county.

Mark Trudell welcomed us to his
new home,
a trailer he and his wife, Peggy
(ph), just

25:03.035 --> 25:05.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moved into and are in the
process of fixing
up.

25:05.604 --> 25:10.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TRUDELL: We shop at the
thrift stores,
the habitat restore, and, if
it's broke, I

25:10.876 --> 25:12.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fix it.

25:12.678 --> 25:16.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mark works
stocking shelves
at a grocery store for minimum
wage, $7.25

25:16.348 --> 25:17.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
an hour.

25:17.483 --> 25:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As his kitchen shows, he is
highly organized.

25:20.386 --> 25:23.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he has other skills,
lighting and plumbing.

25:23.355 --> 25:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He helps his neighbors for free,
but he has
little security for himself.

25:27.059 --> 25:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TRUDELL: I have never ever,
ever in my
life drawn unemployment, even
though I was

25:31.997 --> 25:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
entitled to it, I paid into it.

25:35.067 --> 25:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Fifty-year-old
Darla Dietz
lives in a home she rents with
her husband,

25:39.538 --> 25:41.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Terry (ph).

25:41.306 --> 25:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Terry is 52 years old, but a
degenerative
brain disease is eroding his
mind now to the

25:48.447 --> 25:50.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
capacity of a 3-year-old.

25:50.182 --> 25:55.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That makes Darla his full-time
caregiver,
bathing him, making his meals,
constantly

25:55.154 --> 25:56.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
watching him.

25:56.555 --> 26:01.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARLA DIETZ: He doesn't know how
many children
we have, their ages.

26:01.059 --> 26:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very hard when you have a
history with
somebody for so long, and yet
you're the only

26:07.866 --> 26:09.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the memories.

26:09.501 --> 26:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The couple live
off Terry's
disability check, $1,234 a

DARLA DIETZ: I'm out of benefits
right now,
so, this week, it's go to a food
pantry.

26:20.546 --> 26:23.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's hope I sell a pair of
earrings.

26:23.382 --> 26:25.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's getting with my
daughter-in-law.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hey, what do you have?

26:26.318 --> 26:27.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you have?

26:27.719 --> 26:29.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And that's life.

26:29.521 --> 26:33.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The earrings
and jewelry
Darla sells sometimes determine
if she will

26:33.592 --> 26:38.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have gas for the car or diapers
for her husband.

26:38.530 --> 26:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Getting to our next stop was a
challenge up
a steep muddy clay road to
Darla's daughter-in-law's

26:44.203 --> 26:45.804 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

husband and three
children in her mother's
trailer.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLIE DIETZ: My husband just
started working
again.

26:50.809 --> 26:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My mom, of course, has Social
Security.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She's got COPD.

26:55.581 --> 26:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is her property, so,
luckily, we have
my mom.

26:59.284 --> 27:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been since, I think, last
year that he
was working.

27:04.089 --> 27:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's paycheck to paycheck.

27:06.258 --> 27:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are times when he
works, when he
doesn't work, because, like I
said, we get

27:11.530 --> 27:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
snowed in, rained in, it's a
hard place to
be at.

LISA DESJARDINS: In rural
America, lack of
transportation, health care
needs and feeling

27:20.138 --> 27:25.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ignored by politicians are all
reasons the
poor vote less and have less
power.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENE NICHOL, University of North
Carolina
at Chapel Hill: If we had a
bunch of low-income

27:26.912 --> 27:31.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans in this room, they
would say, why
bother to vote?

27:32.017 --> 27:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would say, with real
justice, neither
of these parties pays any
attention to the

27:37.556 --> 27:39.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
likes of me.

27:39.091 --> 27:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to bother with
politics because
politics doesn't do me any good.

27:41.627 --> 27:45.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Gene Nichol is
a law professor
and poverty expert at the
University of North

27:45.430 --> 27:47.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Carolina at Chapel Hill.

27:47.199 --> 27:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENE NICHOL: In the United
States, with the
system we have, it's a little
closer to $1

27:51.737 --> 27:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one vote than it is to one
person one vote.

27:54.540 --> 28:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, low-income people are
already disadvantaged
in that skewed system.

28:00.546 --> 28:05.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then low-income people
frequently have
that tradition of participating
less often,

28:05.751 --> 28:07.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
less vigorously.

28:07.519 --> 28:11.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The gap between
voters and
nonvoters breaks down strongly
along class

28:11.890 --> 28:13.659 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lines.

28:13.692 --> 28:20.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the 2012 presidential
election, 80.2 percent
of those making more than
$150,000 voted,

28:20.465 --> 28:27.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but only 46.9 percent of those
making less
than $10,000 voted.

28:27.172 --> 28:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We asked Darla, Leslie, and Mark
if they think
candidates are taking them into
consideration

28:32.744 --> 28:34.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this election year.

28:34.580 --> 28:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARLA DIETZ: I don't think they
realize that
there's this class of people who
are able-bodied.

28:41.119 --> 28:45.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What I would give for a
full-time job and
benefits.

28:45.791 --> 28:53.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We typically think of poverty to
be a demographic
that you normally associate with
downtown

28:53.565 --> 28:57.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
areas and -- but this is it too.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they don't see that.

28:59.404 --> 29:06.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE DIETZ: I hear one talking
about taking
care of our children, and I hear
one say giving

29:06.211 --> 29:08.080 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us jobs.

29:08.113 --> 29:10.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do I think they're really going
to do it?

29:10.082 --> 29:11.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

29:11.316 --> 29:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Do you think
they're talking
about you?

29:13.919 --> 29:15.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LESLIE DIETZ: No.

29:15.721 --> 29:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TRUDELL: I haven't heard
anything come
out of a politician's mouth that
would help

29:18.090 --> 29:20.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us in a very long time.

29:20.192 --> 29:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if they came down here
and saw how
people are actually living in
rural America,

29:27.399 --> 29:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then maybe they would change it.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maybe they would do something.

29:31.336 --> 29:35.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the infrastructure of the
country is falling
apart.

29:35.674 --> 29:41.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's mass amounts of
money that could
be put in redoing it and giving
people work

29:41.647 --> 29:42.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do it.

29:42.681 --> 29:43.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But they don't see it.

29:43.982 --> 29:46.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't -- they don't come
down here and
look at this.

29:46.118 --> 29:50.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Donald Trump
has made campaign
stops in rural parts of the
country, including

29:50.922 --> 29:54.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one in nearby Statesville, North
Carolina,
in August.

29:54.526 --> 29:59.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But unlike his rival, Hillary
Clinton, he
doesn't have a specific plan to
combat rural

29:59.831 --> 30:00.799 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poverty.

30:00.832 --> 30:05.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She does.

30:05.637 --> 30:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But neither candidate gives
poverty the attention
of earlier decades, like 1964,
when President

30:11.410 --> 30:18.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lyndon Johnson went on a poverty
tour before
launching his war on poverty, or
1968, when

30:18.850 --> 30:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then presidential candidate
Robert F. Kennedy
made his own two-day trip to
investigate poverty

30:23.989 --> 30:25.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Appalachia.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gene Nichol says Americans have
learned to
turn their eyes away from
poverty.

30:29.761 --> 30:33.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GENE NICHOL: We go about our
daily lives without
thinking about it.

30:33.498 --> 30:38.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Maybe there's economic
hardships, but it's
on the other side of town or the
other side

30:38.570 --> 30:42.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the county, or, here, the
other side of
state.

30:42.074 --> 30:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe the hardship is even so
pronounced,
that it gives the lie to our
claims of equal

30:48.714 --> 30:50.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dignity and opportunity.

30:50.215 --> 30:52.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we never see it.

30:52.117 --> 30:56.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mark Trudell
hasn't thought
of voting as an opportunity in a
long time.

30:56.955 --> 30:58.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But that has changed.

30:58.824 --> 31:03.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He just registered to vote, and
plans to cast
his first ballot since voting
for Ross Perot

31:03.595 --> 31:05.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1992.

31:05.797 --> 31:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Darla Dietz, she's going to try
to make it
to a polling place on Election
Day, if she

31:10.068 --> 31:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can get someone to take care of
her husband.

31:13.805 --> 31:18.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for Leslie Dietz, she says
politicians
offer her nothing, and she turns
to faith

31:18.844 --> 31:20.278 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
instead.

31:20.312 --> 31:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw her teaching Sunday
school, a lesson
about biblical leader Moses.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For her, it's a question of
morality.

31:25.984 --> 31:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE DIETZ: I kind of feel
strongly about
teaching them in Sunday school,
because I

31:30.122 --> 31:35.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can make sure that they know the
difference
between right and wrong, what's
moral, what's

31:35.527 --> 31:38.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ethical, you know?

31:38.063 --> 31:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really don't want to get
involved in
something that I think is
unethical.

31:43.168 --> 31:48.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, she has no
plans to vote
this November for either
candidate running

31:48.273 --> 31:49.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for president.

31:49.875 --> 31:53.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins
in Wilkes County, North
Carolina.

31:53.378 --> 31:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back to the
campaign.

31:56.114 --> 32:00.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Late today, Politico is
reporting the latest
shakeup in Donald Trump's
effort.

32:00.752 --> 32:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The national political director
is stepping
down, citing personal reasons.

32:14.566 --> 32:20.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The battle for Mosul is the most
important
of the two-year campaign against
ISIS in Iraq,

32:20.105 --> 32:24.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a defeat there would be a
crippling setback
for the extremists.

32:24.342 --> 32:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn now to a man with
detailed knowledge
of the city and its ethnic and
sectarian crosscurrents.

32:30.949 --> 32:36.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Retired General David Petraeus
was in charge
of the 101st Airborne Division
in Mosul in

32:36.688 --> 32:38.523 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2003.

32:38.557 --> 32:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went on to command the entire
multinational
force in Iraq and also served as
the top general

32:43.929 --> 32:45.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for U.S. Central Command.

32:45.730 --> 32:49.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also ran NATO and American
operations in
Afghanistan.

32:49.768 --> 32:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, from 2011 to 2012, he
served as director
of the CIA.

32:55.173 --> 32:56.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins me now from New York.

32:56.641 --> 32:58.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
General Petraeus, thank you for
being with
us.

32:58.443 --> 33:00.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

33:00.245 --> 33:00.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS (RET.), Former
Commander, U.S.
Central Command: Good to be with
you, Judy.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

33:02.581 --> 33:07.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, last night at
the debate,
Donald Trump again criticized
the Obama administration

33:07.919 --> 33:13.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for telegraphing ahead of time
the plan to
go into Mosul.

33:13.391 --> 33:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does Donald Trump have a point
about not letting
the enemy know what you're going
to do?

33:18.263 --> 33:19.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: What is going on
here is,
in a sense, a distinction
between so-called

33:23.668 --> 33:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strategic surprise, which is not
possible
when you're moving tens of
thousands of troops

33:28.773 --> 33:34.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and thousands of vehicles and
logistics and
everything else, and then
tactical surprise,

33:34.846 --> 33:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which I think probably was
achieved to some
degree when the Iraqi forces
launched the

33:40.819 --> 33:47.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
original operation several days
ago, and actually
has continued, as they have
opened new offensives,

33:47.425 --> 33:53.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you will, from the north and
the northeast,
in addition to those in the
initial day, which

33:53.198 --> 33:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
came from the south and from the
southeast
and east.

33:56.167 --> 34:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
the challenges
that the Iraqi military and its
allies, including

34:01.139 --> 34:03.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the U.S., face in Mosul?

34:03.241 --> 34:04.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know that area well.

34:04.542 --> 34:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, it's changed since the
takeover by
ISIS.

34:07.312 --> 34:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what do you think they're
confronting?

34:08.513 --> 34:10.315 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

34:10.348 --> 34:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: Well, first, of
course, they're
confronting what would be a
tough fight in

34:14.419 --> 34:20.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a city that's several times
larger than any
that they have cleared so far
over the course

34:20.058 --> 34:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the last two years, since we
helped them
reconstitute their forces,
reequip, and retrain

34:25.997 --> 34:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and remand them, and then as we
have enabled
them so impressively, frankly,
with this armada

34:33.004 --> 34:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of manned and unmanned aerial
vehicles, precision-strike
assets and intelligence fusion,
as well as

34:39.945 --> 34:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obviously advising and assisting
them.

34:43.315 --> 34:47.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they will encounter a tough,
tough city
fight.

34:47.118 --> 34:51.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Urban operations are inherently
difficult.

34:51.156 --> 34:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The enemy has been there for a
couple of years,
has dug tunnel systems, trenches
filled with

34:56.494 --> 34:59.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oil that they will torch to try
to obscure
our optics.

34:59.564 --> 35:01.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They will use snipers.

35:01.333 --> 35:05.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And every single house, every
single neighborhood
has to be cleared.

35:05.770 --> 35:09.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a population that
used to be,
in our day, when I was
privileged to command

35:09.841 --> 35:16.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 101st Airborne Division, in
Mosul and
Nineveh province, which Mosul
Islamist capital,

35:16.414 --> 35:17.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some two million people.

35:17.716 --> 35:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's down probably to about 1.2
million now.

35:20.752 --> 35:25.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of those will leave and go
to the refugees
centers that have been set up to
take care

35:25.123 --> 35:27.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of them during the course of the
battle.

35:27.325 --> 35:29.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But many will also stay.

35:29.127 --> 35:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some will be trapped and
kept there by
the Islamic State, used
essentially as human

35:33.631 --> 35:39.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
shields, announcement
complicating factor
for the Iraqi security forces,
the Kurdish

35:39.070 --> 35:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Peshmerga, and indeed for our
elements that
are supporting them in this
fight.

35:43.174 --> 35:49.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I do want to
ask you about
the challenges that the Iraqis
face even assuming

35:49.647 --> 35:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mosul is cleared of ISIS.

35:51.783 --> 35:57.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, are you confident
that they will
be able to get ISIS out of
Mosul?

35:57.222 --> 36:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And do you think it could take
as long as
a year, which the head of
Central Command

36:00.825 --> 36:01.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has said that it might?

36:01.826 --> 36:03.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: No, I think --
with respect,
I think he said it could take
months, I think.

36:06.031 --> 36:09.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Understandably, he's giving a
bit of the worst-case
analysis.

36:09.934 --> 36:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's already moving faster than
most predicted.

36:12.437 --> 36:16.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have said that, look, the
Islamic State
fighters that are left in Mosul,
maybe as

36:16.741 --> 36:21.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many as 5,000 or 6,000, they
realize that
they are dead men walking.

36:21.312 --> 36:25.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no question that the
Iraqi security
forces, with all of the enablers
that we're

36:25.850 --> 36:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
providing them, are going to
clear that city.

36:28.453 --> 36:30.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not in question.

36:30.255 --> 36:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only question is, how long
do the Islamic
State fighters really put up
resistance?

36:35.293 --> 36:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are reports already of
substantial numbers
of deserters, many of whom have
been executed,

36:41.099 --> 36:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and of leaders trying to leave
the city as
well.

36:43.468 --> 36:50.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, one of the big
questions that is
out there right now is, where is
Baghdadi,

36:50.075 --> 36:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the leader of the Islamic State?

36:51.910 --> 36:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is he trapped there with one of
his explosives
experts, or did he actually
escape to the

36:57.115 --> 37:00.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
west and try to get back across
the border
to Syria?

37:00.218 --> 37:04.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, again, no question that the
Iraqi security
forces will prevail.

37:04.622 --> 37:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bigger question is actually
the battle
after this.

37:08.460 --> 37:14.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have made clear in writing
a couple
of months ago, for example, that
the most

37:14.199 --> 37:19.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complex human terrain in all of
Iraq is to
be found in Mosul and the
province of which

37:19.771 --> 37:23.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is a capital, Nineveh,
biblical Nineveh.

37:23.441 --> 37:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are Sunni Arabs in the
majority, but
there are also pockets of Shia
Arabs.

37:27.178 --> 37:29.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are Turkmen, Sunni as well
as Shia.

37:29.380 --> 37:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are Kurds, and they come
from several
political parties that they're
not always

37:33.418 --> 37:35.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in agreement with each other.

37:35.253 --> 37:39.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are sizable numbers of
Christians that
were treated horribly under the
Islamic State

37:39.891 --> 37:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and want to get back to their
areas.

37:41.526 --> 37:42.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are Yazidis.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are Shabak.

37:44.295 --> 37:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of these want to get
back from whence
they came, and they want to play
a part in

37:49.033 --> 37:51.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
governance that follows.

37:51.903 --> 37:56.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And all will want to be
represented and want
that government to be responsive
to them and

37:56.441 --> 38:01.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guarantee their minority rights,
if they're
not the Sunni Arabs, in addition
to, of course,

38:01.946 --> 38:03.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Sunni Arab majority rule.

38:03.815 --> 38:06.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is going to be very, very
difficult.

38:06.618 --> 38:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did achieve it early on in
2003, when I
was privileged to command there.

38:11.256 --> 38:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we had 28,000 great American
soldiers.

38:13.691 --> 38:16.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We had 254 helicopters.

38:16.461 --> 38:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had the authority of being
an occupying
commander under the Geneva
Convention, and

38:21.332 --> 38:24.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
didn't hesitate, frankly, to use
that authority.

38:24.636 --> 38:28.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no equivalent power
there at this
point in time.

38:28.139 --> 38:34.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is going to take
intense politics,
intense negotiations and a lot
of individuals

38:34.746 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
undoubtedly demonstrating the
full range of
emotions along the way.

38:38.049 --> 38:42.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you
confident that
the current Iraqi government is
prepared to

38:42.287 --> 38:48.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do what's necessary to make sure
that Mosul
is stable going forward?

38:48.359 --> 38:49.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: I'm confident
that they will
do everything they possibly can.

38:52.230 --> 38:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The question is whether,
frankly, that is
going to be enough.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are going to be enormous
grievances.

38:57.869 --> 39:01.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There will be scores that some
want to settle.

39:01.906 --> 39:08.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even within the sectarian
groupings and ethnic
groupings, there will be
squabbles and disputes.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi
knows that
the government has to be
inclusive.

39:12.617 --> 39:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He knows that, for Iraq writ
large, the Sunni
Arabs have to be brought back
into the fabric

39:17.889 --> 39:20.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of society, as we were able to
do during the
surge.

39:20.925 --> 39:25.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the huge accomplishments,
which sadly
was undone some three-and-a-half
years after

39:25.463 --> 39:30.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the end of the surge by the
previous prime
minister, who took highly
sectarian actions

39:30.335 --> 39:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that inflamed that part of the
population,
allowed the Islamic State to get
back up off

39:35.373 --> 39:41.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its stomach, and indeed created
fertile fields
for the planting of the seeds of
extremism.

39:41.679 --> 39:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The people now have once again
been acquainted
with that form of extremism.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They want nothing of it.

39:48.253 --> 39:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people are actually reported
rising up
against the Islamic State in
some of the villages

39:52.523 --> 39:57.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outside Mosul, and undoubtedly
will do that
in some Mosul neighborhoods as
well.

39:57.462 --> 40:01.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
finally,
role for the U.S. in all of this
is?

40:01.466 --> 40:05.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it essential that the U.S.
have a role
here or not?

40:05.069 --> 40:06.304 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

40:06.337 --> 40:08.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: It is essential
that the U.S.
has a role.

40:08.339 --> 40:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can assure you that the
new ambassador
there, the new commander on the
ground, both

40:13.611 --> 40:20.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experienced Iraq hands, both
have multiple
tours there in past years, that
they are keenly

40:20.718 --> 40:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aware that they have to engage
in that, as
is the special presidential
enjoy, Brett McGurk,

40:26.190 --> 40:30.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has spent an enormous amount
of time in
Baghdad and Irbil up in the
Kurdish regional

40:30.528 --> 40:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government capital, trying to
help foster
all of this.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's the extent of what we
can do.

40:36.668 --> 40:40.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can encourage, we can nudge,
we can cajole.

40:40.505 --> 40:42.340 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We can't force.

40:42.373 --> 40:47.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is going to have to be
Iraqis at the
end of the day that come
together, recognizing

40:47.512 --> 40:51.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, if they cannot, fertile
fields will
be planted for the planting of
the seeds of

40:51.883 --> 40:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS 3.0, of further extremism
in Iraq.

40:55.653 --> 40:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: General David
Petraeus, we
thank you very much.

40:59.390 --> 41:00.458 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

41:00.491 --> 41:01.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: Great to be back
with you,
Judy.

41:01.993 --> 41:05.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

41:05.730 --> 41:17.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One subject
that's gotten less
attention in the national
election is climate

41:17.175 --> 41:22.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change, but there is a battle
over a carbon
tax ballot initiative in
Washington state

41:22.714 --> 41:23.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next month.

41:23.848 --> 41:27.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be the first tax of its
kind in the
country.

41:27.785 --> 41:32.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has the
story for his weekly series,
Making Sense.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN, Founder, Carbon
Washington:
You might be an economist if you
don't read

41:34.692 --> 41:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
human interest stories because
they don't
interest you.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.930 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:38.963 --> 41:44.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: At Seattle's Museum
of Flight
earlier this year, Climate
Night, headlining,

41:44.068 --> 41:49.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yoram Bauman, who claims, with a
straight
face, that he's the world's
first and only

41:49.640 --> 41:51.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
economic comic.

41:51.542 --> 41:53.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: You might be an
economist if
you have ever gone into a bank
or other financial

41:53.578 --> 41:56.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
institution in the hopes of
getting a date.

41:56.314 --> 41:58.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:58.116 --> 42:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: If you adamantly
refuse to sell
your children because you think
they will

42:01.085 --> 42:02.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be worth more later.

42:02.086 --> 42:03.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:03.888 --> 42:08.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But when we visited
Seattle in
April, Bauman had begun a dead
serious fight,

42:08.159 --> 42:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to combat climate change in his
home state
of Washington by imposing a tax
on carbon

42:13.731 --> 42:15.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
emissions.

42:15.366 --> 42:19.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He'd founded the grassroots
group Carbon Washington
to put the issue to voters.

42:19.337 --> 42:23.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Initiative 732, it's going
to be on the
November ballot.

42:23.141 --> 42:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I-732 works by charging
polluters with
a carbon fee, which lowers
pollution.

42:26.844 --> 42:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: And then the revenue that
is created
will go to reducing other taxes
in the state.

42:32.183 --> 42:38.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Making the carbon
tax, starting
at $25 per ton of CO2, about 25
cents per

42:38.589 --> 42:40.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gallon of gasoline,
revenue-neutral.

42:40.625 --> 42:46.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: The revenue from
the carbon
tax goes to cut existing taxes.

42:46.364 --> 42:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of it goes to cut the state
sales tax
by a full percentage point.

42:50.535 --> 42:55.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most households are going to pay
a few hundred
dollars a year more for fossil
fuels and a

42:55.273 --> 42:57.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
few hundred dollars a year less
for everything
else.

42:57.542 --> 43:01.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Everyone will pay
the carbon
tax, says Bauman.

43:01.345 --> 43:03.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everyone gets the sales tax cut.

43:03.614 --> 43:09.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But two groups get a bonus, the
first, working
families, who'd be hardest hit
by a rise in

43:09.420 --> 43:11.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
energy prices.

43:11.189 --> 43:15.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: It's going to
provide up to
$1,500 a year for 400,000
working families

43:15.426 --> 43:16.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Washington state.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Families like Jason
Puracal's.

43:18.262 --> 43:23.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON PURACAL, Washington: Yes,
I will pay
a little bit more in fossil fuel
use.

43:23.434 --> 43:27.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, the sales tax drop of 1
percent will
offset that.

43:27.705 --> 43:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I shouldn't see a change
in my spending
overall.

43:31.542 --> 43:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In addition,
businesses whose
higher energy costs would make
them uncompetitive

43:37.482 --> 43:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with rivals elsewhere will have
the state
business tax eliminated.

43:42.487 --> 43:47.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Still not enough for Ian
Tolleson, though,
who lobbies for food processors
in the Pacific

43:47.225 --> 43:49.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Northwest.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN TOLLESON, Northwest Food
Processors Association:
We heat things, we cut things,
we wash, and

43:51.496 --> 43:53.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is all for food safety.

43:53.164 --> 43:58.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that requires a lot of
energy, tax, tax,
tax all through the supply
chain.

43:58.302 --> 44:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what that does, our products
are now more
expensive on the shelf.

44:03.107 --> 44:07.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how can we compete with
those producers
that wouldn't have this tax?

44:07.912 --> 44:16.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We met up with
Tolleson at Seattle's
Pike Place Market, which
featured, among other

44:16.254 --> 44:20.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
attractions, the world's
presumably first
and only Hula-Hoop
guitar-on-chin-balancing

44:20.625 --> 44:21.993 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
busker.

44:22.026 --> 44:24.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Moreover, says Tolleson:

44:24.061 --> 44:28.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IAN TOLLESON: This is a global
phenomenon,
and it needs a global solution.

44:28.533 --> 44:32.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it fair to put it on the back
of Washington
employers and families?

44:33.004 --> 44:37.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But what really
struck us back
in the spring, when we started
covering this

44:37.508 --> 44:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story, was opposition to I-732
from people
who identify as
environmentalists, like union

44:45.049 --> 44:46.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president Jeff Johnson.

44:46.918 --> 44:49.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF JOHNSON, Union Leader:
During the winter,
we have been struck with
repeated floods and

44:49.520 --> 44:50.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mudslides.

44:50.621 --> 44:52.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the summer, we have droughts
and forest
fires.

44:52.757 --> 44:58.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our shellfish industry has left
the state
and gone to Hawaii because the
acid levels

44:58.362 --> 45:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the ocean has risen so much.

45:00.264 --> 45:05.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But doesn't that
mean that you
should embrace anything that
would help climate

45:05.136 --> 45:06.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
change and counteract it?

45:06.837 --> 45:07.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFF JOHNSON: No.

45:07.838 --> 45:09.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, it doesn't.

45:09.640 --> 45:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got an energy-intensive
company, Kaiser
Aluminum, out in Spokane,
eastern side of

45:13.344 --> 45:14.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our state.

45:14.712 --> 45:18.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the most efficient aluminum
rolling mill
in the world, right?

45:18.316 --> 45:23.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With just a carbon price, they
become less
competitive with aluminum makers
in other

45:23.921 --> 45:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parts of the states, in other
parts of the
world.

45:26.390 --> 45:32.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: OK, maybe a union
leader, however
green, has to worry, first and
forever, about

45:32.229 --> 45:36.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs, even if it means an
unusual alliance
with business.

45:36.667 --> 45:38.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But then we met Jill Mangaliman.

45:38.703 --> 45:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does that shirt say?

45:40.204 --> 45:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JILL MANGALIMAN, Got Green: Oh,
yes, so this
is where -- we're Got Green.

45:43.941 --> 45:48.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We are a community-based
organization in South
Seattle led by people of color.

45:48.913 --> 45:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But why would a
militant environmental
group oppose a carbon tax?

45:53.484 --> 45:58.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILL MANGALIMAN: Without any
kind of targeted
revenue, business can continue
as usual, and

45:58.556 --> 46:00.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's not what we want.

46:00.291 --> 46:06.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: More targeted
revenue than the
$1,500-a-year subsidy to her
constituents

46:06.063 --> 46:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and for local groups like Got
Green.

46:08.799 --> 46:14.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, it was also
surprising to find
out who was popping up in
support, right-wing

46:14.472 --> 46:16.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policy lobbyist Todd Myers, for
instance.

46:16.307 --> 46:19.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD MYERS, Policy Lobbyist:
Anything that
moves environmental policy away
from regulation,

46:19.877 --> 46:24.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which tends to be very expensive
and ineffective,
toward a personal incentive,
which is more

46:24.749 --> 46:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effective, is a good thing.

46:26.717 --> 46:31.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A good thing,
agrees Jason Puracal,
who happens to be an ardent
environmentalist.

46:31.822 --> 46:36.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON PURACAL: It's great to put
a price on
carbon and try to move us away
from fossil

46:36.761 --> 46:40.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fuels, but how do we do so in a
way that's
equitable for all?

46:40.097 --> 46:45.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that question
may be why,
in the six months since our
report aired,

46:45.036 --> 46:50.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polls have remained evenly
split, the pro
and con bedfellows as odd as
ever.

46:50.941 --> 46:57.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Indeed, the only major
environmental group
to back the initiative is the
Audubon Society.

46:57.748 --> 47:04.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among those who do not, the
national Sierra
Club, based in California, which
overruled

47:04.121 --> 47:12.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
local Washington state members
to declare
that the Sierra Club doesn't
support I-732.

47:12.063 --> 47:17.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aren't you at all concerned
that, if this
initiative fails, in part
because you folks

47:17.401 --> 47:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't support it, it will set
back the climate
change movement?

47:23.708 --> 47:25.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MICHAEL BRUNE, Executive
Director, Sierra
Club: No, not at all.

47:25.443 --> 47:29.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe that there's a better
way that
helps us get off fossil fuels,
but accelerates

47:29.246 --> 47:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a transition to clean energy.

47:31.048 --> 47:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That better way,
says executive
director Mike Brune, would
involve raising

47:35.486 --> 47:41.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more money than a
revenue-neutral tax, and
funneling it to clean energy
projects and

47:41.592 --> 47:43.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to those who'd suffer from
higher energy prices.

47:44.028 --> 47:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BRUNE: What we are
looking for is
a set of policies that will
simultaneously

47:49.967 --> 47:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put a price on carbon, so that
the economy
shifts towards good
family-sustaining jobs

47:55.773 --> 48:01.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the clean energy sector, and
is directing
funds towards low-income
communities, communities

48:01.212 --> 48:05.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of color, the communities that
have the highest
level of pollution in the state.

48:05.216 --> 48:10.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As for the lack of
new investment
money for clean energy, well,
that's just

48:10.287 --> 48:16.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why Greg Mankiw, former head of
George W.
Bush's Council of Economic
Advisers, finds

48:16.093 --> 48:18.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a revenue-neutral carbon tax so
appealing.

48:18.696 --> 48:20.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY MANKIW, Former Chairman,
Council of
Economic Advisers: The first
principle of

48:20.765 --> 48:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economics is that people respond
to incentives.

48:22.900 --> 48:28.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what a carbon tax tries to
do is tries
to harness that principle to get
people to

48:28.439 --> 48:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reduce their carbon footprint.

48:30.274 --> 48:36.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But there is a case
to be made,
isn't there, that we ought to
invest in clean

48:36.080 --> 48:40.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
energy, and here's a revenue
source we can
use to make those investments?

48:40.985 --> 48:44.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY MANKIW: If you give
people the right
incentives, then the private
sector will be

48:44.388 --> 48:45.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
smart enough to make the right
investments.

48:45.756 --> 48:49.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL BRUNE: Putting a price
on carbon can
be great policy.

48:49.593 --> 48:51.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's not all that's
needed.

48:51.095 --> 48:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to find a way to address
the constituencies
in a particular state.

48:54.765 --> 49:01.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: How do you respond
to the criticism
that you're essentially catering
to certain

49:01.639 --> 49:06.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
constituencies here, rather than
independently
analyzing?

49:06.911 --> 49:08.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BRUNE: That seems a
little silly.

49:08.879 --> 49:14.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's fair to say that
two of the biggest
challenges we face in this
country are climate

49:14.752 --> 49:18.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
change and economic inequality.

49:18.155 --> 49:23.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If we pit one of those
challenges against
the other, neither will be
successful.

49:23.394 --> 49:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But will anything
be successful,
asks Greg Mankiw, if we try to
address both

49:29.166 --> 49:31.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of those and more in one
package?

49:31.769 --> 49:36.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY MANKIW: People on the
left say they
want to combine a carbon tax
with all their

49:36.941 --> 49:38.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pro-spending agenda.

49:38.709 --> 49:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Someone on the far right could
say, gee, I
love a carbon tax, as long as we
use it to

49:41.111 --> 49:42.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reduce the estate tax.

49:42.880 --> 49:47.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I-732 tries to do is,
it tries to
frame the issue relatively
narrowly, so we

49:47.918 --> 49:51.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can all come together and reach
a consensus
on this, rather than bundling it
together

49:51.755 --> 49:56.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a lot of extraneous issues,
perhaps important
issues, but are extraneous to
the issue of

49:56.260 --> 49:58.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
putting a price on carbon.

49:58.128 --> 50:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Last word goes to
Yoram Bauman,
the world's foremost stand-up
economist, and,

50:02.700 --> 50:05.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given his long environmental
track record,
perhaps its greenest.

50:05.803 --> 50:09.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: One of the things
that I love
about this policy is that it
does have potential

50:10.007 --> 50:11.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for bipartisan support.

50:11.876 --> 50:13.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not big government.

50:13.310 --> 50:14.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not smaller government.

50:14.812 --> 50:17.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just, how do we make the
tax system fairer
and more sustainable?

50:18.015 --> 50:21.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a powerful message that
hopefully we
can take around the country.

50:21.452 --> 50:26.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: How the voters of
Washington
state respond to the message
will be known

50:26.357 --> 50:27.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on November 8.

50:27.725 --> 50:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is "NewsHour" economics
correspondent
Paul Solman.

50:35.399 --> 50:44.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to another
in our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask interesting

50:44.108 --> 50:46.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people to share their passions.

50:46.076 --> 50:50.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, casting director David
Rubin, who's
more than a hundred film
credits.

50:50.180 --> 50:54.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID RUBIN, Casting Director:
The most important
thing for an actor to bring to
the table is

50:54.418 --> 50:56.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
themselves, their own
idiosyncrasy.

50:56.220 --> 51:01.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so many actors get
preoccupied with what
they think the filmmaker is
looking for.

51:01.392 --> 51:05.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, frankly, what we're looking
for is them.

51:05.829 --> 51:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of my first jobs was working
on the production
staff of "Saturday Night Live."

51:12.970 --> 51:15.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I was a lowly production
assistant.

51:15.673 --> 51:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the last two seasons of
the original
cast, John Belushi, and Dan
Aykroyd, Gilda

51:20.978 --> 51:22.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Radner, Jane Curtin.

51:22.179 --> 51:25.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was insane.

51:25.049 --> 51:27.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During my last season, it was
actually announced
that the show would not
continue.

51:28.018 --> 51:29.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we all kind of scrambled for
work.

51:29.586 --> 51:32.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I happened to meet the head
of casting
at NBC.

51:32.156 --> 51:33.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She was looking for an
assistant.

51:33.357 --> 51:34.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She hired me.

51:34.458 --> 51:36.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was kismet.

51:36.226 --> 51:39.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I first read a screenplay,
there are
sometimes very specific
descriptions of the

51:39.330 --> 51:41.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
characters.

51:41.298 --> 51:46.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the first thing that I do is
forget those
descriptions, because writers
write very specifically,

51:46.136 --> 51:50.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not for the casting director or
not for the
director, but for the studio
executive or

51:50.341 --> 51:52.176 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the financier.

51:52.209 --> 51:57.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you read in a script
"doctor 40s," the
temptation on the part of the
filmmaker might

51:57.781 --> 52:01.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be just to assume that it was a
white male
in their 40s or 50s.

52:01.952 --> 52:06.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why couldn't it be an Asian
person in their
30s?

52:06.390 --> 52:08.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why couldn't it be a little
person?

52:08.559 --> 52:10.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why couldn't it be a Latino?

52:10.327 --> 52:14.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Gender diversity, racial
diversity, all of
those things come into play in a
conversation

52:14.565 --> 52:18.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a filmmaker when you are
bringing in
different approaches to a
particular character.

52:18.802 --> 52:23.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are several pioneers in
casting that
opened the doors to the process
in general.

52:23.741 --> 52:27.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this really happened after
the demise
of the studio system, when
studios no longer

52:27.945 --> 52:29.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had actors under contract.

52:29.513 --> 52:32.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They needed people who were
going to direct
the casting process.

52:32.950 --> 52:37.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lynn Stalmaster was the first
independent
casting director in motion
pictures, who cast

52:37.621 --> 52:40.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
films like "West Side Story" and
"The Graduate."

52:40.624 --> 52:46.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had searched far and wide
before Dustin
Hoffman, from relative
obscurity, got that

52:46.296 --> 52:47.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
role.

52:47.731 --> 52:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marion Dougherty in New York was
doing the
same groundbreaking work.

52:50.801 --> 52:54.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was about casting people for
their idiosyncrasy.

52:54.104 --> 52:56.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The thing that keeps this job
fresh is the
variety.

52:56.974 --> 52:59.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have cast over a hundred
motion pictures.

52:59.243 --> 53:01.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I look at my resume, I get
a little tired.

53:01.678 --> 53:05.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just like an actor doesn't want
to be typecast,
I don't want to be typecast in
casting.

53:05.115 --> 53:10.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, on the wall of my office,
there's a poster
of "The English Patient" very
near a poster

53:10.954 --> 53:13.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of "Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from
Guantanamo
Bay."

53:13.057 --> 53:18.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some times when an
actor comes in,
and they give what they think is
a botched

53:18.695 --> 53:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
audition, they go off on their
lines, something
goes wrong in the scene.

53:22.399 --> 53:28.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And often those are the most
illuminating
additions to me, those kind of
organic moments

53:28.572 --> 53:32.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where an actor connects with a
character,
even though they may not even
realize that

53:32.743 --> 53:34.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they are doing it.

53:34.278 --> 53:39.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is David Rubin, and this
is my Brief
But Spectacular take on casting.

53:39.583 --> 53:42.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that's the
"NewsHour"
for tonight.

53:42.086 --> 53:43.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:43.087 --> 53:44.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We missed our
calling.

53:44.088 --> 53:45.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

53:45.089 --> 53:46.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:46.790 --> 53:49.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening
with Mark Shields and David
Brooks.

53:49.093 --> 54:01.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
