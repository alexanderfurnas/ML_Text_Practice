THE COMPLICATIONS?

06:38.965 --> 06:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE

06:41.167 --> 06:42.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLICATION IS THAT THEY

06:42.002 --> 06:44.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVEN'T DECIDED ON A MECHANISM

06:44.037 --> 06:48.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MINISTERS INVOLVED IN THE CRISIS

06:54.347 --> 06:55.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T COME UP

06:55.615 --> 06:57.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH A WAY TO SEND THE MIGRANTS

06:57.617 --> 06:58.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK.

06:58.385 --> 06:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT GREECE HAS PROPOSED THEY

06:59.986 --> 07:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USE PRIVATELY CHARTED BOATS THAT

07:01.621 --> 07:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE ESCORTED, BUT

07:03.790 --> 07:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPARENTLY ALL SIDES STILL HAVE

07:04.724 --> 07:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO AGREE ON THE METHOD.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: AS FOR MIGRANTS

07:07.494 --> 07:09.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND REFUGEES THAT ARE TALE IN

07:09.529 --> 07:12.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREECE RIGHT NOW, ARE CONDITIONS

07:12.132 --> 07:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TENSE ON THE GROUND WITH THIS

07:13.166 --> 07:13.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEWS?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THEY AWARE OF WHAT IS

07:15.935 --> 07:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING?

07:16.636 --> 07:19.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MOST PEOPLE ARE AWARE.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMOTIONS, TO BE FAIR, ARE MIXED

07:22.175 --> 07:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY

07:23.109 --> 07:24.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISAPPOINTED THAT THEY WON'T BE

07:24.110 --> 07:26.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABLE TO TRAVEL TO EUROPE

07:26.746 --> 07:27.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMEDIATELY.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT THEY WILL BE STUCK HERE

07:28.882 --> 07:31.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR MORE THAN A YEAR PERHAPS.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS ALSO

07:34.821 --> 07:36.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELIEF THAT THEY WON'T BE SENT

07:36.556 --> 07:36.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE PEOPLE ALREADY IN GREECE

07:38.358 --> 07:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL NOT BE DEPORTED, HAVING

07:39.626 --> 07:41.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID THAT THERE WAS THE

07:41.528 --> 07:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMONSTRATION JUST FINISHED IN

07:43.229 --> 07:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATHENS AND SEVERAL, ATHENS

07:46.933 --> 07:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WERE PROTESTING THE E.U.

07:48.668 --> 07:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEALING.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: THAT IS

07:50.937 --> 07:52.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING, I WAS ASKING ABOUT

07:52.138 --> 07:53.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREECE CITIZENS.

07:53.139 --> 07:54.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THIS SEEN AS A POSITIVE OR

07:54.574 --> 07:55.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGATIVE GIVEN GREECE OWN

07:55.842 --> 07:56.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINANCIAL ISSUES?

07:56.343 --> 07:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IT IS NOT SOMETHING

07:58.978 --> 08:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAS HAPPENED OVERNIGHT, SO

08:00.847 --> 08:02.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN USED TO THE

08:02.282 --> 08:03.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THERE IS A REFUGEE CRISIS

08:03.717 --> 08:05.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SEEING PEOPLE FROM SYRIA IN

08:05.919 --> 08:08.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STREETS IN MOST CITIES IN

08:08.154 --> 08:10.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREECE, SO IT IS HOT A NEW

08:10.657 --> 08:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHENOMENON.

08:11.057 --> 08:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE OTHER HAND, FOR SURE IT

08:12.325 --> 08:15.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A STRAIN ON THE ECONOMY, SO

08:15.362 --> 08:16.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAIN, IT IS A MIXED PICTURE,

08:16.796 --> 08:19.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD WILL

08:19.099 --> 08:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO ACCEPT REFUGEES IN THE WORLD,

09:21.761 --> 09:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY HAVE MORE THAN THE
