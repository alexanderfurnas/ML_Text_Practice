GROUND GAME IS NEEDED, BUT WITH

00:18.619 --> 00:20.721
WHAT TROOPS AND WHEN?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.389
UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN AGAIN BUT

00:22.389 --> 00:23.824
LARGELY BECAUSE EVEN MORE PEOPLE

00:23.824 --> 00:24.791

IN A MAJOR REVERSAL, WHITE HOUSE

00:48.382 --> 00:49.516
OFFICIALS SAID TODAY PRESIDENT

00:49.516 --> 00:51.818
OBAMA WILL DELAY ANY EXECUTIVE

00:51.818 --> 00:53.220
ACTION TO RESHAPE THE NATION’S

00:53.220 --> 00:55.122
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM UNTIL AFTER

01:01.295 --> 01:02.829
SAYING HE WILL DO SO BEFORE THE

01:02.829 --> 01:03.931
END OF THE YEAR.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.232
THE DECISION TO DELAY THE

01:05.232 --> 01:07.301
PROCESS IS SEEN AS AN EFFORT TO

01:07.301 --> 01:08.969
HELP DEMOCRATS IN DIFFICULT

01:08.969 --> 01:10.804
REELECTION RACES.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.439
NEARLY 20% OF WOMEN IN THE

UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN RAPED

01:13.607 --> 01:15.776

01:19.680 --> 01:21.014
RELEASED YESTERDAY BY THE

01:23.116 --> 01:24.217
THE FINDINGS WERE BASED ON A

01:24.217 --> 01:25.852
SURVEY OF 12,000 PEOPLE

01:25.852 --> 01:27.120
CONDUCTED ON BOTH CELL PHONES

01:27.120 --> 01:27.988
AND LANDLINES.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.189
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

01:29.189 --> 01:30.390
VIOLENCE IS REPORTEDLY

01:30.390 --> 01:32.793
PERPETRATED BY PAST PARTNERS OR

01:34.127 --> 01:35.929
A SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE, LED BY

01:48.942 --> 01:50.777

GROUPS.

01:51.478 --> 01:52.713
A DISSENTING REPORT BY

01:52.713 --> 01:55.382
REPUBLICANS SAID 83% OF THE

01:55.382 --> 01:56.583
TARGETED GROUPS WERE

01:56.583 --> 01:58.318
CONSERVATIVE-LEANING.

01:58.318 --> 01:59.653
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

01:59.653 --> 02:00.787
THROUGHOUT PARTS OF THE UPPER

02:00.787 --> 02:02.189
MIDWEST ARE STILL WITHOUT POWER

02:02.189 --> 02:03.557
FOLLOWING SEVERE STORMS

02:03.557 --> 02:05.092
YESTERDAY AND OVERNIGHT.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.127
IN THE CHICAGO AREA, 70-MILE-AN-

02:07.127 --> 02:08.662
HOUR WINDS RIPPED ROOFS OFF

02:08.662 --> 02:10.497
BUILDINGS, BROUGHT DOWN TREES

02:10.497 --> 02:12.032

02:12.032 --> 02:13.800
HIGHWAY OVERPASS.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.969
ABOUT 100,000 CUSTOMERS LOST

02:15.969 --> 02:17.104
POWER THERE.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.939
ANOTHER 400,000 MICHIGAN

02:18.939 --> 02:20.440
RESIDENTS LOST POWER AFTER THE

02:20.440 --> 02:21.675
STORM MOVED THERE.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.378
AT LEAST ONE PERSON WAS KILLED.

02:24.378 --> 02:25.679
TURNING OVERSEAS, LIFE APPEARED

02:25.679 --> 02:26.980
TO BE RETURNING TO NORMAL TODAY

02:26.980 --> 02:28.382
IN MUCH OF EASTERN UKRAINE

02:28.382 --> 02:29.349
FOLLOWING YESTERDAY’S

02:29.349 --> 02:31.118
ANNOUNCEMENT OF A CEASE-FIRE.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.486
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT TROOPS HAD

02:32.486 --> 02:34.154
BATTLED PRO-RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS

02:34.154 --> 02:35.555
IN THE AREA NEAR RUSSIA FOR

02:35.555 --> 02:36.690
SEVERAL MONTHS.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.991
RECENTLY, NATO SAID RUSSIAN

02:37.991 --> 02:39.359
FORCES CROSSED THE BORDER INTO

02:39.359 --> 02:40.961
UKRAINE AND PUSHED BACK

02:40.961 --> 02:42.696
UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT FORCES.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.897
RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN

02:43.897 --> 02:45.165
CONFERRED BY PHONE TODAY WITH

02:45.165 --> 02:46.600
UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT PETRO

02:46.600 --> 02:47.667
POROSHENKO.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.202
POROSHENKO SAID LATER THE TWO

02:49.202 --> 02:50.470
DISCUSSED WAYS TO MAKE THE

02:50.470 --> 02:52.072
CEASE-FIRE MORE STABLE.

02:52.072 --> 02:53.106
THE TWO SIDES ARE ALSO

02:53.106 --> 02:54.741
EXCHANGING PRISONERS.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.576
IN WEST AFRICA, OFFICIALS IN

02:56.576 --> 02:57.778
SIERRA LEONE SAY THEY WILL

02:57.778 --> 03:00.080
IMPOSE A THREE-DAY NATIONWIDE

03:00.080 --> 03:02.482
LOCKDOWN LATER THIS MONTH TO TRY

03:02.482 --> 03:04.451
AND STOP THE SPREAD OF THE EBOLA

03:04.451 --> 03:05.285
VIRUS.

03:05.285 --> 03:06.153
PEOPLE IN THE NATION OF SIX

03:06.153 --> 03:08.121
MILLION WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO

03:08.121 --> 03:09.523
LEAVE THEIR HOMES.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.657
HEALTH WORKERS HOPE THE MOVE

03:10.657 --> 03:12.659
WILL HELP THEM TO IDENTIFY AND

03:12.659 --> 03:15.762
ISOLATE NEW EBOLA VIRUS CASES.

03:15.762 --> 03:17.597
MORE THAN 2,100 PEOPLE IN FOUR

03:17.597 --> 03:19.499
WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAVE DIED

03:19.499 --> 03:21.802
DURING THIS EBOLA OUTBREAK.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.537
AND SYRIAN GOVERNMENT WARPLANES

03:23.537 --> 03:24.838
TODAY ATTACKED ISLAMIC STATE

03:24.838 --> 03:26.173
FIGHTERS IN THE NORTH OF THAT

03:26.173 --> 03:27.841
COUNTRY NEAR TURKEY.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.010
AT LEAST 25 PEOPLE REPORTEDLY

03:30.010 --> 03:31.078
WERE KILLED, MANY OF THEM

03:31.078 --> 03:32.946
CIVILIANS WHO DIED WHEN A

03:32.946 --> 03:34.981
MISSILE HIT A BAKERY CROWDED

03:34.981 --> 03:36.149
WITH SHOPPERS.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.751
YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA SPOKE

03:37.751 --> 03:39.719
ABOUT THE NEED TO BOLSTER IRAQI

03:39.719 --> 03:41.488
MILITARY FORCES TO FIGHT THE

03:41.488 --> 03:43.657
ISLAMIC STATE.

03:43.657 --> 03:44.624
>> WE CAN SUPPORT THEM FROM THE

03:44.624 --> 03:46.259
AIR, BUT ULTIMATELY WE’RE GOING

03:46.259 --> 03:49.463
TO NEED A STRONG GROUND GAME.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.030
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE ABOUT

03:50.030 --> 03:51.198
EFFORTS TO DEFEAT THE ISLAMIC

03:51.198 --> 03:52.365
STATE, WE ARE JOINED NOW FROM

03:52.365 --> 03:53.867
WASHINGTON BY ANTHONY CORDESMAN.

03:53.867 --> 03:54.768
HE IS WITH THE CENTER FOR

03:54.768 --> 03:55.936
STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL

03:55.936 --> 03:57.537
STUDIES AND WAS THE DIRECTOR OF

03:57.537 --> 03:59.072
INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT IN THE

03:59.072 --> 04:00.707
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF

04:00.707 --> 04:01.274
DEFENSE.

04:01.274 --> 04:02.843
MR. CORDESMAN, THE PRESIDENT OF

04:02.843 --> 04:03.944
THE UNITED STATES HAS SAID THAT

04:03.944 --> 04:05.879
WE NEED A GROUND GAME, A

04:05.879 --> 04:07.347
RESPONSE; A PARTIAL RESPONSE

04:07.347 --> 04:08.915
FROM THE REGION MIGHT BE "YOU

04:08.915 --> 04:09.483
AND WHAT ARMY?"

04:09.483 --> 04:11.151
SO WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD

04:11.151 --> 04:12.953
ACTUALLY BE ON THE GROUND AND

04:12.953 --> 04:15.722
HELP TACKLE ISIS?

04:15.722 --> 04:17.357
>> THE IRAQI FORCES ARE

04:17.357 --> 04:18.892
RELATIVELY LARGE, COMPARED TO

04:18.892 --> 04:21.294
ANY ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE ISLAMIC

04:21.294 --> 04:24.097
STATE’S FORCES ARE.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.633
IF YOU PROVIDE THE CAPABILITY

04:26.633 --> 04:28.735
AND TRAINING TO MAKE THOSE IRAQI

04:28.735 --> 04:31.271
FORCES MORE EFFECTIVE, IF YOU

04:31.271 --> 04:33.340
GIVE THE KURDISH PESHMERGA

04:33.340 --> 04:35.876
BETTER ARMS, YOU REALLY HAVE A

04:35.876 --> 04:37.644
FORCE ON THE GROUND THAT IS

04:37.644 --> 04:40.147
SIGNIFICANTLY SUPERIOR TO WHAT

04:40.147 --> 04:42.582
THE ISLAMIC STATE HAS.

04:42.582 --> 04:44.618
IF YOU THROW INTO THAT U.S.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.920
AIRPOWER, AND THAT OF SOME OTHER

04:46.920 --> 04:48.889
COUNTRIES, APPLIED NOT ONLY IN

04:48.889 --> 04:51.992
IRAQ BUT IN SYRIA, YOU HAVE A

04:51.992 --> 04:56.062
DECISIVE AMOUNT OF FIREPOWER.

04:56.062 --> 04:57.964
AND IF YOU ADD TO THIS THE

04:57.964 --> 05:00.467
ABILITY TO SEAL OFF THE ISLAMIC

05:00.467 --> 05:03.236
STATE ON THE BORDERS OF THE

05:03.236 --> 05:05.739
AREAS IT OCCUPIES, TO CUT OFF

05:05.739 --> 05:07.841
ITS ECONOMIC STRUCTURE AND

05:07.841 --> 05:10.944
REDUCE ITS FLOW OF VOLUNTEERS,

05:10.944 --> 05:12.445
IN COMBINATION, THAT’S A LOT OF

05:12.445 --> 05:13.647
LEVERAGE.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.949
IT’S ALSO A LOT OF "IFS."

05:15.949 --> 05:17.450
BUT THE PROBLEM IS NOT SO MUCH

05:17.450 --> 05:19.653
THE GROUND GAME.

05:19.653 --> 05:20.954
THE PROBLEM IS TO CREATE A

05:20.954 --> 05:23.223
STRUCTURE IN IRAQ WHERE THE

05:23.223 --> 05:25.492
SUNNIS AND KURDS CAN COOPERATE

05:25.492 --> 05:27.661
WITH THE SHIITE FORCES, WHERE

05:27.661 --> 05:31.331
YOU CAN REBUILD THE IRAQI FORCES

05:31.331 --> 05:33.400
WITHOUT HAVING THEM TAKE SIDES

05:33.400 --> 05:35.368
IN AN ETHNIC OR SECTARIAN CIVIL

05:35.368 --> 05:36.336
WAR.

05:36.336 --> 05:36.903
>> Sreenivasan: ARE WE

05:36.903 --> 05:38.071
CONFIDENT THAT THE IRAQI

05:38.071 --> 05:40.340
SECURITY FORCES CAN BE TRAINED

05:40.340 --> 05:41.608
UP AND NOT WALK OFF THE

05:41.608 --> 05:42.809
BATTLEFIELD LIKE THEY HAVE IN

05:42.809 --> 05:45.312
PREVIOUS OCCASIONS?

05:45.312 --> 05:46.613
>> WELL, WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.615
THEY DIDN’T EXACTLY WALK OFF THE

05:48.615 --> 05:49.649
BATTLEFIELD.

05:49.649 --> 05:51.218
THEY FLED.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.086
PART OF IT WAS THEIR LEADERSHIP

05:53.086 --> 05:55.488
IS LEADERSHIP MALIKI CHOSE ON

05:55.488 --> 05:58.925
THE BASIS OF LOYALTY BY SECT AND

05:58.925 --> 06:01.795
USED IN WAYS WHICH ABUSED THE

06:01.795 --> 06:03.330
LOCAL POPULATION.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.564
ARE WE CONFIDENT WE CAN CHANGE

06:04.564 --> 06:05.031
THAT?

06:05.031 --> 06:05.832
NO, WE’RE NOT.

06:05.832 --> 06:07.133
NOBODY CAN BE.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.069
THIS IS UP TO THE IRAQIS AND THE

06:09.069 --> 06:10.870
IRAQI GOVERNMENT.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.205
BUT SO FAR, THERE’S BEEN ENOUGH

06:12.205 --> 06:15.242
PROGRESS TO AT LEAST OFFER HOPE.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.644
AND WE HAVE SEEN COOPERATION

06:17.644 --> 06:20.780
BETWEEN THE KURDISH FORCES AND

06:20.780 --> 06:23.450
THE SHIITE FORCES, AS WELL AS

06:23.450 --> 06:25.685
THE IRAQI FORCES.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.887
WE HAVE SEEN U.S. ADVISERS HELP

06:27.887 --> 06:30.557
THE IRAQI FORCES AT LEAST TRY TO

06:30.557 --> 06:32.692
TAKE BACK TERRITORY IN AREAS

06:32.692 --> 06:34.127
LIKE TIKRIT.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.528
SO THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE

06:35.528 --> 06:36.796
SIGNS.

06:36.796 --> 06:38.064
THERE ARE CERTAINLY NO

06:38.064 --> 06:39.866
GUARANTEES.

06:39.866 --> 06:40.634
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE ANY

06:40.634 --> 06:42.302
AMOUNT OF RELIGIOUS PRESSURE

06:42.302 --> 06:43.403
THAT THE LEADERSHIP IN THE

06:43.403 --> 06:45.238
REGION CAN BRING TO BEAR ON

06:45.238 --> 06:46.172
ISIS?

06:46.172 --> 06:47.140
>> WELL, THAT’S A CRITICAL

06:47.140 --> 06:47.807
QUESTION.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.443
THE ANSWER IS NOT PRESSURE, BUT

06:50.443 --> 06:53.113
THE PROBLEM IS WE IN THE WEST,

06:53.113 --> 06:54.147
WHETHER IT’S IN THE THE UNITED

06:54.147 --> 06:56.349
STATES OR ITS EUROPEAN ALLIES,

06:56.349 --> 06:57.784
CAN NEVER MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT

06:57.784 --> 07:00.987
WE’RE EITHER AN ISLAMIC STATE OR

07:00.987 --> 07:02.722
THAT WE’RE ARABS.

07:02.722 --> 07:05.692
SAUDI ARABIA, THE UNITED ARAB

07:05.692 --> 07:08.428
EMIRATES, JORDAN CAN.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.730
TURKEY CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT, AND

07:10.730 --> 07:13.099
IT CAN JOIN IN THIS.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.235
SO ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES IS TO

07:15.235 --> 07:17.537
HAVE THE CLERICS IN THE STATES

07:17.537 --> 07:19.172
THAT ARE AROUND THE ISLAMIC

07:19.172 --> 07:21.508
STATE, TO HAVE THEM MAKE THE

07:21.508 --> 07:24.911
CASE AS TO JUST HOW EXTREME THE

07:24.911 --> 07:26.579
ISLAMIC STATE IS, HOW MUCH IT

07:26.579 --> 07:28.515
HAS DEPARTED FROM THE REAL

07:28.515 --> 07:30.317
VALUES OF ISLAM.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.385
THE IDEOLOGICAL DIMENSION HERE

07:32.385 --> 07:35.622
IS AS CRITICAL AS THE MILITARY

07:35.622 --> 07:38.124
OR THE POLITICAL OR THE ECONOMIC

07:38.124 --> 07:39.059
DIMENSION.

07:39.059 --> 07:39.426
>> Sreenivasan: WOULD ANY OF

07:39.426 --> 07:40.760
THOSE COUNTRIES IN THE

07:40.760 --> 07:42.362
NEIGHBORHOODS SEND IN GROUND

07:42.362 --> 07:43.129
TROOPS?

07:43.129 --> 07:44.364
>> I THINK THE ANSWER IS, IT

07:44.364 --> 07:46.099
WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.268
IT’S NOT CLEAR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

07:48.268 --> 07:51.304
IF YOU SENT IN SAUDI OR

07:51.304 --> 07:53.273
JORDANIAN FORCES.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.342
AND CERTAINLY, TURKISH FORCES

07:55.342 --> 07:57.777
WOULD NOT BE AN ELEMENT THAT

07:57.777 --> 07:59.045
WOULD REALLY CONTRIBUTE TO

07:59.045 --> 08:00.980
STABILITY.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.248
THE PROBLEM IN IRAQ,

08:02.248 --> 08:05.385
ESSENTIALLY, IS YOU NEED TO HAVE

08:05.385 --> 08:08.355
IRAQIS ON THE GROUND.

08:08.355 --> 08:11.524
THEY DON’T HAVE TO BE SUNNI, BUT

08:11.524 --> 08:13.059
THEY TO BE PART OF A GOVERNMENT

08:13.059 --> 08:14.961
THAT SUNNIS CAN TRUST, AND THE

08:14.961 --> 08:17.530
SAME IS TRUE OF THE KURDS.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.399
AND WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO SYRIA,

08:19.399 --> 08:22.602
THE FACT IS, WALKING IN TO THAT

08:22.602 --> 08:25.305
PARTICULAR MESS, WE’RE NOT

08:25.305 --> 08:27.374
SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT THE ISLAMIC

08:27.374 --> 08:28.975
STATE, OR AL-NUSRA, OR THE

08:28.975 --> 08:30.443
SO-CALLED MODERATE REBELS, BUT

08:30.443 --> 08:32.779
YOU HAVE MORE THAN 70

08:32.779 --> 08:34.814
FRAGMENTED ELEMENTS IS NOT

08:34.814 --> 08:36.850
SOMETHING THAT CAN EASILY BE

08:36.850 --> 08:39.285
DONE FROM THE OUTSIDE.

08:39.285 --> 08:40.820
IT’S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE

08:40.820 --> 08:42.856
UNITED STATES TO SEND IN GROUND

08:42.856 --> 08:43.890
TROOPS.

08:43.890 --> 08:44.290
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

08:44.290 --> 08:45.325
ARTHONY CORDESMAN JOINING US

08:45.325 --> 08:47.761
FROM WASHINGTON, THANKS SO MUCH.

08:47.761 --> 08:48.628
>> THANK YOU.

08:56.770 --> 08:57.337
>> Sreenivasan: WE WANTED TO

08:57.337 --> 08:58.671
FOLLOW UP TONIGHT ON YESTERDAY’S

08:58.671 --> 08:59.806
UNEMPLOYMENT REPORT.

08:59.806 --> 09:00.774
THE GOVERNMENT REPORTED THAT

09:00.774 --> 09:03.076
142,000 JOBS WERE CREATED LAST

09:03.076 --> 09:04.444
MONTH, WELL BELOW MOST

09:04.444 --> 09:05.612
EXPECTATIONS.

09:05.612 --> 09:06.946
EVEN SO, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

09:06.946 --> 09:11.017
DROPPED FROM 6.2% TO 6.1%, IN

09:11.017 --> 09:12.218
LARGE PART BECAUSE WHAT’S KNOWN

09:12.218 --> 09:14.487
AS THE PARTICIPATION RATE FELL.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.321
IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN MORE

09:15.321 --> 09:17.090
AMERICANS DROPPED OUT OF THE

09:17.090 --> 09:17.957
WORKFORCE.

09:17.957 --> 09:18.792
FOR MORE ABOUT ALL THIS, WE ARE

09:18.792 --> 09:19.859
JOINED FROM WASHINGTON BY

09:19.859 --> 09:21.094
SUDEEP REDDY, AN ECONOMICS

09:21.094 --> 09:21.995
EDITOR AT THE "WALL STREET

09:21.995 --> 09:22.328
JOURNAL."

09:22.328 --> 09:23.229
SO, ONE OF THE ARTICLES IN THE

09:23.229 --> 09:24.931
"JOURNAL" SAID 60,000 PEOPLE

09:24.931 --> 09:26.065
DROPPED OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE

09:26.065 --> 09:26.900
LAST MONTH.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.068
PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR US.

09:29.068 --> 09:29.335
>> THAT’S RIGHT.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.937
WE’VE SEEN OVER THE COURSE OF

09:30.937 --> 09:32.372
THE RECOVERY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

09:32.372 --> 09:34.407
JUST GIVING UP HOPE, DROPPING

09:34.407 --> 09:35.008
OUT.

09:35.008 --> 09:35.909
THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE

09:35.909 --> 09:37.977
APPEAR TO BE DROPPING OUT, JUST

09:37.977 --> 09:40.146
BECAUSE THEY CAN’T FIND GOOD

09:40.146 --> 09:41.548
JOBS AND IT’S NOT WORTH STAYING

09:41.548 --> 09:42.148
IN.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.451
SO TO SEE THAT MANY PEOPLE PULL

09:44.451 --> 09:45.819
OUT, RIGHT NOW, THE LABOR FORCE

09:45.819 --> 09:47.086
PARTICIPATION RATE IS AROUND

09:47.086 --> 09:48.254
63%.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.756
THAT MEANS THERE ARE MILLIONS OF

09:49.756 --> 09:51.391
PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE LABOR

09:51.391 --> 09:53.293
FORCE BEFORE, BEFORE THE

09:53.293 --> 09:55.562
RECESSION STARTED IN 2007, WHO

09:55.562 --> 09:57.330
AREN’T COMING BACK IN, EVEN WHEN

09:57.330 --> 09:58.832
WE SEE IMPROVEMENT IN THE

09:58.832 --> 10:00.300
OVERALL ECONOMY, IMPROVEMENT IN

10:00.300 --> 10:01.167
THE LABOR MARKET.

10:01.167 --> 10:01.935
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT ARE

10:01.935 --> 10:02.836
SOME OF THE LONG-TERM

10:02.836 --> 10:04.237
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS LOW

10:04.237 --> 10:05.505
PARTICIPATION RATE?

10:05.505 --> 10:07.340
>> FOR THE INDIVIDUALS, THEY’RE

10:07.340 --> 10:08.341
REALLY QUITE TRAGIC.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.844
IT MEANS THAT IF YOU’RE NOT IN

10:10.844 --> 10:12.378
THE LABOR FORCE, IN A JOB THAT

10:12.378 --> 10:13.913
SUITS YOUR SKILLS, THAT MEANS

10:13.913 --> 10:15.515
YOU’RE GOING TO SPEND DECADES

10:15.515 --> 10:18.151
DOWN THE LINE PROBABLY EARNING

10:18.151 --> 10:19.185
LESS THAN YOU WOULD HAVE EARNED

10:19.185 --> 10:20.487
OTHERWISE BECAUSE YOU START OUT

10:20.487 --> 10:21.721
AT A LOWER BASE.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.289
YOU’RE NOT GETTING THE KINDS OF

10:23.289 --> 10:24.457
INCREASES THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT

10:24.457 --> 10:26.759
IN PAY AND IN JOB QUALITY.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.194
THAT CAN STUNT YOU AND THERE’S

10:28.194 --> 10:29.429
RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT IT CAN

10:29.429 --> 10:30.930
STUNT YOUR CHILDREN AS WELL.

10:30.930 --> 10:32.332
THAT’S WHY IT’S A BIG RISK THAT

10:32.332 --> 10:32.899
WAY.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.834
IT HURTS THE OVERALL ECONOMY IN

10:34.834 --> 10:36.002
MUCH BROADER WAYS.

10:36.002 --> 10:38.605
AN ECONOMY RELIES ON PEOPLE

10:38.605 --> 10:40.073
WORKING AT THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.543
IT RELIES ON PEOPLE BEING--

10:43.543 --> 10:45.178
PARTICULARLY EDUCATED PEOPLE,

10:45.178 --> 10:46.646
BEING INVOLVED IN THE LABOR

10:46.646 --> 10:47.947
FORCE, LOOKING FOR GOOD

10:47.947 --> 10:49.215
OPPORTUNITIES, LOOKING FOR GOOD

10:49.215 --> 10:49.816
JOBS.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.317
AND YOU SEE IT IN PLENTY OF

10:51.317 --> 10:52.919
ECONOMIES AROUND THE WORLD, WHEN

10:52.919 --> 10:54.320
YOU DON’T HAVE PEOPLE WORKING AT

10:54.320 --> 10:55.889
THEIR FULL POTENTIAL, IT’S A

10:55.889 --> 10:57.657
DEGRADATION OF THE ECONOMY THAT

10:57.657 --> 10:59.559
REDUCES THE POTENTIAL TO GROW

10:59.559 --> 11:02.228
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR JOB

11:02.228 --> 11:03.963
CREATION, FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP,

11:03.963 --> 11:04.764
FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU

11:04.764 --> 11:06.132
WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IN A

11:06.132 --> 11:07.567
VIBRANT, THRIVING ECONOMY.

11:07.567 --> 11:08.001
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.736
AND ABOUT THOSE WHO ARE WORKING,

11:09.736 --> 11:11.237
ARE THEIR WAGES RISING?

11:11.237 --> 11:12.138
ARE THEY TURNING AROUND AND

11:12.138 --> 11:14.274
SPENDING MORE?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.975
>> UNFORTUNATELY, THEIR WAGES

11:15.975 --> 11:17.176
ARE NOT RISING VERY MUCH.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.912
WE’RE SEEING A VERY TWO-TRACK

11:18.912 --> 11:20.613
ECONOMY RIGHT NOW.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.615
ON ONE HAND, YOU SEE THE

11:22.615 --> 11:23.750
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS-- AND THERE

11:23.750 --> 11:25.418
HAVE BEEN SOME REPORTS THIS WEEK

11:25.418 --> 11:27.020
WITH NEW DATA SHOWING THAT THE

11:27.020 --> 11:28.221
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MAKE, THE

11:28.221 --> 11:31.124
MOST GAINS, THE TOP 1% TO 3%,

11:31.124 --> 11:33.326
THEY’RE DOING QUITE WELL, PARTLY

11:33.326 --> 11:34.494
BECAUSE THE STOCK MARKET HAS

11:34.494 --> 11:36.462
BEEN GOING UP SO STRONGLY OVER

11:36.462 --> 11:37.897
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

11:37.897 --> 11:40.366
EVERYONE ELSE, THE OTHER 97% OF

11:40.366 --> 11:42.535
AMERICANS, ARE GENERALLY SEEING

11:42.535 --> 11:43.503
STAGNANT WAGES.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.605
THAT IS WHY YOU’RE NOT SEEING

11:45.605 --> 11:47.073
CONSUMER SPENDING TAKE OFF.

11:47.073 --> 11:48.708
YOU SEE AN ECONOMY THAT ON THE

11:48.708 --> 11:49.776
SURFACE LOOKS LIKE IT’S

11:49.776 --> 11:51.010
IMPROVING BASED ON ALL THE

11:51.010 --> 11:54.047
NUMBERS, BUT THE WAY EVERYONE’S

11:54.047 --> 11:55.848
REACTING TO IT, IT REALLY ISN’T

11:55.848 --> 11:58.051
GAINING THAT MUCH TRACTION.

THERE MAY BE ANOTHER WAY FOR

12:58.244 --> 13:00.780
DOGS TO SAVE LIVES.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.082
ONE NIGHT IN THE SPRING OF 2011,

13:03.082 --> 13:04.250
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER GETTING

13:04.250 --> 13:06.452
A NEW PUPPY, DIANE PAPAZIAN

13:06.452 --> 13:08.554
NOTICED HER DOG, TROY, BEHAVING

13:08.554 --> 13:09.922
STRANGELY.

13:09.922 --> 13:11.724
>> HE’S IN BED WITH US, AND HE

13:11.724 --> 13:13.626
IS IN BETWEEN MY HUSBAND AND

13:13.626 --> 13:16.496
MYSELF, AND... SO, HIS HEAD IS

13:16.496 --> 13:17.930
RIGHT HERE.

13:17.930 --> 13:20.566
AND HE IS NUZZLING UP AGAINST MY

13:20.566 --> 13:21.868
LEFT SIDE, AND HE KEEPS

13:21.868 --> 13:23.436
NUZZLING, AND HE’S NUZZLING, AND

13:23.436 --> 13:24.237
HE’S NOT STOPPING.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.071
AND I’M THINKING, WHAT IN THE

13:25.071 --> 13:26.372
HECK IS GOING ON WITH THIS DOG?

13:26.372 --> 13:27.540
CUT IT OUT, YOU KNOW, THAT’S SO

13:27.540 --> 13:28.241
ANNOYING.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.709
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.244
AND HE KEPT DOING IT

13:31.244 --> 13:32.478
PERSISTENTLY, LIKE IT WASN’T

13:32.478 --> 13:34.547
JUST ONCE OR TWICE; IT WAS FOR A

13:34.547 --> 13:35.948
FEW MINUTES THAT HE KEPT

13:35.948 --> 13:36.883
NUZZLING.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.851
SO, FINALLY I SAID, "WHAT IN THE

13:38.851 --> 13:39.986
HECK IS HE DOING?"

13:39.986 --> 13:41.154
SO, I STARTED TO ITCH, BECAUSE

13:41.154 --> 13:43.456
I’M HIGHLY ALLERGIC, AND THAT’S

13:43.456 --> 13:46.025

13:50.229 --> 13:51.097
LONG.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.532

13:52.532 --> 13:54.467
AGGRESSIVE FORM OF STAGE TWO

13:54.467 --> 13:56.002
BREAST CANCER.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.403
SHE’D GONE FOR A MAMMOGRAM SIX

13:57.403 --> 13:59.472
MONTHS EARLIER WHICH WAS CLEAR,

13:59.472 --> 14:01.007
AND WASN’T DUE FOR ANOTHER

14:01.007 --> 14:02.642
MAMMOGRAM UNTIL ANOTHER SIX

14:02.642 --> 14:03.476
MONTHS.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.977
WHEN YOU WENT TO THE DOCTOR, DID

14:04.977 --> 14:08.114
YOU SAY, "YOU KNOW, MY DOG SORT

14:08.114 --> 14:09.582
OF ALERTED ME TO THIS?"

HEARD YOUR STORY?

14:12.952 --> 14:13.920
>> WELL, I DON’T THINK... I

14:13.920 --> 14:15.021
THINK THEY KIND OF PARTLY

14:15.021 --> 14:17.690
THOUGHT I WAS A LITTLE CRAZY.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.892
BUT I THINK THAT THEY PROBABLY

14:19.892 --> 14:22.562
HAVE HEARD ENOUGH STORIES ABOUT

14:22.562 --> 14:24.163
DOGS AND THEIR VERY KEEN SENSE

14:24.163 --> 14:26.666
OF SMELL THAT THEY WEREN’T

14:26.666 --> 14:28.768
COMPLETELY SURPRISED.

14:28.768 --> 14:29.936
>> Reporter: DIANE’S STORY MIGHT

14:29.936 --> 14:32.138
NOT BE SO CRAZY AFTER ALL.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.906
FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS, CANCER

14:33.906 --> 14:35.742
RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN EXPLORING

14:35.742 --> 14:37.543
THE POSSIBILITY THAT CANCER

14:37.543 --> 14:39.979
ACTUALLY SMELLS LIKE SOMETHING,

14:39.979 --> 14:41.848
AND THAT DOGS CAN DETECT THAT

14:41.848 --> 14:43.683
SMELL.

ALWAYS HAVE TO QUESTION.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.251
UNTIL WE SEE ALL THE DATA AND

22:14.333 --> 22:15.501
I KNOW THAT HE WAS TRYING TO

22:15.501 --> 22:16.702
TELL ME SOMETHING IN HIS OWN

AND INVESTIGATES THE WORST EBOLA

22:33.219 --> 22:34.553
OUTBREAK ON RECORD, THE

22:34.553 --> 22:36.222
DEVASTATING IMPACT IT’S HAVING

22:36.222 --> 22:37.389
ON FAMILIES AND HEALTH CARE

22:37.389 --> 22:38.757

22:38.757 --> 22:40.025
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO

22:40.025 --> 22:41.527

22:41.527 --> 22:42.661
HERE’S AN EXCERPT FILMED IN

22:42.661 --> 22:43.929
SIERRA LEONE.

22:51.437 --> 22:53.439
STREETS, WARNING THE OUTBREAK

22:53.439 --> 22:54.573

22:59.745 --> 23:00.879
EVEN IN THE DOCTORS WITHOUT

23:00.879 --> 23:03.015
BORDERS HOSPITAL, EBOLA IS

23:03.015 --> 23:04.817
KILLING 70% OF THOSE IT

23:04.817 --> 23:06.719
INFECTS.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.153
BECAUSE SO FEW PEOPLE WHO GO TO

23:08.153 --> 23:09.955
THE HOSPITAL EVER RETURN,

23:09.955 --> 23:11.290
VICTIMS ARE HIDING IN THEIR

23:11.290 --> 23:13.225
HOMES AND INFECTING THEIR

23:13.225 --> 23:14.193
FAMILIES.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.037
THE ONLY WAY TO CONTAIN EBOLA

23:25.037 --> 23:27.072
IS TO ISOLATE THE INFECTED.

23:30.709 --> 23:32.111
THIS MAN WORKS WITH ONE OF

23:32.111 --> 23:33.212
SIERRA LEONE’S DISEASE

23:44.023 --> 23:45.524
CAN’T KEEP UP WITH THE NUMBER

23:56.068 --> 23:57.703
TWO WEEKS AGO, HE WENT THROUGH

23:57.703 --> 23:59.772

23:59.772 --> 24:01.307
QUARANTINED WITH SUSPECTED

24:01.307 --> 24:03.108

24:03.108 --> 24:04.109
IT TURNED OUT TO BE A FALSE

24:04.109 --> 24:07.746
ALARM, AND HE RETURNED TO WORK.

24:07.746 --> 24:08.781
NOW, HE’S ABOUT TO HEAD TO

24:08.781 --> 24:12.318
ANOTHER CONTAMINATED VILLAGE.

24:12.318 --> 24:13.285
>> IF I GIVE UP, IT’S LIKE I’M

24:13.285 --> 24:15.287
