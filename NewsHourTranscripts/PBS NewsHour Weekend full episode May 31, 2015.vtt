WEBVTT

00:10.744 --> 00:12.079
>> Sreenivasan: ON THIS EDITION

00:12.079 --> 00:13.780
FOR SUNDAY, MAY 31:

00:13.780 --> 00:15.148
WITH A DEADLINE LOOMING, THE

00:15.148 --> 00:15.983
SENATE RESUMES THE DEBATE OVER

00:15.983 --> 00:17.618
THE PATRIOT ACT.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.119
IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT, THE

00:19.119 --> 00:20.487
GROWING BUSINESS OF GENDER ROLES

00:20.487 --> 00:22.890
AND NON-CONFORMING FASHION.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.992
>> I THINK PEOPLE SEE ME IN A

00:24.992 --> 00:26.159
WAY THAT MAY ACTUALLY BE ALIGNED

00:26.159 --> 00:28.462
WITH HOW I SEE MYSELF.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.529
>> Sreenivasan: AND, THE DEATH

00:29.529 --> 00:30.530
OF BEAU BIDEN.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.232
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:32.232 --> 00:33.100
>>FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS

00:33.100 --> 00:34.067
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:34.067 --> 00:39.072
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:39.072 --> 00:39.840
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:39.840 --> 00:41.174
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:41.174 --> 00:42.609
THE SENATE IS IN A RARE SUNDAY

00:42.609 --> 00:44.044
SESSION TONIGHT, WRANGLING OVER

00:44.044 --> 00:45.545
THREE KEY SURVEILLANCE

00:45.545 --> 00:46.813
PROVISIONS OF THE PATRIOT ACT

00:46.813 --> 00:48.615
SET TO EXPIRE AT MIDNIGHT.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.117
THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL PROVISION

00:50.117 --> 00:51.718
ALLOWS THE N.S.A. TO COLLECT AND

00:51.718 --> 00:53.287
STORE AMERICANS' PHONE RECORDS.

00:53.287 --> 00:54.855
THE HOUSE ALREADY PASSED A

00:54.855 --> 00:56.290
BIPARTISAN MEASURE, FORCING THE

00:56.290 --> 00:57.824
GOVERNMENT TO GIVE UP THE MASS

00:57.824 --> 00:58.959
DATA COLLECTION AND HAVE PHONE

00:58.959 --> 00:59.693
COMPANIES KEEP THE RECORDS

00:59.693 --> 01:01.295
INSTEAD.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.162
BUT THE SENATE IS LOCKED IN A

01:02.162 --> 01:12.773
STAND-OFF.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.441
EVEN IF A GROUP OF SENATORS

01:14.441 --> 01:16.043
COMES UP WITH A VIABLE BILL IN

01:16.043 --> 01:17.678
THE NEXT FEW HOURS, THE SENATE

01:17.678 --> 01:19.546
HAS TO AGREE UNANIMOUSLY JUST

01:19.546 --> 01:21.081
TO VOTE ON IT.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.950
KENTUCKY SENATOR RAND PAUL SAYS

01:22.950 --> 01:25.018
HE'LL REFUSE TO LET THAT HAPPEN,

01:25.018 --> 01:27.220
SAYING SATURDAY HE'LL "FORCE THE

01:27.220 --> 01:29.256
EXPIRATION OF THE N.S.A. ILLEGAL

01:29.256 --> 01:30.824
SPY PROGRAM."

01:30.824 --> 01:32.192
RAND PAUL'S TACTICS SPARKED

01:32.192 --> 01:33.293
CRITICISM FROM UTAH SENATOR MIKE

01:33.293 --> 01:34.728
LEE THIS MORNING.

01:34.728 --> 01:36.530
LEE WANTS THE SENATE TO PASS THE

01:36.530 --> 01:37.864
HOUSE VERSION OF THE BILL

01:37.864 --> 01:38.565
TONIGHT.

01:38.565 --> 01:39.433
>> I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE

01:39.433 --> 01:40.667
VOTES.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.035
SO AT THIS POINT I THINK THE

01:42.035 --> 01:43.203
QUESTION IS NOT REALLY ABOUT

01:43.203 --> 01:44.504
WHETHER WE'LL GET THIS PASSED,

01:44.504 --> 01:45.605
BUT WHEN.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.573
IT'LL HAPPEN EITHER TONIGHT OR

01:46.573 --> 01:47.274
IT WILL HAPPEN ON WEDNESDAY OR

01:47.274 --> 01:47.941
SOMETIME IN BETWEEN THEN.

01:47.941 --> 01:48.675
>> Sreenivasan: JOINING ME NOW

01:48.675 --> 01:49.543
WITH THE VERY LATEST ON THE

01:49.543 --> 01:50.410
SENATE DEBATE IS THE NEWSHOUR'S

01:50.410 --> 01:51.278
POLITICAL DIRECTOR LISA

01:51.278 --> 01:52.879
DESJARDINS.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.014
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DID WE GET

01:54.014 --> 01:54.481
HERE?

01:54.481 --> 01:55.115
IT HAS BEEN A WEEK.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.350
HOW DID WE GOAT THIS POINT?

01:56.350 --> 01:58.952
>> RIGHT, THIS IS A GAMBLE BY

01:58.952 --> 02:02.689
SENATE MAJORLY LEADER MITCH

02:02.689 --> 02:03.690
MCCONNELL, WHEN THE SENATE COMES

02:03.690 --> 02:05.459
UP TO A DEADLINE, ESPECIALLY ONE

02:05.459 --> 02:07.094
LIKE LAST WEEK WHEN THEY WERE ON

02:07.094 --> 02:08.095
THEIR WAY TO I HAVE A

02:08.095 --> 02:09.129
INDICATION, THE SENATE USUALLY

02:09.129 --> 02:10.931
DOES MEET THAT DEADLINE, IT IS

02:10.931 --> 02:11.999
JUST BY A FEW MINUTES, THIS

02:11.999 --> 02:13.734
TIME, HOWEVER, THEY DIDN'T, AND

02:13.734 --> 02:15.702
I THINK THE DIFFERENCE, HARI,

02:15.702 --> 02:18.372
THIS TIME, IS THAT WHEN THESE

02:18.372 --> 02:20.774
PROVISIONS WERE LAST AUTHORIZED

02:20.774 --> 02:23.143
BY CONGRESS, IT WAS 2011.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.912
SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE SEEN

02:25.912 --> 02:28.148
EVERETT SNOWDEN MADE HIS

02:28.148 --> 02:28.982
REVELATIONS ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY

02:28.982 --> 02:30.417
THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DOING

02:30.417 --> 02:31.852
AND JUST IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS

02:31.852 --> 02:33.487
THEY GOT A FEDERAL COURT TO RULE

02:33.487 --> 02:34.021
AGAINST THEM.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.522
SO THIS IDEA OF KIND OF TAKING

02:35.522 --> 02:37.424
SOMETHING LIKE A REPORT TO YOUR

02:37.424 --> 02:38.692
BOSS ON DEADLINE AND GETTING

02:38.692 --> 02:39.993
THEM TO SIGN OFF WHICH

02:39.993 --> 02:41.061
SOMETIMES CONGRESS HAS DONE

02:41.061 --> 02:43.263
DIDN'T WORK THIS TIME, BECAUSE

02:43.263 --> 02:44.765
REALLY THE GAME HAS CHANGED,

02:44.765 --> 02:45.632
OUR KNOWLEDGE HAS CHANGED AND

02:45.632 --> 02:46.566
OPINIONS HAVE CHANGED ABOUT

02:46.566 --> 02:47.801
THESE PROGRAMS SINCE THEY WERE

02:47.801 --> 02:48.702
LAST AUTHORIZED.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.037
>> Sreenivasan: WELL, WHAT THE

02:50.037 --> 02:51.738
OPTIONS ON THE TABLE HEADING

02:51.738 --> 02:53.673
INTO TONIGHT?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.675
>> WELL, THERE WERE TWO OPTIONS

02:55.675 --> 02:57.444
THAT THE SENATE ACTUALLY VOTED

02:57.444 --> 02:59.546
ON, ONE WAS JUST A TWO MONTH

02:59.546 --> 03:00.580
EXTENSION, JUST KEEP THE

03:00.580 --> 03:02.149
PROGRAMS RUNNING EXACTLY AS IS

03:02.149 --> 03:03.450
AND TRYING 0 TO DISCUSS WHAT TO

03:03.450 --> 03:04.551
DO NEXT.

03:04.551 --> 03:05.986
THAT IS THE CLASSIC OPTION FOR

03:05.986 --> 03:07.254
THE SENATE BUT THAT REALLY

03:07.254 --> 03:08.855
DIDN'T GET VERY MANY VOTES.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.425
WHAT DID ALMOST GET ENOUGH VOTES

03:11.425 --> 03:14.327
WAS A REVISION OF THE REFORM

03:14.327 --> 03:15.829
DATA COLLECTION PROGRAM.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.597
THIS IDEA PASSED THE HOUSE

03:17.597 --> 03:18.999
OVERWHELMINGLY AND IT GOT 57

03:18.999 --> 03:19.933
VOTES IN THE SENATE, I DON'T

03:19.933 --> 03:21.368
WANT TO GET TOO MUCH INTO

03:21.368 --> 03:22.369
NUMBERS BUT THAT IS REALLY

03:22.369 --> 03:23.570
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS JUST

03:23.570 --> 03:24.604
THREE VOTES SHORT OF WHAT IT

03:24.604 --> 03:25.439
NEEDED.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.541
SO THIS IDEA OF REVISING THE

03:27.541 --> 03:28.575
PATRIOT ACT WOULD MAKE IT SO

03:28.575 --> 03:30.510
THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO TAKE

03:30.510 --> 03:32.646
ITS HANDS OFF COMPLETELY ALL OF

03:32.646 --> 03:34.948
THE PHONE METADATA, THE NUMBERS

03:34.948 --> 03:36.016
YOU AND I CALL, FOR EXAMPLE,

03:36.016 --> 03:37.551
THAT THE GOVERNMENT NOW HAS

03:37.551 --> 03:38.785
CLEAR ACCESS TO.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.287
THE GOVERNMENT NO LONGER WOULD

03:40.287 --> 03:42.122
BE ABLE TO SEE, INSTEAD THE

03:42.122 --> 03:43.924
GOVERNMENT UNDER THIS USA

03:43.924 --> 03:45.292
FREEDOM ACT WOULD HAVE TO GET A

03:45.292 --> 03:46.393
COURT ORDER AND THEY WOULD HAVE

03:46.393 --> 03:48.261
TO ASK OUR TELEPHONE COMPANY OR

03:48.261 --> 03:49.396
OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY

03:49.396 --> 03:51.598
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA.

03:51.598 --> 03:52.499
THE COMPANIES WOULD BE THE ONES

03:52.499 --> 03:54.201
THAT HOLD THAT DATA, NOT

03:54.201 --> 03:54.734
GOVERNMENT.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.736
IT IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.105
IT ALMOST HAD ENOUGH VOTES A

03:58.105 --> 04:00.140
WEEK AGO AND I THINK THE THING

04:00.140 --> 04:02.542
TO WATCH IS AS TO WHETHER REFORM

04:02.542 --> 04:03.810
MINDED SENATORS ARE ABLE TO GET

04:03.810 --> 04:05.212
THREE MORE PEOPLE TO JUMP ON

04:05.212 --> 04:07.314
BOARD WITH THEM IN THE NEXT DAY,

04:07.314 --> 04:08.048
MAYBE A FEW DAYS.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.316
>> Sreenivasan: SO IF THOSE

04:09.316 --> 04:10.484
THREE SENATORS GET ON BOARD,

04:10.484 --> 04:12.352
DOES THAT MEAN THAT SENATOR RAND

04:12.352 --> 04:14.154
PAUL, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

04:14.154 --> 04:15.188
RAND PAUL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO

04:15.188 --> 04:19.092
STOP THIS SINGLE-HANDEDLY?

04:19.092 --> 04:21.027
>> HE CANNOT ULTIMATELY STOP

04:21.027 --> 04:22.362
THIS SINGLE-HANDEDLY BUT HE CAN

04:22.362 --> 04:24.731
DELAY IT SO THAT WE DO EXPECT

04:24.731 --> 04:27.868
THESE POWERS TO EXPIRE TONIGHT

04:27.868 --> 04:28.835
@MIDNIGHT.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.370
SENATOR PAUL HAS SAID IN A

04:30.370 --> 04:31.705
STATEMENT THAT HIS CAMPAIGN SENT

04:31.705 --> 04:33.840
ME THAT HE WILL OBJECT TO IT AND

04:33.840 --> 04:34.941
BASICALLY THAT MEANS THAT IT

04:34.941 --> 04:36.977
WILL TAKE DAYS OF PROCESS TO GET

04:36.977 --> 04:39.279
TO A FINAL VOTE.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.447
ANY SINGLE SENATOR HAS THAT

04:40.447 --> 04:41.548
ABILITY AND HERE RAND BALL IS

04:41.548 --> 04:42.149
USING IT.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.985
SO HE CAN'T STOP A COMPROMISE

04:44.985 --> 04:47.420
NECESSARILY BUT HE CAN DELAY IT

04:47.420 --> 04:48.822
SO THAT THESE POWERS WOULD

04:48.822 --> 04:50.657
EXPIRE FOR AT LEAST A FEW DAYS.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.292
SO THEN WE GOAT THE ISSUE OF

04:52.292 --> 04:53.894
WHAT WILL THE COMPROMISE BE?

04:53.894 --> 04:55.162
WHAT WILL THE SENATE DO AND THE

04:55.162 --> 04:56.296
TRUTH IS, HARI, RIGHT NOW WE

04:56.296 --> 04:57.130
DON'T KNOW.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.065
SO WHILE YOU AND I ARE WONDERING

04:59.065 --> 04:60.000
WHAT EXACTLY OUR GOVERNMENT WILL

04:60.000 --> 05:02.102
BE ABLE TO DO AND, IN

05:02.102 --> 05:03.703
SURVEILLANCE, EITHER ON THE

05:03.703 --> 05:05.138
SECURITY ISSUE OR LIBERTY ISSUE,

05:05.138 --> 05:07.040
MANY EMPLOYEES OF THE NSA ARE

05:07.040 --> 05:08.375
WONDERING JUST IN THE NEXT FEW

05:08.375 --> 05:09.209
HOURS WHAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

05:09.209 --> 05:10.110
DO AS WELL FOR THE NEXT FEW

05:10.110 --> 05:10.677
DAYS.

05:10.677 --> 05:12.312
>> Sreenivasan: SO ONE OF THE

05:12.312 --> 05:13.046
ADMINISTRATION TALKING POINTS

05:13.046 --> 05:13.880
THROUGHOUT THIS WEEK REALLY

05:13.880 --> 05:14.881
THROUGHOUT THE PAST COUPLE OF

05:14.881 --> 05:17.117
YEARS IS HOW INTEGRAL NSA

05:17.117 --> 05:18.885
INTELLIGENCE HAS BEEN TO

05:18.885 --> 05:19.886
THWARTING TERRORISM IF THERE IS

05:19.886 --> 05:22.155
A LAPSE COME MIDNIGHT WHO SAYS

05:22.155 --> 05:24.391
HOW DANGEROUS IT IS AND HOW NOT

05:24.391 --> 05:25.425
TO DANGEROUS IT IS?

05:25.425 --> 05:27.160
>> THE TRUTH IS THAT WE HAVE NOT

05:27.160 --> 05:28.728
GOTTEN SPECIFICS ON EXACTLY WHAT

05:28.728 --> 05:30.197
WOULD HAPPEN, AND IT IS POSSIBLE

05:30.197 --> 05:31.731
THAT HONESTLY THE NATIONAL

05:31.731 --> 05:33.066
SECURITY AGENCY AND THE WHITE

05:33.066 --> 05:34.367
HOUSE DON'T KNOW, THEY DON'T

05:34.367 --> 05:35.535
KNOW EXACTLY HOW TERRORISTS

05:35.535 --> 05:36.670
WOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

05:36.670 --> 05:37.237
OF THIS.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.905
THEY DO THINK THAT TERRORISTS

05:38.905 --> 05:39.973
ARE AWARE OF THIS DEBATE, THEY

05:39.973 --> 05:42.175
ARE AWARE THAT SOME POWERS MAY

05:42.175 --> 05:42.909
EXPIRE TONIGHT.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.811
I THINK THE PROGRAM TO PAY THE

05:44.811 --> 05:46.513
MOST ATTENTION TO, HARI, IS NOT

05:46.513 --> 05:49.749
THE CON VENTURE, CONTROVERSIAL

05:49.749 --> 05:50.984
METADATA ONE BUT CALLED ROVING

05:50.984 --> 05:53.320
WIRETAPS AND THAT'S THE POWER

05:53.320 --> 05:55.188
THAT ALLOWS OUR GOVERNMENT TO

05:55.188 --> 05:56.523
TRACK TERRORIST SUSPECTS WHEN

05:56.523 --> 05:57.190
THEY CHANGE PHONES.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.658
YOU ARE TRACKING THE SUSPECT AND

05:58.658 --> 05:59.593
NOT THE PHONE.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.360
>> Sreenivasan: SURE.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.429
>> AND ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE

06:02.429 --> 06:04.464
NATIONAL SECURITY INDUSTRY SAYS

06:04.464 --> 06:05.999
THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT POWER

06:05.999 --> 06:07.133
BUT IT WOULD EXPIRE ALONG WHERE

06:07.133 --> 06:09.236
THE OTHER TWO IN THIS BECAUSE OF

06:09.236 --> 06:11.204
THE MORE CONTROVERSIAL ONE, I

06:11.204 --> 06:12.806
THINK THAT'S THE ONES THEY ARE

06:12.806 --> 06:14.474
THE MOST NERVOUS ABOUT.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.042
>> Sreenivasan: POLITICAL

06:16.042 --> 06:16.810
DIRECTOR LISA DESJARDINS JOINING

06:16.810 --> 06:17.577
US FROM WASHINGTON, THANK YOU SO

06:17.577 --> 06:18.144
MUCH.

06:18.144 --> 06:19.012
>> MY PLEASURE.

06:19.012 --> 06:23.183
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.017
>> Sreenivasan: LEADERS ACROSS

06:24.017 --> 06:24.851
THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD

06:24.851 --> 06:25.952
ARE EXPRESSING SYMPATHY TONIGHT

06:25.952 --> 06:26.720
FOR VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND

06:26.720 --> 06:27.587
HIS FAMILY FOLLOWING THE DEATH

06:27.587 --> 06:28.955
OF HIS OLDEST SON, BEAU.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.190
BEAU BIDEN WAS CONSIDERED A

06:30.190 --> 06:31.791
RISING STAR IN THE DEMOCRATIC

06:31.791 --> 06:33.360
PARTY AND WAS WIDELY EXPECTED TO

06:33.360 --> 06:34.194
RUN FOR GOVERNOR OF DELAWARE IN

06:34.194 --> 06:36.663
2016.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.365
THE VICE PRESIDENT'S ELDEST SON

06:38.365 --> 06:40.367
HAD FACED A SERIES OF HEALTH

06:40.367 --> 06:42.002
SETBACKS IN RECENT YEARS, YET

06:42.002 --> 06:43.703
WAS ABLE TO SERVE TWO TERMS AS

06:43.703 --> 06:44.871
DELAWARE'S ATTORNEY GENERAL UP

06:44.871 --> 06:47.140

BANS SUSPECTED NAZI CRIMINALS

09:34.874 --> 09:35.909
DAMAGES ARE ALREADY ESTIMATED TO

09:35.909 --> 09:38.545

09:38.545 --> 09:39.712
IN INDIA, RAIN SHOWERS ARE

09:39.712 --> 09:41.181
BRINGING LITTLE RELIEF FROM THE

09:41.181 --> 09:43.316
RAGING HEAT WAVE THAT HAS KILLED

09:43.316 --> 09:44.984
2,200 PEOPLE SINCE MID-APRIL.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.709
MONTH, IN WHICH HE STATED, "FOR

10:09.709 --> 10:10.643
ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES I AM A

10:10.643 --> 10:12.345
WOMAN."

10:12.345 --> 10:13.780
THE INTERVIEW BECAME A LARGE

10:13.780 --> 10:15.181
PART OF A NATIONAL CONVERSATION

10:15.181 --> 10:16.382
ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF GENDER

10:16.382 --> 10:18.518
AND SEXUALITY.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.220
AND WITHIN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY,

10:20.220 --> 10:21.054
A CRUCIAL ASPECT OF THAT

10:21.054 --> 10:22.088
CONVERSATION IS ABOUT WHAT TO

10:22.088 --> 10:23.723
WEAR.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.191
IN THIS UPDATED STORY, THE

10:25.191 --> 10:26.593
NEWSHOUR'S IVETTE FELICIANO

10:26.593 --> 10:27.694

10:27.694 --> 10:28.428
ROLES ARE CHANGING THE FASHION

10:28.428 --> 10:31.531
INDUSTRY.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.466
>> MY GENDER IDENTITY IS REALLY

10:33.466 --> 10:35.502
BASED IN BOTH MY EXPERIENCES AS

10:35.502 --> 10:38.304
A WOMAN, AND ALSO IT'S JUST

10:38.304 --> 10:39.072
DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT

10:39.072 --> 10:41.040
I'M MASCULINE.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.742
>> Reporter: RACHEL TUTERA SAYS

10:42.742 --> 10:44.477
IT WASN'T UNTIL SHE STARTED

10:44.477 --> 10:46.145
WEARING BOY'S CLOTHES AS A PRE-

10:46.145 --> 10:47.413
TEEN, THAT SHE STARTED TO FEEL

10:47.413 --> 10:48.147
LIKE THE MOST AUTHENTIC VERSION

10:48.147 --> 10:50.049
OF HERSELF.

10:50.049 --> 10:51.584
YET THE 30-YEAR-OLD SAYS

10:51.584 --> 10:53.253
SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES IN THE

10:53.253 --> 10:54.521
MEN'S DEPARTMENT LEFT HER

10:54.521 --> 10:55.688
FEELING INSECURE AND SELF-

10:55.688 --> 10:56.723
CONSCIOUS.

10:56.723 --> 10:57.390
NOTHING EVER FIT HER

10:57.390 --> 10:59.158
PROPORTIONS.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.493
SO SHE WAS RESIGNED TO THINKING

11:00.493 --> 11:02.395
THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT WAS.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.030
>> I GOT USED TO WEARING CLOTHES

11:04.030 --> 11:05.698
THAT HID ME.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.333
I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST END UP

11:07.333 --> 11:09.035
BEING SOMEONE WHO WOULD PREFER

11:09.035 --> 11:10.803
TO BE OVERLOOKED, OR NOT WORTH

11:10.803 --> 11:12.572
SORT OF A SECOND GLANCE.

11:12.572 --> 11:13.706
TYPICALLY YOU SHOW A LITTLE BIT

11:13.706 --> 11:15.041
OF CUFF.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.643
>> Reporter: AFTER YEARS OF

11:16.643 --> 11:18.244
FRUSTRATION SHOPPING OFF THE

11:18.244 --> 11:20.079
RACK, TUTERA DECIDED TO PURCHASE

11:20.079 --> 11:21.915
HER FIRST TAILORED MEN'S SUIT,

11:21.915 --> 11:23.550
AND SHE SAYS THE WAY SHE FELT

11:23.550 --> 11:24.450
WHEN SHE TRIED IT ON CHANGED HER

11:24.450 --> 11:26.252
LIFE.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.021
>> HAVING SOMETHING CUSTOM-MADE

11:28.021 --> 11:30.156
FOR MY BODY BASICALLY

11:30.156 --> 11:31.791
REINTRODUCED ME TO MY BODY AND I

11:31.791 --> 11:34.060
HAVE FELT, LIKE, INCREDIBLY

11:34.060 --> 11:35.828
VISIBLE IN A WAY THAT'S NOT JUST

11:35.828 --> 11:37.797
CAUSING PEOPLE TO TAKE A SECOND

11:37.797 --> 11:39.599
LOOK AT ME, BUT I THINK PEOPLE

11:39.599 --> 11:41.100
SEE ME IN A WAY THAT MAY

11:41.100 --> 11:41.901
ACTUALLY BE ALIGNED WITH HOW I

11:41.901 --> 11:43.303
SEE MYSELF.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.271
AND THAT HAS BEEN THE MOST,

11:45.271 --> 11:46.039
LIKE, POWERFUL, MIND-BLOWING

11:46.039 --> 11:47.807
THING.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.375
>> Reporter: THE EXPERIENCE MADE

11:49.375 --> 11:50.543
TUTERA WANT TO PASS THAT FEELING

11:50.543 --> 11:52.579
ON TO OTHERS.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.880
SO SHE APPROACHED THE NEW YORK

11:55.114 --> 11:57.216

12:06.826 --> 12:08.361
PEOPLE WHO WANT WELL-FITTING,

12:08.361 --> 12:10.630

12:19.205 --> 12:21.841
FOR THEIR CUSTOM MADE SUIT.

12:21.841 --> 12:23.142
>> THIS IS NOT JUST A NEED THAT

12:23.142 --> 12:23.943
IS BEING RECOGNIZED IN

12:23.943 --> 12:24.978
PROGRESSIVE CITIES.

12:24.978 --> 12:25.712

12:25.712 --> 12:26.613
EMOTIONAL FOR ANY OF YOUR

12:27.647 --> 12:28.548

SURE.

12:30.783 --> 12:31.584
SHOPPING OR WEARING CLOTHES

12:31.584 --> 12:32.318
SEEMS LIKE A REALLY MUNDANE

12:32.318 --> 12:33.386
THING.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.021
BUT ACTUALLY IT'S, LIKE,

12:35.021 --> 12:36.756
INCREDIBLY MEANINGFUL AND

12:36.756 --> 12:38.091
INCREDIBLY POWERFUL AND IT CAN

12:38.091 --> 12:38.992
REALLY, LIKE, MAKE OR BREAK AN

12:51.738 --> 12:53.172
INTO THE WRONG BODY.

12:53.172 --> 12:54.607
BUT, THEY MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES

12:54.607 --> 12:56.009
DEEPLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE

13:20.166 --> 13:21.868

13:21.868 --> 13:22.702

13:22.702 --> 13:23.970
THAT A NEW NAME OR PRONOUNS

SHOULD BE USED, AND HE ALSO SAYS

13:26.039 --> 13:27.540

GOOD ROBOT, I DON'T CARE.

21:20.379 --> 21:22.181
WHAT THEY BUILT WAS A BIT OF

21:22.181 --> 21:23.949
SELF-CONFIDENCE ABOUT WHAT'S

21:23.949 --> 21:25.484
POSSIBLE, A NEW PERSPECTIVE.
