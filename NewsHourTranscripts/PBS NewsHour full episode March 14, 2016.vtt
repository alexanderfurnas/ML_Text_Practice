JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.741 --> 00:11.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Candidates race toward a
critical day of primaries

00:11.778 --> 00:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tomorrow, with eyes on Ohio and
Florida as
potential campaign
game-changers.

00:17.184 --> 00:22.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Monday, we sit
down with the new head of the
U.N. Refugee

00:22.222 --> 00:27.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Agency, Filippo Grandi, on the
eve of the
fifth anniversary of the Syrian
civil war.

00:27.895 --> 00:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with public
media partners
Marketplace and "Frontline," we
launch a new

00:33.333 --> 00:39.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
series, How the Deck Is Stacked,
reported
by Kai Ryssdal, on why many
Americans feel

00:39.907 --> 00:41.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they can't get ahead.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL, Marketplace: We
have added a
million jobs in this economy
since the last

00:44.745 --> 00:48.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time we went out in the field in
September,
and yet people aren't feeling
it. And that

00:48.282 --> 00:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me is the most interesting
thing, that
what's going on here is not
being widely shared

00:53.020 --> 00:55.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down at the middle and bottom
ranges of this
economy.

00:55.555 --> 01:03.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.730 --> 01:06.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:06.633 --> 01:16.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: After a weekend of
turmoil on
the presidential campaign trail,
candidates

01:16.476 --> 01:22.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got down to business with just
hours to go
until polls open in another
critical series

01:22.082 --> 01:23.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of primaries.

01:23.917 --> 01:29.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the day began with more
protests at a
Donald Trump rally, this time in
North Carolina.

01:29.556 --> 01:38.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The commotion was met, at first,
by silence
from the Republican
front-runner, but when

01:38.699 --> 01:44.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chants of "Trump" and "USA"
drowned out the
demonstrators, the billionaire
businessman

01:44.471 --> 01:46.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spoke up.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
But the press is now calling.
They're saying,

01:48.075 --> 01:52.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oh, but there's such violence.
No violence.
You know, how many people have
been hurt at

01:52.245 --> 01:58.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our rallies? I think like
basically none,
other than I guess maybe
somebody got hit

01:58.185 --> 01:59.419 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
once.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no violence. There's
lovefests. These
are lovefests.

02:02.622 --> 02:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It was a similar
scene later in
the day in Florida. The tumult
comes amid

02:08.628 --> 02:14.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a scramble for votes in five
states tomorrow,
featuring pivotal primaries in
Florida and

02:14.801 --> 02:16.603 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ohio.

02:16.636 --> 02:22.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Focusing on his must-win home
state, John
Kasich started his day in
Youngstown, taking

02:22.109 --> 02:23.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aim at Trump.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
Leadership is not dividing
people. Leadership

02:27.014 --> 02:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not encouraging a toxic
environment where
we blame one group because of
the failure

02:34.221 --> 02:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or success of another. This
country is about
us coming together. This country
is not about

02:42.029 --> 02:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us tearing each other down or
having fist-fights
at a campaign rally. That's not
what America

02:49.136 --> 02:51.104 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

02:51.138 --> 02:56.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Later in the day,
Kasich was joined
by another Trump critic, 2012
Republican nominee

02:56.476 --> 02:58.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mitt Romney.

02:58.278 --> 03:00.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MITT ROMNEY (R), Former
Presidential Candidate:
You look at this guy and, unlike
the other

03:00.480 --> 03:06.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people running, he has a real
track record.
He has the kind of record that
you want in

03:06.286 --> 03:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington. And that's why I'm
convinced that
you're going to do the right
thing tomorrow.

03:12.225 --> 03:12.759 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Agreed?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:14.661 --> 03:15.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
Tomorrow's the day where we're
going to shock

03:15.062 --> 03:16.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Senator Marco Rubio,
like Kasich,
has also taken a similar home
state focus,

03:18.832 --> 03:24.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but in Florida. The winner in
either state
will take home all the
delegates. And, as

03:24.237 --> 03:27.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Ohio, front-runner Trump
poses the greatest
threat.

03:27.641 --> 03:32.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Tomorrow, we
have a chance
to make a powerful statement to
the country.

03:32.412 --> 03:37.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is that the Republican
Party is not
going to allow itself to be
hijacked by fake

03:37.217 --> 03:40.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conservatives and people who go
around dividing
us against each other.

03:40.854 --> 03:44.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For Texas Senator
Ted Cruz, Illinois
provides a ripe target.

03:44.291 --> 03:50.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Donald Trump has made billions
buying influence

03:50.263 --> 03:54.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from politicians, supporting
liberal Democratic
politicians and supporting the
Republican

03:55.001 --> 03:58.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
establishment, all at the
expense of working
men and women.

03:58.438 --> 04:03.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Democrat Hillary
Clinton campaigned
in Illinois as well, meeting
with Latino activists

04:03.577 --> 04:07.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and visiting a memorial for
victims of gun
violence.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a rally, she jabbed at
Republicans' economic
proposals.

04:10.283 --> 04:13.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Folks who get excited by the
rhetoric and

04:13.553 --> 04:19.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the demagoguery on the
Republican side need
to be reminded that they are
George W. Bush

04:19.526 --> 04:21.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on steroids.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:24.731 --> 04:30.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Their
economic plans
-- their economic plans, each
and every one

04:30.303 --> 04:36.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them would throw us back into
the mess
that President Obama was able to
dig us out

04:36.243 --> 04:38.011 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of.

04:38.044 --> 04:41.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And back in Ohio,
Bernie Sanders
predicted he'd beat Clinton, as
he hit her

04:41.715 --> 04:43.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
again for her Wall Street
speeches.

04:43.884 --> 04:51.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
If you get paid $225,000 for a
speech, it

04:51.158 --> 05:00.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
must be an extraordinary speech.
It must be
mind-blowing. It must be
Shakespearian. It

05:00.934 --> 05:03.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should be released to the
American people.

05:03.203 --> 05:04.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:04.704 --> 05:08.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, as with the
Republicans,
the day's main target was Trump.

05:08.508 --> 05:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Bringing
our people together
will always trump separating us
and dividing

05:15.182 --> 05:16.950 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us up.

05:16.983 --> 05:24.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We have
to have a
big vote tomorrow that can send
a strong message

05:24.057 --> 05:25.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that love trumps hate.

05:25.992 --> 05:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Clinton called on
Democrats to
unify around her as the best
chance to defeat

05:31.498 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

05:33.300 --> 05:37.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will have more from
"NewsHour" correspondent
John Yang, who is in the
battleground state

05:37.270 --> 05:39.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Ohio, right after the news
summary.

05:39.573 --> 05:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Russian
President Vladimir Putin ordered
his armed

05:44.044 --> 05:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces to begin pulling out of
Syria. He said
it's because Russia's military
intervention

05:49.516 --> 05:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has achieved its objectives, as
a new round
of Syrian peace talks got under
way in Geneva.

05:55.422 --> 06:01.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin discussed his decision
today by phone
with President Obama, who
welcomed the move.

06:01.394 --> 06:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria's President Bashar Assad
said the action
was coordinated, and France's
defense minister

06:07.100 --> 06:12.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said Russia has -- quote --
"practically stopped
hitting" moderate Syrian rebels.

06:12.105 --> 06:16.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For more on Putin's
announcement, I spoke
late this afternoon with Nathan
Hodge, Moscow

06:16.810 --> 06:19.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bureau chief for The Wall Street
Journal.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Nathan.

06:20.880 --> 06:28.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, U.S. officials say they have
seen no evidence
yet of any movement by Russian
forces. Is

06:28.688 --> 06:31.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Putin believed to be
serious about
this?

06:31.224 --> 06:34.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HODGE, The Wall Street
Journal: Well
there, didn't seem to be much
evidence, according

06:34.394 --> 06:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the U.S. officials that we
had spoken to,
that Russians were ever planning
to stay for

06:39.065 --> 06:40.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the long haul.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this announcement certainly
comes as a
surprise, as much of a surprise
in many ways

06:44.938 --> 06:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Russia's decision to commence
this military
operation back at the end of
September, although

06:51.378 --> 06:55.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was preceded by a speech that
President
Putin delivered at the U.N.
where he said

06:55.382 --> 06:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Russia wanted to create an
alliance against
terrorism.

06:59.452 --> 07:04.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's cast this campaign as
supporting
the Assad regime as the best
bulwark against

07:05.025 --> 07:07.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Islamic State and other
extremist groups.

07:07.827 --> 07:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what is it
exactly that
it's believed Putin's forces
have accomplished

07:13.166 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria? Because, as you said,
I mean, he
said this was intended to go
after terrorists,

07:17.904 --> 07:23.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we know that civilians,
Syrian civilians
have been targeted. Hundreds, if
not thousands

07:23.376 --> 07:25.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of them have been killed.

07:25.445 --> 07:30.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HODGE: Right, and there
have been accusations
leveled against the Russians of
the indiscriminate

07:30.817 --> 07:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use of force and the use of
weaponry that
has displaced lots of people and
caused civilian

07:37.957 --> 07:43.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harm, allegations, of course,
that the Russians
have pushed back quite hard
against.

07:43.096 --> 07:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what this actually the
campaign did, in
many ways, the introduction of
Russian airpower

07:48.601 --> 07:55.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in many ways reversed the
momentum. Back last
summer, even President Assad had
conceded

07:55.575 --> 08:00.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he was having a difficult
time, because
of defections, holding ground in
Syria.

08:00.814 --> 08:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this, in many ways, they have
-- it's hard
to say if this is really Putin's
mission accomplished

08:06.653 --> 08:12.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
moment yet, but they did
succeed, Russian
airpower did succeed in changing
the momentum

08:12.058 --> 08:18.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the ground in Syria. And in
recent weeks,
they have been pressing a very
strong offensive

08:18.498 --> 08:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the north of the country.

08:20.300 --> 08:24.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is this
pullout, what
effect is it expected to have on
the course

08:24.771 --> 08:26.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the war there?

08:26.506 --> 08:32.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HODGE: Well, what Syrian
opposition
groups are telling us is, we're
waiting to

08:32.145 --> 08:34.114 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see.

08:34.147 --> 08:37.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doesn't necessarily mean that
Putin is withdrawing
all of his support entirely.
Putin's spokesman

08:37.851 --> 08:43.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that Russia intends to
actually keep
the base or keep bases in Syria.
But what

08:43.156 --> 08:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does seem to be happening is
that maybe Russia
could be exerting a little bit
more pressure

08:47.293 --> 08:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Bashar al-Assad to negotiate
in earnest.

08:51.231 --> 08:57.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, once again, Putin has
managed to insert
himself quite forcefully into
global affairs

08:57.237 --> 08:59.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and in many ways set the agenda
here.

08:59.639 --> 09:03.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nathan Hodge of
The Wall Street
Journal reporting from Moscow,
we thank you.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NATHAN HODGE: Thank you.

09:05.779 --> 09:10.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also today, Turkey
struck back
at Kurdish rebel groups they
believe were

09:10.517 --> 09:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsible for yesterday's
deadly suicide
bombing in Ankara. Authorities
detained 11

09:15.789 --> 09:21.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, and Turkish warplanes
pounded Kurdish
military sites in Northern Iraq.
Sunday's

09:21.194 --> 09:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blast rocked a busy thoroughfare
in the capital,
killing 37 people and wounding
more than 100.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Turkey's prime minister
pledged further
retaliation.

09:30.937 --> 09:36.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMET DAVUTOGLU, Turkish Prime
Minister (through
translator): I am calling on
terrorist organizations

09:36.342 --> 09:41.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the forces behind them. You
cannot weaken
our will. Last night, after this
incident,

09:41.414 --> 09:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our armed forces carried out
comprehensive
operations. Our fight against
these terrorist

09:45.752 --> 09:47.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organizations continue with
resolve.

09:47.987 --> 09:52.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Yesterday's attack
comes just
one month after another suicide
bombing targeted

09:52.992 --> 09:58.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ankara, killing 29 people.
Kurdish rebels
claimed responsibility for that
blast.

JUDY WOODRUFF: An Amtrak
passenger train derailed
early this morning in rural
Southwestern Kansas,

10:04.537 --> 10:09.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
injuring 32 people. None of
their wounds were
life-threatening. A government
official told

10:09.642 --> 10:15.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Associated Press the train's
engineer
noticed a bend in the rail and
hit the emergency

10:15.381 --> 10:20.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brakes shortly before it went
off the tracks.
Emergency crews rushed to rescue
the more

10:20.887 --> 10:23.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than 140 people on board.

10:23.056 --> 10:26.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REX BEEMER, Gray County
Assistant Emergency
Manager: Upon arrival, we found
Amtrak had

10:26.626 --> 10:34.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overturned about 2.5 miles west
of Cimarron.
We have about seven cars that
are laying on

10:34.267 --> 10:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their sides. We have taken and
evacuated all
the patients and personnel out
of the train

10:41.441 --> 10:43.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at this time.

10:43.243 --> 10:47.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Federal
investigators are on
the scene to try to determine
the cause of

10:47.046 --> 10:51.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the derailment. The county's
sheriff said
they're looking into whether an
earlier unreported

10:52.018 --> 10:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vehicle accident could have
damaged the rails.

10:54.721 --> 10:59.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Southern states
braced for a new
round of flooding today that
threatened to

10:59.225 --> 11:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
damage hundreds more homes.
Officials warned
the swollen Pearl River along
the Louisiana

11:05.398 --> 11:11.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Mississippi border could
reach 21 feet,
the highest level in over three
decades.

11:11.337 --> 11:16.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since last week, the flooding
has killed four
people, and damaged nearly 5,000
homes in

11:16.209 --> 11:22.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Louisiana. President Obama
signed a disaster
declaration for the state
yesterday.

11:22.081 --> 11:26.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stocks finished flat on Wall
Street today,
as investors awaited the outcome
of the Federal

11:26.319 --> 11:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reserve's meeting later this
week. The Dow
Jones industrial average gained
nearly 16

11:31.624 --> 11:38.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points to close at 17229. The
Nasdaq rose
almost two points, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped

11:38.698 --> 11:40.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
two.

11:40.533 --> 11:44.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
John Kasich tries to thwart
Donald Trump in

11:44.737 --> 11:51.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ohio, and why Florida could be a
big win or
bust for Marco Rubio; the head
of the U.N.

11:52.011 --> 11:57.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Refugee Agency, as Syria marks
five years
into its civil war; plus, we
launch a new

11:57.550 --> 12:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
series exploring Americans'
views on the economy.

12:07.660 --> 12:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
series exploring Americans'
views on the economy.

12:14.167 --> 12:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow is an important day for
the presidential
race in both parties, with
primaries being

12:18.705 --> 12:24.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
held in five major states. One
of the biggest
prizes is Ohio. No Republican
has won the

12:24.644 --> 12:27.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House without winning the
Buckeye State.

12:27.547 --> 12:33.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this year, it's taken on
heightened importance
in the effort to derail Donald
Trump's path

12:33.186 --> 12:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the Republican nomination.

12:35.154 --> 12:38.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" correspondent John
Yang reports
from Ohio.

12:38.524 --> 12:45.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As Ohio Governor John
Kasich and
Donald Trump crisscrossed the
Buckeye State,

12:45.431 --> 12:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaigning for tomorrow's
primary:

12:47.333 --> 12:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Oh, I love Ohio.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
It's about time we had an Ohioan
become president

12:52.238 --> 12:54.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the United States. It's been
far too long.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

12:56.342 --> 12:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: More is at stake than
just 66 delegates
in this winner-take-all contest.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. JOHN KASICH: Look, I'm
going to win in
Ohio.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We really want to
win Ohio.

13:03.549 --> 13:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ohio Republicans say
they're battling
for nothing less than their
party's future.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: They don't like
liars.

13:09.956 --> 13:14.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And the two men's
styles couldn't
be more different.

13:14.394 --> 13:19.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. JOHN KASICH: So, we will
fix these things
when we remember that we're
Americans and

13:19.065 --> 13:26.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not Republicans and Democrats
first, but Americans
first, and work together and
lift this country.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will fix this.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

13:31.277 --> 13:40.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
build the wall,
folks. Don't worry about it.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

13:41.154 --> 13:41.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Who's going to pay
for the wall?

13:41.654 --> 13:42.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: Mexico!

13:42.155 --> 13:42.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Who?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: Mexico!

13:44.490 --> 13:46.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And it goes beyond
style. Party
leaders fear Trump isn't a real
conservative,

13:46.259 --> 13:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says Paul Beck, a political
scientist at Ohio
State University.

13:49.696 --> 13:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL BECK, Ohio State
University: That is
what is scaring Republican
leaders maybe more

13:53.499 --> 14:00.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than anything is that, if Trump
gets the nomination
and if he wins the presidency,
he redefines

14:00.273 --> 14:05.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the party, and he moves the
party away from
what it has been for almost
forever.

14:05.478 --> 14:09.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's why the state
party is throwing
its full weight behind Kasich.

14:09.515 --> 14:13.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: I'm a volunteer for
Governor Kasich's
presidential campaign. How are
you this evening?

14:13.286 --> 14:17.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A popular second-term
governor
and former nine-term
congressman.

14:17.457 --> 14:21.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: We will protect our
favorite son for
the White House in 2016.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

14:23.196 --> 14:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Franklin County
Auditor Clarence
Mingo said he wouldn't support
Trump as his

14:27.600 --> 14:29.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
party's nominee.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLARENCE MINGO, Franklin County
Auditor: It's
a national embarrassment to have
a gentleman

14:31.304 --> 14:35.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has insulted the disabled,
the war record
of an American hero like John
McCain, insulted

14:35.875 --> 14:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minorities. It's not acceptable.
It's un-American.
And I fear that, long term, the
nation and

14:41.013 --> 14:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the party will pay the price for
this conduct.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Matt Borges is the
state party's
chairman.

14:45.651 --> 14:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT BORGES, Ohio Republican
Party Chairman:
Everyone knows you can't get a
Republican

14:48.688 --> 14:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elected to the White House
without carrying
Ohio. And the candidate who
gives us the best

14:52.024 --> 14:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chance to get Ohio of course is
John Kasich.
So, maybe it isn't so much about
stopping

14:56.229 --> 15:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump as it is about
making sure we
select the right nominee, and
that person

15:00.967 --> 15:04.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should be John Kasich.

15:04.403 --> 15:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But that's not what
voters said
at a Trump rally this weekend in
Dayton.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, what brings you out today?

15:12.912 --> 15:15.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BRENDA HARDESTY, Trump
Supporter: I want to
see this man. He's the man.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Is he your man for
Tuesday?

15:18.017 --> 15:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRENDA HARDESTY: He is my man.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Take Brenda Hardesty.

15:21.320 --> 15:28.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRENDA HARDESTY: I am a
Democrat, but I have
flipped this year because there
is nobody

15:28.661 --> 15:39.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on that side. And Trump, he's
just -- I don't
know. He's our future, you know?
He's just

15:39.438 --> 15:40.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our future.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Loretta Brown
volunteered at the
event.

15:42.708 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA BROWN, Trump Volunteer:
We are financially
sick, and this is the doctor
that's going

15:47.747 --> 15:51.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make it well. That's what
America needs.
That's what the people need.
They need their

15:51.684 --> 15:57.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs back, and, financially, the
country needs
his help.

15:57.657 --> 16:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Even waiting in line
at a Kasich
event in Moraine, undecided
voter Judy Harleman

16:03.496 --> 16:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says he's a good governor, but
she may vote
for Trump anyway.

16:06.866 --> 16:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY HARLEMAN, Ohio Voter: He's
a businessman,
and I think that's what
Washington needs now.

16:13.673 --> 16:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is just too much going on
that's not
right, right now.

16:19.345 --> 16:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Others say they
prefer Kasich's
temperament and experience. Bill
Reridan is

16:24.517 --> 16:26.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a retired engineer.

16:26.319 --> 16:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL RERIDAN, Kasich Supporter:
He's willing
to stand up for his own beliefs
and is not,

16:34.460 --> 16:39.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, trying to make a big
thing out of
it, but he's telling the truth
and he's done

16:39.599 --> 16:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a good job in Ohio.

16:40.867 --> 16:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What gave him the
edge over Trump,
in your mind?

16:44.170 --> 16:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL RERIDAN: Just because he's
level-headed
and has good common sense.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This will be the
first time Ryan
Ritchey votes for president.

16:52.712 --> 16:58.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RYAN RITCHEY, Kasich Supporter:
Trump has
gone at this very
unprofessionally. The presidency

16:58.684 --> 17:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is something that should be
taken very seriously.
It's not something that you can
just walk

17:04.290 --> 17:08.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into, not something you can
insult your way
to. And John Kasich is the only
adult left

17:08.728 --> 17:09.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this race.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: And tonight's rally will be
postponed.

17:11.497 --> 17:16.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On Friday, violence
erupted after
Trump canceled a planned rally
in Chicago.

17:16.535 --> 17:20.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kasich, who hadn't engaged
Trump, scolded
the businessman.

17:20.606 --> 17:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. JOHN KASICH: Donald Trump
has created
a toxic environment. There is no
place for

17:26.512 --> 17:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a national leader to prey on the
fears of
people who live in our great
country.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump says Kasich
isn't strong
enough.

17:34.587 --> 17:40.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Kasich is a baby.
He's a baby.
He can't be president. He can't
be president.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Too many problems.

17:42.261 --> 17:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Voters have already
been casting
ballots for nearly a month, even
as the governor

17:45.932 --> 17:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the billionaire intensify
their battle
over the airwaves.

17:49.035 --> 17:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Kasich gave Ohio
Obamacare and increased
our budget more than any
governor in the U.S.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't need him in Ohio and we
certainly
don't need him in Washington.

17:57.843 --> 18:03.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: As polls showed Donald
Trump leading
Ohio, he attacked our John
Kasich with unhinged,

18:03.849 --> 18:04.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bold-faced lies.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And at the
grassroots.

18:07.720 --> 18:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Hi. We're stopping by on
behalf of
my brother, John Kasich.

18:11.991 --> 18:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Hi. Hello. My name is
Christina and
I'm with the Trump campaign.

18:16.662 --> 18:21.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Party leaders'
concerns go beyond
the primary. Some worry that
Trump at the

18:21.567 --> 18:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top of the ticket could hurt
Republican candidates
all the way down the ballot.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ROB PORTMAN (R), Ohio: He's
done a great
job for us as governor and he
deserves to

18:28.240 --> 18:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be president of the United
States.

18:30.042 --> 18:33.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Like Senator Rob
Portman, who's
been at Kasich's side on the
campaign trail.

18:33.713 --> 18:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ROB PORTMAN: If there are a
number of
Ohio Republicans, people who
would otherwise

18:37.950 --> 18:44.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
vote Republican almost
automatically, who
say I just cannot stomach this
ticket with

18:44.690 --> 18:49.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump at the top, I can't
vote Democratic,
that would be a violation of
everything I

18:49.829 --> 18:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe in, and so I'm just not
going to turn
out, and it, I think, is a
legitimate worry.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: With so much at
stake...

18:57.703 --> 19:01.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Are we going to
win Ohio?

19:01.741 --> 19:02.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

19:02.808 --> 19:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: ... Trump's path to
the nomination...

19:04.343 --> 19:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. JOHN KASICH: So, now we're
here. Please
don't screw this up for me. OK?

19:05.778 --> 19:07.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:07.813 --> 19:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: ... the survival of
Kasich's campaign
and the future of Republican
Party, Ohio Republicans'

19:12.418 --> 19:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hopes for a Kasich win tomorrow
are more than
just a matter of Buckeye pride.

19:21.160 --> 19:25.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Kasich now acknowledges
that if he loses
his home state tomorrow, it's
probably the

19:25.631 --> 19:31.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end of the road for him, or, as
he puts it,
he stays home. A Trump loss here
in Ohio would

19:31.370 --> 19:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complicate his drive for a first
ballot nomination,
but not necessarily end it.

19:36.942 --> 19:42.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Judy, it would probably
certainly put
visions of a brokered convention
dancing in

19:42.248 --> 19:44.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the anti-Trump forces' heads --
Judy.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hmm.

19:46.285 --> 19:51.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, hi, John. So, tell us,
there's also a
serious race going on between
the Democrats

19:51.490 --> 19:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Ohio, Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders.
Tell us a little bit about that
looks like.

19:56.128 --> 20:01.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, the Bernie
Sanders campaign
really hopes tomorrow that they
can show that

20:01.567 --> 20:07.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan was not a fluke. They
have high hopes
for Ohio. When they look at
Ohio, they see

20:07.306 --> 20:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of the things that helped
them in Michigan,
industrial manufacturing jobs
that have gone

20:12.711 --> 20:15.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
overseas, a slow recovery.

20:15.247 --> 20:22.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ohio only got back to their
pre-recession
employment level in October,
much later than

20:22.455 --> 20:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of other states. So,
Sanders is hitting
hard on the trade issue, both in
speeches

20:27.993 --> 20:33.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and in rallies and on
television. This morning,
he added a stop in Youngstown, a
place where

20:33.332 --> 20:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the steel industry used to be
big, but no
more.

20:37.269 --> 20:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also see Ohio as a home to
a lot of little
college towns across the state,
which would

20:43.109 --> 20:47.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play to his strength with young
people. For
their part, the Clinton campaign
says only

20:47.847 --> 20:53.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they expect a close race
tomorrow, but
they had been talking about
being here today.

20:53.652 --> 20:58.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They did not. They were not.
They were in
Illinois and North Carolina
instead, and tomorrow

20:58.591 --> 21:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, to watch the election
returns, they
will be not here, but in Florida
-- Judy.

21:03.629 --> 21:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, just
quickly, what
about television advertising?

21:07.600 --> 21:10.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that playing much of a role
on the Democratic
side?

21:10.402 --> 21:17.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It is -- I mean, just
like last
time, Ohio is blanketed with
television ads.

21:17.042 --> 21:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard to watch television
and not see
even the same Sanders ad or
Clinton ad repeating.

21:23.883 --> 21:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lot of people here say
that it is so
saturated that it becomes
background noise,

21:28.921 --> 21:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it may not really be having
an effect
-- Judy.

21:31.690 --> 21:35.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Yang
reporting for us
from Ohio, and you will be there
tomorrow

21:35.895 --> 21:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when they're voting. Thanks.

21:37.796 --> 21:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ohio is key, but
votes in Florida,
Illinois, Missouri and North
Carolina could

21:44.336 --> 21:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also determine the future of the
race for
Democrats and Republicans.

21:48.741 --> 21:53.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we turn to Politics
Monday, with
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report and

21:53.812 --> 21:58.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Stuart Rothenberg of The
Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales
Political Report.

21:58.584 --> 21:59.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

21:59.285 --> 22:00.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Amy, I want to start with you.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For every candidate not named
Trump, how critical
is tomorrow?

22:04.523 --> 22:06.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Very
critical.

22:07.026 --> 22:11.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, Trump is -- it is
important as
well. But I think there are two
people whose

22:11.096 --> 22:16.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future begins or ends tomorrow.
One of those
is Marco Rubio, who's been
hunkering down

22:16.802 --> 22:21.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Florida, hoping that maybe
that those polls
showing him down double digits
are wrong and

22:21.340 --> 22:28.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things can turn around in the
last few hours
here before voting begins. Sort
of doubtful.

22:28.414 --> 22:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he loses his home state, he
doesn't move
on. John Kasich, of course, as
we just learned

22:33.285 --> 22:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the piece before this,
counting on Ohio
to deliver him the home state.
However, that

22:37.890 --> 22:42.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't mean that John Kasich is
in the hunt
for the nomination. All it means
is that he

22:42.361 --> 22:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
denied Donald Trump the ability
to sort of
run away with the day and amass
enough delegates

22:48.167 --> 22:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to stay on the path to winning
the 1,237 delegates
he would need to be the outright
nominee before

22:55.608 --> 23:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we hit the Cleveland, before we
hit the Cleveland
Republican Convention.

23:00.512 --> 23:08.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich would still be a spoiler,
in other
words, splitting up the votes
once again between

23:08.787 --> 23:13.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump and the non-Trump, and
probably
leading us to what could be a
contested convention.

23:13.826 --> 23:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Stu, for a
while, it was Marco
Rubio as a non-Trump and now
it's John Kasich?

23:18.163 --> 23:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Editor and
Publisher, The
Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales Political
Report: Well,

23:19.999 --> 23:22.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's what it looks like,
because Rubio seems
to be floundering in the polls
in his own

23:22.701 --> 23:24.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state and other states.

23:24.637 --> 23:29.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somehow, the air went out of the
balloon pretty
quickly for Marco Rubio, and now
all the attention

23:29.441 --> 23:34.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is on John Kasich. Amy is right.
And it's
really sort of funny. This is --
Kasich has

23:34.914 --> 23:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not put together a national
campaign for the
Republican nomination.

23:39.084 --> 23:43.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's fought in a couple of
states. Michigan,
he came in narrowly in third.
And it's almost

23:43.322 --> 23:47.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as if, if he wins Ohio, it's
almost as if
he's the favorite son. And
there's a question

23:47.526 --> 23:50.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as to whether he can broaden his
appeal beyond
that.

23:50.729 --> 23:55.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the Kasich people
will say, we're
the only game in town. We're the
only establishment

23:55.401 --> 23:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
game in town. Even though John
Kasich says
he's not establishment, that is
who backing

23:59.605 --> 24:00.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

24:00.172 --> 24:00.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Let's say...

24:00.572 --> 24:01.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:01.140 --> 24:01.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Sure.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: ... at this point.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Amy, aside from Ohio and
Florida, which we
have heard so much about, we're
also seeing

24:05.811 --> 24:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primaries tomorrow in Illinois,
North Carolina
and Missouri.

24:09.048 --> 24:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, and for the two
parties,
you have very different
scenarios playing

24:15.587 --> 24:17.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out here.

24:17.423 --> 24:20.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing I want to point
out is, Ted
Cruz is still in this race on
the Republican

24:20.192 --> 24:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side, and he actually has won
more votes and
more delegates than John Kasich
or Marco Rubio.

24:26.131 --> 24:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he's likely to stay in this
race as well
regardless of where the results
are.

24:31.036 --> 24:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He may be able to pick up a win
and pick up
some delegates in Missouri. He's
also looking

24:37.743 --> 24:43.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to pick up delegates in
Illinois. The question
of whether Trump goes is not
just Ohio and

24:43.382 --> 24:48.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Florida, whether he can sweep
those two states,
but whether he does well enough
in Ohio -- I'm

24:48.220 --> 24:52.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
sorry -- in Missouri and
Illinois that he
can pick up enough delegates.

24:52.458 --> 24:56.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because of the way that they
proportion out
their delegates there, he could
actually get

24:56.829 --> 25:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a big lead even while he loses
Ohio narrowly
to John Kasich. So, the math
will be very

25:02.334 --> 25:04.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
important to watch.

25:04.103 --> 25:09.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, we're
watching for
almost a rerun of what we saw on
the -- in

25:09.842 --> 25:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan, which is Bernie
Sanders likely to
do well Ohio, Illinois and
Missouri, Hillary

25:16.915 --> 25:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton likely to do well in
Florida and North
Carolina.

25:20.452 --> 25:25.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The challenge for Bernie Sanders
is that coming
close or winning narrowly isn't
enough for

25:25.224 --> 25:30.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him. He needs now to win at
least 55 percent
of all the delegates going
forward in order

25:30.462 --> 25:32.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have a chance to catch up
with her.

25:32.264 --> 25:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, is this one of
those cases
-- I guess on both sides -- in
which, Stu,

25:35.901 --> 25:39.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can win or you can lose and
you can still
keep winning? Does that make
sense? If you're

25:39.738 --> 25:44.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, you can lose
and you can
still get enough delegates that
he can't catch

25:44.576 --> 25:45.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

25:45.444 --> 25:47.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Right. Right,
exactly.

25:47.246 --> 25:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has this -- she has an
advantage right
now of 200 in terms of pledged
delegates that

25:52.050 --> 26:00.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she won, but she has another
over 400 superdelegate
advantage. And, as Amy said,
each of these

26:00.092 --> 26:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states is a little different.
And states with
large -- basically, the red
states, Secretary

26:07.699 --> 26:11.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton does really well in the
Republican
states. In the Democratic
states, she doesn't

26:11.069 --> 26:12.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do so well.

26:13.005 --> 26:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's a tradeoff. In that
Michigan-Mississippi
contest, she lost Michigan, but
she won all

26:17.509 --> 26:22.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
those delegates from
Mississippi, and she
ended up winning, even though
all the attention

26:22.548 --> 26:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was on how she lost Michigan.

26:24.383 --> 26:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
down-ballot
consequences, because this is
not just about

26:28.387 --> 26:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the presidential race. Everyone
-- people
who are sitting in the Senate
and even the

26:31.723 --> 26:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House are watching this all play
out very
carefully, Amy.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

26:38.096 --> 26:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're talking about a state
like Ohio.
Rob Portman, the freshman
Republican senator

26:43.168 --> 26:49.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elected in 2010 rather easily,
up for reelection
this year, he's already in a
very close race

26:49.441 --> 26:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the former governor,
Democratic governor
of this state.

26:53.245 --> 26:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With somebody like Trump on the
top of the
ticket who is as polarizing as
he is, it is

26:57.783 --> 27:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be very tough for Rob
Portman not
to get pulled under by the Trump
phenomenon,

27:04.990 --> 27:09.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not in a good way. I think
he will be
a weight on many Republicans
running in these

27:09.795 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
swing states, pulling them down.

27:12.097 --> 27:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You could even see that as the
House level,
too. It is very hard for me to
believe that,

27:16.869 --> 27:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Donald Trump as the top of
the ticket,
that Republicans could hold the
Senate. They'd

27:21.440 --> 27:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely lose the Senate. The only
question
is how many seats they lose.

27:24.743 --> 27:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But that said, Stu,
all of the
talk, all the chatter this
weekend about violence

27:29.314 --> 27:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Trump events, it's not really
losing Trump
any support at the top.

27:34.219 --> 27:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: There is no
evidence of
that yet.

27:36.855 --> 27:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, Trump supporters were
attracted to him
very early. They locked in, and
their whole

27:42.594 --> 27:47.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world view is his world view. It
basically
is a sense that he's fighting
against the

27:47.199 --> 27:51.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
media, the political
establishment. So, of
course, when they attack him,
when they portray

27:51.570 --> 27:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him as inciting violence,
they're just trying
to destroy him.

27:55.407 --> 27:58.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so his supporters, I think,
are pretty
solid. Now, I don't think he's
going to lose

27:58.710 --> 28:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support there. Now, it may limit
his ability
to broaden support at any point,
but I don't

28:04.883 --> 28:06.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think it's shaken up the race
dramatically.

28:06.718 --> 28:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask you
both, finally,
what are you chances here on
Super Tuesday

28:10.956 --> 28:16.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
III eve, or whatever we're
calling this? What
is your guess about the chances
of this leading

28:16.662 --> 28:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to a contested convention, Amy?

28:19.197 --> 28:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Gosh, you put me on
the spot here.

28:22.768 --> 28:23.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

28:23.468 --> 28:24.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:24.603 --> 28:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Let's see. Why do
you do that,
Gwen?

28:25.971 --> 28:26.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:26.405 --> 28:28.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: OK.

28:28.206 --> 28:31.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that -- I think Kasich
can win Ohio
tomorrow. To me, I'm going to
look at the

28:31.743 --> 28:35.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
margins coming out of Ohio and
Illinois before
I give you an answer. But I
think we could

28:35.714 --> 28:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be looking at a contested
convention, especially
if Ted Cruz also runs well. Stu
is totally

28:42.087 --> 28:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right. The Trump vote is not
moving. It's
a question of where the rest of
the vote goes.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Stu?

28:47.092 --> 28:47.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I don't know,
Gwen.

28:48.026 --> 28:49.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:49.294 --> 28:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I would say
that I agree
with Amy that...

28:51.964 --> 28:53.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

28:53.465 --> 28:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, I think
Trump's going
to have a really good day.

28:56.068 --> 29:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, can he win
enough and how
close does he get? Is he going
to get 1,237?

29:01.540 --> 29:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure he's going to be
there, but he
may be within spitting distance,
and they

29:05.110 --> 29:07.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may not be able to deny him the
nomination.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK. Well, we will be
checking
in with both of you on that.

29:09.881 --> 29:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report, Stu
Rothenberg of The Rothenberg &amp;
Gonzales Political

29:14.119 --> 29:15.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Report, thank you both very
much.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Thanks, Gwen.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

29:18.023 --> 29:22.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: We have more
politics coverage
online, including a story about
which GOP

29:22.260 --> 29:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates have benefited the
most from lobbyists.
There's a breakdown at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

29:30.402 --> 29:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow marks
five years since
Syria's brutal civil war began,
killing hundreds

29:44.249 --> 29:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of thousands and displacing
millions more.

29:47.519 --> 29:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The humanitarian situation
remains the most
dire since the Second World War,
as halting

29:53.558 --> 29:56.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
peace talks toward a resolution
begin again.

29:56.528 --> 30:00.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner begins our coverage.

30:00.599 --> 30:07.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Huddled
together, hand in
hand, hundreds of migrants
streamed out of

30:07.039 --> 30:13.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a camp in Northern Greece today.
They trudged
along muddy trails and forded
surging rivers

30:13.812 --> 30:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in search of a break in the
border fence.

30:15.981 --> 30:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We hope we can cross
because we are a
lot of people. Our number is big
now.

30:21.753 --> 30:26.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: They're fleeing
the overcrowded,
rain-soaked Idomeni camp, where
they have

30:26.992 --> 30:32.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been stranded since its northern
neighbor
Macedonia closed its border to
refugees last

30:32.264 --> 30:36.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week. Many are Syrians fleeing
the war in
at home.

30:36.435 --> 30:41.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva today, the first round
of United
Nations-brokered peace talks
aimed at ending

30:41.139 --> 30:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that conflict got under way, as
U.N. special
envoy to Syria, Staffan de
Mistura, hosted

30:47.579 --> 30:49.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Syria's ambassador to the U.N.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: We believe that
we should

30:51.750 --> 30:58.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have at least a clear road map.
I'm not saying
an agreement, but a clear road
map, because

30:58.423 --> 31:02.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's what Syria is expecting
from all of
us.

31:02.260 --> 31:11.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as I know, the only plan
B available
is return to war, and to even
worse war than

31:11.169 --> 31:12.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we had so far.

31:13.004 --> 31:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The start of
talks come as
a tenuous cessation of
hostilities in Syria

31:17.676 --> 31:19.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entered its third week.

31:19.811 --> 31:26.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, five years since the
conflict began,
UNICEF painted a dire picture
for the country's

31:26.184 --> 31:32.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children. One in three Syrian
children has
been born since the war broke
out. And 8.4

31:32.858 --> 31:38.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million, or nearly 80 percent of
Syrian children,
are affected by the violence,
either within

31:38.964 --> 31:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country or as refugees
elsewhere.

31:41.933 --> 31:48.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the U.N. Refugee
Agency, UNHCR,
reported that 46 percent of the
more than

31:48.673 --> 31:57.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
150,000 refugees inundating
Europe this year
came from Syria. Those numbers
outpace last

31:57.582 --> 32:02.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year's, when a record one
million people fled
to Europe.

32:02.754 --> 32:07.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many make the perilous sea
crossing from Turkey
to Greece, but now, because
Balkan borders

32:07.859 --> 32:13.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are blocked, thousands are
stranded in Greece.
At an E.U. summit last week,
Turkish Prime

32:13.865 --> 32:19.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister Ahmet Davutoglu offered
to take back
huge numbers of migrants in
exchange for $3

32:19.971 --> 32:24.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
billion in aid and progress on
Turkey's joining
the European Union.

32:24.743 --> 32:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The E.U. summit with Turkey
resumes later
this week, but the U.N. Refugee
Agency has

32:30.215 --> 32:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strongly objected to the deal,
saying it would
violate the European Human
Rights Convention.

32:36.054 --> 32:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's where Jeffrey Brown picks
up the story.

32:38.223 --> 32:43.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And joining me is
the new head
of that agency, Filippo Grandi,
United Nations

32:43.161 --> 32:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
high commissioner for refugees.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI, UNITED NATIONS
HIGH COMMISSIONER
FOR REFUGEES: Thank you.

32:48.533 --> 32:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let's start with
that tentative
deal that Margaret was just
talking about

32:50.268 --> 32:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the E.U. and Turkey.
What is your
objection to having Turkey bring
back some

32:53.839 --> 32:55.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of those refugees?

32:55.040 --> 32:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: I think we
should put this
in context.

32:58.777 --> 33:04.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey is the country that hosts
the largest
number of Syrian refugees. We
have heard it

33:04.549 --> 33:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2.7 million. In fact, it's the
countries that
host the largest numbers number
of refugees

33:09.921 --> 33:13.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worldwide, all kinds of
refugees.

33:13.291 --> 33:20.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have always promoted the
idea that
the responsibility of hosting
Syrian refugees

33:20.098 --> 33:25.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be shared more widely.
Many of them
have reached Europe together
with refugees

33:25.737 --> 33:32.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of other countries, and we have
always encouraged
Europe to manage that flow in an
orderly way.

33:32.344 --> 33:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, this wasn't done.
Chaos has
followed. What we see in Greece
today is very

33:39.417 --> 33:46.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worried. Europe is reacting in
an emergency
manner and is now proposing to
-- is now discussing

33:46.625 --> 33:51.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Turkey the possibility of
sending back
to Turkey some of these people.
Now, what

33:51.229 --> 33:52.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we're seeing...

33:52.764 --> 33:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Would that not
create more
of an order -- orderly passage?

33:55.166 --> 33:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Well, first of
all, it needs
to be done, and if it is done,
it is called

33:59.537 --> 34:03.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
technically readmission of
refugees from one
country to the other.

34:03.475 --> 34:09.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It needs to be done in a manner
that respects
the human rights, the rights of
these refugees.

34:09.314 --> 34:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we're saying to Europe,
what we're
advising Europe, if it is done,
it needs to

34:13.585 --> 34:21.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be done in a manner that fully,
fully ensures
the guarantees for the people
that go back

34:21.927 --> 34:24.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that their protection and their
rights are
observed.

34:24.696 --> 34:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Speaking of
Turkey and other
countries that border Syria,
where there are

34:28.667 --> 34:34.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many refugees, and so many
financial precious
on these countries -- now, you
have had a

34:34.205 --> 34:39.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of pledges of money. Do they
get -- do
they have the resources to
handle the refugees

34:39.744 --> 34:43.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have? Or is the money
coming through
that you need?

34:43.415 --> 34:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: There was a
conference in
London at the beginning of
February in which

34:48.320 --> 34:56.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$11 billion were pledged to
support refugees
and hosting communities and host
countries

34:56.561 --> 34:58.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the region.

34:58.596 --> 35:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of that money has been paid
and -- pledged
and paid, but we haven't got the
full picture

35:05.637 --> 35:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yet. What we are telling donor
governments
is that those pledges need to be
expedited,

35:11.543 --> 35:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, for people on the
ground, results
have to be tangible and visible.
Otherwise,

35:16.648 --> 35:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the risk is that they will move
on and also
try to reach Europe.

35:19.684 --> 35:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When you look at
countries
in Europe closing their borders,
you look

35:24.422 --> 35:30.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at political trends, even this
weekend elections
in Germany, do you see the tide
turning against

35:30.929 --> 35:32.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
refugees in Europe?

35:32.597 --> 35:38.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FILIPPO GRANDI: We see a
hardening of the
position of certain governments
in respect

35:38.670 --> 35:40.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of receiving refugees.

35:40.872 --> 35:47.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we are, of course, telling
Europe is
that the responsibility to take
care of refugees

35:47.846 --> 35:53.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be shared globally. This
is -- Syria
has shown that this cannot be
any more the

35:53.184 --> 35:59.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsibility of two, three
countries bordering
the country at war, Syria in
this case, but

35:59.791 --> 36:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has to be shared more widely,
including by
Europe.

36:02.727 --> 36:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, thousands of
refugees now
stranded in Greece, right? What
should be

36:08.633 --> 36:12.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done for those? What is the
situation there?
How dire is it? And what should
be done for

36:12.904 --> 36:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
those people in the short term?

36:14.339 --> 36:16.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: The situation is
dire.

36:16.741 --> 36:22.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People were trying to move on
for Greece.
The northern border was closed,
so now about

36:22.180 --> 36:28.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
40,000 are stranded there, and
more are coming.
The important thing is to find
adequate sites

36:28.520 --> 36:34.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to host them temporarily until
solutions are
found, including, perhaps,
relocation through

36:35.026 --> 36:38.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe, a decision that Europe
made many months
ago, but which it didn't
implement.

36:38.963 --> 36:43.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, what do you
-- you were
talking earlier about donor
countries, the

36:43.968 --> 36:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pledges you have received. I
wonder about
the United States. What do you
want to see

36:48.106 --> 36:52.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come from the United States? Is
it more money?
Should the United States take in
more refugees?

36:52.877 --> 36:57.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: The United
States is the largest
donor country to refugee
programs.

36:58.016 --> 37:04.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's also the country that
takes the largest
number of resettled refugees
from old nationalities.

37:04.956 --> 37:10.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, the number of Syrians
that all
countries are taking through
resettlemento~

37:10.195 --> 37:15.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and other legal means of
transferring them
from one country to the other,
of course,

37:15.667 --> 37:21.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
those numbers are still
inadequate, compared
to the 4.7 million that are
hosted by the

37:21.172 --> 37:22.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
countries neighboring Syria.

37:23.007 --> 37:28.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, why is this
so tough to
crack? I mean, why does it seem
to get worse?

37:28.046 --> 37:34.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why is there intransigence from
governments
that keeps people in this
flight? And how

37:34.252 --> 37:35.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
long do you think the world has?

37:35.987 --> 37:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: I think there's
a mixture
of motives that have made
governments and

37:39.924 --> 37:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes public opinion more
resistant to
hosting refugees.

37:45.830 --> 37:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are economic reasons,
economic downturn.
There's security reasons, the
fear, the unjustified

37:53.204 --> 37:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fears that refugees bring
terror. Refugees
flee terror. They don't bring
terror to countries.

37:59.911 --> 38:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their arrival is very carefully
vetted, so
there should be no fear.

38:04.182 --> 38:09.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is an irrational fear,
which is,
in many countries, fueled by
political propaganda.

38:09.254 --> 38:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And Margaret's
piece was talking
about the potential prospects
for a peace

38:12.690 --> 38:14.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
settlement, but who knows,
right?

38:14.392 --> 38:19.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you expect, for the time
being, that the
flight of refugees will
continue?

38:19.130 --> 38:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Until there is
war, people
will try to flee.

38:22.233 --> 38:27.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is in human nature. People
are afraid
of bombs, of destruction and
want to go away.

38:27.805 --> 38:34.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is why what has happened in
Geneva today,
five years after the beginning
of the war,

38:34.112 --> 38:38.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the resumption of peace talks,
is so important.
It must succeed.

38:38.583 --> 38:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Filippo Grandi is
U.N. high
commissioner for refugees.

38:43.154 --> 38:48.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you so much.

38:48.993 --> 38:54.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Thank you.

38:54.832 --> 39:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the start of
a new election-year
series about the economic lives
of Americans,

39:03.208 --> 39:08.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the frustrations many face
trying to get ahead,
and the forces shaping the
economy.

39:09.013 --> 39:14.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In many way, the recovery seems
solid. The
unemployment rate is at its
lowest level since

39:14.652 --> 39:20.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the recession, and there's been
six consecutive
years of job growth. But many
Americans say

39:20.692 --> 39:22.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they don't feel it.

39:22.627 --> 39:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our new multimedia series will
explore why
and how economic forces are
affecting individuals,

39:28.600 --> 39:35.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a joint project of the
"NewsHour," Marketplace
and PBS' "Frontline." We're
titling it How

39:35.139 --> 39:36.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Deck Is Stacked.

39:36.874 --> 39:41.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kai Ryssdal is the host of
Marketplace. And
he will be working on this
series with us.

39:41.646 --> 39:47.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He joins us from Los Angeles
tonight to discuss
a new poll commissioned by
Marketplace looking

39:47.185 --> 39:48.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at these issues.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Kai, welcome.

39:49.954 --> 39:53.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You are going to be tackling
something we
have been trying to understand
for a long

39:53.157 --> 39:53.992 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL, Marketplace: Yes,
we are.

39:55.860 --> 39:59.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see people consistently rate
the economy
as the number one thing they're
worried about

39:59.564 --> 40:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country. It tops even
terrorism and
national security in most recent
polls from

40:03.968 --> 40:05.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other organizations.

40:05.803 --> 40:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we wanted to know why. What
is it about
people's individual economies
that makes them

40:10.275 --> 40:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, this is the most important
thing for
us?

40:12.310 --> 40:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we went out with Edison
Research, and
we said to people, 1,000 people
across the

40:15.880 --> 40:20.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, why? What is going on?
What are you
feeling in your own personal
economy? And

40:20.485 --> 40:22.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's what this poll is all
about.

40:22.253 --> 40:26.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you start
with some new
numbers that quantify people's
attitudes.

40:26.257 --> 40:31.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a percentage there I
found striking
who say they are sometimes or
frequently anxious

40:31.362 --> 40:33.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about their financial situation.

40:33.131 --> 40:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Two thirds of
people in this
country, 61 percent of people,
say they are

40:36.934 --> 40:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes or frequently anxious
about what's
going on in their lives.

40:40.672 --> 40:44.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a bunch of things,
right? It's
making car payments. It's their
jobs. It's

40:44.208 --> 40:47.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they see their future.
It's if they
have got enough saved for
retirement. They

40:47.945 --> 40:51.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not feeling the thing that
the numbers,
which you cited in the
beginning, tell them

40:52.016 --> 40:53.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they should feel.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jobs are up. We have added a
million jobs
in this economy since the last
time we went

40:56.621 --> 41:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out in the field in September,
and yet people
aren't feeling it. And that, to
me, is the

41:00.191 --> 41:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most interesting thing, that
what's going
on here is not being widely
shared down at

41:05.363 --> 41:07.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the middle and bottom ranges of
this economy.

41:07.231 --> 41:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Kai, you
also found that
the anxiety is higher among
African-Americans

41:12.337 --> 41:13.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and among Hispanics.

41:13.604 --> 41:15.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: Right.

41:15.573 --> 41:20.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're the ones who have not
saved for retirement.
They use payday loans more. They
see problems

41:20.745 --> 41:24.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with their inheritances. All of
these things
that the rest of us are feeling
sort of day

41:24.949 --> 41:28.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in and day out -- and I should
say, by the
way, that you have to separate
the wealthiest

41:28.519 --> 41:30.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of this economy from the
rest of it.
Right?

41:30.588 --> 41:34.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you get down below the 1
percent, the
5 percent, there is deep
economic stress,

41:34.926 --> 41:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and African-Americans and
Latinos are feeling
that more acutely than anybody.

41:38.363 --> 41:42.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, you asked a
specific question
about -- that I found
fascinating -- about

41:42.867 --> 41:45.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how people would handle an
unexpected expense.

41:45.903 --> 41:47.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: Right.

41:47.705 --> 41:53.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we asked people, if you had
an unexpected
expense of $1,000 today, right
now, would

41:53.745 --> 41:57.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you be able to handle it? And we
asked it
because you can get $1,000 like
that. You

41:57.949 --> 42:01.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a fender-bender, you trip
on a curb,
and there's a thousand bucks.

42:01.285 --> 42:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we said, would you be
able to make
that payment? Fifty-nine percent
of people

42:05.456 --> 42:09.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said they would have difficulty
making the
payment. And more importantly,
and really

42:09.093 --> 42:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more troubling, is that fully
half of that
group said they have nowhere to
turn for help.

42:14.465 --> 42:18.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't have a friend, they
don't have
a relative that could help them
out with $1,000.

42:18.536 --> 42:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you think about how
easy it is in
this economy today to turn
around and be hit

42:22.173 --> 42:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a $1,000 bill for some kind
of expense,
that's a big issue.

42:25.676 --> 42:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also got some
interesting
results when you asked people
about the role

42:29.914 --> 42:35.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they feel Washington has played
in all this,
how angry they are specifically
at the nation's

42:35.686 --> 42:36.554 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
capital.

42:36.587 --> 42:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: There is some
discontent.

42:38.423 --> 42:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, and there are some
racial and ethnic
crosscurrents in there that you
have to sort

42:41.993 --> 42:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of parse out. But -- and as you
see out on
the campaign trail today, nobody
is very happy

42:46.597 --> 42:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with it going -- what's going on
in Washington.
You see that in Democrats, and
you see it

42:50.134 --> 42:52.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Republicans. You see it in
independents.

42:52.236 --> 42:55.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are not satisfied with
what's going
on. But -- and this is also
really interesting

42:55.506 --> 42:59.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- there is great support for a
government
safety net. People want the
government. They

42:59.911 --> 43:01.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just don't want it the way it is
right now.

43:01.746 --> 43:05.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that one, I
know you are
going to keep trying to
understand.

43:05.616 --> 43:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But tell us a little bit,
finally, Kai, where
you are going to be going, what
parts of the

43:10.354 --> 43:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country and what kinds of
questions you are
going to be trying to
understand.

43:13.057 --> 43:14.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: Right.

43:14.826 --> 43:16.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what we're going to do is,
we're going
to go out with "Frontline" and
some folks

43:16.928 --> 43:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the "PBS NewsHour," and
we're going to
find the stories that tell the
people side

43:21.265 --> 43:23.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this thing, right?

43:23.201 --> 43:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will give you an example.
I was in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama, a number of months ago
working for

43:25.303 --> 43:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Marketplace story. And we met
a woman who
is a Ph.D. student in material
science at

43:31.342 --> 43:35.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the University of Alabama,
right? She's a
hard scientist. She is going to
get a job

43:35.279 --> 43:38.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this new economy no matter
what, right?

43:38.216 --> 43:44.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's working at a barbecue
joint in Tuscaloosa,
Alabama to make ends meet. She's
got $192,000

43:44.121 --> 43:47.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worth of debt. As I said, she's
going to get
a job once she gets her degree.

43:48.025 --> 43:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what she said -- I said, how
do you feel?
What's it like out there as you
think about

43:51.729 --> 43:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the future? And she said: "I'm
scared. I'm
scared."

43:55.800 --> 43:59.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we're going to find the
stories that
sort of pull that thread
through, why people

43:59.437 --> 44:03.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aren't feeling good about what,
according
to the numbers, is a rising
economy.

44:03.975 --> 44:08.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we are
looking forward
to the entire series, going to
be working

44:08.346 --> 44:11.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with you, talking to you
throughout the rest
of this election year and
beyond.

44:11.983 --> 44:13.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kai Ryssdal, thank you very
much.

44:13.784 --> 44:15.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: You bet.

44:15.620 --> 44:20.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we want to
hear more from
you about where we should go and
what issues

44:20.157 --> 44:22.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you feel should be part of our
series.

44:22.126 --> 44:26.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The series is funded in part by
the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting.

you will see
a place where you can give us
your feedback

44:30.501 --> 44:34.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on how the deck is stacked.

44:34.372 --> 44:43.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will be back in
just a moment.

44:43.247 --> 44:47.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take this time to
hear from your
local PBS station. It's a chance
to offer

44:47.985 --> 44:53.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps keep
programs like
ours on the air.

44:53.758 --> 44:56.394 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

44:56.427 --> 45:06.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And an update before
we go.

vote. King had been serving as
the department's

Duncan stepped

45:48.546 --> 45:58.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
