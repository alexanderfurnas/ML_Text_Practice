WEBVTT

00:05.906 --> 00:09.610
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is
away.

00:09.610 --> 00:14.615
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
President Obama leads a meeting
of more than 60 nations come

00:14.615 --> 00:21.255
together to counter violent
extremism and try to dismantle
the Islamic State.

00:21.255 --> 00:28.061
Then, Volkswagen plans a massive
recall of 11 million vehicles.
We talk to a lead researcher

00:28.061 --> 00:33.734
who helped discover that the
company rigged cars to pass
emissions tests.

00:33.734 --> 00:38.272
And a new play ripped from the
headlines. Anna Deavere Smith
explores race and justice

00:38.272 --> 00:40.607
on stage.

00:40.607 --> 00:43.911
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH,
Playwright/Actress: We have
retreated into a kind of
segregation.

00:43.911 --> 00:47.614
And some people would say that
it's a all part of this gap
between the rich and the

00:47.614 --> 00:48.782
poor.

00:48.782 --> 00:55.789
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:55.789 --> 01:00.427
(BREAK)

01:00.427 --> 01:09.569
JUDY WOODRUFF: Afghanistan's
military fought today to take
back a provincial capital, the

01:09.569 --> 01:14.141
first major city captured
by the Taliban in 14 years.

01:14.141 --> 01:20.113
The militants stormed Kunduz
yesterday, in a major setback to
the government. Today,

01:20.113 --> 01:24.985
Afghan troops and militiamen
launched a counteroffensive,
with U.S. air support, and a
promise of more

01:24.985 --> 01:29.389
help from President
Ashraf Ghani in Kabul.

01:29.389 --> 01:33.927
ASHRAF GHANI, President of
Afghanistan (through
translator): Afghan security
force made achievements

01:33.927 --> 01:38.765
today in Kunduz province. They
have recaptured some parts of
the government buildings. New

01:38.765 --> 01:41.234
reinforcements have reached
Kunduz and Baghlan, and a
battalion from the national army
will

01:41.234 --> 01:43.503
get to Kunduz soon.

01:43.503 --> 01:47.908
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Taliban
disputed those claims of
success, and later reports told

01:47.908 --> 01:52.512
of Taliban fighters attacking
the Kunduz Airport.

01:52.512 --> 01:57.551
In Yemen, medical officials
sharply increased the death toll
from an attack on a wedding

01:57.551 --> 02:05.192
party to 131. They blamed
airstrikes yesterday led by
Saudi Arabia against Shiite
rebels.

02:05.192 --> 02:10.764
The Saudis denied it, and blamed
ground fire from the rebels.
Video of the aftermath showed

02:10.764 --> 02:16.269
collapsed buildings and burned
wreckage, as onlookers gathered.
It was the deadliest incident

02:16.269 --> 02:20.540
yet in Yemen's civil war.

02:20.540 --> 02:25.779
President Obama and Cuba's
President Raul Castro met
privately today on the sidelines

02:25.779 --> 02:30.684
of the U.N. General Assembly in
New York. It's the second time
they have held face-to-face

02:30.684 --> 02:38.091
talks this year, as part of
normalizing ties. Cuba said
Castro pressed again to end the

02:38.091 --> 02:44.598
longstanding U.S. economic
embargo entirely. President
Obama favors that move, but
Republicans

02:44.598 --> 02:49.569
and some Democrats in the
U.S. Congress are opposed.

02:49.569 --> 02:54.808
The U.S. Senate worked today
toward a final vote to avert a
government shutdown. The
temporary

02:54.808 --> 03:00.280
measure would fund federal
operations through December 11.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell

03:00.280 --> 03:06.286
also called for a long-term deal
to cover the next two fiscal
years.

03:06.286 --> 03:11.358
Meanwhile, House Republicans
were meeting to discuss
strategy. California Congressman

03:11.358 --> 03:16.363
Kevin McCarthy is the favorite
to replace the retiring John
Boehner as speaker.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.331
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA),
House Majority Leader: I'm
concerned about making a
difference

03:18.331 --> 03:23.703
in everybody's lives. We want to
make sure that we're closer to
the people, that they

03:23.703 --> 03:28.341
feel this is their government,
they're in charge and we serve
them. Now, that's not

03:28.341 --> 03:31.878
easy and it won't change
overnight, but that's our
mission.

03:31.878 --> 03:37.084
JUDY WOODRUFF: Boehner resigned
after running afoul of Tea Party
demands to defund Planned

03:37.084 --> 03:41.822
Parenthood, even if it meant
shutting down the government.

03:41.822 --> 03:47.394
For the first time, the head of
Planned Parenthood, Cecile
Richards, faced her Republican
critics

03:47.394 --> 03:52.132
in Congress today. They have
attacked the group after
clandestine videos showed
officials

03:52.132 --> 03:56.803
discussing how fetal tissue
is used for research.

03:56.803 --> 04:00.607
Today, Congressman Jim Jordan
and others sparred with Richards
over stripping the group of

04:00.607 --> 04:02.642
its federal funding.

04:02.642 --> 04:05.946
REP. JIM JORDAN (R), Ohio: The
nice things about these videos,
it's -- it's lifted the

04:05.946 --> 04:10.884
curtain. We can now see what's
going on there. And that's why
should fund the government

04:10.884 --> 04:14.421
and ship the money from this
organization to organizations
that didn't do this kind

04:14.421 --> 04:16.356
of behavior.

04:16.356 --> 04:19.159
CECILE RICHARDS, President,
Planned Parenthood: The
outrageous accusations leveled
against

04:19.159 --> 04:26.032
Planned Parenthood based on
heavily doctored videos are
offensive and categorically
untrue.

04:26.032 --> 04:31.605
I realize, though, that the
facts have never gotten in the
way of these campaigns to block

04:31.605 --> 04:34.541
women from health care that
they need and deserve.

04:34.541 --> 04:40.247
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans also
accused Planned Parenthood of
spending millions on political

04:40.247 --> 04:43.950
activities. Richards said the
group keeps federal funds
strictly segregated from its

04:43.950 --> 04:46.786
political arm.

04:46.786 --> 04:52.192
The director of national
intelligence told senators today
he doesn't have high hopes

04:52.192 --> 04:57.697
for a new cyber-agreement with
China. It's supposed to prevent
state-sponsored hacking

04:57.697 --> 05:02.269
aimed at businesses. But when
James Clapper was asked today if
he's optimistic it will

05:02.269 --> 05:07.474
work, he said no. He said
economic sanctions might be
better.

05:07.474 --> 05:12.779
And on Wall Street, stocks had a
mixed session, one day after the
big losses. The Dow Jones

05:12.779 --> 05:19.186
industrial average gained 47
points to close near 16050. The
Nasdaq fell 26 points, and

05:19.186 --> 05:23.390
the S&P 500 added two.

05:23.390 --> 05:28.361
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
more than 60 nations commit to
taking down the Islamic

05:28.361 --> 05:34.434
State; a closer look at Russia's
role in Syria; Anna Deavere
Smith tackles race, justice and

05:34.434 --> 05:50.417
inequality on stage,
plus, much more.

05:50.417 --> 05:54.821
World leaders met today at the
United Nations on ways to combat
violent extremism around

05:54.821 --> 05:59.226
the world, especially
in Syria and Iraq.

05:59.226 --> 06:03.730
"NewsHour"'s chief foreign
affairs correspondent Margaret
Warner is there and has this
report.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.899
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: I have repeatedly
said that our approach will

06:05.899 --> 06:10.303
take time. This is
not an easy task.

06:10.303 --> 06:14.441
MARGARET WARNER: Today's
admission came one year after
President Obama formed an
international

06:14.441 --> 06:20.180
coalition against the Islamic
State, with much fanfare here at
the U.N.

06:20.180 --> 06:25.752
The U.S.-led coalition includes
some 60 countries, about two
dozen taking part in the
military

06:25.752 --> 06:29.522
campaign. The president told the
group he is ultimately
optimistic, but the date of

06:29.522 --> 06:32.225
success was unclear.

06:32.225 --> 06:40.634
BARACK OBAMA: We have ISIL
taking root in areas that
already are suffering from
failed

06:40.634 --> 06:52.012
governance, in some cases, in
some cases, civil war or
sectarian strife. And, as a
consequence

06:52.012 --> 06:58.118
of the vacuum that exists in
many of these areas, ISIL has
been able to dig in. They

06:58.118 --> 07:01.087
have shown themselves
to be resilient.

07:01.087 --> 07:05.458
MARGARET WARNER: Indeed, this
map from the Institute for the
Study of War last September

07:05.458 --> 07:10.797
shows the Islamic State's zones
of control in Iraq and Syria. A
similar map this month

07:10.797 --> 07:15.001
shows the group has made
gains in Central Syria.

07:15.001 --> 07:20.006
In Iraq, Islamic State still
holds the major cities of Mosul
and Ramadi, while Kurdish

07:20.006 --> 07:24.878
and Iraqi government forces have
liberated Kirkuk and Tikrit, and
stopped an advance

07:24.878 --> 07:29.149
on the Iraqi Kurdish
capital, Irbil.

07:29.149 --> 07:35.622
So far, Iraqi government plans
to launch new offensives have
come to little. As for Syria,

07:35.622 --> 07:41.661
CBS News now reports the
Pentagon is ending its $500
million program to train
moderate

07:41.661 --> 07:46.566
rebels there. The National
Security Council disputes that
report. But U.S. officials have

07:46.566 --> 07:51.738
said that only a handful of the
trainees ever took to the field.

07:51.738 --> 07:56.843
Kurdish fighters have been
effective in both countries, but
the politics are complicated.

07:56.843 --> 08:01.281
Today, Turkey's prime minister,
a member of the coalition, made
a point of saying the

08:01.281 --> 08:05.585
Turks were also fighting
Turkey's Kurdish rebels
demanding autonomy.

08:05.585 --> 08:10.190
AHMET DAVUTOGLU, Turkish Prime
Minister: All of us, we must be
vigilant. One terrorist

08:10.190 --> 08:15.128
fighting the other will not
legitimize it. We want our
partners and friends to support

08:15.128 --> 08:18.665
Turkey in its fight against
all types of terrorism.

08:18.665 --> 08:22.635
MARGARET WARNER: For his part,
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider
al-Abadi urged greater support

08:22.635 --> 08:26.906
to build up his military and
shut down recruiting for ISIS.

08:26.906 --> 08:31.711
In fact, there have multiple
reports that the past year has
seen a spike in foreign

08:31.711 --> 08:35.448
recruits to ISIS from
more than 100 countries.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.918
British Prime Minister David
Cameron addressed that.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.688
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: So, of course, we have
to win militarily. We have

08:41.688 --> 08:45.925
to have the political solution.
We need all the propaganda I
have spoken about. But we

08:45.925 --> 08:50.864
also need to challenge the
extremist world view right at
the very start.

08:50.864 --> 08:55.402
MARGARET WARNER: That appeal to
beat back extremism was nearly
universal at today's

08:55.402 --> 08:59.672
summit. But consensus on how to
do it remained hard to come by.

08:59.672 --> 09:03.343
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
Margaret joins me now.

09:03.343 --> 09:07.747
Margaret, welcome. You are in
New York covering these U.N.
meetings.

09:07.747 --> 09:12.352
That meeting that you reported
on first, the anti-ISIS meeting,
I guess you could call

09:12.352 --> 09:17.690
it, it seemed a little flat in
the video. What struck you?

09:17.690 --> 09:24.030
Well, it looks like we have just
lost our connection with
Margaret Warner. So, unless

09:24.030 --> 09:27.400
we can get it right back, which
it doesn't look like we can, we
are going to turn to

09:27.400 --> 09:34.707
our next segment, which is
talking to two guests about what
is going on in Syria and

09:34.707 --> 09:36.976
the Russian involvement.

09:36.976 --> 09:42.315
And I'm just going to preface
that by saying, as we have been
reporting, last month, Russia

09:42.315 --> 09:47.654
started to beef up its military
support to the regime in Syria.
It started sending supplies

09:47.654 --> 09:53.960
and equipment, even sending
attack aircraft, as this recent
satellite image shows.

09:53.960 --> 09:58.198
So, the question is, what impact
will Russia's intervention in
the Syrian war have, and what

09:58.198 --> 10:01.668
is really motivating
President Putin?

10:01.668 --> 10:06.873
For that we get two views.
Nikolas Gvosdev is professor of
national security studies

10:06.873 --> 10:12.111
at the U.S. Naval War College.
He has written extensively about
Russia. And Andrew Tabler,

10:12.111 --> 10:15.715
he is a senior fellow at the
Program on Arab Politics at the
Washington Institute for Near

10:15.715 --> 10:17.317
East Policy.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.319
Welcome to you both.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.855
Andrew Tabler, to you first. Why
are the Russians doing this? Why
are they getting involved

10:21.855 --> 10:23.923
in Syria?

10:23.923 --> 10:24.557
ANDREW TABLER, Fellow,
Washington Institute for Near
East Policy: The Russians are
getting

10:24.557 --> 10:28.895
involved in Syria because they
want to prop up the Assad
regime.

10:28.895 --> 10:33.299
President Assad only controls
roughly 20 to 25 percent of his
territory. He's been losing

10:33.299 --> 10:39.339
ground, and quite rapidly.
Russia was worried about a
catastrophic collapse of the
regime

10:39.339 --> 10:43.176
that could be taken advantage of
by ISIS. That's why they're
moving in on the surface.

10:43.176 --> 10:47.046
But there are other reason as
well that have to do with
Russia's place in the region.

10:47.046 --> 10:50.116
It's asserting its power. And
also there has been some
speculation that they're trying

10:50.116 --> 10:54.287
to get out of the debacle that
they find themselves in Ukraine.

10:54.287 --> 10:58.024
JUDY WOODRUFF: So more about
propping up Assad than about
doing away with ISIS?

10:58.024 --> 11:00.393
ANDREW TABLER: That's right.

11:00.393 --> 11:05.331
It seems, based on their
deployment, whether it's by --
we see significant sea, air
buildup

11:05.331 --> 11:12.105
with significant fighter
aircraft, and augmenting
airfields and naval facility. It
seems they're

11:12.105 --> 11:17.076
there to support Assad in the
western part of the country. The
question remains, will

11:17.076 --> 11:19.178
they play a constructive role
over all of the country, and how
will they deploy vis-a-vis

11:19.178 --> 11:20.013
ISIS?

11:20.013 --> 11:21.814
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we
will get into that.

11:21.814 --> 11:28.254
Nick Gvosdev, what exactly is
Russia doing in Syria right now?
What kind of material

11:28.254 --> 11:30.723
and men do they
have on the ground?

11:30.723 --> 11:33.459
NIKOLAS GVOSDEV, U.S. Naval War
College: Well, as Andrew pointed
out, they're putting in

11:33.459 --> 11:36.296
advanced equipment.

11:36.296 --> 11:40.767
They have a number of battalions
arriving. They're putting in --
they're reinforcing

11:40.767 --> 11:47.840
their port in Tartus, outside of
Latakia. They're putting in both
fighter aircraft.

11:47.840 --> 11:52.111
There are reports that
long-range bombers are being
readied in Southern Russia that

11:52.111 --> 11:55.949
could be flown over the Caspian,
over Iranian and Iraqi airspace
and then could conduct

11:55.949 --> 11:58.251
missions in Syria.

11:58.251 --> 12:02.288
And I think that we're seeing
the Russians positioning for two
things. One is of course

12:02.288 --> 12:07.694
to help bolster the Assad
regime, but the other thing is
to prepare a fallback plan,

12:07.694 --> 12:13.099
which is that, if Assad cannot
be restored to control over most
of Syria, the Russians

12:13.099 --> 12:17.837
still want to have a say in how
Syria will evolve in the coming
years.

12:17.837 --> 12:23.409
And one way they can do this is
by ensuring that Assad, the
Alawites, some of the Christian

12:23.409 --> 12:28.915
groups have a secure enclave
along the coast that then could
be used as a bargaining chip

12:28.915 --> 12:34.320
with Turkey and Saudi Arabia and
the other powers for how the
future of Syria would go

12:34.320 --> 12:39.025
about. And it's essentially to
say that Russia, too, has a
voice and a veto in what happens

12:39.025 --> 12:42.328
in the Middle East, and it's not
just simply the regional powers
or the United States that

12:42.328 --> 12:45.031
get to determine the
future of Syria.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.900
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Andrew
Tabler, whatever the combination
of reasons for their doing

12:47.900 --> 12:49.836
it, can they be successful?

12:49.836 --> 12:52.105
ANDREW TABLER: It's
very difficult.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.508
The Assad regime is crippled. I
think this is where,
analytically, the United States

12:55.508 --> 12:59.879
and Russia are just very -- in
very, very different places,
Barack Obama not a big fan

12:59.879 --> 13:05.151
of going into Syria, obviously.
Why is he betting on the
opposition? Well, because Assad

13:05.151 --> 13:09.088
controls such little territory,
because he's so rigid in terms
of his political positions,

13:09.088 --> 13:13.393
and because he's been unable to
really turn it around and retake
and capture all of this

13:13.393 --> 13:15.061
territory.

13:15.061 --> 13:20.566
So, the Russians are betting on
a failed scheme, and that's the
way the United States sees

13:20.566 --> 13:23.503
it. We will have to wait and see
if the Russian intervention
changes the calculation and to

13:23.503 --> 13:25.304
what degree.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.441
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nick Gvosdev, how
do you see that? Do you think
the Russians have the capacity

13:28.441 --> 13:32.145
to make a difference in
Syria, when nobody else has?

13:32.145 --> 13:35.982
NIKOLAS GVOSDEV: Well, it
depends, as Andrew has already
pointed out, to what you're
trying

13:35.982 --> 13:41.287
to do. If you're trying to
reestablish Assad's control over
all of Syria and to grind all

13:41.287 --> 13:47.226
the opposition group, ISIS, the
non-ISIS groups, into the dust,
so that Assad is left in control

13:47.226 --> 13:51.097
of all of Syria,
that's very difficult.

13:51.097 --> 13:55.501
On the other hand, if the
fallback plan is to start
creating these safe enclaves,
both

13:55.501 --> 14:00.339
for Assad, but also for Russian
interests, so that the Russian
bases on the Mediterranean

14:00.339 --> 14:05.178
are secure, that could be more
doable, because then you don't
have to retake territory. You

14:05.178 --> 14:10.083
simply have to prevent ISIS and
other opposition groups from
expanding further.

14:10.083 --> 14:13.419
And, of course, the Russians
will have a much different set
of rules of engagement when

14:13.419 --> 14:15.154
they -- if and when they
engage in combat in Syria.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.689
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.860
NIKOLAS GVOSDEV: They are much
more prepared to use force.

14:20.860 --> 14:25.631
And what we have already seen
over the last few days, if some
of these reports are to

14:25.631 --> 14:30.603
be credited, that Syrian
government strikes have gotten
more accurate, have gotten
better,

14:30.603 --> 14:35.341
is that a case of Russian
intelligence and Russian
capabilities beginning to aid
the

14:35.341 --> 14:37.376
Syrian regime? We
will have to see.

14:37.376 --> 14:41.380
But if the goal is to keep Assad
in control of the Syria that he
has left, the Russians

14:41.380 --> 14:43.950
are in a better
position to do that.

14:43.950 --> 14:48.488
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
right now, Andrew Tabler, about
the U.S. in all this.

14:48.488 --> 14:55.361
How do you envision, if any,
cooperation, collaboration
between the U.S. and Russia?

14:55.361 --> 14:59.499
We know that's what President
Obama and President Putin were
to talk about, and we're going

14:59.499 --> 15:01.801
to come back the Margaret Warner
in a minute about that. Is it --
and is this something

15:01.801 --> 15:04.103
the U.S. should do?

15:04.103 --> 15:07.607
ANDREW TABLER: Well, you know,
on the surface, there's been an
effort to deconflict the two

15:07.607 --> 15:11.477
military activities, which is
that so pilots don't start
shooting at each other, which

15:11.477 --> 15:13.946
would lead both countries to war
over something like Syria.
That's something that nobody
really

15:13.946 --> 15:16.549
wants.

15:16.549 --> 15:21.287
There's some convergence of
concern over things like foreign
fighters, on the breakdown of

15:21.287 --> 15:25.758
Syria and hemorrhaging people
and migrants and so on
elsewhere. The big issue,
though,

15:25.758 --> 15:30.630
is that Russia and the United
States completely differ on an
end state in Syria with the...

15:30.630 --> 15:32.031
JUDY WOODRUFF: On whether
Assad should remain in power?

15:32.031 --> 15:34.100
ANDREW TABLER: Well, yes.

15:34.100 --> 15:39.705
They -- the U.S. believes that
Assad should step aside and has
for four years. Putin and

15:39.705 --> 15:44.110
Russia now say that President
Assad must be the basis for a
settlement, not that his regime

15:44.110 --> 15:47.046
would be a basis for a
settlement. And that's a big
difference.

15:47.046 --> 15:51.250
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Nick Gvosdev,
how do you see that? I mean, do
you -- what -- how do

15:51.250 --> 15:55.054
you envision cooperation between
the U.S. and Russia? Is this
something the United States

15:55.054 --> 15:57.690
should be even considering?

15:57.690 --> 16:00.993
NIKOLAS GVOSDEV: Well, in my own
opinion on this, a lot depends
on what the ultimate U.S.

16:00.993 --> 16:03.162
goals are.

16:03.162 --> 16:08.301
And, of course, we have sent
very conflicting signals. On one
hand, we appear to say we

16:08.301 --> 16:13.573
want to disengage from the
region. We're reluctant to
really put our own people on the
ground

16:13.573 --> 16:18.277
or to really get involved. On
the other hand, as Andrew has
pointed out, we don't
necessarily

16:18.277 --> 16:22.148
agree with the end state that
the Russians would want. This,
of course, would also certainly

16:22.148 --> 16:26.719
increase Iranian influence in
the region as well, which is
something that our strategy

16:26.719 --> 16:31.157
has worked to try to contain
over the last number of years.

16:31.157 --> 16:35.895
So, in some ways, we have to set
our own priorities first of what
end state we would like and

16:35.895 --> 16:39.398
what we're prepared to do about
it. What's also interesting, of
course, is to see how

16:39.398 --> 16:41.868
other regional powers are
beginning to assess the changed
conditions.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.703
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

16:43.703 --> 16:49.175
NIKOLAS GVOSDEV: You had Prime
Minister Netanyahu flew to
Moscow. You had President
Erdogan

16:49.175 --> 16:55.047
of Turkey in Moscow this past
Wednesday to have consultations
with President Putin. And

16:55.047 --> 16:59.585
it's clear that the powers of
the region are now also
beginning to reassess what their

16:59.585 --> 17:03.055
strategies are willing to be in
light of the Russian
involvement.

17:03.055 --> 17:06.392
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of moving
parts here, all instigated by
the move by the Russians

17:06.392 --> 17:09.595
to get more engaged in Syria.

17:09.595 --> 17:12.798
Nick, Nikolas Gvosdev, Andrew
Tabler, we thank you both.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.368
NIKOLAS GVOSDEV: Thank you.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.970
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with that,
let's turn back to our
correspondent, chief foreign
affairs

17:17.970 --> 17:19.972
correspondent, Margaret Warner,
at the United Nations.

17:19.972 --> 17:24.510
Margaret, apologies. We
lost you a few minutes ago.

17:24.510 --> 17:29.548
We were talking about that
session this morning, the
anti-ISIS session that was held
at the

17:29.548 --> 17:32.418
U.N. How did you
read that meeting?

17:32.418 --> 17:36.088
MARGARET WARNER: Well, Judy, you
had started out asking if it was
flat. I would say definitely

17:36.088 --> 17:38.291
that's an understatement.

17:38.291 --> 17:45.298
I mean, here you had presidents,
prime ministers all around the
table, and talking about, you

17:45.298 --> 17:48.701
know, what they have achieved.
Well, they couldn't say they
have achieved much. Instead,

17:48.701 --> 17:54.573
they bemoaned how much ISIS has
gained ground in their own
countries, either with attacks

17:54.573 --> 17:56.976
or recruiting their young
people. They tried to analyze
the problem. And it had to do
with

17:56.976 --> 17:59.478
Internet recruitment.

17:59.478 --> 18:04.383
But really they said exactly the
same things they said a year
ago. They said -- almost

18:04.383 --> 18:08.754
none could point to a real
accomplishment. Then they didn't
have any frank discussion

18:08.754 --> 18:11.691
about the fault with their own
strategy and what they should
do. They were all canned

18:11.691 --> 18:13.893
speeches.

18:13.893 --> 18:18.631
And, amazingly, they totally
ignored the elephant in the
room, which Andrew and Nick just
talked

18:18.631 --> 18:25.338
about, which is, ISIS is based
in Syria. What are they going to
do about the home base of

18:25.338 --> 18:30.242
ISIS? And that of course gets
into this whole discussion about
Assad's future.

18:30.242 --> 18:36.482
And if the anti-ISIL coalition,
as the White House calls it,
insists, you know, that they're

18:36.482 --> 18:41.520
in the lead, to think they
didn't even discuss this was
astonishing to me.

18:41.520 --> 18:48.394
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's come
back to the meeting yesterday
between the two -- first

18:48.394 --> 18:54.633
of all, the two speeches of
President Obama and President
Putin, dueling speeches, you

18:54.633 --> 18:58.671
could characterize them, and
then the meeting they had later
in the day. What do we know

18:58.671 --> 19:04.410
about that meeting, and how did
the atmosphere of what happened
yesterday play into today?

19:04.410 --> 19:09.215
MARGARET WARNER: So, you easy,
what we're told -- and it was
still going on when you

19:09.215 --> 19:15.021
and I spoke last night -- is,
they were very businesslike,
frank. They certainly did have

19:15.021 --> 19:19.325
a stony handshake at the
beginning, but that, once they
got in the room, though it was
certainly

19:19.325 --> 19:22.828
not warm and chummy -- these two
men don't like each other --
that there were none of

19:22.828 --> 19:24.864
the recriminations about, oh,
this is your fault and this is
your fault. They got to

19:24.864 --> 19:26.799
business.

19:26.799 --> 19:33.406
Half the discussion was about
Syria and what to do about
Syria. And they agreed on some

19:33.406 --> 19:37.343
common ground. And, of course,
U.S. officials, including John
Kerry, who went on "Morning

19:37.343 --> 19:43.482
Joe" today, tried to point to
the positives: We agree ISIL is
really a serious threat to

19:43.482 --> 19:48.354
all of us, that their returning
foreign fighters are really a
threat to your country and mine

19:48.354 --> 19:54.260
and the whole region and all of
Europe, and that the ultimate
goal, they said, was an

19:54.260 --> 20:00.166
integrated, secular Syria, which
I know many people think is now
illusory.

20:00.166 --> 20:06.772
But they didn't have any meeting
of the minds on this future of
Assad. The one thing they

20:06.772 --> 20:11.644
did agree is that Secretary
Kerry and Foreign Minister
Lavrov will continue discussions

20:11.644 --> 20:15.681
about getting a political
process going, a political
transition going.

20:15.681 --> 20:20.820
And, to me, the big question is,
can this be, as in the Iran
nuclear talks, where the

20:20.820 --> 20:26.625
U.S. and Russia were able to
isolate those talks and really
actually work together to

20:26.625 --> 20:31.363
get that Iranian nuclear deal,
or will it be like the situation
in Ukraine, where it's

20:31.363 --> 20:37.503
so poisoned by the hostility or
dislike or distrust really
between Presidents Obama and

20:37.503 --> 20:40.773
Putin, that it will go nowhere?
And we just don't know.

20:40.773 --> 20:44.743
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Margaret,
very quickly, finally, where do
you see this anti-ISIS coalition

20:44.743 --> 20:48.380
headed in terms of
what it can get done?

20:48.380 --> 20:52.785
MARGARET WARNER: I think it was
summed up by two people today,
first of all, King Abdullah

20:52.785 --> 20:57.223
of Jordan, who said, if we can't
do -- if we can't work more
effectively, we will all

20:57.223 --> 20:59.592
pay the price.

20:59.592 --> 21:03.829
This was a public meeting. And
late in the day, Josh Earnest,
the White House spokesman,

21:03.829 --> 21:07.800
was briefing reporters on Air
Force One as it headed home,
because they piped it in to

21:07.800 --> 21:12.705
us here, and he basically said
-- acknowledged that, a year
from now, when they come back

21:12.705 --> 21:16.175
to meet here, this issue will
still be at the top of the
agenda suggesting it's going

21:16.175 --> 21:19.411
to be a very, very long slog.

21:19.411 --> 21:24.783
JUDY WOODRUFF: Margaret warning
-- Margaret Warner continuing a
long and productive week...

21:24.783 --> 21:25.017
(LAUGHTER)

21:25.017 --> 21:25.484
(CROSSTALK)

21:25.484 --> 21:26.018
MARGARET WARNER: ... myself.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.453
(LAUGHTER)

21:27.453 --> 21:31.390
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... covering the
U.N. meetings in New York, we
thank you.

21:31.390 --> 21:40.399
MARGARET WARNER: A pleasure.

21:40.399 --> 21:47.940
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now the
scandal enveloping Volkswagen.

21:47.940 --> 21:54.713
Today, the company said it would
recall 11 million diesel cars
worldwide, after admitting

21:54.713 --> 22:00.819
they had been rigged to cheat
emissions tests. The company's
stock price continues to
plummet.

22:00.819 --> 22:05.291
Last week, its CEO resigned. And
this week, German prosecutors
said they were considering

22:05.291 --> 22:08.260
criminal charges against him.

22:08.260 --> 22:12.665
William Brangham has more on
the unlikely way it all began.

22:12.665 --> 22:16.302
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We take a
closer look at how Volkswagen
got caught, and what it all

22:16.302 --> 22:20.506
means, with one of the engineers
who helped catch the automaker.

22:20.506 --> 22:24.710
John German is a senior fellow
at the International Council on
Clean Transportation, a
nonprofit

22:24.710 --> 22:27.346
dedicated to improving vehicle
emissions and one that provides
research to regulators all

22:27.346 --> 22:30.049
over the world.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.451
So, John German, I wonder if you
would just start off by telling
me, how did this revelation

22:32.451 --> 22:34.587
come about?

22:34.587 --> 22:36.622
JOHN GERMAN, International
Council on Clean Transportation:
Well, we were actually just

22:36.622 --> 22:39.892
doing routine testing.

22:39.892 --> 22:44.029
This is an outgrowth of our work
in Europe. And it's been known
in Europe for five to

22:44.029 --> 22:48.500
10 years that diesel cars have
high in-use NOx emissions.

22:48.500 --> 22:53.839
ICCT has been working with some
other groups to -- on this. We
have done some testing there.

22:53.839 --> 23:00.479
And our director of our European
office, Peter Mock, had the
bright idea that we should test

23:00.479 --> 23:05.718
some vehicles in the U.S. And
our thought was, because the
U.S. has the most stringent

23:05.718 --> 23:10.689
emissions standards in the
world, and because EPA and CARB
have a lot of legal authority

23:10.689 --> 23:15.961
and experience and do effective
enforcement, that the diesel
cars in the U.S. would be

23:15.961 --> 23:18.864
clean, and that we would take
this data back to Europe and
say, hey, they can do it in

23:18.864 --> 23:21.066
the U.S., how come you
can't do it in Europe?

23:21.066 --> 23:24.603
So, we were as surprised as
anybody when we got the results.

23:24.603 --> 23:28.374
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, Volkswagen
installed this software that
turned on the emissions

23:28.374 --> 23:32.244
system when the computer was
being tested -- when the car was
being tested, and then

23:32.244 --> 23:36.248
shut it off when the car was out
on the road and a regular driver
was driving it.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.652
Now, I understand there is a
great deal of complexity in the
computer systems in our

23:39.652 --> 23:44.890
cars today, but how does it
know? How did the software know
that it was being tested?

23:44.890 --> 23:50.529
JOHN GERMAN: There's no way for
us to know exactly what V.W.
did, but there's a lot of

23:50.529 --> 23:55.768
potential ways that a computer
can recognize that it's on a
test.

23:55.768 --> 24:01.674
The tests are run in a
laboratory, and the vehicle is
strapped down and run on some
rollers.

24:01.674 --> 24:07.446
So, it's stationary. The rear
wheels don't turn. Well, if it's
a front-wheel drive car,

24:07.446 --> 24:11.317
the non-drive wheels don't turn.
The steering rack never turns,
because the vehicle doesn't

24:11.317 --> 24:14.987
turn. It's bolted down.

24:14.987 --> 24:19.658
The test is always run at the
same temperature. The test is
always run when the engine is

24:19.658 --> 24:30.002
cold at the start. And another
way is that the test, it always
follows a prescribed drive

24:30.002 --> 24:32.538
cycle. So, in other words, the
speed, every second is known.
And the computer can look

24:32.538 --> 24:34.707
for that, too.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.343
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is there a
concern in your mind that this
could be a bigger issue than

24:37.343 --> 24:38.644
just Volkswagen?

24:38.644 --> 24:42.614
JOHN GERMAN: Yes.

24:42.614 --> 24:47.152
The -- there is -- we have no
data, we have no information
that suggests that any other

24:47.152 --> 24:53.826
manufacturer has been doing the
same thing, but it's the right
question to ask, especially

24:53.826 --> 24:58.397
since the U.S. has the best
regulators and the most
stringent standards in the
world.

24:58.397 --> 25:03.635
So, we definitely think that
government agencies worldwide
need to investigate to see if
other

25:03.635 --> 25:05.938
manufacturers are
doing the same thing.

25:05.938 --> 25:10.609
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In your mind,
is this a sense of the fox
guarding the henhouse? I

25:10.609 --> 25:16.615
mean, I understand that the
complexity of these systems seem
to me to allow the carmakers

25:16.615 --> 25:21.253
to get away with more and more
nefarious activity. I mean, is
that a concern of yours?

25:21.253 --> 25:30.162
JOHN GERMAN: It would be in any
country that doesn't have good
legal authority and enforcement.

25:30.162 --> 25:36.668
As you say, V.W. got away with
this for a while in the U.S.,
but look at the repercussions

25:36.668 --> 25:44.109
once they got caught. And so
it's just -- the sheer magnitude
of the fines and penalties

25:44.109 --> 25:48.614
and public opinion that they
could face, that is the real
deterrent. The agencies just
have

25:48.614 --> 25:50.916
to -- worldwide just have to do
enough to make sure that there
is some chance that they

25:50.916 --> 25:53.352
could get caught.

25:53.352 --> 25:57.389
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, are
you confident at all that this,
the blowback from this scandal

25:57.389 --> 25:59.892
will deter other automakers
from trying to cheat like this?

25:59.892 --> 26:03.829
JOHN GERMAN: Absolutely.

26:03.829 --> 26:07.599
And you already have other
manufacturers scrambling to make
sure that they're not accused of
the

26:07.599 --> 26:10.169
same thing.

26:10.169 --> 26:13.839
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John German,
the International Council on
Clean Transportation, thank you

26:13.839 --> 26:17.376
very much for joining us.

26:17.376 --> 26:28.754
JOHN GERMAN: Right. You're
welcome. Thank you.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.322
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:30.322 --> 26:35.661
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what's driving the high cost of
prescription drugs; and Anna

26:35.661 --> 26:39.164
Deavere Smith tackles race,
justice and inequality on stage.

26:39.164 --> 26:40.966
Philippines

26:40.966 --> 26:46.939
But, first, the television news
and documentary Emmy Awards were
last night. We're proud to

26:46.939 --> 26:54.179
say PBS went home with 17
statues, more than any other
network. The "NewsHour" won two,

26:54.179 --> 26:59.551
the first for an investigative
look at who's behind the Chinese
takeover of the world's

26:59.551 --> 27:04.122
largest pork producer. We
partnered with the Center for
Investigative Reporting.

27:04.122 --> 27:09.094
And the second dives into the
dangerous underwater mines in
the Philippines.

27:09.094 --> 27:13.999
Larry C. Price traveled there to
document the sometimes deadly
way some poor Filipinos

27:13.999 --> 27:15.868
are making a living.

27:15.868 --> 27:19.338
Here's an encore
look at that story.

27:19.338 --> 27:22.641
Hari Sreenivasan narrates our
report, produced in partnership
with the Pulitzer Center on

27:22.641 --> 27:25.177
Crisis Reporting.

27:25.177 --> 27:30.616
HARI SREENIVASAN: Near a remote
village in the Eastern
Philippines, at a small camp in

27:30.616 --> 27:37.122
the forest, a man bites down on
a plastic tube, adjusts his mask
and disappears into

27:37.122 --> 27:42.928
water as opaque as
chocolate milk.

27:42.928 --> 27:48.867
Descending as deep as 40 feet,
he breathes from a small diesel-
powered air compressor

27:48.867 --> 27:54.306
on the surface, while blindly
digging into the sides of a
narrow tunnel. For hours at

27:54.306 --> 27:59.244
a time, he fills bags with mud
and rock that a partner hauls to
the surface, where the

27:59.244 --> 28:04.349
sediment is broken down and,
using mercury, panned for gold.

28:04.349 --> 28:09.988
According to Thomson Reuters, in
2012, the Philippines was the
18th largest producer

28:09.988 --> 28:16.328
of gold worldwide. Large
companies are responsible for
much of that, but there are also
unofficial

28:16.328 --> 28:22.267
small-scale mines like these.
Many lie in the poor coastal
province of Camarines Norte,

28:22.267 --> 28:26.038
about 200 miles Southeast of
Manila, where some of the
country's highest concentrations

28:26.038 --> 28:29.942
of the precious
mineral can be found.

28:29.942 --> 28:36.081
But much of it is trapped in ore
underwater. So-called compressor
mining originated in

28:36.081 --> 28:41.019
this region of the Philippines
as far back as the mid-1990s.
The practice was inspired

28:41.019 --> 28:46.091
by fishermen, who used the
motors to dive deep underwater
to catch reef fish. But with

28:46.091 --> 28:50.128
the potential for engine
breakdowns and tunnel collapses,
it's an extremely dangerous
venture,

28:50.128 --> 28:53.465
and one not limited to adults.

28:53.465 --> 28:58.236
Pulitzer Prize-winning
photographer Larry C. Price
traveled to the Philippines for
the

28:58.236 --> 29:04.109
"NewsHour" in November. There,
he spoke with 15-year old Elias
Delima (ph), who began diving

29:04.109 --> 29:08.981
when he was just 13. Delima told
an interpreter that divers get
double the take of the other

29:08.981 --> 29:13.185
miners, around $5 a day, and
that's incentive enough.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.987
QUESTION (through translator):
Why do you do this? Why do you
go into the hole and bring

29:14.987 --> 29:17.022
up the dirt?

29:17.022 --> 29:21.226
BOY (through translator): To get
gold, to help my parents, and to
have some money for

29:21.226 --> 29:23.462
myself.

29:23.462 --> 29:28.734
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dindo Leche
(ph), now 25, said he began
diving when he was 14. While

29:28.734 --> 29:32.971
he's no longer afraid, he says
he knows the risks remain.

29:32.971 --> 29:36.375
DINDO LECHE, Philippines
(through translator): It's
dangerous. Because we are
extracting

29:36.375 --> 29:40.746
soil, the holes get wider and
deeper. The soil loses natural
strength. And it doesn't

29:40.746 --> 29:43.849
stick together and easily gives
way. That is what we are on the
lookout for underwater,

29:43.849 --> 29:46.985
so you do not get buried.

29:46.985 --> 29:49.688
QUESTION (through translator):
Which is worse, when the
compressor stops, or when the
tunnel

29:49.688 --> 29:52.057
collapses?

29:52.057 --> 29:56.962
DINDO LECHE (through
translator): A tunnel collapse
is more dangerous. But, often,
those

29:56.962 --> 30:02.134
two happen at the same time.
That is what is called your time
to die.

30:02.134 --> 30:08.540
HARI SREENIVASAN: Compressor
mining was officially outlawed
in the Philippines in 2012. In
January

30:08.540 --> 30:12.611
of that year, near the town of
Paracale, an accident left at
least three compressor miners

30:12.611 --> 30:16.982
dead. The site was shut
down and quickly abandoned.

30:16.982 --> 30:24.189
Yet, with vast stretches of poor
rural communities spread across
some 7,100 islands, desperation

30:24.189 --> 30:30.295
is high and regulation is
lacking. November's record
typhoon caused billions of
dollars

30:30.295 --> 30:36.501
of damage to the country. But it
only stopped operations for one
day in Mambulao Bay, where

30:36.501 --> 30:43.175
more than 400 work on some 40
floating bamboo encampments near
the village of Santa Milagrosa.

30:43.175 --> 30:49.381
Miners here say they pay local
police $11 a month per worker to
look the other way.

30:49.381 --> 30:52.217
Many of those workers are
children and adolescents.

30:52.217 --> 30:55.854
JULIE HALL, World Health
Organization: There are three
main risks from this type of
practice.

30:55.854 --> 31:00.659
HARI SREENIVASAN: Julie Hall
works with the World Health
Organization in Manila. She says

31:00.659 --> 31:05.964
that in addition to the
immediate life-threatening
dangers posed by an engine
failure or collapse,

31:05.964 --> 31:10.736
the conditions also pose
longer-term health risks for
children. One is the poor
quality

31:10.736 --> 31:14.573
of air fed to the divers
by the compressor engines.

31:14.573 --> 31:19.578
JULIE HALL: It's likely that
that air that's sucked through
the tube will be mixed with

31:19.578 --> 31:24.149
diesel fumes, with carbon
monoxide, with other pollutants,
because it's very close to the

31:24.149 --> 31:26.918
engine that's driving
the compressor.

31:26.918 --> 31:31.189
HARI SREENIVASAN: The second is
the effects on the body at those
depths underwater.

31:31.189 --> 31:36.962
JULIE HALL: The body's under a
lot of pressure. Little gas
bubbles can form in your
bloodstream,

31:36.962 --> 31:41.099
and those gas bubbles can block
off the blood supply to little
bits of your brain or little

31:41.099 --> 31:44.603
bits of your lung.

31:44.603 --> 31:47.305
HARI SREENIVASAN: And a third is
the poor quality of the water
they're diving in, susceptible

31:47.305 --> 31:50.008
to bacteria and parasites.

31:50.008 --> 31:56.248
JULIE HALL: For somebody to be
spending a lot of time breathing
poor-quality air, under

31:56.248 --> 32:01.586
pressure, under the water, and
exposed to all of these bacteria
and other bugs in that

32:01.586 --> 32:06.558
dirty water, this clearly poses
a significant health risk.

32:06.558 --> 32:12.864
CARLOS CONDE, Human Rights
Watch: When you're a poor
family, the more -- the more
people

32:12.864 --> 32:18.637
you can convince to work and
contribute to the family income,
obviously, the better.

32:18.637 --> 32:22.841
HARI SREENIVASAN: Carlos Conde
works for Human Rights Watch in
the Philippines. He says that

32:22.841 --> 32:27.078
parents are typically the ones
pushing their children into this
dangerous work.

32:27.078 --> 32:33.752
CARLOS CONDE: Oftentimes, they
don't consider, for instance,
education for the kids. Although

32:33.752 --> 32:38.990
getting an education is a
paramount concern for Filipino
families, but, you know,
particularly

32:38.990 --> 32:46.131
in the provinces, the really
poor ones, it's just, you know,
kids are seen as extra hands.

32:46.131 --> 32:51.703
HARI SREENIVASAN: Edlyn Ortiz
(ph) is 12 years old. Girls like
her typically don't dive.

32:51.703 --> 32:55.307
But they help with the panning
and domestic chores that allow
the family to work at the

32:55.307 --> 32:59.044
mine. She tells an interpreter
that her family depends on her
help.

32:59.044 --> 33:02.447
QUESTION (through translator):
Why do you work in gold mining?

33:02.447 --> 33:07.052
GIRL (through translator): To
earn money so we can have
something to eat.

33:07.052 --> 33:11.756
QUESTION (through translator):
What do you like better, going
to school or working?

33:11.756 --> 33:14.926
GIRL (through translator): I
want to keep going to school,
and in the end, that's what

33:14.926 --> 33:17.662
will give us a better life.

33:17.662 --> 33:21.867
LAWRENCE JOHNSON, International
Labor Organization: These
children are mortgaging their
future,

33:21.867 --> 33:24.569
not of themselves only, but also
their families and their
communities.

33:24.569 --> 33:27.639
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lawrence
Johnson directs the efforts of
the U.N.'s International Labor

33:27.639 --> 33:31.209
Organization in the Philippines.
He agrees that schooling is key
to breaking this cycle

33:31.209 --> 33:34.312
of child labor.

33:34.312 --> 33:42.287
LAWRENCE JOHNSON: We see
education as a way to help the
next generation become more
productive,

33:42.287 --> 33:47.225
to have a better quality of
life. But it's also right now
allowing for an environment

33:47.225 --> 33:48.093
where these parents can actually
provide for their families, and
not just go out and mine

33:48.093 --> 33:51.363
just enough today to survive.

33:51.363 --> 33:56.735
HARI SREENIVASAN: In a country
with so many desperate
challenges, even before the
typhoon,

33:56.735 --> 33:59.704
Johnson says if people want to
help stop this practice, they
can start by being more
conscientious

33:59.704 --> 34:01.539
consumers.

34:01.539 --> 34:07.445
LAWRENCE JOHNSON: Whether we're
talking gold or silver that we
mine, it's a bulk commodity.

34:07.445 --> 34:11.516
So we ask consumers, are you
sure that the ring you're
wearing, the earring, the
necklaces

34:11.516 --> 34:15.754
are free from child labor?
That's more difficult, but it's
up to consumers to start making
that

34:15.754 --> 34:17.589
choice again.

34:17.589 --> 34:20.458
HARI SREENIVASAN: For now, the
divers will continue to bear the
risks, taking their dangerous

34:20.458 --> 34:27.165
plunges and grasping for gold.

34:27.165 --> 34:38.009
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now let's turn to
the rising price of prescription
drugs and outcries to

34:38.009 --> 34:40.979
do something about it.

34:40.979 --> 34:46.484
The latest uproar began after
The New York Times reported how
one company, Turing
Pharmaceuticals,

34:46.484 --> 34:55.060
raised the price of a drug from
$13 a pill to $750. It follows
headlines about the rising

34:55.060 --> 35:00.799
costs of new cancer drugs, as
well as a breakthrough drug for
hepatitis C that initially cost
more

35:00.799 --> 35:05.236
than $80,000 for a
course of treatment.

35:05.236 --> 35:10.408
The two leading Democratic
candidates for president,
Hillary Clinton and Bernie
Sanders,

35:10.408 --> 35:16.147
are proposing big changes,
including lowering patient costs
and bigger discounts for
Medicare.

35:16.147 --> 35:19.451
Now two views on this.

35:19.451 --> 35:25.090
Dr. Peter Bach is the director
of the Center for Health Policy
and Outcomes at Memorial

35:25.090 --> 35:31.563
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
And Dr. Thomas Stossel is the
director of translational
medicine

35:31.563 --> 35:36.401
at Brigham and Women's Hospital
and a professor of medicine at
Harvard Medical School.

35:36.401 --> 35:38.570
And, gentlemen, we
welcome you both.

35:38.570 --> 35:39.871
Dr. Bach, I'm going
to start with you.

35:39.871 --> 35:42.073
Why is this happening?

35:42.073 --> 35:43.742
DR. PETER BACH, Director, Center
for Health Policy and Outcomes,
Memorial Sloan Kettering

35:43.742 --> 35:47.779
Cancer Center: Well, it's really
that there's no system in place
the hold down drug prices,

35:47.779 --> 35:53.518
and so companies are just
becoming increasingly bold,
charging prices that they think
the

35:53.518 --> 35:56.488
market will bear.

35:56.488 --> 36:02.093
And Turing Pharmaceuticals and
the 55-fold increase in the
price of Daraprim is just

36:02.093 --> 36:06.965
a version of a company testing
the market, if you will, just
how high they can raise

36:06.965 --> 36:11.202
a price. But we see it across
drugs, rapid inflation in the
cost of drugs, not only new

36:11.202 --> 36:13.471
ones, but old ones.

36:13.471 --> 36:16.775
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Stossel, how
do you explain it? It's long
been the case that there has

36:16.775 --> 36:20.912
been no system for keeping
prices down. Why now?

36:20.912 --> 36:23.415
DR. THOMAS STOSSEL, Harvard
Medical School: Well, there
still is no system, although
people

36:23.415 --> 36:25.083
are asking for it.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.552
Well, thank you for having me.

36:27.552 --> 36:34.659
So, I have been in medicine for
almost half-a-century, and it's
incredibly better because of the

36:34.659 --> 36:40.365
drugs that are available. So,
drugs bring great value. There's
no question about it.

36:40.365 --> 36:47.672
Also, despite the fact there's
been uptake in costs in recent
years, they still constitute

36:47.672 --> 36:51.643
less than, I think, 14 percent
of total health care costs.

36:51.643 --> 36:58.650
Now, in that 50 years, the
price, the cost of what it takes
to get a drug approved by

36:58.650 --> 37:04.122
the FDA has increased 100 times.
And if you're interested, I can
explain why I think that

37:04.122 --> 37:04.622
is.

37:04.622 --> 37:06.558
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well...

37:06.558 --> 37:12.430
DR. THOMAS STOSSEL: But it's
that is what is driving -- the
only antidote to keeping

37:12.430 --> 37:18.269
innovation going is to sustain
profitability. Now, the Turing
case is an anomaly.

37:18.269 --> 37:20.171
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me...

37:20.171 --> 37:25.343
DR. THOMAS STOSSEL: That has
nothing to do with innovation.
That, I agree, is pure
opportunism.

37:25.343 --> 37:30.014
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. And we
have reported on that, and we
want to set that aside, because

37:30.014 --> 37:33.651
we could spend the whole time we
have with you talking about it.

37:33.651 --> 37:37.755
But, just quickly, Dr. Bach,
this point that it's innovation,
these companies are taking

37:37.755 --> 37:40.458
a risk, does that explain
it, the rise in costs?

37:40.458 --> 37:42.760
DR. PETER BACH:
Well, yes and no.

37:42.760 --> 37:47.365
It's unbelievably important that
we get new drugs. We need more
new treatments. We have

37:47.365 --> 37:55.006
patients who need help. But it
isn't the case that the rise in
costs tracks with extra burden.

37:55.006 --> 37:59.878
The truth is, more drugs are
being approved now, about 90
percent of new drug applications

37:59.878 --> 38:03.848
to the Food and Drug
Administration. It was only
about 50 percent just eight
years ago.

38:03.848 --> 38:09.721
There are more sort of detours
around the regulatory process,
single-arm trials, skipping

38:09.721 --> 38:14.459
randomized trials, shorter
trials, so it's actually getting
easier to get a drug approved.

38:14.459 --> 38:19.697
The reason is that it is
possible to charge very high
prices.

38:19.697 --> 38:24.335
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to
turn to both of you because --
on this question of how

38:24.335 --> 38:26.905
badly patients are being hurt.

38:26.905 --> 38:31.843
Dr. Stossel, I read a quote. As
I mentioned, the Democratic
candidates for president are

38:31.843 --> 38:36.047
making a big issue of this.
Bernie Sanders said in one
interview -- he talked about
working-class

38:36.047 --> 38:40.752
women struggling with breast
cancer, not having a lot of
money, they were able to get the

38:40.752 --> 38:44.255
same medicine for one-tenth
the price in Canada.

38:44.255 --> 38:48.293
I mean, real people are being
affected by this, aren't they?

38:48.293 --> 38:53.097
DR. THOMAS STOSSEL: Absolutely.
And I don't discount the misery,
the stress that having,

38:53.097 --> 38:57.669
on top of a bad disease, to
be socked with a big co-pay.

38:57.669 --> 39:02.540
But I see that -- a big mistake
to just point the finger at the
drug companies. I mean,

39:02.540 --> 39:06.978
I have to disagree with Dr. Bach
that it's easier to get a drug
approved today. I think

39:06.978 --> 39:11.983
it's harder to get a drug
approved today, because there is
more stringent FDA regulation,

39:11.983 --> 39:16.354
and it's engrafted on a nasty
fact that biology is tough.

39:16.354 --> 39:21.960
There is a huge failure rate.
Nine out of 10 great drug
candidates don't make it. And

39:21.960 --> 39:23.795
the successes have to
pay for those failures.

39:23.795 --> 39:24.262
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it...

39:24.262 --> 39:25.863
(CROSSTALK)

39:25.863 --> 39:29.534
DR. THOMAS STOSSEL: And Canada
controls prices. The whole world
freeloads off of American

39:29.534 --> 39:31.569
drug innovation.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.338
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you want to
quickly respond to that? Because
I want to ask you both what

39:33.338 --> 39:34.706
you think should be done.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.107
DR. PETER BACH: No, please,
proceed. Go ahead.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.810
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what do you
think should be done about this?

39:38.810 --> 39:43.681
I mean, we have got the
Democratic candidates for
president both talking about
putting caps

39:43.681 --> 39:48.820
on the price of prescription
drugs. The Republican candidates
take, it's my understanding, a

39:48.820 --> 39:52.457
hands-off, government hands-off
approach. What do you think
should be done, Dr. Bach?

39:52.457 --> 39:57.061
DR. PETER BACH: Well, what we
have is pricing for drugs that
doesn't make any sense. You

39:57.061 --> 39:59.130
can have a drug that doesn't
work well and charge a high
price. You can have a drug
that's

39:59.130 --> 40:02.033
terrific and charge
a high price.

40:02.033 --> 40:07.805
And what I would like to see is
prices based on value. And Dr.
Stossel mentioned that.

40:07.805 --> 40:12.443
And so value is something about
how well the drug works to
alleviate suffering, to prolong

40:12.443 --> 40:19.484
life. And if we had a market
where drugs that worked better
to treat disease cost more,

40:19.484 --> 40:23.955
the companies that would win in
that environment are the ones
who are best at innovating.

40:23.955 --> 40:28.026
And they could get the biggest
profit. And the companies that
make me-too products that

40:28.026 --> 40:32.664
aren't incremental improvements,
they wouldn't be as profitable.
And that's how markets are

40:32.664 --> 40:36.734
supposed to work. And what's
broken here is, right now, both
of those companies can charge

40:36.734 --> 40:38.269
whatever they want.

40:38.269 --> 40:41.472
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Stossel, does
that sound like a solution?

40:41.472 --> 40:46.077
DR. THOMAS STOSSEL: No, because
it costs just as much to develop
a marginal drug as a good

40:46.077 --> 40:48.680
drug.

40:48.680 --> 40:55.186
Good intentions don't lead to
drug innovation. There's a huge
amount of luck, serendipity,

40:55.186 --> 40:59.557
that's involved. And so there's
-- I can't think of any
enterprise where there's so
little

40:59.557 --> 41:03.695
connection between what it costs
to develop the product, what the
value of the product

41:03.695 --> 41:08.132
is and what it costs to keep the
system going, keeping the
innovation going.

41:08.132 --> 41:14.038
And it's that huge failure rate
that's the bugaboo here. And I
don't know any easy answer

41:14.038 --> 41:19.777
to it, but I do believe that
it's fantasy to think that, if
you impose top-down pricing,

41:19.777 --> 41:25.750
you bring the political process
into it, that you're -- if
that's what society wants, fine,

41:25.750 --> 41:29.554
but you have to understand that
it is incompatible with
innovation.

41:29.554 --> 41:33.991
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, gentlemen,
it is a big subject. And I think
we have only begun to

41:33.991 --> 41:36.060
scratch at the surface. I know
we're going to come back to this
again, but I want to

41:36.060 --> 41:38.830
thank both of you
for joining us.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.866
Dr. Thomas Stossel, Dr. Peter
Bach, we thank you both.

41:41.866 --> 41:47.772
DR. PETER BACH:
Thanks very much.

41:47.772 --> 41:53.978
DR. THOMAS STOSSEL: Thank you.

41:53.978 --> 42:00.651
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new play
inspired by today's headlines
touring the country, including a

42:00.651 --> 42:04.222
stop soon in Baltimore.

42:04.222 --> 42:06.524
Jeffrey Brown has the latest
report in our ongoing series on
mass incarceration: Broken

42:06.524 --> 42:08.259
Justice.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.795
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH,
Playwright/Actress: You put leg
shackles on a man who could
barely

42:10.795 --> 42:16.734
walk? And then throw him in the
back of a paddy wagon like, oh,
a dead animal, you know

42:16.734 --> 42:20.538
what I'm saying?

42:20.538 --> 42:26.711
JEFFREY BROWN: A story on the
stage taken from the streets of
America today, the arrest

42:26.711 --> 42:30.715
of Freddie Gray in Baltimore
earlier this year, as witnessed
and videotaped by a bystander

42:30.715 --> 42:32.817
named Kevin Moore.

42:32.817 --> 42:36.754
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: And you feel
the camera is the only weapon
you have?

42:36.754 --> 42:38.489
KEVIN MOORE, Baltimore: Yes, the
camera is the only thing that we
have to can actually

42:38.489 --> 42:40.658
protect us that's not illegal.

42:40.658 --> 42:45.296
JEFFREY BROWN: The storyteller
is writer and actor Anna Deavere
Smith, who wove Moore's

42:45.296 --> 42:51.903
experience into her new project,
titled "Notes From the Field:
Doing Time in Education."

42:51.903 --> 42:56.574
The project began with an
anecdote a friend told Smith
about a young person in
Baltimore

42:56.574 --> 42:59.744
who was arrested after
urinating on a watercooler.

42:59.744 --> 43:03.981
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: She said,
oh, whatever happened to
mischief? And I was just like,

43:03.981 --> 43:09.353
wow, poor kids are pathologized.
And rich kids have mischief. And
it just grabbed me.

43:09.353 --> 43:14.492
And I thought, it's time to go
home, really, and go back to
what I began with, and look

43:14.492 --> 43:17.662
and see what's wrong with it.

43:17.662 --> 43:22.934
JEFFREY BROWN: Home is
Baltimore, where Smith lived
until she was 15.

43:22.934 --> 43:27.805
After the killing of Freddie
Gray and the riots that ensued,
it was a sadly appropriate

43:27.805 --> 43:35.079
setting for Smith her return.
Anna Deavere Smith is a
recognizable presence on
television,

43:35.079 --> 43:39.784
these days on the showtime
program "Nurse Jackie."

43:39.784 --> 43:44.789
But it's her one-woman theater
explorations of aspects of
American life, from racial
strife

43:44.789 --> 43:49.594
to health care, that have earned
her honors and acclaim as a
path-breaking American artist.

43:49.594 --> 43:53.231
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: There's
still something wrong with you.
Maybe it's because you speak

43:53.231 --> 43:54.398
Spanish.

43:54.398 --> 43:57.368
Could you tell me what
kind of cancer you have?

43:57.368 --> 43:58.436
(LAUGHTER)

43:58.436 --> 44:02.406
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: I
said, this is appalling.

44:02.406 --> 44:07.712
JEFFREY BROWN: Smith plays all
the parts. But the words are
those of people she's
interviewed,

44:07.712 --> 44:12.316
activists, scholars,
politicians, average people
affected by what's going on.

44:12.316 --> 44:16.220
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: What I say
now, after having done these
interviews for many, many

44:16.220 --> 44:19.490
years, is that I'm looking for
people who would scream it from
a mountaintop, and I

44:19.490 --> 44:21.893
just happen to be walking by.

44:21.893 --> 44:25.096
JEFFREY BROWN: The aim of this
journalistic-style approach, she
told me recently, is to -- quote

44:25.096 --> 44:27.999
-- "make sense of things."

44:27.999 --> 44:33.404
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: It is, in
terms of looking for the story
and looking for witnesses, the

44:33.404 --> 44:38.009
people who are in it, to have
them explain something to you
that you don't understand.

44:38.009 --> 44:42.547
JEFFREY BROWN: What Smith wants
to understand now is what she
and others call the
school-to-prison

44:42.547 --> 44:49.420
pipeline, in which children,
disproportionately
African-American, Latino and
Native American,

44:49.420 --> 44:53.524
get in trouble in school for
relatively minor offenses and
are then funneled into the
criminal

44:53.524 --> 44:57.094
justice system, changing
their lives forever.

44:57.094 --> 45:00.898
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: We have
retreated into a kind of
segregation. And some people
would

45:00.898 --> 45:06.137
say it's all part of this gap
between the rich and the poor
that many, many, many people

45:06.137 --> 45:08.906
are talking about, or the gap
between the rich and the middle
class, or just the failure

45:08.906 --> 45:11.375
of our public institutions.

45:11.375 --> 45:15.613
JEFFREY BROWN: For the project,
Smith and her team talked to
hundreds of people in seven

45:15.613 --> 45:19.283
cities, including Baltimore,
where we joined her for a day.

45:19.283 --> 45:25.923
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: The call for
our men to get up. You even go
to the sagging pants,

45:25.923 --> 45:30.328
right, which is controversial,
some people say. What about
that? What about the sagging

45:30.328 --> 45:34.999
pants? What does that mean? Why
did you call for them to
basically pull their pants up?

45:34.999 --> 45:38.336
REV. JAMAL BRYANT, Empowerment
Temple Church: When I say pull
it up, it's not just the pants,

45:38.336 --> 45:42.840
but pull up your level of
thinking, or pull up the
expectation for your own life.

45:42.840 --> 45:46.177
JEFFREY BROWN: We watched as she
interviewed Reverend Jamal
Bryant, who delivered the eulogy

45:46.177 --> 45:48.479
at Freddie Gray's funeral.

45:48.479 --> 45:52.283
REV. JAMAL BRYANT: The reason
why I want you not to cry is
because Freddie's death is not

45:52.283 --> 45:54.018
in vain.

45:54.018 --> 45:59.090
JEFFREY BROWN: He told Smith of
his opposition to a new $30
million jail for youth.

45:59.090 --> 46:04.729
REV. JAMAL BRYANT: Our children
have been so reduced to the
color of criminality, that

46:04.729 --> 46:08.933
they are not even seen in
their humanity as children.

46:08.933 --> 46:13.004
JEFFREY BROWN: Smith recently
presented an early version of
"Notes From the Field" at

46:13.004 --> 46:16.907
the Berkeley Repertory Theater
in California, taking on the
personas of some of those she'd

46:16.907 --> 46:19.844
interviewed around the country.

46:19.844 --> 46:24.048
She became India Sledge, a
student in West Baltimore.

46:24.048 --> 46:29.920
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: My
boyfriend, Jake, was near -- he
was walking to the store. And
the

46:29.920 --> 46:34.659
police jacked him up and threw
him against the wall for no
reason, checked him for no

46:34.659 --> 46:41.332
reason. And since that time, his
momma's like, I have got to get
away from here, because,

46:41.332 --> 46:43.067
around this area, that's all it
is around here, is just drug
dealers, drug dealers,

46:43.067 --> 46:45.503
drug dealers.

46:45.503 --> 46:49.407
JEFFREY BROWN: As Stephanie
Williams of Philadelphia, Smith
gave a teacher's view of chaos
in the

46:49.407 --> 46:50.941
classroom.

46:50.941 --> 46:52.476
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: I felt like
I had a whole bunch of hungry,
starving people, and I had

46:52.476 --> 47:01.419
nothing in my hands to give
them, even though I tried to
give them so much. But it was
hard

47:01.419 --> 47:11.062
to be that strong day in and day
out. It was just -- it felt like
-- it was like running

47:11.062 --> 47:12.129
a jail without a gun.
That's what it was like.

47:12.129 --> 47:12.430
And it's like being in jail
without a gun, no guns, no
handcuffs, billy clubs. I can't

47:12.430 --> 47:18.836
go use a club. I can't do any of
that. I got to just keep you in
order just by being me.

47:18.836 --> 47:23.274
JEFFREY BROWN: In Baltimore, of
course, things were very
personal for Smith.

47:23.274 --> 47:27.645
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: I'm just
glad it's not boarded up. It's
different. You know, it's

47:27.645 --> 47:29.547
different.

47:29.547 --> 47:35.519
JEFFREY BROWN: As she visited
her childhood neighborhood on
the city's West Side. A former

47:35.519 --> 47:38.489
neighbor, Sheila Wiggins, who
taught Smith how to dance the
twist, was stunned to see

47:38.489 --> 47:39.924
her.

47:39.924 --> 47:45.663
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH:
Oh my goodness.

47:45.663 --> 47:49.300
JEFFREY BROWN: Smith showed us
the cemetery behind her house
where she and friends would

47:49.300 --> 47:50.935
play and pick berries.

47:50.935 --> 47:55.639
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: We played
in this alley, hopscotch.

47:55.639 --> 48:03.013
JEFFREY BROWN: Today, she sees
enormous problems in her
hometown, but also something
more.

48:03.013 --> 48:10.321
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: The young
people in particular who I'm
talking to really show great
vulnerability.

48:10.321 --> 48:15.292
They are not masked with
language or jargon. And I'm very
moved by that. There's a kind

48:15.292 --> 48:18.929
of grace here in
Baltimore that I miss.

48:18.929 --> 48:22.967
JEFFREY BROWN: In this project,
Smith says, she wants to take a
more activist approach

48:22.967 --> 48:27.404
than in the past, pushing local
communities to engage and look
for solutions.

48:27.404 --> 48:33.210
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: Right now,
people are just falling off the
radar. They are just

48:33.210 --> 48:38.182
dying. Or how can that continue?
And the only way it's going to
turn around, I think, is

48:38.182 --> 48:46.957
by what I call this spark of a
moral imagination, of a more
empathic community.

48:46.957 --> 48:53.230
And that's one thing art can
offer. I can ask people to feel
about this, until enough

48:53.230 --> 48:56.100
people say -- in their
community, they say, well, we
have got to get this together,
we

48:56.100 --> 48:58.736
have got to turn this around.

48:58.736 --> 49:02.773
JEFFREY BROWN: Anna Deavere
Smith will perform "Notes From
the Field" in California and
Oregon

49:02.773 --> 49:07.478
this fall, before bringing it
to Baltimore in early December.

49:07.478 --> 49:11.015
ANNA DEAVERE SMITH: I said, just
one, Jesus, just one. I'm not
trying to do the masses.

49:11.015 --> 49:14.185
I'm just trying to
save one at a time.

49:14.185 --> 49:21.659
JEFFREY BROWN: From Baltimore,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

49:21.659 --> 49:35.072
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight on
"Frontline," the first of a
three-part series on the bombing

49:35.072 --> 49:43.480
of Pan Am Flight 103, which
killed 270 people over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.

49:43.480 --> 49:48.385
In "My Brother's Bomber," Ken
Dornstein, whose brother was
killed in the crash, takes a
deep

49:48.385 --> 49:52.990
look into the files of the case,
talking to former prosecutors
who believe not all of

49:52.990 --> 49:58.162
those responsible were
prosecuted, much less even
identified.

49:58.162 --> 50:03.367
Only one person, Abdel Basset
al-Megrahi, was convicted and
sentenced to life, but was

50:03.367 --> 50:08.105
released in 2009 because of
his deteriorating health.

50:08.105 --> 50:13.010
MAN: President Obama said the
U.S. deeply regrets the decision
and warned Libya not

50:13.010 --> 50:16.947
to give him a hero's welcome.
The Libyans weren't listening.

50:16.947 --> 50:20.985
MAN: Megrahi emerged wearing a
suit, the frail former inmate
unrecognizable as he
acknowledged

50:20.985 --> 50:22.686
the jubilant crowd.

50:22.686 --> 50:26.590
KEN DORNSTEIN, Brother of Pan Am
Flight 103 Victim: I remember
being shocked by Megrahi's

50:26.590 --> 50:33.530
release. His conviction hadn't
been fully satisfying, but at
least it was an answer.

50:33.530 --> 50:39.370
Now all that was coming undone.
My brother and the others had
been killed, and certainty

50:39.370 --> 50:42.106
about who did it was
being wiped away.

50:42.106 --> 50:47.111
MAN: Some believe Megrahi should
go free. They don't believe he
was guilty in the first

50:47.111 --> 50:48.579
place.

50:48.579 --> 50:51.749
MAN: Megrahi is not expected to
live long enough for his next
appeal to be heard.

50:51.749 --> 50:55.552
KEN DORNSTEIN: Megrahi's release
also gave momentum to those who
believed he wasn't guilty

50:55.552 --> 51:03.093
at all, and theories pinning
Lockerbie on Iran were once
again revived.

51:03.093 --> 51:08.532
I wished I could let it go, but,
instead, I decided to set out on
my own search for

51:08.532 --> 51:13.737
answers. I began by tracking
down the FBI agent who had
worked longer than anyone on

51:13.737 --> 51:16.974
the Lockerbie case,
Richard Marquise.

51:16.974 --> 51:17.942
RICHARD MARQUISE, Former FBI
Investigator: How are you? Good
to see you, Ken.

51:17.942 --> 51:21.712
KEN DORNSTEIN: Good to see you.

51:21.712 --> 51:27.217
Almost 25 years later, no one
has ever admitted playing any
role in it. And in fact,
Megrahi,

51:27.217 --> 51:30.754
the one man convicted, he is let
go after serving only eight
years, under a cloud of

51:30.754 --> 51:32.623
suspicion.

51:32.623 --> 51:36.961
RICHARD MARQUISE: Nobody is
being -- nobody is paying for
this. Nobody is paying
judicially

51:36.961 --> 51:42.399
for blowing up Pan Am 103.
That's a great frustration.

51:42.399 --> 51:49.173
Gadhafi was told, if your agents
are found guilty, you have to
admit responsibility for

51:49.173 --> 51:56.280
the attack. And all he would
admit to was "responsibility for
the actions of my agents."

51:56.280 --> 52:02.820
I think it's terrible that we
allowed him to get away with
that statement. When I spoke

52:02.820 --> 52:11.795
to the Lockerbie families, I
said I wished we could have
gotten more for you. Megrahi

52:11.795 --> 52:17.267
was the only person convicted
because he's the only person
that the evidence led to.

52:17.267 --> 52:23.307
But, if he did this, he didn't
do it by himself. Megrahi's the
tip of the iceberg.

52:23.307 --> 52:28.779
JUDY WOODRUFF: "Frontline" airs
tonight on most PBS stations.

52:28.779 --> 52:31.415
And that brings us to our
"NewsHour" Shares of the day,
something that caught our eye

52:31.415 --> 52:34.718
which might be of
interest to you, too.

52:34.718 --> 52:41.291
The John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation announced a
new class of Genius Grant
fellows

52:41.291 --> 52:46.663
today. The winners include an
urban sociologist, an
environmental engineer and
playwright Lin-Manuel

52:46.663 --> 52:49.500
Miranda.

52:49.500 --> 52:54.438
In a foundation video, Miranda
spoke of Hamilton, the Broadway
musical he wrote about founding

52:54.438 --> 52:58.442
father Alexander Hamilton
that opened in August.

52:58.442 --> 53:03.881
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA, Playwright:
I fall in love for a living. I
write musicals, and musicals

53:03.881 --> 53:08.786
take a long time to write. So,
when you have an idea, you
really have to fall in love with

53:08.786 --> 53:14.458
it.

53:14.458 --> 53:21.565
With Hamilton, it's a perfect
marriage of function and form.
Hip-hop is uniquely suited
