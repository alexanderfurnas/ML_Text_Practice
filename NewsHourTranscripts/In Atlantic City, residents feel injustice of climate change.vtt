>> Sreenivasan: GLOBAL SEA LEVEL

00:01.768 --> 00:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISE WENT UP 50% BETWEEN 1994

00:04.504 --> 00:06.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND 2014, ACCORDING TO A STUDY

00:06.406 --> 00:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUBLISHED THIS WEEK IN THE

00:07.640 --> 00:09.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOURNAL "NATURE CLIMATE CHANGE."

00:09.743 --> 00:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN 2014 ALONE, IT WENT UP AN

00:11.444 --> 00:12.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EIGHTH OF AN INCH.

00:12.712 --> 00:13.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT

00:13.646 --> 00:14.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE NUMBERS ACTUALLY MEAN,

00:14.914 --> 00:16.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE A LOOK AT THE INCREASING

00:16.216 --> 00:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER OF FLOODING EVENTS ALONG

00:17.517 --> 00:18.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED

00:18.752 --> 00:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES.

00:19.552 --> 00:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NONPROFIT CLIMATE CENTRAL

00:20.987 --> 00:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKED AT 90 CITIES FROM

00:22.522 --> 00:24.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSACHUSETTS TO FLORIDA.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDED IN THAT LIST ARE

00:25.291 --> 00:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATLANTIC CITY AND OTHER TOWNS ON

00:26.793 --> 00:28.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEW JERSEY SHORE.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I RECENTLY SPOKE TO THE REPORTER

00:29.195 --> 00:31.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THAT STORY, JOHN UPTON.

00:31.664 --> 00:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WORKED ON THIS FOR SIX

00:32.465 --> 00:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS; WHY FOCUS ON ATLANTIC

00:33.867 --> 00:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY?

00:34.300 --> 00:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, ATLANTIC CITY, TO A LOT

00:35.268 --> 00:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF US, THINK... WE THINK

00:36.202 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASINOS, THE TRUMP TAJ MAHAL, ET

00:38.505 --> 00:39.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CETERA, ET CETERA.

00:39.406 --> 00:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE PEOPLE

00:40.673 --> 00:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT LIVE THERE.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO, THE CLIMATE CENTRAL

00:42.442 --> 00:43.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCIENTISTS ACTUALLY CONDUCTED

00:43.977 --> 00:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANALYSIS.

00:44.611 --> 00:45.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY LOOKED AT HUNDREDS OF U.S.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COASTAL CITIES AND EXAMINED THE

00:48.581 --> 00:49.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASE THAT ARE EXPECTED AND

00:49.916 --> 00:50.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FLOOD RISKS IN EACH OF

00:50.750 --> 00:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY IDENTIFIED ABOUT 90 THAT

00:53.553 --> 00:55.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACE VERY SHARP INCREASES IN...

00:55.021 --> 00:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FLOODING RISKS.

00:56.289 --> 00:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF THESE CITIES TEND TO BE

00:57.457 --> 00:58.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILT ALONG BAYS, ALONG RIVERS,

00:58.725 --> 01:00.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEAR THE MOUTHS OF ESTUARIES, SO

01:00.593 --> 01:02.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE A VERY LOW TOPOGRAPHY.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE HIGHEST-RISK ONES TEND

01:04.864 --> 01:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE CLUSTERED ALONG THE MID-

01:06.099 --> 01:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATLANTIC.

01:07.033 --> 01:08.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ATLANTIC CITY SIMPLY SHOWED

01:08.168 --> 01:09.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP AS BEING ONE OF THE CITIES

01:09.436 --> 01:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FACES THE GREATEST RISKS.

01:11.871 --> 01:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, IT ALSO

01:13.506 --> 01:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS THIS GREAT INEQUITY AMONG

01:15.608 --> 01:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RICH AND THE POOR THAT...

01:17.143 --> 01:18.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A CITY THAT'S IN ECONOMIC

01:18.278 --> 01:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECLINE RIGHT NOW, SO I WANTED

01:19.846 --> 01:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO EXAMINE HOW... HOW THEY'RE

01:21.414 --> 01:22.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAPTING TO... TO THE CHANGES

01:22.715 --> 01:23.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN... IN SEA LEVEL THERE.

01:23.817 --> 01:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU ALSO TOOK

01:24.517 --> 01:25.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIDEO IN YOUR ARTICLE.

01:25.418 --> 01:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I KNOW YOU SPENT SIX MONTHS

01:26.386 --> 01:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKING ON THIS PROJECT.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A PIECE OF SOUND THAT WE

01:28.922 --> 01:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE FROM ONE OF THE RESIDENTS

01:29.789 --> 01:30.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

01:30.323 --> 01:31.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO HER.

01:31.724 --> 01:32.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT WASN'T THAT BAD.

01:32.792 --> 01:33.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WASN'T BAD WHEN YOU FIRST

01:33.860 --> 01:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVED IN HERE.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS EIGHT INCHES BEFORE.

01:38.098 --> 01:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER TEN INCHES, IT'S GOING

01:38.932 --> 01:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE IN THE HOUSE.

01:40.567 --> 01:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO

01:41.534 --> 01:44.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT A WASHER AND DRIER UP.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ALL REPLACEABLE, BUT IT'S

01:45.205 --> 01:47.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY HARD AND VERY INCONVENIENT.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MONEY, YOU KNOW.

01:49.709 --> 01:50.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THIS IS NOT

01:50.577 --> 01:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER HURRICANE SANDY.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAS AFTER WHAT KIND OF

01:53.513 --> 01:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEATHER?

01:54.147 --> 01:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS... WHEN THERE'S A... A

01:55.882 --> 01:57.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FULL MOON OR A NEW MOON, YOU GET

01:57.484 --> 01:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGHER TIDES THAN AT NORMAL

01:58.418 --> 01:59.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMES.

01:59.552 --> 02:01.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST YESTERDAY, I WAS RETWEETING

02:01.154 --> 02:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PICTURES FROM THIS STREET,

02:02.255 --> 02:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARIZONA AVENUE, ATLANTIC AVENUE,

02:03.790 --> 02:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WERE FLOODING SIMPLY

02:04.724 --> 02:06.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THERE WAS A HIGH TIDE

02:06.292 --> 02:08.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSOCIATED WITH A FULL MOON.

02:08.228 --> 02:08.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE WAS A

02:08.928 --> 02:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORM.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STORMS PUSH WATER FROM THE

02:12.232 --> 02:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COAST TOWARDS THE LAND.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, YOU HAVE THE TIDE ACTUALLY

02:15.001 --> 02:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISING UP IN THE STREET, COMING

02:16.736 --> 02:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THE STORM WATER DRAINS.

02:18.271 --> 02:19.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE SAME TIME AS THAT, YOU

02:19.205 --> 02:20.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE HEAVY RAIN-- OR EVEN ANY

02:20.940 --> 02:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAIN-- AND THE RAIN CAN'T DRAIN

02:22.575 --> 02:23.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WHAT YOU GET IS VERY

02:24.310 --> 02:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUBSTANTIAL FLOODING IN SOME OF

02:26.079 --> 02:26.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE

02:26.913 --> 02:27.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILT ALONG BAYS IN ATLANTIC

02:27.947 --> 02:28.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY.

02:28.715 --> 02:29.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WAS THE CASE IN THE

02:29.582 --> 02:30.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIDEO THAT YOU JUST SAW.

02:30.416 --> 02:31.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FACT OF LIFE ON-- IF THE

02:34.387 --> 02:35.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE RIGHT,

02:35.822 --> 02:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY A FULL MOON AND A

02:36.823 --> 02:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEAVY RAIN OR STORM, AND IT'S

02:38.158 --> 02:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER.

02:38.958 --> 02:39.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS CAN HAPPEN... THIS IS

02:39.726 --> 02:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING MONTHLY.

02:40.927 --> 02:41.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS HAPPENING ALL THE TIME.

02:41.961 --> 02:42.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RESIDENTS HAVE THEIR OWN

02:42.862 --> 02:44.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYSTEMS FOR DEALING WITH IT.

02:44.063 --> 02:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ALERT EACH OTHER WHEN THEY

02:45.431 --> 02:46.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THE WATERS RISING.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY... THEY'VE ALL LOST CARS.

02:48.034 --> 02:49.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY... THEY MOVE THEIR CARS.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY PARK THEM IN A GARAGE IN

02:50.370 --> 02:52.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DOWNTOWN AREA OR ON HIGHER

02:52.906 --> 02:54.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAND.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY PUT THEIR FURNITURE UP ON

02:56.242 --> 02:56.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON BLOCKS.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY TAKE PRECAUTIONS BECAUSE

02:58.244 --> 02:59.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE ALL EXPERIENCED SERIOUS

02:59.546 --> 03:01.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLOODS, AND SO THEY JUST TAKE

03:01.214 --> 03:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEASURES TO... TO MINIMIZE

03:02.148 --> 03:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:05.418 --> 03:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS DO TO THE PROPERTY VALUE?

03:06.252 --> 03:07.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M IMAGINING RIGHT NOW, AFTER I

03:07.554 --> 03:08.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THIS STORY, OR AT LEAST

03:08.588 --> 03:09.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

03:09.656 --> 03:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING FOR, I'M NOT GOING TO

03:11.057 --> 03:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUY A HOUSE THAT'S ON THAT

03:12.158 --> 03:12.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STREET.

03:12.859 --> 03:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

03:13.626 --> 03:15.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE, IF THEY CAN'T SELL IT...

03:15.395 --> 03:16.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND SO, IT'S NOT ONLY THAT

03:16.963 --> 03:17.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S UNAPPEALING BECAUSE IT'S

03:17.931 --> 03:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLOODING, BUT ATLANTIC CITY IS

03:28.007 --> 03:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FOR LESS THAN $35,000 EACH.

03:41.421 --> 03:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT

03:42.488 --> 03:43.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESIDENTS WHO ARE SOME OUT OF

03:43.556 --> 03:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:45.658 --> 03:46.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIED UP IN THEIR HOUSE.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CAN'T SELL THEIR PROPERTY.

03:53.366 --> 03:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY... THEY FEEL VERY TRAPPED.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THEM REALLY EXPRESSED

03:57.503 --> 03:59.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME VERY STRONG EMOTIONS TO ME.

03:59.038 --> 03:59.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:07.247 --> 04:10.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ONE IS IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA.

04:20.927 --> 04:21.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A BIG SEAWALL THAT'S

04:21.961 --> 04:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING BUILT TO PROTECT THE

04:23.463 --> 04:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASINOS AND THE DOWNTOWN AREA.

04:25.064 --> 04:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE ALSO ABOUT TO SPEND TENS

THESE ARE HOLIDAY HOUSES.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THEY'RE GETTING PROTECTIONS

04:39.145 --> 04:39.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE ACTUALLY

04:39.946 --> 04:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUED TO TRY TO PREVENT THE

TO LOSE THEIR VIEWS.

04:43.683 --> 04:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, ALL AROUND THESE RESIDENTS,

THEY CAN SEE THE FEDERAL

04:58.231 --> 05:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:27.927 --> 05:28.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERIOUS HERE.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

POLLUTION INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S CAUSING THE SEAS TO RISE.

05:32.532 --> 05:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE NEED TO TAKE MEASURES

TO... TO STOP THAT.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

>> THE ONLY REASON THAT YOU CAN

$20 BILLION IN ARREARS.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
