JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.405 --> 00:06.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:08.175 --> 00:11.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
changes at the top of Donald
Trump's campaign.

00:11.645 --> 00:15.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk with the new manager,
ask why and
what will be different.

00:15.649 --> 00:20.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead:
From raging
fires on California's charred
lands to deadly

00:20.621 --> 00:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flooding in Louisiana, we take a
look at the
country's battle with extreme
weather.

00:24.791 --> 00:31.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And powerful
national security
hacking tools leaked online put
computer networks

00:31.632 --> 00:33.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at risk.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus, an
inside look at
the world's most active volcano
-- how one

00:36.603 --> 00:41.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
geologist is using the constant
flow of data
to learn more about the Hawaiian
landmark.

00:41.808 --> 00:44.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE GARCIA, Geologist,
University of Hawaii:
Well, with most volcanoes, you
want to know

00:44.778 --> 00:46.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when it's going to erupt.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so that's a primary concern.

00:48.548 --> 00:52.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in this case, where we have
an eruption
that's been going on for over 30
years, the

00:52.719 --> 00:54.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big question is, when is it
going to stop?

00:54.321 --> 00:57.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:57.291 --> 01:01.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.662 --> 01:14.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
presidential
nominee is bringing new leaders
to his campaign

01:14.574 --> 01:17.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
team, and not for the first
time.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:19.046 --> 01:23.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There was a new
seating chart at
Donald Trump's campaign
headquarters in Trump

01:23.350 --> 01:25.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tower today.

01:25.185 --> 01:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican nominee was still
in the center
chair, but around him, signs of
a leadership

01:30.590 --> 01:36.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shuffle, the second in less than
two months,
as polls show him losing ground.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The new campaign CEO?

01:38.598 --> 01:40.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stephen Bannon.

01:40.534 --> 01:46.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bannon, top executive of the
combative conservative
Web site Breitbart News, is new
to political

01:46.873 --> 01:48.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
companies.

01:48.408 --> 01:52.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump also promoted senior
adviser Kellyanne
Conway to campaign manager.

01:52.612 --> 01:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conway, a longtime pollster,
will focus on
messaging, as she did this
morning on FOX

01:58.652 --> 02:00.320 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Manager:
It's the busy homestretch to
Election Day,

02:02.389 --> 02:09.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we just need to sort of beef
up the senior-level
roles in a way that we are
dividing and conquering.

02:09.062 --> 02:14.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Paul Manafort, top
aide for the
past two months, will keep his
title of campaign

02:14.868 --> 02:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chairman, though his role is
unclear.

02:17.637 --> 02:22.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News of the shakeup came after a
Trump rally
in Wisconsin last night, where,
for the second

02:22.442 --> 02:26.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
day in a row, he used a
teleprompter as he
tried to broaden the field.

02:26.513 --> 02:32.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I'm asking for the vote of every
African-American

02:32.452 --> 02:38.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizen struggling in our
country today who
wants a different and much
better future.

02:38.992 --> 02:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He spoke not far from
Milwaukee,
still reeling from unrest
touched off by a

02:44.598 --> 02:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weekend police shooting that
left a 23-year-old
black man dead.

02:49.136 --> 02:56.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The violence,
riots and destruction
that have taken place in
Milwaukee is an assault

02:56.543 --> 03:02.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the right of all citizens to
live in security
and to live in peace.

03:02.549 --> 03:07.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Trump was to
receive his
first intelligence briefing as
the Republican

03:07.254 --> 03:09.122 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nominee.

03:09.156 --> 03:13.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's despite telling FOX News
on Tuesday
what he thought about the work
of U.S. intelligence

03:13.827 --> 03:14.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agencies.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Look what's happened over the
last 10 years,"
he said.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"It's been catastrophic."

03:19.533 --> 03:22.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic nominee Hillary
Clinton is to briefed
as well.

03:22.469 --> 03:26.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, her campaign wouldn't
answer questions
about it.

03:26.173 --> 03:30.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton was campaigning in
Cleveland, Ohio,
today, trying to fortify her
slim polling

03:30.777 --> 03:32.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lead in a critical swing state.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I think it's fair to say that
Donald Trump

03:35.115 --> 03:36.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has shown us who he is.

03:36.716 --> 03:42.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He can hire and fire anybody he
wants from
his campaign.

03:42.355 --> 03:45.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can make him read new words
from a teleprompter.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:47.494 --> 03:55.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: But he
is still the
same man who insults Gold Star
families, demeans

03:55.235 --> 03:56.269 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

03:56.303 --> 03:58.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no new Donald Trump.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is it.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump is to take a
new step in
his campaign later this week,
airing his very

04:03.310 --> 04:06.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first general election ads in
swing states.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:09.216 --> 04:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will talk with
Trump's new
campaign manager, Kellyanne
Conway, right

04:14.821 --> 04:16.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

04:16.690 --> 04:20.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
Turkey announced plans to
release some 38,000

04:20.494 --> 04:25.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prison inmates to make room for
people rounded
up after last month's failed
coup attempt.

04:25.465 --> 04:29.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prisoners with two years or less
left on their
sentence will qualify for early
release, but

04:29.903 --> 04:33.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the most violent criminals will
not be eligible.

04:33.273 --> 04:37.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Turkish authorities have
detained roughly
40,000 people linked to the coup
plot.

04:37.677 --> 04:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
About half of them face formal
charges.

04:39.813 --> 04:44.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the White
House pledged $17 million to
help fight opioid

04:44.918 --> 04:46.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and heroin abuse.

04:46.653 --> 04:51.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will help law enforcement
agencies halt
drug trafficking and prevent
overdoses.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Obama administration
urged Congress
to do more.

04:55.028 --> 04:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president signed a bill
aimed at addressing
the opioid crisis last month.

04:59.432 --> 05:04.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it fell far short of the
more than $1
billion that his administration
requested

05:04.437 --> 05:06.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to fight the epidemic.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The nation's
commuter and
freight trains have shown little
progress

05:09.309 --> 05:13.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in installing safety
technologies mandated
by Congress.

05:13.413 --> 05:17.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's according to a new report
out today
from the Federal Railroad
Administration.

05:17.651 --> 05:23.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The safety system uses GPS and
radio frequencies
to automatically stop or slow
trains, preventing

05:23.757 --> 05:25.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
collisions and derailments.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was supposed to be installed
by 2015.

05:27.961 --> 05:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Congress had to extend that
deadline until
at least 2018 after projects
were delayed

05:32.999 --> 05:35.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by a lack of funding and
technical obstacles.

05:35.569 --> 05:41.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Technology firm
Cisco announced
that it will lay off up to 5,500
employees,

05:41.875 --> 05:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
roughly 7 percent of its work
force.

05:44.211 --> 05:49.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The world's largest manufacturer
of computer
networking equipment has seen a
slowing demand

05:49.349 --> 05:51.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for its products.

05:51.251 --> 05:56.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's tried to shift its
focus into software
and cloud-based networking in
the face of

05:56.122 --> 05:57.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
growing competition.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On Wall
Street, stocks managed
modest gains after minutes from
the Federal

06:01.194 --> 06:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reserve's last policy meeting
signaled it
could raise interest rates soon.

06:05.999 --> 06:10.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained nearly
22 points to close above 18573.

06:10.670 --> 06:13.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose a point, and the
S&amp;P 500 added
four points.

06:14.007 --> 06:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And controversy
continues to
brew behind the scenes at the
Olympic Games.

06:18.945 --> 06:24.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brazilian police arrested
Europe's top Olympic
official, Patrick Hickey of
Ireland, at his

06:24.951 --> 06:28.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rio hotel room, and charged him
with ticket
scalping.

06:28.288 --> 06:34.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a Brazilian judge
ordered American
swimmers Ryan Lochte and Jimmy
Feigen to stay

06:34.127 --> 06:40.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Rio, claiming they gave
conflicting accounts
of being robbed at gunpoint last
week.

06:40.300 --> 06:44.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lochte has already returned to
the U.S., but
Feigen is still in Brazil.

06:44.304 --> 06:47.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump's new campaign
manager on the

06:47.874 --> 06:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
latest shakeup; Louisiana
flooding and California
wildfires, the increasing
frequency of natural

06:54.447 --> 07:00.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disasters; an English community
that could
lose its E.U. subsidies after
voting for Brexit;

07:00.687 --> 07:05.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

07:05.158 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return now to
the changes
at the top of the Trump campaign
and what

07:17.304 --> 07:23.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led to all this, with Robert
Costa, national
political reporter for The
Washington Post.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Robert, welcome back to the
program.

07:24.844 --> 07:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it was just two months ago
we saw a change
at the top of the Trump
campaign.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what happened?

07:31.284 --> 07:35.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA, The Washington
Post: That change
two months ago saw Paul
Manafort, the campaign

07:35.388 --> 07:40.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chairman, take control of the
Trump campaign
from Corey Lewandowski, the
longtime campaign

07:40.060 --> 07:41.828 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
manager.

07:41.861 --> 07:46.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it was a change of
philosophy back then
from let Trump be Trump to a
more disciplined

07:46.166 --> 07:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strategy, more party unity, more
focus on
a scripted message.

07:50.637 --> 07:54.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has scrapped that Manafort
playbook,
however, over the weekend,
deciding to go

07:54.841 --> 08:00.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with this new team, Steve Bannon
from Breitbart,
Kellyanne Conway, the longtime
pollster who

08:00.280 --> 08:02.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he is friendly with.

08:02.182 --> 08:06.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's because Trump,
according to my sources,
is looking at these last 80
days, and he says

08:06.519 --> 08:10.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to himself, he wants to do it
his way, run
from the gut, run on his
instincts.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, tell us
about Stephen
Bannon.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.862 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who is he?

08:15.895 --> 08:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is not somebody we have known
associated
with the campaign, although we
know he's been

08:19.399 --> 08:21.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
close to Mr. Trump.

08:21.234 --> 08:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: He's a colorful
and populist
figure on the American right,
someone who's

08:26.306 --> 08:31.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not closely associated with the
Republican
Party, hasn't run a presidential
campaign

08:31.778 --> 08:35.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before, has rarely, if ever,
been involved
with political campaigns.

08:35.882 --> 08:40.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he has been running this Web
site Breitbart
News, which is popular for its
nationalist

08:40.987 --> 08:44.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
themes, its advocacy against
illegal immigration.

08:44.424 --> 08:48.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has become close to figures
like Sarah
Palin over the past decade.

08:48.862 --> 08:55.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this profile on a certain
segment of the
American right has brought him
close to Trump.

08:55.301 --> 08:58.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His politics overlap with
Trump's own.

08:58.271 --> 09:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has been someone who has
provided Trump
with informal candid advice over
the past

09:03.276 --> 09:05.078 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

09:05.111 --> 09:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump has developed this
rapport and has
turned to Bannon at many turns
as he's thought

09:08.248 --> 09:10.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about his campaign.

09:10.049 --> 09:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Robert, what
do your sources
tell you we should expect to see
change in

09:14.687 --> 09:18.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's behavior on the campaign
trail and
the campaign itself?

09:18.391 --> 09:23.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Bannon's strategy,
according
to people close to both Trump
and Bannon,

09:23.563 --> 09:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to run a less partisan
campaign than Paul
Manafort may have advised for
Trump in recent

09:30.069 --> 09:31.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

09:31.971 --> 09:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I mean by that is a
populist campaign
that doesn't stress political
issues in the

09:37.010 --> 09:41.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
traditional way you see in a
general election
campaign of right vs. left.

09:41.648 --> 09:45.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we should expect to see
from Trump, according
to the people who were in
meetings with him

09:45.485 --> 09:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, is a full-throated
nationalist message,
something that is based on
rallies, media

09:51.758 --> 09:56.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appearances, and trying to rouse
those voters,
working-class voters in swing
states.

09:56.529 --> 09:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what is meant
by nationalist
message?

09:59.199 --> 10:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: It is something
that is based
in Trump's pitch about
immigration and trade

10:05.538 --> 10:12.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the economic frustration
that Trump believes
is out there in much of the
American -- much

10:12.078 --> 10:13.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

10:13.980 --> 10:18.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is a sense that jobs
should stay here,
products should be made here,
foreign policy

10:19.018 --> 10:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be crafted from an almost
isolationist
perspective, America first, as
Trump often

10:24.290 --> 10:25.992 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
says.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Robert, the
people you
talk to inside the campaign, do
they still

10:28.595 --> 10:30.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
believe they can win this?

10:30.597 --> 10:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we know the polls have
been difficult
in the last month for Mr. Trump.

10:34.100 --> 10:40.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: They believe there
is a difficult
path ahead, but they look at two
things.

10:40.206 --> 10:46.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They think suburban voters in
places like
North Carolina, Ohio and
Pennsylvania remain

10:46.379 --> 10:50.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intrigued by Trump, interested
in perhaps
switching over to Trump in the
final stretch,

10:50.950 --> 10:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even if they are skittish at
Trump at the
moment and moving toward Clinton
in the polls.

10:55.688 --> 11:00.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Trump can change his message
to really
zero in on those voters by
focusing on national

11:00.426 --> 11:04.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
security, populism and
nationalism, the Trump
campaign thinks they have a
shot.

11:04.931 --> 11:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing they are going
to try to win
over is more women voters.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is where Kellyanne
Conway comes in.

11:08.935 --> 11:13.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She spent her whole career
trying to help
Republicans appeal more to the
female voter.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's going to be part of
the equation
moving ahead.

11:15.775 --> 11:20.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally,
Robert, do they
lead you to believe this is the
last change

11:20.046 --> 11:21.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we will see in the campaign?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: You never know
with Donald Trump.

11:23.216 --> 11:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He kept this decision close to
his vest over
the weekend, didn't tell many
party leaders,

11:28.454 --> 11:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if any, that he was going to
make this overhaul
in his campaign.

11:32.091 --> 11:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is someone who runs a small
operation compared
to most presidential campaigns.

11:37.196 --> 11:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is someone who is a lone
loner in American
politics, almost an isolated
figure, who believes

11:43.269 --> 11:48.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his own calls on political
issues, on strategy
matter more than any kind of
consultant's

11:48.841 --> 11:50.209 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
advice.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Costa with
The Washington
Post, we thank you.

11:52.745 --> 11:54.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Thank you.

11:54.547 --> 11:59.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now let's get
an inside
view of today's changes in the
Trump campaign

11:59.152 --> 12:00.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the woman we have just been
hearing about.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the new campaign manager,
Kellyanne
Conway.

12:03.723 --> 12:04.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kellyanne, hello.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's good to see you.

12:06.559 --> 12:11.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just heard Robert Costa say
this has to
do in part with Donald Trump,
frankly, wanting

12:11.764 --> 12:15.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less discipline, wanting to be
himself on
the campaign trail.

12:15.335 --> 12:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that what is going on?

12:17.070 --> 12:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Manager:
Well, first of all, Judy, thank
you for having

12:20.540 --> 12:21.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

12:21.541 --> 12:22.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I appreciate your
congratulations.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, everybody is always talking
about the
Donald Trump pivot.

12:25.511 --> 12:28.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pivot is style when they give
him advice.

12:28.181 --> 12:33.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's, don't say this, don't say
that, you
should do this, you shouldn't do
that.

12:33.052 --> 12:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think when he says, you
know, he gets
tired of being told by different
people inside

12:37.357 --> 12:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and outside of what to do and
how to speak,
it doesn't free him to talk
about the issues,

12:42.762 --> 12:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is where he really wants
to take this
campaign.

12:44.597 --> 12:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the discipline you have
seen this
week is in giving those
speeches, on Monday

12:50.003 --> 12:54.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about radical Islamic terrorism,
where, whether
people liked the speech and the
solutions

12:54.474 --> 12:56.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or not, at least they can look
at them.

12:56.142 --> 12:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can look at the road map.

12:57.977 --> 13:02.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They can look at the
several-point plan and
decide whether or not that is
the commander

13:02.048 --> 13:03.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in chief they would like to
trust.

13:03.983 --> 13:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, he followed it up
with a very unusual,
very robust policy speech,
really taking the

13:08.388 --> 13:13.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case to Hillary Clinton and
putting her on
the hot seat to explain why,
after decades

13:13.693 --> 13:17.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of public service herself, while
she has been
a politician for decades, and
why in all of

13:17.930 --> 13:22.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
our big cities, we have
Democratic mayors,
and we have a rise in poverty
and crime and

13:22.869 --> 13:24.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
homelessness, a rise in
unemployment.

13:24.671 --> 13:29.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think he's taking the case
right back
to Hillary Clinton, which is
really his best

13:29.075 --> 13:30.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shot at winning the presidency.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what we just
heard from
Robert Costa -- and it's been
reported -- the

13:33.913 --> 13:39.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other new person -- or the new
person elevated,
I should say, in the campaign is
Stephen Bannon,

13:39.852 --> 13:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who does come from Breitbart
News.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And why would Donald Trump turn
to him?

13:45.058 --> 13:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is someone who has never run
a campaign
before.

13:46.893 --> 13:51.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has been associated with this
pretty controversial
news Web site.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does Mr. Bannon bring?

13:53.232 --> 13:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Donald Trump
said it best,
Judy, where he said: I know them
well, and

13:58.504 --> 14:03.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want people who want to win
and who believe
I can win and who are warriors.

14:03.176 --> 14:07.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Bannon is a guy
ready for the
right kind of battle, realizing
that this

14:07.914 --> 14:09.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a pretty simple choice.

14:09.749 --> 14:14.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You either want Donald Trump's
view of free
market health care, where it is
portable and

14:14.987 --> 14:21.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is affordable and is accessible
to more people,
or you want more of Aetna
pulling out of 11

14:21.127 --> 14:26.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to 15 states just yesterday,
announcing $430
million worth of losses over the
last two

14:26.432 --> 14:28.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

14:28.267 --> 14:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That followed UnitedHealthcare
saying it would
suffer a billion dollars in
losses by being

14:32.105 --> 14:33.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the exchange.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are serious issues that
impact people.

14:35.108 --> 14:39.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to Bob Costa and to your
point, Judy,
women are the chief health care
officers of

14:39.345 --> 14:41.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their households.

14:41.247 --> 14:46.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These health care exchange
realities on Obamacare
are very real to them, as the
chief health

14:46.853 --> 14:48.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care officers.

14:48.621 --> 14:52.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we would like to know if
Mrs. Clinton
owns Obamacare, in other words,
if she feels

14:52.658 --> 14:54.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like it is a good policy moving
forward.

14:54.260 --> 14:58.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Would she move us towards a
single-payer system,
a la Bernie Sanders?

14:58.197 --> 15:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are there pieces of Obamacare,
the Affordable
Care Act, that she would scrap
or the ones

15:01.701 --> 15:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that she thinks are worth
keeping?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need those questions
answered.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you pivot, the pivot really
needs to
be on substance, when you start
talking about

15:08.574 --> 15:13.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
issues, and not just
individuals, when you
start talking about principles,
and not just

15:13.346 --> 15:14.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
personalities.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then we're having a conversation
befitting
of the voters.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's try
to understand
what this is, because, again, we
just heard

15:19.886 --> 15:25.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Robert Costa describe an
approach that is
going to try to be not so
partisan, not so

15:25.892 --> 15:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- quote, unquote -- "Republican
vs. Democratic."

15:29.529 --> 15:35.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we know that the Breitbart
News Web site
is what they call -- it's been
called alt-right,

15:35.034 --> 15:42.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a movement of hard-right
ideologues and white
nationalists who scorn
traditional conservatism.

15:42.408 --> 15:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that the philosophy Mr. Trump
is embracing?

15:44.710 --> 15:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: No, it's not.

15:46.779 --> 15:50.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's, I guess, someone's
opinion or
characterization of a Web site
or stories

15:50.783 --> 15:52.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on a Web site.

15:52.652 --> 15:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, I would
like to point
out, because I think too much of
the reporting

15:57.423 --> 16:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has said that this is a reset,
this is a shakeup.

16:02.695 --> 16:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact is, just over there in
Trump Tower
today, the core four, Manafort
and Gates,

16:06.432 --> 16:11.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have been for on for a
while, Bannon and
myself, we met on any number of
issues.

16:11.337 --> 16:15.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We reviewed the last cuts of our
ads that
are going up this weekend.

16:15.842 --> 16:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sat in, all four of us sat in
on the roundtable
with national security and
terrorism and foreign

16:22.148 --> 16:23.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
policy experts.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I believe you showed some
footage from there.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we are all working together.

16:27.253 --> 16:32.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is an expansion of a team
in these critical
last couple of weeks.

16:32.692 --> 16:37.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think what is very
important is that
the candidate trusts the people
around them.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you see who is there.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite what Hillary Clinton
said today -- that
was a complete lie.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody got fired at the Trump
campaign today.

16:45.671 --> 16:49.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody is feeding him -- I found
that to be
really unbecoming, to talk about
Donald Trump

16:50.009 --> 16:52.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reading new words off a
teleprompter.

16:52.211 --> 16:56.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this has to go both
ways, where she
is pretty insulting of him.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I appreciate that it's
actually getting
covered here.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you a little
bit more, Kellyanne Conway,
though, about

17:02.255 --> 17:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where you do stand in the polls.

17:03.856 --> 17:04.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You are a pollster.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have made it your career.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you read the polls?

17:08.728 --> 17:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Donald Trump right now
is running
behind in virtually every single
battleground

17:12.398 --> 17:13.532 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, he is,
but with varying
margins.

17:16.769 --> 17:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Judy, we're happy that it
is August and
not October or November.

17:20.506 --> 17:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We recognize that there is work
to do.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some of that work is among
independent
voters.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some is among Republicans.

17:27.079 --> 17:32.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some is among the work to be
done among
Democrats who, in the same
polls, say that

17:32.418 --> 17:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they just don't trust or much
like Hillary
Clinton.

17:34.620 --> 17:37.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we feel like they are open
to our message.

17:37.423 --> 17:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are going to work hard
for all those
votes.

17:38.958 --> 17:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is what campaigns are for.

17:40.927 --> 17:44.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Campaigns are really for
combining the message,
the messenger, the delivery, the
opportunities,

17:45.031 --> 17:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ground game, the data
operation, all of
which is really coming into
place.

17:49.335 --> 17:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have to credit Manafort
and Gates for
putting so much of that together
before we

17:52.939 --> 17:54.740 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
arrived.

17:54.774 --> 17:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, if you look at the
horse race numbers
in these statewide polls, Judy,
they look

17:58.177 --> 17:59.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really great for Hillary
Clinton.

18:00.012 --> 18:04.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you go just a little bit
underneath,
you see that many of her
fundamental measurements

18:04.383 --> 18:06.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are still very poor.

18:06.285 --> 18:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have -- in the Virginia
poll, for example,
you have 54 percent of
Virginians saying they

18:10.923 --> 18:12.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are unfavorable towards Hillary
Clinton.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is not a lot that she can
do to change
that image, because they already
know her;

18:15.928 --> 18:20.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
68 percent said that the
selection of Tim
Kaine doesn't matter to their
vote; 66 percent

18:20.199 --> 18:22.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the white voters there say
that they are
unfavorable towards her.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, let
me...

18:23.736 --> 18:25.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: So, she really
needs to
work on those as well.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I just want to
squeeze in one
last question.

18:27.406 --> 18:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the description of
the philosophy
of this campaign as nationalist,
almost isolationist,

18:34.613 --> 18:36.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is that something you accept?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: No.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I -- in fact, I emphatically
reject it.

18:39.719 --> 18:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I said, Judy, just hours
ago, I sat
in a roundtable with former and
current congressmen,

18:46.158 --> 18:51.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with generals, with elected
officials at very
high levels, with national
security and foreign

18:51.163 --> 18:52.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
policy experts.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that wasn't the talk around
the -- that
wasn't the conversation around
the table,

18:55.668 --> 18:56.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I assure you.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We allowed the press in.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so, no, I reject it.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm not surprised critics
and naysayers
have to do that.

19:02.708 --> 19:08.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, the only thing I would ask
of the Clinton
campaign and many of their
sympathizers is,

19:08.481 --> 19:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you are asked a question
about Hillary
Clinton, try not to say Donald
Trump every

19:12.051 --> 19:13.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other word.

19:13.052 --> 19:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is where criticisms like
that come from.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people -- if you have a
real debate
on the issues, you go back and
look at the

19:17.923 --> 19:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radical Islamic speech from
Monday, you go
back and look at the law and
order speech

19:21.394 --> 19:26.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the minority community
speech yesterday,
you find that that
characterization is patently

19:26.332 --> 19:28.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
false.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I think I
was hearing
Robert Costa quote people he was
talking to

19:30.269 --> 19:33.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from inside the campaign, but we
can straighten
that out later.

19:33.973 --> 19:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kellyanne Conway, again, the
newly named campaign
manager for Donald Trump, thank
you very much.

19:38.677 --> 19:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Thank you,
Judy.

19:45.918 --> 19:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Two major
disasters in two
different parts of the country
have sent tens

19:55.895 --> 20:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of thousands of people fleeing
from their
homes, and caused millions of
dollars in damage.

20:01.133 --> 20:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are these just freak events, or
are they in
some way related to climate
change?

20:06.138 --> 20:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham brings us the
latest.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's called
the Blue Cut
Fire, and it's wreaking havoc in
Southern

20:12.778 --> 20:14.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
California.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The massive blaze closed major
roadways like
part of Interstate-15 that
connects Los Angeles

20:18.317 --> 20:19.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Las Vegas.

20:19.952 --> 20:24.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And last night, officials issued
evacuation
orders for more than 34,000
homes.

20:24.256 --> 20:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's some 82,000 people.

20:26.125 --> 20:31.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I think this is the worst
that I have
ever seen, you know?

20:31.330 --> 20:37.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's kind of getting used to
the idea
of being homeless.

20:37.069 --> 20:41.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The fire
erupted yesterday
in the Cajon Pass, a critical
corridor just

20:41.707 --> 20:45.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
north of San Bernardino, only 60
miles from
Los Angeles.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It quickly expanded to more than
45 square
miles.

20:49.215 --> 20:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten air tankers, 15 helicopters
and some 1,300
firefighters were deployed
within 24 hours.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They faced hot and windy
conditions.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL WAKOSKI, San Bernardino
County Fire
Battalion Chief: The fuels are
extremely dry

20:59.859 --> 21:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and very explosive this time of
year.

21:03.095 --> 21:08.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in my 40 years of fighting
fire, I have
never seen fire behavior so
extreme as it

21:08.567 --> 21:10.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was yesterday.

21:10.402 --> 21:11.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK HARTWIG, San Bernardino
County Fire Chief:
I was able to get up this
morning and get

21:11.937 --> 21:14.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some eyes on it from the air.

21:14.273 --> 21:19.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a word, it was devastating, a
lot of homes
lost yesterday.

21:19.979 --> 21:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There'll be a lot of families
that come home
to nothing.

21:23.315 --> 21:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Governor Jerry
Brown declared
a state of emergency for the
Blue Cut area,

21:27.319 --> 21:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as he did earlier this week for
a major blaze
north of San Francisco.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That fire has since started to
fade.

21:33.792 --> 21:38.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man suspected of sparking
it, as well
as 16 smaller fires over the
last year, has

21:38.397 --> 21:41.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now been charged with arson.

21:41.967 --> 21:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seventeen hundred miles across
the country,
a different kind of disaster is
unfolding

21:46.205 --> 21:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Louisiana, where some of the
worst floods
in history have hit the state.

21:51.243 --> 21:55.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the water begins to recede in
some parts,
the numbers are stark.

21:55.347 --> 22:01.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 11 people have died,
30,000 people
have been rescued, and 40,000
homes damaged.

22:01.720 --> 22:06.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We lost everything, God,
just about.

22:06.392 --> 22:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We got out safely and all of our
friends are
safe, so that's the main thing.

22:12.831 --> 22:17.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So far, about
68,000 people
have signed up for assistance
from the Federal

22:17.403 --> 22:19.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Emergency Management Agency.

22:19.305 --> 22:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The American Red Cross says this
flooding
has triggered its largest
disaster operation

22:23.976 --> 22:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since Superstorm Sandy in 2012.

22:26.979 --> 22:31.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The catastrophes in California
and Louisiana
have again raised the question:
Are these

22:31.684 --> 22:35.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
events caused in part by global
climate change?

22:35.054 --> 22:40.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both events follow a July that
was the planet's
single hottest month since
records began in

22:40.092 --> 22:45.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 19th century, and many
computer models
have indicated that, as
temperatures rise,

22:45.064 --> 22:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
droughts and extreme weather are
likely to
follow.

22:48.300 --> 22:52.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help us sort out what's
driving these extreme
events, we turn to two
scientists well-versed

22:52.871 --> 22:54.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in these matters.

22:54.673 --> 22:58.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barry Keim is a climatologist
for the state
of Louisiana and a professor at
Louisiana

22:58.277 --> 23:04.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State University, and Adam Sobel
is a professor
of environmental science at
Columbia University.

23:04.116 --> 23:07.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also directs its Initiative
on Extreme
Weather and Climate.

23:07.753 --> 23:08.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for being here.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Barry, I would like to start
with you.

23:11.557 --> 23:14.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before we get into the science
of all of this,
can you just tell us, how are
things in Baton

23:14.460 --> 23:16.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rouge right now?

23:16.362 --> 23:18.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY KEIM, Louisiana State
University: Well,
in Baton Rouge, they are
improving, but across

23:18.130 --> 23:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the broader area, there still
are some issues.

23:20.866 --> 23:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Things are slowly starting to
settle down
or simmer down a little bit.

23:24.036 --> 23:28.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, across most of
my immediate
region, people have already
started ripping

23:28.540 --> 23:30.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out carpets and gutting houses.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we're already starting the
cleanup.

23:32.144 --> 23:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, this was
obviously a
historic amount of rainfall that
fell on your

23:36.482 --> 23:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state and that flooded you all
out.

23:38.851 --> 23:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you give us a sense of the
context of
how serious these storms were,
and should

23:44.290 --> 23:46.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we be thinking about these in
terms of climate
change?

23:46.825 --> 23:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY KEIM: This event was -- it
was a tropical
disturbance.

23:48.894 --> 23:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a very weak -- in fact,
it -- I would
classify it practically as an
easterly wave.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the amount of rainfall
amounts, as I suggested,
were staggering.

23:56.902 --> 24:04.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just to put this in perspective,
a 100-year
rain event in this region is
roughly 14 inches.

24:04.176 --> 24:07.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A 1,000-year event is about 21
inches.

24:07.413 --> 24:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we have about eight sites,
seven or
eight sites across Southeast
Louisiana or

24:11.317 --> 24:14.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Central Louisiana that
exceeded the
1,000-year mark.

24:14.520 --> 24:19.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, we have one site
that had 30
-- over 31 inches of rain.

24:20.025 --> 24:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, 1,000-year event is 21
inches, and this
was 31 inches.

24:24.129 --> 24:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that ought to give you some
context on
just how severe this rainstorm
was across

24:27.566 --> 24:29.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this area.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In that
context, do you
think of this as something that
is -- what

24:32.438 --> 24:36.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we would expect to see with
climate change,
or is that not part of your
thinking?

24:36.108 --> 24:41.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY KEIM: Well, no single
event really tells
you anything about climate
change specifically,

24:42.014 --> 24:43.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and even one year's worth of
events.

24:43.782 --> 24:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, admittedly, this past year
has been very
strange.

24:46.185 --> 24:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had the floods in South
Carolina.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Texas had some serious floods.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We even had a major flood
earlier this year
in Louisiana.

24:52.825 --> 24:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, we even had an early
one back in
this past October which was
quite extraordinary.

24:57.896 --> 25:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it does seem like there is
something unusual
going on.

25:01.300 --> 25:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I still wouldn't quite
characterize this
as being a sign that the climate
has officially

25:07.039 --> 25:08.107 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
changed.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are just in a very unusual
period right
now.

25:09.975 --> 25:13.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this could be indicative of
climate change,
but it's way, way too early.

25:13.479 --> 25:17.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need a lot more data and
understanding
of the science to be able to say
something

25:17.516 --> 25:18.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conclusively like that.

25:18.951 --> 25:22.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Adam Sobel, I
would put
the same question to you.

25:22.287 --> 25:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In California, we have seen this
historic
drought.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It has dried out the landscape.

25:26.291 --> 25:30.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is partly why we have seen
these explosive
fires across the state there.

25:30.396 --> 25:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again droughts are not
unusual for California,
the same way floods are not
unusual for Louisiana.

25:35.501 --> 25:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you see these in relation
to climate
change?

25:37.403 --> 25:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SOBEL, Columbia University:
Well, I think
you have to talk about each
event separately.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So let's start with the
Louisiana event.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the California situation
is a little
bit different and has been going
on for a

25:46.278 --> 25:47.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
number of years.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there have actually been a
few studies
specifically on that event.

25:49.648 --> 25:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But since we're talking about
Louisiana and
the floods now, just for some
general context,

25:54.920 --> 25:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, across the United
States, as well
as most places in the world
where there is

25:58.791 --> 26:03.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
adequate data to ask the
question, we have
seen increases over the last
decades, or in

26:03.662 --> 26:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some cases the last century, in
the extremity
of severe rain events.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we see heavy rain events
becoming heavier
and a larger fraction of the
rain falling

26:12.004 --> 26:13.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at heavy events.

26:13.839 --> 26:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is what our climate
projections tell
us should happen as the climate
warms, although

26:17.509 --> 26:21.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to uncertain degrees, but it's
qualitatively
consistent.

26:21.146 --> 26:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we expect it on physical
grounds, as a
warming climate means that there
is more water

26:26.118 --> 26:27.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vapor in the atmosphere.

26:27.853 --> 26:32.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, it's true that each
individual event
is a result of many factors, and
climate change

26:32.257 --> 26:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is at most one of them, and
usually a small
one.

26:35.227 --> 26:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So a lot of things have to
happen for an extreme
event to occur.

26:38.397 --> 26:39.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, it wouldn't be an
extreme event.

26:40.032 --> 26:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so climate change can at
most push the
odds a little bit in one
direction.

26:43.368 --> 26:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I mean, we now have a new
emerging area
of science called extreme event
attribution,

26:49.475 --> 26:53.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where people actually do studies
and have
ways of making probabilistic
statements.

26:53.278 --> 26:57.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't ever say this event
was caused by
climate change or this single
event is conclusive

26:57.249 --> 26:59.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
evidence of climate change.

26:59.084 --> 27:02.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you can say that climate
change appears
to have made it such a percent
more probable,

27:02.588 --> 27:06.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or given that it occurred, make
it such and
such percent more extreme.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those studies haven't yet been
done on the
Louisiana event.

27:09.595 --> 27:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My guess is that they will be
done pretty
soon.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can get done pretty quickly
now.

27:13.332 --> 27:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would cautiously predict
that they are
going to show some increase in
the likelihood

27:17.536 --> 27:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this happening due to climate
change, although
I wouldn't want to put a number
on it.

27:21.006 --> 27:22.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that is the sort of broad
context.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is the kind of thing
we expect
to see more as the future
proceeds.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's the kind of thing we
have been seeing.

27:28.580 --> 27:34.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I agree that to make
stronger statements
than that about a specific
event, it is certainly

27:34.586 --> 27:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
possible to overstate the
connection.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a lot of science
behind the statement
that there may be some
connection there.

27:39.691 --> 27:41.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Barry, back to
you.

27:41.760 --> 27:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm just curious, do you think
that this is
what we have just got to become
accustomed

27:45.297 --> 27:49.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to, that what was once
considered an extreme
event is now just the new
normal?

27:49.935 --> 27:52.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, if so, what does that mean
for policy-makers?

27:52.037 --> 27:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRY KEIM: Yes, well, we're
certainly in
a period right now where we have
seen quite

27:56.909 --> 27:58.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a bit -- quite a few extremes.

27:58.710 --> 28:02.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And -- but we have had some
periods in the
past where we have had
clustering of really

28:03.015 --> 28:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big, catastrophic rainfall
events in the past
as well.

28:08.086 --> 28:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I tell you, the last decade
or so really
does raise some eyebrows, and
very, very suspicious.

28:13.592 --> 28:20.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as what this means for
policy implications,
I mean, this is just so complex,
so politically

28:20.832 --> 28:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loaded, that, I mean, it's
really tough to
navigate through these waters,
so to speak.

28:27.406 --> 28:33.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, yes, it is really hard
to say a whole
lot conclusively on what kind of
policy should

28:33.211 --> 28:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proceed as a result of these
recent extremes.

28:35.547 --> 28:40.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Adam, with
relation to the
fire in California and the many
people appointed

28:40.686 --> 28:46.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the very long drought that
has dried out
much of California and makes
these fires more

28:46.725 --> 28:51.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
common and more violent when
they actually
occur, how do you see climate
change in relation

28:51.163 --> 28:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to that particular event?

28:52.631 --> 28:54.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM SOBEL: Right.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if we look at the drought in
California,
there have actually been several
studies of

28:56.802 --> 28:59.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, some of it done by my
colleagues here
at Columbia.

28:59.137 --> 29:03.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those studies actually show
the complexity
of studying events like this,
because the

29:03.075 --> 29:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
answer actually depends how you
ask the question.

29:05.544 --> 29:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you ask about just the lack
of rainfall
-- of course, the cause of a
drought is just

29:09.548 --> 29:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lack of rainfall -- then the
studies have
tended to come to a conclusion
that it's not

29:13.318 --> 29:16.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- this event is not
fundamentally caused
by climate change.

29:16.221 --> 29:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, once you have a lack
of rainfall,
the hotter temperatures that we
see as a result

29:20.492 --> 29:25.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of human influence on climate
cause water
to evaporate from the soils more
quickly,

29:25.063 --> 29:29.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so you have overall a dryer
land surface
and lower reservoirs and all of
that.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, there, there is a
climate change
influence.

29:31.169 --> 29:35.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if you ask about the lack of
rainfall,
this event appears to be largely
natural,

29:35.107 --> 29:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is what the studies have shown.

29:36.975 --> 29:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you ask about the overall
dryness of
California, there does seem to
be some influence

29:43.281 --> 29:45.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of higher temperature, which is
a result of
climate change.

29:45.550 --> 29:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the studies have come to
different conclusions,
in part because they ask
different questions.

29:49.788 --> 29:54.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I think that is the
complicated answer
to that question, as far as we
know now.

29:54.292 --> 29:58.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Adam Sobel, Barry
Keim, thank you both very much
for being here.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM SOBEL: Thank you.

29:59.631 --> 30:00.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARRY KEIM: My pleasure.

30:01.033 --> 30:05.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

30:05.904 --> 30:16.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:16.515 --> 30:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
revealing
a secret NSA code leaves us all
vulnerable;

and we take you to the edge of a
Hawaiian
volcano to discover what makes
it erupt.

30:27.826 --> 30:33.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: There are reports
that the United
Kingdom's process to begin
leaving the European

30:34.032 --> 30:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union may not begin until later
next year,
delaying the U.K.'s so-called
Brexit.

30:39.671 --> 30:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The June vote to leave may have
surprised
many there, but it came as
welcome news to

30:44.910 --> 30:46.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the island nation's fishermen.

30:46.745 --> 30:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have long complained about
European Union
rules, and now they're hoping
Brexit will

30:51.717 --> 30:57.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help them revitalize a fishing
industry they
say was damaged by E.U. policy.

30:57.355 --> 31:01.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Southwest England, special
correspondent
Jennifer Glasse reports.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Fishermen have
brought their
catches into

31:04.329 --> 31:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brixham Harbor since the Middle
Ages, when
it was the biggest fishing port
in Southwest

31:08.900 --> 31:11.069 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
England.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The harbor and the fleet have
changed over
the centuries.

31:13.972 --> 31:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And skipper Mike Sharp hopes
there are more
changes to come.

31:18.443 --> 31:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why he voted for the U.K.
to leave
Europe.

31:20.612 --> 31:25.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SHARP, Fisherman: We have
all the Dutch,
and the French, and the Belgian
fishermen,

31:25.217 --> 31:29.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and mainly the Spanish as well
coming to land
to take our fish out of our
waters, which

31:29.554 --> 31:34.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we want to -- you know, I think
we still can
let them come in, but we can
decide how many

31:34.159 --> 31:35.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
comes in.

31:35.961 --> 31:43.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: European
Union-mandated quotas
stipulate what kind and how many
fish the

31:43.335 --> 31:45.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trawlers can bring in.

31:45.203 --> 31:49.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sharp and other fishermen here
claim the quotas
favor boats from continental
Europe.

31:49.808 --> 31:52.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E.U. rules also limited the size
of fishing
fleets.

31:52.978 --> 31:57.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SHARP: When I started
fishing 30 years
ago, there was 60 beam trawlers,
and now there's

31:57.449 --> 31:58.416 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
17.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I would like to see it built
back up.

32:01.086 --> 32:06.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: A larger fleet
could mean
hundreds more jobs for deck
hands, engineers,

32:06.758 --> 32:13.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
welders and, onshore,
processing, buying and
selling fish.

32:13.865 --> 32:21.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brixham Fish Market is already
the largest
on England's South Coast,
handling about $35

32:21.306 --> 32:23.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
million of annual trade.

32:23.308 --> 32:26.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This market itself was
modernized in part
with E.U. funds.

32:26.912 --> 32:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MORTIMER, Brixham: A lot of
the fish
we sell in England, we sell from
this market

32:30.482 --> 32:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here actually goes abroad.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think just, because we're out
of the E.U.,
I don't think they're going to
stop buying

32:34.753 --> 32:35.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our fish.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're still going to want our
fish.

32:37.656 --> 32:41.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Fish buyer
Steve Farrar says
his children voted to stay in
Europe because

32:41.226 --> 32:43.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they want to be able to study
and work there.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE FARRAR, Fish Buyer: Oh, I
don't want
them that badly.

32:45.897 --> 32:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: He voted to
leave because
he says it was a question of
democracy vs.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
control from Europe.

32:52.470 --> 32:57.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE FARRAR: I felt very much
that if I couldn't
vote somebody, a politician, in
or out, I

32:57.409 --> 33:01.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
didn't want them making
decisions over my
life or my children's lives or
my grandchildren's

33:01.413 --> 33:02.447 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lives.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was the fundamental
issue, really.

33:04.449 --> 33:09.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Robert
Simonetti exports
fish and serves it at a local
restaurant,

33:09.354 --> 33:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including, what else, fish and
chips.

33:12.691 --> 33:16.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't think his out vote to
leave will
change much for his businesses.

33:16.361 --> 33:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT SIMONETTI, Fish Exporter:
For me, it
was all the immigration thing.

33:18.396 --> 33:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's a big issue for
everybody.

33:20.198 --> 33:24.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we want control about
who comes
into our country, really, the
people we don't

33:24.436 --> 33:26.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want, the criminals.

33:26.238 --> 33:30.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're coming here to work
and you're going
to be part of the community, we
don't care

33:30.408 --> 33:35.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what color you are, whether
you're white,
black or yellow.

33:35.080 --> 33:39.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Waitress Wendy
Lanyon says
any sacrifices made to leave
Europe will be

33:39.751 --> 33:41.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
worth it.

33:41.553 --> 33:44.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY LANYON, Waitress: I do
believe we're
going to -- it's going to be
hard for us as

33:44.422 --> 33:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a country, but nothing like what
they made
out it was going to be.

33:49.461 --> 33:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have survived before
without being
in the European Union.

33:53.899 --> 33:56.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we will survive again.

33:56.134 --> 33:58.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm sure we will.

33:58.036 --> 34:02.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Despite the
anti-Europe sentiment
here, this harbor town has deep
historical

34:03.008 --> 34:05.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ties with the continent.

34:05.543 --> 34:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dutch Prince William of Orange
landed here
on the 5th of November, 1688,
and he became

34:10.582 --> 34:13.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the king of England, ruling
alongside Queen
Mary.

34:14.019 --> 34:19.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Napoleon Bonaparte never
actually set foot
on land, but his ship was just
offshore before

34:19.291 --> 34:21.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he was sent into exile.

34:21.092 --> 34:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over tea, local historian Edgar
Lawrence says
it's no surprise Britons voted
to leave.

34:26.631 --> 34:33.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDGAR LAWRENCE, Historian: I'm
old enough
to have voted for the common
market, but what

34:33.038 --> 34:38.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we got wasn't anything like what
we had been
told it was going to be.

34:38.109 --> 34:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's just got worse and
worse.

34:41.947 --> 34:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: And what do you
think Brexit
will do for Brixham and Devon
and Cornwall?

34:48.086 --> 34:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EDGAR LAWRENCE: Depends very
much on the politicians.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We know what we want it to do.

34:56.728 --> 35:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will they agree to everything we
want, which
Europe doesn't seem to want us
to have?

35:07.973 --> 35:13.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: The picturesque
beaches of
Devon and Cornwall counties
attract tourists

35:13.044 --> 35:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that bring in revenue, but not
enough to keep
the local economies afloat.

35:18.750 --> 35:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This area once produced tin and
copper and
china clay, but all you can see
of the mines

35:23.588 --> 35:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now are now abandoned shells.

35:26.391 --> 35:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the mines closed, there
was a steady
decline in manufacturing and
other industries,

35:30.795 --> 35:33.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaving this one of the poorest
areas in Europe.

35:33.898 --> 35:38.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cornwall alone has received
hundreds of millions
of dollars in European aid,
support that's

35:38.803 --> 35:40.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
now at risk.

35:40.705 --> 35:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The E.U. had pledged $650
million through
20 to Cornwall to continue to
support new

35:46.945 --> 35:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
businesses, build infrastructure
and complete
high-speed Internet access to
the region.

35:52.617 --> 35:58.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The head of the local county
commission is
trying to ensure the money keeps
flowing,

35:58.089 --> 35:59.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether from Europe or the U.K.
government.

35:59.824 --> 36:03.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN POLLARD, Leader, Cornwall
Council: I
don't think the economic
argument played a

36:03.461 --> 36:05.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very big part in the decision.

36:05.530 --> 36:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was more on fear and a
dislike of Brussels.

36:09.367 --> 36:14.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People like to blame somebody
for the ills
of the country, and Brussels was
getting the

36:14.839 --> 36:15.940 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
blame.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it wasn't, in that sense,
economically
logical.

36:18.977 --> 36:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was very much a reaction
vote.

36:21.679 --> 36:27.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JENNIFER GLASSE: One of
Cornwall's poorest
areas is Redruth.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This food bank gives out free
provisions to
the needy.

36:31.022 --> 36:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vikki Rostron and her partner
are both unemployed
and have six children between
them.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has no interest in politics
and didn't
vote.

36:40.365 --> 36:44.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VIKKI ROSTRON, Redruth,
Cornwall: I didn't
know enough about it to think
about it, to

36:44.302 --> 36:45.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be honest.

36:45.570 --> 36:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not -- it wasn't something
I wanted to
do, you know?

36:50.708 --> 36:54.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: The food bank's
founder says
the Brexit vote won't hurt
Cornwall because

36:54.946 --> 36:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European money has not produced
the right
kind of jobs since the local
economy has evolved.

36:59.751 --> 37:03.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONOVAN GARDNER, Food Bank
Founder: Those
jobs are not here anymore.

37:03.688 --> 37:05.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that -- and they're still
not here.

37:05.690 --> 37:11.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it's European money or
British government
money, those cyber-jobs are not
here in Cornwall.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what we struggle
with.

37:13.698 --> 37:17.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Some in
Cornwall want the
government to bring back heavy
industry, not

37:17.435 --> 37:19.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a viable prospect.

37:19.337 --> 37:24.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And European funds have been
spent to create
21st century solutions to
Cornwall's limitations.

37:24.075 --> 37:32.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN POLLARD: A lot of that
money is not visible,
so it doesn't build a school or
a sports center.

37:32.050 --> 37:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It builds a road, or it builds a
business
park, or it helps to develop a
digital industry.

37:38.556 --> 37:42.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people, the man in the
street doesn't
-- they don't see that.

37:42.227 --> 37:45.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Back in
Brixham, the fishermen
head out to sea.

37:45.830 --> 37:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they have done their
part, persuading
the country to vote to get out
of Europe.

37:50.168 --> 37:52.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now it's up to the politicians.

37:52.737 --> 37:57.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Negotiations are expected to
take two years
or many more.

37:57.809 --> 38:01.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fishermen of Brixham hope
officials in
London and Brussels won't leave
them high

38:01.713 --> 38:03.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and dry.

Reporting for the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Jennifer
Glasse in Brixham, England.

38:12.757 --> 38:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The National
Security Agency's
primary mission is to spy on the
electronic

38:23.101 --> 38:26.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
communications of countries and
people overseas.

38:26.437 --> 38:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the weekend, though,
sophisticated code
the NSA developed to penetrate
computer security

38:30.508 --> 38:32.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
systems was posted online.

38:32.810 --> 38:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This serious breach comes amid
the ongoing
revelations of the hacking of
the Democratic

38:37.182 --> 38:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Committee and other
organizations,
allegedly by groups linked to
Russian intelligence.

38:42.687 --> 38:46.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this, we turn to The
Washington
Post national security
correspondent Ellen

38:46.424 --> 38:48.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nakashima, and Paul Vixie.

38:48.226 --> 38:51.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He designed and built some of
the software
that is the backbone of the
Internet today.

38:51.529 --> 38:55.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is now chairman and CEO of
Farsight Security,
a computer security firm.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ellen Nakashima, what happened
this weekend?

38:57.902 --> 38:59.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What got released?

38:59.771 --> 39:01.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN NAKASHIMA, The Washington
Post: Over
the weekend, apparently on
Saturday, mysteriously,

39:02.006 --> 39:12.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a cache of NSA hacking tools was
released
online through file-sharing
sites such as

39:12.050 --> 39:14.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BitTorrent and Dropbox.

39:14.586 --> 39:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really wasn't noticed until
about Monday,
when the computer security
community started

39:21.059 --> 39:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commenting on it and questions
arose as to
whether or not the NSA had been
hacked.

39:25.997 --> 39:30.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Paul
Vixie, if these
lock picks, these digital tools
to try break

39:30.401 --> 39:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into different systems out are
out in the
open now, these are the tools
that the American

39:34.272 --> 39:38.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government was using, what is
the consequence,
if it is in the public sphere?

39:38.476 --> 39:44.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL VIXIE, Chairman and CEO,
Farsight Security:
Well, I think, every day,
everybody is trying

39:44.916 --> 39:46.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to hack everybody.

39:46.150 --> 39:49.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, this is not huge news.

39:49.520 --> 39:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's big news about it is that
these tools
were built by the U.S.
government.

39:55.693 --> 40:00.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the lock picks, as you
call them,
are now obsolete.

40:00.632 --> 40:06.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They are relying on
vulnerabilities that have
since been closed, because the
files are about

40:06.271 --> 40:08.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
3 years old.

40:08.106 --> 40:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at least one of them is
active against
a very current piece of
equipment from Cisco.

40:12.477 --> 40:20.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is going to lead to a lot
of break-ins
while the patches are prepared
and shipped

40:20.151 --> 40:21.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and then applied.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ellen
Nakashima, what about
the idea that some of these are
as recent

40:24.889 --> 40:28.660 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as 2013?

40:28.693 --> 40:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does the NSA know, if this was a
hack, if
this was something more recent?

40:33.097 --> 40:37.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ELLEN NAKASHIMA: The NSA
officially is not
commenting.

40:37.201 --> 40:45.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But former NSA operators,
personnel I have
interviewed were -- actually
recognized the

40:45.810 --> 40:51.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tooled that were released and
said they were,
indeed, legitimate.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they don't believe that the
NSA was actually
hacked.

40:54.886 --> 41:04.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They think it is more likely
that perhaps
one of the operators at the
agency inadvertently

41:04.062 --> 41:15.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
uploaded a tool set, an entire
tool set of
tools to a server, a staging
server in cyberspace,

41:15.306 --> 41:20.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and didn't recognize that, and
didn't pull
it back down.

41:20.144 --> 41:27.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once it was out there, other
adversaries,
other spy agencies around the
world are also

41:27.518 --> 41:30.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sometimes sitting on these same
servers.

41:30.288 --> 41:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of them might have noticed
it, got it,
took a copy of it, and got it,
without the

41:37.061 --> 41:38.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NSA realizing it.

41:38.930 --> 41:44.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Paul Vixie,
how many people,
companies, governments does this
make vulnerable?

41:44.435 --> 41:52.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL VIXIE: I haven't seen an
estimate of
the market size, but, really, we
have got

41:52.944 --> 41:57.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
at least one of these
vulnerabilities that
is still current, and the patch
is being prepared

41:57.582 --> 41:59.350 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

41:59.384 --> 42:03.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, some of the ones
that are not
current are also going to work,
because many

42:04.021 --> 42:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enterprise networks are not
patched up to
date.

42:06.924 --> 42:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can't afford the constant
churn of updating
their equipment, updating their
software.

42:12.463 --> 42:18.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so even though some of the
vulnerabilities
that have been used by these
tools are no

42:18.770 --> 42:24.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
longer current, they're still
going to -- those
picks are still going to fit
quite a few locks.

42:24.776 --> 42:31.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't really -- I would say,
in order of
magnitude, anywhere between
one-tenth and

42:31.215 --> 42:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one-half of the customer bases
for the largest
firewall vendors should really
be worried

42:37.488 --> 42:38.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

42:38.856 --> 42:40.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That still
sounds like a
pretty large number.

42:40.658 --> 42:43.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL VIXIE: Yes, that is a large
number.

42:43.895 --> 42:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Internet was originally
academic.

42:46.564 --> 42:50.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when it was built, every one
that could
reach you was trustworthy.

42:50.268 --> 42:56.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, that changed in
the mid-'90s,
when we commercialized and
privatized the

42:56.274 --> 42:58.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Internet.

42:58.075 --> 43:01.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at that time, we started
developing this
firewall technology that was
meant to limit

43:01.245 --> 43:05.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of who could reach you or
how various
people could reach you.

43:05.716 --> 43:11.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what that means is, the
inside of these
networks is very soft, full of
soft targets,

43:11.989 --> 43:15.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and tends to rely on firewall to
keep it safe.

43:15.693 --> 43:22.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, any time you have a key that
will unlock
the firewall and let you do
whatever you want

43:22.133 --> 43:24.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the other side, you suddenly
have a very
target-rich environment.

43:24.969 --> 43:29.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ellen, the
people that you
have spoken to, are they
concerned that kind

43:29.207 --> 43:36.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the design of these keys
would tip off
to whoever is using these tools
exactly who

43:36.047 --> 43:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the NSA targets, how they target
them, how
they create the breaches in
these firewalls?

43:41.652 --> 43:43.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ELLEN NAKASHIMA: Well,
absolutely.

43:43.454 --> 43:48.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that is one of the issues
with, you know,
a disclosure like this.

43:48.960 --> 43:53.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I should say there are also
some former
employees who think it's more
likely that

43:53.798 --> 44:00.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some disgruntled insider stole
all the tools
and then put them out there,
perhaps for some

44:00.338 --> 44:02.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
personal profit.

44:02.173 --> 44:09.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in any case, now that they
are out there,
they are available to other
hackers, other

44:09.514 --> 44:17.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spy agencies who could either
target companies
running these firewalls, or also
look and

44:17.722 --> 44:24.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watch to see what the NSA is
targeting and
exfiltrating as well.

44:24.562 --> 44:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ellen, in the
context the
sort of cyberwar that seems to
be escalating

44:29.467 --> 44:34.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
between Russia and other
countries, the fact
that this happens now, what are
your sources

44:34.405 --> 44:40.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
telling you about how these
tools could end
up in the wrong hands in a
political context?

44:40.945 --> 44:42.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELLEN NAKASHIMA: Yes.

44:42.680 --> 44:48.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, it's -- I don't think we
have any hard
evidence as to who is behind the
release.

44:48.553 --> 44:56.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's, at this point, I think,
largely circumstantial
that it -- some people think it
might be Russia.

44:56.961 --> 45:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The timing is certainly notable,
or suspect,
coming, as you noted, on the
heels of some

45:03.968 --> 45:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the hacks of the DNC and the
DCCC and the
releases of hacked e-mails from
the DNC that

45:12.610 --> 45:20.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been linked to Russia or,
more recently,
of hacked personal cell phone
numbers and

45:20.518 --> 45:22.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
e-mail addresses of Democratic
lawmakers.

45:22.353 --> 45:25.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That also appears to be coming
from Russia.

45:25.923 --> 45:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, some people think that maybe
this is another
signal from Russia to the Obama
administration,

45:34.365 --> 45:39.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the White House that is no
doubt right
now discussing how they might
respond to all

45:39.604 --> 45:42.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of these Russian hacks and
provocations.

45:42.273 --> 45:47.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a signal to them to say,
hey, you know,
if you are thinking about
retaliating in some

45:47.812 --> 45:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, calling us out, stepping up
sanctions,
or even responding in kind in
cyberspace,

45:54.085 --> 45:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think twice, because we can
cause you some
pain.

45:56.654 --> 46:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, finally,
briefly, Paul
Vixie, is there concern in the
computer security

46:01.359 --> 46:05.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
committee -- community whether
the NSA can
keep its secrets safe?

46:05.196 --> 46:08.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL VIXIE: There is.

46:08.332 --> 46:14.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The NSA needs a lot of fairly
controversial
data and tools in order to
accomplish its

46:14.705 --> 46:16.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mission.

46:16.540 --> 46:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we depend on those type --
that kind of
data, those kind of tools not
being generally

46:22.513 --> 46:24.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
available.

46:24.348 --> 46:29.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, with this disclosure and
with the Edward
Snowden disclosures of a couple
of years ago,

46:29.854 --> 46:35.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is some concern that maybe
there are
some types of data, some types
of tools that

46:35.526 --> 46:40.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shouldn't be created at all,
because there
just isn't a way to keep them
perfectly safe.

46:40.598 --> 46:45.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Paul Vixie, Ellen
Nakashima, thanks so much.

46:45.670 --> 46:55.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, science

46:55.713 --> 47:01.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, science
correspondent
Miles O'Brien joins a researcher
who ventures

47:01.419 --> 47:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close to the glowing heart of an
active Hawaiian
volcano to learn what makes them
tick.

47:07.291 --> 47:09.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the latest in our weekly
Leading ®MD+IT /MD-IT /Edge
series.

®MD+IT /MD-IT /
MIKE GARCIA, Geologist,
University of Hawaii:

47:11.796 --> 47:13.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

47:13.631 --> 47:16.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: If you want to
learn what makes
a volcano erupt, you need to go
right to the

47:16.934 --> 47:22.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
otherworldly source, the
crunchy, oozing,
red-hot source.

47:22.606 --> 47:25.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At least, that's what geologist
Mike Garcia
does.

47:25.509 --> 47:27.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE GARCIA: Voila.

47:27.545 --> 47:29.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Wow.

47:29.613 --> 47:30.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's amazing.

47:30.948 --> 47:32.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Amazing, indeed.

47:32.349 --> 47:35.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Welcome to the most studied
volcano in the
world, Kilauea.

47:36.020 --> 47:41.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Garcia and I came here to this
surreal landscape
on Hawaii's Big Island by
helicopter.

47:41.358 --> 47:47.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On our way, we got a glimpse of
the red rock
cauldron of magma through the
sulfur-tainted

47:47.064 --> 47:48.532 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
steam.

47:48.566 --> 47:52.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kilauea is one of the longest
currently erupting
volcanoes on the planet.

47:52.436 --> 47:55.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The lava started flowing in
January of 1983.

47:55.072 --> 48:00.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE GARCIA: So, the mantle is
producing an
enormous amount of hot material
that's coming

48:00.778 --> 48:02.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of Kilauea.

48:02.480 --> 48:07.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is probably one of the most
active periods
of the historical record of
Kilauea.

48:07.218 --> 48:13.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The eruption
waxes and wanes,
at times spewing fountains of
lava, and, in

48:13.224 --> 48:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 1990s, threatening and
destroying nearby
homes.

48:16.894 --> 48:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, of late, it's been more
spectacle than
menace, a slow-motion window
into what lies

48:23.234 --> 48:25.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
beneath the surface.

48:25.269 --> 48:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Through it all, there is one
constant here
besides flowing lava: Garcia.

48:30.307 --> 48:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has been studying Kilauea for
30 years,
hoping to improve eruption
forecasting.

48:35.780 --> 48:39.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE GARCIA: Well, with most
volcanoes, you
want to know when it's going to
erupt.

48:39.984 --> 48:42.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so that's a primary concern.

48:42.052 --> 48:46.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in this case, where we have
an eruption
that's been going on for over 30
years, the

48:46.190 --> 48:48.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big question is, when is it
going to stop?

48:48.159 --> 48:54.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: He comes here
looking for data,
in this case a piece of freshly
cooked earth

48:54.732 --> 48:56.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just out of the oven.

48:56.600 --> 49:03.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He dunks it in water, freezing
the moment
and its chemical composition in
time, a geological

49:03.407 --> 49:04.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Instagram packed with data.

49:05.009 --> 49:07.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE GARCIA: We know its
birthday.

49:07.077 --> 49:09.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We know when it was erupted.

49:09.346 --> 49:12.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you might ask, well, why do
we -- why
do we care?

49:12.349 --> 49:16.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because the lava composition
changes hourly,
daily, or -- and even monthly.

49:16.687 --> 49:23.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And somewhere in
there might
be some sort of telltale sign of
whether it's

49:23.494 --> 49:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to continue erupting or
not, right?

49:25.529 --> 49:27.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE GARCIA: Absolutely.

49:27.264 --> 49:30.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In science, one of the key
things we do now
are time series studies, where
we collect

49:30.668 --> 49:35.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
samples repeatedly during the
course of an
eruption or in the ocean,
because it's evolving

49:35.573 --> 49:37.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all the time.

49:37.508 --> 49:42.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Back in his lab
at the University
of Hawaii in Honolulu, graduate
student Kendra

49:42.713 --> 49:49.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lynn does her part to understand
Kilauea,
shaving rocks into 30-micron
slices, and then

49:49.353 --> 49:52.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
analyzing them using an electron
microprobe.

49:52.690 --> 49:56.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is interested in this green
mineral called
olivine.

49:56.327 --> 49:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the most common mineral
that forms at
Kilauea.

49:59.730 --> 50:01.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What can we learn from it?

50:01.498 --> 50:03.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENDRA LYNN, Graduate Student,
University
of Hawaii: Because it's the
first thing to

50:03.267 --> 50:06.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crystallize in these magmas, it
tells us a
lot about the mantle source,
where the magmas

50:06.804 --> 50:08.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
came from.

50:08.105 --> 50:10.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it can also tell us a lot
about the magma's
history.

50:10.674 --> 50:15.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This is just one
of many tests
the team routinely conducts to
analyze the

50:15.212 --> 50:18.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
elements and isotopes in the
newborn rocks.

50:18.215 --> 50:22.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE GARCIA: Each of the
processes within
the volcano leaves a
fingerprint.

50:23.020 --> 50:28.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, over the years, we have been
able to develop
an understanding of what those
fingerprints

50:28.993 --> 50:32.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are and what they tell us about
what's going
on in the volcano.

50:32.263 --> 50:33.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, where are we
right now?

50:33.497 --> 50:35.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is this?

50:35.466 --> 50:37.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE GARCIA: We're looking at
the rock collection
we have from the Pu'u 'O'o
eruption, as well

50:37.835 --> 50:39.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as some of the other Hawaiian
eruptions.

50:39.737 --> 50:44.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And over the
years he has amassed
an impressive collection of
rocks, not just

50:44.942 --> 50:48.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Kilauea, but from volcanoes
all over
the Hawaiian islands.

50:48.679 --> 50:54.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE GARCIA: So, this is July 23
of 1997.

50:54.551 --> 50:56.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this one looks a little
grayer.

50:56.353 --> 50:58.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, it's not
quite as shiny,
for whatever reason.

50:58.555 --> 50:59.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why would that be?

50:59.556 --> 51:00.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE GARCIA: But you can see the
imprint.

51:00.824 --> 51:02.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it was a little cooler at
the time it
was quenched.

51:02.993 --> 51:04.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ah, I see.

51:04.395 --> 51:06.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If only these rocks could talk.

51:06.563 --> 51:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fortunately, Garcia is pretty
adept at reading
them.

51:10.501 --> 51:13.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things he focuses on
is the temperature
of the lava.

51:13.771 --> 51:17.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE GARCIA: So, what we have
seen is a long-term
decrease.

51:17.408 --> 51:20.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Initially, the lava temperature
was low.

51:20.678 --> 51:21.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It increased.

51:21.679 --> 51:23.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The eruption roared upward.

51:23.547 --> 51:28.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now it's been slowly waning
as -- and
we see the temperature of the
lava is indicating

51:28.886 --> 51:30.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a decrease.

51:30.087 --> 51:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we think this eruption might
end in the
near future.

51:34.358 --> 51:36.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's ended several times in
the past.

51:36.927 --> 51:41.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was quiet in 1997 for a
month, and then
it restarted.

51:41.899 --> 51:47.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Back at the lava
flow, Garcia
told me his work is not as
dangerous as it

51:47.271 --> 51:51.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seems, a calculated risk for a
good scientific
cause.

51:51.342 --> 51:55.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All right, so what is the
strategy for walking?

51:55.145 --> 51:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you know what to step on?

51:56.981 --> 52:02.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE GARCIA: We need to avoid
areas that look
shelly, indicating that the lava
has drained

52:02.152 --> 52:03.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out from underneath.

52:03.954 --> 52:08.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we try to look for places
where it looks
solid, so we can avoid
collapsing in on the

52:09.026 --> 52:09.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lava flow.

52:10.027 --> 52:11.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: I'm just going to
follow you.

52:11.061 --> 52:12.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How's that?

52:12.062 --> 52:13.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE GARCIA: Very good.

52:13.831 --> 52:18.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But while we were
here, some
newly minted, still hot Hawaiian
earth melted

52:18.602 --> 52:21.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the soles right off of his
shoes.

52:21.672 --> 52:23.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Wow, just like that.

52:24.008 --> 52:26.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is the other one already gone?

52:26.944 --> 52:28.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE GARCIA: No, no.

52:28.412 --> 52:29.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oh, you're absolutely right.

52:29.880 --> 52:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Holy moly.

52:31.348 --> 52:33.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Wow.

52:33.083 --> 52:38.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All in a day's work for an
intrepid geologist
determined to go with and to the
flow.

52:38.756 --> 52:41.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE GARCIA: Success.

52:41.492 --> 52:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
