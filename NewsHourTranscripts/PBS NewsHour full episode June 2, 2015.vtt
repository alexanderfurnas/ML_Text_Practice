00:11.912 --> 00:15.816
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hundreds missing
after a cruise ship capsizes on
the Yangtze River

00:15.816 --> 00:19.586
in China -- the race against
time to rescue survivors.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.455
Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:21.455 --> 00:24.324
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:24.324 --> 00:29.696
Also ahead this Tuesday: He's
out. The embattled president of
FIFA resigns days after

00:29.696 --> 00:34.368
his reelection failed to
lift a cloud of controversy.

00:34.368 --> 00:40.474
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then: righting a
wrong. Once-overlooked soldiers
receive the Medal of Honor
nearly

00:40.474 --> 00:45.012
100 years after fighting on the
front lines of World War I.

00:45.012 --> 00:50.350
GWEN IFILL: Plus, media for and
by those who are homeless, from
newspapers to the silver

00:50.350 --> 00:53.921
screen, empowering people
who live on the streets.

00:53.921 --> 00:58.058
BRIAN CAROME, Executive
Director, Street Sense: One of
the things is the powerful
transformational

00:58.058 --> 01:02.696
effect that self-expression has
on our lives, because you have
got to first believe in yourself

01:02.696 --> 01:06.433
to claw your way out of this
deep hole that is homelessness.

01:06.433 --> 01:10.270
GWEN IFILL: Those are some of
the stories we're covering on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:10.270 --> 01:15.742
JUDY WOODRUFF: A frantic rescue
effort continued all day in
China, for hundreds of people on

01:15.742 --> 01:20.914
a river cruise out of Nanjing.
Their ship rolled over during
stormy weather last night,

01:20.914 --> 01:24.918
and so far, only 15 people
have been found alive.

01:24.918 --> 01:28.555
John Sparks of Independent
Television News has our report.

01:28.555 --> 01:32.693
JOHN SPARKS: From the murky
depths of the Yangtze River, a
woman appears surrounded

01:32.693 --> 01:37.597
by a team of
professional divers.

01:37.597 --> 01:46.707
She's weak on her feet, but very
much alive, the woman, 65 years
old, one of a small number

01:46.707 --> 01:53.814
of survivors from a cruise ship
called the Eastern Star, which
capsized in a storm overnight.

01:53.814 --> 01:59.186
The divers found her near the
upturned bow sheltering in an
air pocket 15 meters below

01:59.186 --> 02:01.822
the surface~

02:01.822 --> 02:08.528
There remains, however, more
than 400 people unaccounted for,
the vast majority retirees

02:08.528 --> 02:15.068
on a 13-day cruise, and
emergency personnel have
struggled. They heard voices
inside

02:15.068 --> 02:20.540
the ship this morning, this man
responding by tapping his
hammer.

02:20.540 --> 02:26.847
Later, they tried to cut a hole
through the ship's hull, but
poor weather and strong currents

02:26.847 --> 02:34.821
have hampered their efforts.
Tonight, the head of the rescue
effort said his team were

02:34.821 --> 02:40.961
in a race against time. "The
incident happened very
suddenly," said Yang Chuatan
(ph), "but

02:40.961 --> 02:46.400
we will give it 100 percent."

02:46.400 --> 02:53.540
The Chinese prime minister, Li
Keqiang, also on TV today, here
taking charge of the rescue

02:53.540 --> 02:58.278
effort. It's a public
relations gesture in part from

02:58.278 --> 03:01.982
Communist Party officials
worried how about the public and
the victims' families will

03:01.982 --> 03:04.351
react.

03:04.351 --> 03:09.723
For desperate relatives, there
was little information to be
had. In Nanjing, the travel

03:09.723 --> 03:14.327
company said only that staff
had gone to the accident site.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.930
MAN (through translator):
There's just the notice on the
door. We don't know if they're

03:16.930 --> 03:18.632
alive.

03:18.632 --> 03:23.303
JOHN SPARKS: And the
authorities, well, they have a
maritime catastrophe on their

03:23.303 --> 03:28.141
hands. Still, details from the
scene will be tightly controlled
with journalists being

03:28.141 --> 03:31.244
kept away from the site.

03:31.244 --> 03:36.716
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news, the Senate approved
legislation to reshape the

03:36.716 --> 03:41.955
National Security Agency's
surveillance. The NSA's legal
authority to collect bulk phone

03:41.955 --> 03:47.894
records under the Patriot Act
expired Sunday night. In its
place, the USA Freedom Act

03:47.894 --> 03:54.134
will impose new limits on
collection and access to the
records. Senators passed it
67-32

03:54.134 --> 03:58.438
after House leaders warned
against making any changes.

03:58.438 --> 04:02.309
The House overwhelmingly
approved the measure last month.
That demand aggravated Senate

04:02.309 --> 04:05.278
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.814
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: We were not
going to simply just roll over

04:07.814 --> 04:13.420
and accept the House bill
without debating it and
attempting to amend it. We hear
various

04:13.420 --> 04:16.156
members of the House saying,
don't change the bill at all.
You would think it was

04:16.156 --> 04:22.462
the Ten Commandments. The
Senate is entitled to change the
bill.

04:22.462 --> 04:27.501
GWEN IFILL: McConnell favored
extending the expired Patriot
Act, along with its expired

04:27.501 --> 04:32.339
tougher surveillance provisions,
but Republican Rand Paul, a
presidential candidate, blocked

04:32.339 --> 04:37.077
that last week. Today, Illinois
Senator Dick Durbin and other
Democrats said the GOP

04:37.077 --> 04:39.846
mishandled the whole issue.

04:39.846 --> 04:43.283
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL),
Minority Whip: Senate
Republicans wasted precious time

04:43.283 --> 04:48.555
as the clock ran out on key
national security authority,
putting their own political
interests

04:48.555 --> 04:55.328
ahead of the national interests.
Well, enough is enough. We as
senators are not here to

04:55.328 --> 04:59.232
serve as extras in a
presidential campaign
commercial.

04:59.232 --> 05:03.103
GWEN IFILL: The bill now goes
to the president's desk. He
tweeted this evening that he
will

05:03.103 --> 05:05.472
sign it as soon as it arrives.

05:05.472 --> 05:11.611
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Paris today,
Western and Arab nations pledged
new support to help Iraq

05:11.611 --> 05:14.981
fight a growing Islamic State
threat. Foreign ministers and
others convened at the French

05:14.981 --> 05:17.751
Foreign Ministry.

05:17.751 --> 05:24.524
The gathering was organized
after ISIS fighters captured
Ramadi in Iraq and Palmyra in
Syria.

05:24.524 --> 05:29.729
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider
al-Abadi said ISIS fighters are
using enormous truck bombs

05:29.729 --> 05:34.000
that explode like a mini-nuclear
bomb. He complained the
coalition's air campaign is

05:34.000 --> 05:37.704
not enough and said he
needs far more help.

05:37.704 --> 05:42.776
GWEN IFILL: Suspected Islamist
militants have struck again in
Nigeria. Witnesses

05:42.776 --> 05:48.148
and medics report up to 50
people were killed in a series
of bombings today. It happened

05:48.148 --> 05:53.787
in the northeastern city of
Maiduguri, where an explosion
ripped apart a crowded meat
market.

05:53.787 --> 05:58.792
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greece submitted
a proposal to its creditors
today, hoping to unlock more

05:58.792 --> 06:03.630
bailout funds. Details were not
made public, but Eurozone
leaders warned the two sides

06:03.630 --> 06:07.133
are still a long way
from agreement.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.403
Greek Prime Minister Alexis
Tsipras said it's up to those
leaders to decide what happens

06:10.403 --> 06:12.772
now.

06:12.772 --> 06:18.144
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greek Prime
Minister (through translator):
We have made concessions,
because

06:18.144 --> 06:22.649
a compromise demands
concessions. We know these
concessions will be difficult,
but we

06:22.649 --> 06:27.787
have submitted a realistic plan
for Greece to exit the crisis, a
realistic plan, whose

06:27.787 --> 06:32.225
acceptance by the institutions,
our lenders and our partners in
Europe will mark the end

06:32.225 --> 06:35.528
of the scenario of
divisions in Europe.

06:35.528 --> 06:38.632
JUDY WOODRUFF: Without new
rescue funds, Greece may default
on its debts at the end

06:38.632 --> 06:40.800
of this month.

06:40.800 --> 06:45.338
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, police in Boston today
shot and killed a man under

06:45.338 --> 06:50.877
surveillance in a terror
investigation. CNN and others
reported he'd become an Islamist

06:50.877 --> 06:55.949
radical and recently posted
online threats against police.
Boston's commissioner says

06:55.949 --> 07:00.620
when officers and federal agents
moved in, the man pulled a large
knife and came at them,

07:00.620 --> 07:02.989
so they opened fire.

07:02.989 --> 07:08.395
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amtrak's boss
vowed today to get new
technology up and running, so it

07:08.395 --> 07:13.600
can stop speeding passenger
trains. The train that wrecked
in Philadelphia last month

07:13.600 --> 07:19.673
wasn't using positive train
control, or PTC. It hit a curve
doing more than 100 miles

07:19.673 --> 07:23.176
an hour, and derailed,
killing eight people.

07:23.176 --> 07:27.647
At a House hearing today, an
emotional Joseph Boardman said
he's focused on the Northeast

07:27.647 --> 07:29.616
Corridor.

07:29.616 --> 07:33.987
JOSEPH BOARDMAN, CEO, Amtrak: I
still believe that the single
greatest contribution that

07:33.987 --> 07:41.061
my generation of railroaders can
make to this industry is to
implement PTC as rapidly as

07:41.061 --> 07:48.268
possible. And I promise you
that, by the end of this year,
this system, which will

07:48.268 --> 07:55.575
dramatically enhance safety,
will be complete and operational
on the NEC.

07:55.575 --> 07:58.712
JUDY WOODRUFF: The National
Transportation Safety Board is
still investigating the May

07:58.712 --> 08:01.181
12 accident.

08:01.181 --> 08:06.353
GWEN IFILL: The acting head of
the Transportation Security
Administration has been
reassigned

08:06.353 --> 08:11.825
over security failures. Melvin
Carraway was ousted in the wake
of tests overseen by

08:11.825 --> 08:17.130
the agency's inspector general.
Government audits reported
undercover agents smuggled

08:17.130 --> 08:24.571
fake explosives, weapons and
other banned items past TSA
screeners in 67 out of 70
attempts.

08:24.571 --> 08:29.809
JUDY WOODRUFF: The California
State Senate voted today to
allow immigrants here illegally

08:29.809 --> 08:35.081
to buy insurance on a state
health exchange. California
would be the first to take that

08:35.081 --> 08:39.452
step, under the Affordable Care
Act, if the state assembly and
the governor go along.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.989
The immigrants wouldn't be
eligible for insurance
subsidies.

08:42.989 --> 08:47.927
GWEN IFILL: And on Wall Street,
the Dow Jones industrial average
lost 28 points to

08:47.927 --> 08:55.468
close back near 18010. The
Nasdaq fell six points, and the
S&P 500 slipped two.

08:55.468 --> 09:00.874
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the most powerful man in sports
steps down amid corruption

09:00.874 --> 09:06.646
investigations; lawmakers want
answers on car safety after
massive recalls of defective

09:06.646 --> 09:13.920
air bags; honoring the valor and
service of overlooked World War
I veterans; an FBI secret

09:13.920 --> 09:19.826
air force, the low-flying planes
on missions for domestic
surveillance; documenting the

09:19.826 --> 09:25.598
stories of homeless people on
newsprint, film and in song;
plus, educating Pakistani
children

09:25.598 --> 09:32.172
in failing schools surrounded
by violence and instability.

09:32.172 --> 09:43.249
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just four days
after he won reelection to a
fifth term as the head of

09:43.249 --> 09:48.788
soccer's international governing
body, Sepp Blatter stunned
nearly everyone today when

09:48.788 --> 09:52.692
he announced he would resign as
president of FIFA. Top FIFA
officials were arrested

09:52.692 --> 09:55.295
last week.

09:55.295 --> 10:01.201
The Department of Justice
uncorked a 47-count indictment
alleging bribery and widespread

10:01.201 --> 10:06.239
corruption. And, yesterday,
published reports said Blatter's
top deputy had been linked

10:06.239 --> 10:10.510
to wire transfers involving bank
payments believed to be bribes
related to World Cup

10:10.510 --> 10:12.712
bids.

10:12.712 --> 10:17.817
At a hastily called news
conference today, Blatter didn't
address the specifics, but

10:17.817 --> 10:21.621
acknowledged the mounting
scandal undercut the votes and
the mandate he said he received

10:21.621 --> 10:24.390
last week.

10:24.390 --> 10:31.164
JOSEPH "SEPP" BLATTER,
President, FIFA (through
translator): This mandate
doesn't seem to

10:31.164 --> 10:36.836
be supported by everybody in the
world of football, supporters,
clubs, players, those

10:36.836 --> 10:42.509
who inspire life in football, as
much as we do at FIFA. That's
why I will call an extraordinary

10:42.509 --> 10:46.379
congress and put at disposal my
function. It is going to be
held as soon as possible

10:46.379 --> 10:49.782
and a new president will
be elected to follow me.

10:49.782 --> 10:54.387
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's look at
the sudden resignation and the
circumstances around it.

10:54.387 --> 10:59.425
Declan Hill is an investigative
journalist and the author of a
book about FIFA's problems

10:59.425 --> 11:03.796
with corruption. It's called
"The Fix: Soccer and Organized
Crime." I spoke with him a

11:03.796 --> 11:05.698
short time ago from Ottawa.

11:05.698 --> 11:09.102
Declan Hill, welcome.

11:09.102 --> 11:16.476
So, why the sudden reversal?
Sepp Blatter said just on Friday
that he was glad to be

11:16.476 --> 11:19.712
reelected and this was going
to be a new era for FIFA.

11:19.712 --> 11:22.749
DECLAN HILL, Investigative
Journalist: It really is
extraordinary.

11:22.749 --> 11:29.923
I mean, today's events starting
early Zurich time dawn all the
way to right now is an epic,

11:29.923 --> 11:34.060
shaking time in international
sports. It reminds me a little
bit of "Game of Thrones,"

11:34.060 --> 11:37.397
the Lannisters are meeting
at King's Landing.

11:37.397 --> 11:42.268
And what is really going on is a
bunch of kingmakers, people
behind the throne, people

11:42.268 --> 11:46.639
that we don't see in public,
either as the journalists or as
sports fans, I think phoned

11:46.639 --> 11:50.777
up Sepp Blatter this morning
and said enough is enough.

11:50.777 --> 11:56.950
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what
precipitated that? As you and I
are speaking, as we tape this

11:56.950 --> 12:01.354
interview, ABC News is reporting
that the FBI, U.S. prosecutors
are now investigating

12:01.354 --> 12:03.389
Blatter himself.

12:03.389 --> 12:08.394
DECLAN HILL: Yes, and you have
an extraordinary scenario here.

12:08.394 --> 12:12.865
As you can see, I'm speaking to
you from Ottawa, Canada, where
the women's World Cup will be

12:12.865 --> 12:18.104
in a few days. The second in
command today earlier today in
Zurich suddenly discovered

12:18.104 --> 12:23.009
that he had crucial business
that meant he couldn't fly to
Canada. Really, what may

12:23.009 --> 12:26.245
be going on, and a lot of people
are talking about this, is that
he's afraid of landing

12:26.245 --> 12:28.381
in Canada.

12:28.381 --> 12:32.819
Canadian extradition laws with
the United States are excellent,
and if you guys want

12:32.819 --> 12:36.990
people arrested, our police
services generally arrest them
and extradite them right way,

12:36.990 --> 12:40.093
unlike Switzerland or
Trinidad and Tobago.

12:40.093 --> 12:46.299
So, there was a fear that the
top executives couldn't even
attend the women's World Cup

12:46.299 --> 12:49.335
without fear of being arrested.
This is really extraordinary.

12:49.335 --> 12:53.906
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a
sense, Declan Hill, of who else
may be implicated before

12:53.906 --> 12:56.342
this is over?

12:56.342 --> 13:00.747
DECLAN HILL: Yes, I looked at
the FBI indictment that came
out, as you know, under Loretta

13:00.747 --> 13:05.184
Lynch, the attorney general,
last week, and it's an
extraordinary picture.

13:05.184 --> 13:10.923
What they really paint is a
deliberate, clear, informal
organized crime syndicate
operating

13:10.923 --> 13:17.096
inside international sports. So
you have the public face of how
to market these TV,

13:17.096 --> 13:23.102
all these ticketing things, and
then you have these really
meticulous, well-planned scams

13:23.102 --> 13:27.674
that are going on inside that
organization. So, really, if
you're getting the second

13:27.674 --> 13:32.111
in command who is afraid of
getting on a plane to fly to
Canada, it really could be
anyone.

13:32.111 --> 13:36.916
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, for Blatter
to step down and be replaced by
someone else, how much

13:36.916 --> 13:39.552
of a change is that
in and of itself?

13:39.552 --> 13:44.390
DECLAN HILL: I think it's
really an era-making change.

13:44.390 --> 13:48.828
There's a whole bunch of
national sports federations
around the world or soccer
federations that

13:48.828 --> 13:54.333
are going to be deeply, deeply
worried. Look, FIFA has a track
record of, when national

13:54.333 --> 13:59.105
governments, be they Iran, be
they Greece, be they Kenya, be
they Nigeria, look at their

13:59.105 --> 14:03.376
soccer and say, hang on, if this
is too corrupt, we're going to
clean it up.

14:03.376 --> 14:08.514
FIFA will go in and stop those
government investigations. They
will stop those police

14:08.514 --> 14:12.385
investigations and they will
say, hey, you know, you can't
investigate our people, because

14:12.385 --> 14:15.722
that's politics
interfering with sport.

14:15.722 --> 14:20.426
So you have sports, soccer
federations around the world
that have been essentially
protected

14:20.426 --> 14:26.265
by Blatter and the people in
Zurich. That day seems to be
over now, and that's going

14:26.265 --> 14:30.136
to shake the soccer world
in a tremendous way.

14:30.136 --> 14:33.773
JUDY WOODRUFF: Declan Hill, we
thank you very much for talking
with us.

14:33.773 --> 14:38.745
DECLAN HILL: Thanks for having
me on, Judy. Very much
appreciate it.

14:38.745 --> 14:50.890
GWEN IFILL: Millions of car
owners face a dilemma. There's
a nationwide recall for

14:50.890 --> 14:55.561
defective air bags affecting
vehicles made by most of the
major auto manufacturers. But

14:55.561 --> 15:00.266
a bigger recall may also mean
a longer wait for repair.

15:00.266 --> 15:05.204
That was just one of several
issues lawmakers laid at the
doorstep today of the Takata
Corporation,

15:05.204 --> 15:13.312
the air bag manufacturer. It's
now the largest auto safety
recall in U.S. history, nearly

15:13.312 --> 15:19.252
34 million vehicles. And,
today, Takata was called before
Congress again.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.088
Executive vice president
Kevin Kennedy:

15:22.088 --> 15:25.091
KEVIN KENNEDY, Executive Vice
President, Takata: It is
unacceptable to us for even one
of

15:25.091 --> 15:28.561
our products to fail to
perform as intended.

15:28.561 --> 15:34.333
GWEN IFILL: Over time, chemical
inflators in Takata air bags
have exploded with so much

15:34.333 --> 15:38.938
force that they spray metal
fragments. The problem is
linked to six deaths and more
than

15:38.938 --> 15:42.508
100 injuries worldwide
since 2003.

15:42.508 --> 15:49.115
KEVIN KENNEDY: We deeply regret
each instance in which someone
has been injured or killed.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.952
We're committed to doing
everything in our power to
address the safety concerns
raised

15:52.952 --> 15:55.288
by air bag ruptures.

15:55.288 --> 16:01.327
GWEN IFILL: Kennedy said Takata
now plans to change the design
of its driver-side air

16:01.327 --> 16:06.866
bags. But lawmakers worried
about how long it will take.
Republican Congressman Fred

16:06.866 --> 16:12.138
Upton pressed Mark Rosekind,
head of the National Highway
Traffic and Safety
Administration.

16:12.138 --> 16:16.876
REP. FRED UPTON (R), Michigan:
What is the goal, the timetable
for completely resolving

16:16.876 --> 16:21.581
the issue, being able to
identify which vehicles have
these defective air bags,
getting them

16:21.581 --> 16:25.785
replaced, making sure the owners
are there? What's your hopeful
time frame for this

16:25.785 --> 16:29.222
to be resolved and we can
move to the next issue?

16:29.222 --> 16:30.122
MARK ROSEKIND, Administrator,
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration: At this point,

16:30.122 --> 16:34.293
I believe if anybody gave you a
number, they don't know what
they're talking about.

16:34.293 --> 16:39.365
GWEN IFILL: Rosekind warned his
agency is underfunded and
already has more than 1,200

16:39.365 --> 16:43.502
other recall campaigns
to oversee.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.938
Let's get more about the
questions asked at this hearing
and the problems consumers are

16:45.938 --> 16:49.375
running into with this recall.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.844
David Shepardson of The Detroit
News covers the auto industry.
And he was covering this

16:51.844 --> 16:54.013
hearing today.

16:54.013 --> 16:59.518
David, do we know anything more
about the cause of these defects
in the air bags, whether

16:59.518 --> 17:02.655
it's chemical or
design or whatever?

17:02.655 --> 17:06.525
DAVID SHEPARDSON, The Detroit
News: I think the answer is all
of the above. In fact,

17:06.525 --> 17:12.031
Takata and NHTSA and an
independent testing group by the
major auto companies think
there's

17:12.031 --> 17:17.737
a variety of factors, number
one, the propellant, ammonium
nitrate, and the fact that,
under

17:17.737 --> 17:25.211
high-humidity circumstances, it
appears to be more likely to
explode or exit at a higher

17:25.211 --> 17:29.382
heat than other propellants, as
well as the design of these air
bags.

17:29.382 --> 17:35.588
In fact, as you pointed out,
Takata is ending its use of one
of these major driver-side

17:35.588 --> 17:40.626
air bags. And then issues like
the tape used to actually attach
the inflator to the

17:40.626 --> 17:45.364
air bag. So you have got a lot
of different causes, and the
fact that you have got 53

17:45.364 --> 17:49.969
million vehicles worldwide, six
deaths and 100 injuries, but
trying to figure out that

17:49.969 --> 17:53.773
needle in a haystack, why are
just such a few number failing,
but when they do fail,

17:53.773 --> 17:54.507
it can be with
deadly consequences?

17:54.507 --> 17:55.074
GWEN IFILL: Catastrophic.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.642
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Right.

17:56.642 --> 18:00.513
GWEN IFILL: So, that's a big
number, 53 million worldwide.
How many models are we

18:00.513 --> 18:04.517
talking about in the U.S.?
Because, in the past, when
recalls have happened, it's been

18:04.517 --> 18:08.220
the actual manufacturer of the
vehicle who did the recall. Is
that what's happening

18:08.220 --> 18:10.222
now? Everyone is scrambling?

18:10.222 --> 18:15.027
DAVID SHEPARDSON: You have got
11 major auto companies
recalling 34 million vehicles

18:15.027 --> 18:19.365
in the U.S.; 17 million have
previously been recalled, so
it's about double that.

18:19.365 --> 18:23.769
And the answer is, we don't know
yet, because, to date, only
seven of the eleven companies

18:23.769 --> 18:29.875
have notified the government as
to the identities of the new
vehicles that are being added to

18:29.875 --> 18:35.781
the recall, and within that you
have got dozens and dozens of
models. So to get to the -- you

18:35.781 --> 18:39.185
know, the end point, where we
know all the vehicles are
probably, as the administrator

18:39.185 --> 18:41.988
was saying, going to take weeks,
if not months, and then you have
got the issue of just building

18:41.988 --> 18:43.689
all the parts.

18:43.689 --> 18:47.593
GWEN IFILL: Well, OK. So,
assume that you were driving one
of these cars which are

18:47.593 --> 18:51.597
suspect, with the suspect air
bag, and you go to the
government Web site, and you
compare

18:51.597 --> 18:55.601
your VIN number, you do all
these things right to find out
that indeed yours is a car which

18:55.601 --> 19:01.474
is under recall. So then how
long will it take you to get
that fix made?

19:01.474 --> 19:05.878
DAVID SHEPARDSON: The answer
really depends likely on where
you are, because the auto

19:05.878 --> 19:10.549
companies and Takata are
prioritizing the high-humidity
areas.

19:10.549 --> 19:14.487
Because right now they have only
built four million replacement
kits, they have got 30

19:14.487 --> 19:19.191
million more to build, and
they're only going to get up to
one million units built per
month

19:19.191 --> 19:23.162
by September, it could
ultimately take two years to
build the parts.

19:23.162 --> 19:27.133
So, if you're in a high-humidity
area, chances are you can get
the fix done immediately.

19:27.133 --> 19:31.737
But check with your dealer.
Depending on the stock of your
dealer, you may be able

19:31.737 --> 19:36.108
to get your vehicle fixed
immediately, and some companies
are offering loaner vehicles

19:36.108 --> 19:39.311
as well. So, there's no good
answer. And, remember, it could
take up to 60 days for

19:39.311 --> 19:41.781
all of the VIN numbers
to get inputted.

19:41.781 --> 19:45.751
So, if you don't see your
vehicle recalled, as the
administrator said, keep
checking once

19:45.751 --> 19:48.254
a week for a couple of
months potentially.

19:48.254 --> 19:51.757
GWEN IFILL: Because of the size
of this recall, is this
something that needs to be

19:51.757 --> 19:56.162
taken out of the hands of -- at
least it has come up in the
hearing today -- of the
individual

19:56.162 --> 19:59.398
auto companies and be handled by
the government instead, by
NHTSA?

19:59.398 --> 20:02.668
DAVID SHEPARDSON: It's a rare
example where the auto companies
actually agree that NHTSA

20:02.668 --> 20:06.238
should take over, as do both the
Republicans and Democrats on the
committee, because you

20:06.238 --> 20:09.542
have got a lot of
decisions to make.

20:09.542 --> 20:14.213
Who gets the parts first? What
if one company's air bags are
more dangerous than the others?

20:14.213 --> 20:19.685
So, the auto companies want
NHTSA to take over and decide
some of these very sticky

20:19.685 --> 20:23.856
decisions and act as an advocate
for the U.S. because you have
got those 20 million vehicles

20:23.856 --> 20:27.393
abroad. And the U.S. could be
jockeying with the other
countries to see who gets those

20:27.393 --> 20:29.829
replacement parts first.

20:29.829 --> 20:33.365
GWEN IFILL: But NHTSA says
they're underfunded. How would
they handle something this big?

20:33.365 --> 20:36.302
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Well, they're
handling so many different big
issues right now. They're

20:36.302 --> 20:40.539
in a big fight with Fiat
Chrysler over recalls and
they're still overseeing GM, and
their

20:40.539 --> 20:45.244
budget is down 23 percent for
defects in real dollars over a
decade.

20:45.244 --> 20:49.248
The White House wants more money
for them to triple their defects
budget and double

20:49.248 --> 20:54.720
their staff, but so far Congress
has not really moved on it. But
the top Republican on the

20:54.720 --> 20:58.924
committee today said if NHTSA
made a better request, they'd
reconsider. But it's still

20:58.924 --> 21:02.361
going to be an uphill battle to
convince Congress to give them
more money or more authority.

21:02.361 --> 21:04.697
GWEN IFILL: Sounds like the
whole thing is an uphill battle
for now.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.632
David Shepardson of The
Detroit News, thank you.

21:06.632 --> 21:09.935
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Thanks, Gwen.

21:09.935 --> 21:21.647
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nearly a full
century after they fought in
World War I, a pair of veterans

21:21.647 --> 21:26.519
were honored posthumously by the
president today. He gave them
the nation's highest

21:26.519 --> 21:31.357
military award, the Medal of
Honor, saying their heroism had
never been fully recognized

21:31.357 --> 21:34.026
because of discrimination.

21:34.026 --> 21:37.363
One recipient was
African-American. The other was
Jewish.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.632
William Brangham has the story.

21:39.632 --> 21:44.003
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: They both risked
their own lives to save

21:44.003 --> 21:51.277
the lives of others. They both
left us decades ago, before we
could give them the full
recognition

21:51.277 --> 21:56.549
that they deserved, but it's
never too late to say thank you.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.952
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For one of
the men honored by President
Obama today, recognition for

21:59.952 --> 22:05.791
his acts of valor were a long
time coming. In 1917, Henry
Johnson joined the all-black

22:05.791 --> 22:09.929
369th Regiment, known as
the Harlem Hellfighters.

22:09.929 --> 22:15.935
At the time, most black soldiers
just performed menial labor, not
combat operations. But

22:15.935 --> 22:21.006
the Hellfighters were deployed
to France and fought under
French command. Private Johnson

22:21.006 --> 22:25.778
was stationed in France on the
western front. On sentry duty
one night, he and another

22:25.778 --> 22:30.983
private, named Needham Roberts,
came under fire from at least a
dozen German soldiers.

22:30.983 --> 22:35.454
After a long fight, both men
were wounded, Roberts was
unconscious, and the Germans
advanced.

22:35.454 --> 22:40.726
BARACK OBAMA: Then he grabbed
the only weapon he had left --
his Bolo knife -- and went

22:40.726 --> 22:45.598
to rescue Needham. Henry took
down one enemy soldier, then the
other. And finally,
reinforcements

22:45.598 --> 22:49.401
arrived and the last
enemy soldier fled.

22:49.401 --> 22:53.372
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For his
extraordinary acts, Johnson was
given France's highest military

22:53.372 --> 22:57.443
honor, the Croix de Guerre.

22:57.443 --> 23:01.480
Johnson and the Hellfighters
were welcomed home by adoring
crowds in Harlem and across

23:01.480 --> 23:05.818
New York. His image was even
used on recruitment posters.
And in a private letter, General

23:05.818 --> 23:11.590
John Pershing, the top American
commander during the war,
recognized Johnson.

23:11.590 --> 23:15.894
But neither Johnson's bravery
nor the 21 wounds he sustained
that night were noted in his

23:15.894 --> 23:19.331
military records back home.

23:19.331 --> 23:23.435
Yohuru Williams, a history
professor at Fairfield
University in Connecticut, said
that was no

23:23.435 --> 23:25.704
simple oversight.

23:25.704 --> 23:28.607
YOHURU WILLIAMS, History
Professor, Fairfield University:
When the French began to
recognize

23:28.607 --> 23:33.946
and celebrate acts of valor,
like we see with the Henry
Johnson case, Pershing's
reaction

23:33.946 --> 23:38.517
wasn't to celebrate these
troops, but actually try to
introduce Jim Crow segregation
into

23:38.517 --> 23:42.988
the French government and into
the army, into the war itself.

23:42.988 --> 23:47.926
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But after
decades of advocacy by fellow
veterans and others, Johnson was

23:47.926 --> 23:52.531
posthumously awarded the Purple
Heart by President Clinton in
1996, and the Medal of Honor
today

23:52.531 --> 23:56.302
by President Obama.

23:56.302 --> 24:01.073
Another World War I veteran
received the nation's highest
military honor today, Sergeant
William

24:01.073 --> 24:06.845
Shemin. While Shemin did
receive the military's second
highest award in 1919, the
president

24:06.845 --> 24:12.318
said his accomplishments never
got the full honor they
deserved, in part because he was

24:12.318 --> 24:16.255
Jewish. Shemin's daughters were
on hand to accept his award
today.

24:16.255 --> 24:21.694
BARACK OBAMA: The Allies were
hunkered down in one trench, the
Germans in another, separated

24:21.694 --> 24:27.266
by about 150 yards of open space
-- just a
football-field-and-a-half.

24:27.266 --> 24:34.640
But that open space was a
bloodbath. Soldier after
soldier ventured out, and
soldier after

24:34.640 --> 24:41.880
soldier was mowed down. So
those still in the trenches were
left with a terrible choice,

24:41.880 --> 24:46.752
die trying to rescue your fellow
soldier, or watch him die,
knowing that part of you

24:46.752 --> 24:50.989
will die along with him.

24:50.989 --> 24:57.229
William Shemin couldn't stand to
watch. He ran out into the hell
of No Man's Land and

24:57.229 --> 25:05.471
dragged a wounded comrade to
safety. And then he did it
again, and again. Three times,

25:05.471 --> 25:12.644
he raced through heavy machine
gunfire. Three times, he
carried his fellow soldiers to
safety.

25:12.644 --> 25:16.415
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At a press
conference earlier this week,
Elsie Shemin-Roth said

25:16.415 --> 25:19.818
her father was one of
many overlooked heroes.

25:19.818 --> 25:22.521
ELSIE SHEMIN-ROTH, Daughter of
Sergeant William Shemin: This
supreme honor is the name of

25:22.521 --> 25:28.994
William Shemin, but it would
please him if it were also
dedicated to the fallen, the

25:28.994 --> 25:34.500
survivors and their families who
didn't have the proper paperwork
or representation depicting

25:34.500 --> 25:36.668
their valor.

25:36.668 --> 25:41.373
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Professor
Williams says recognizing
soldiers like Shemin and Johnson

25:41.373 --> 25:45.344
today reminds us that the
failure to acknowledge the
contributions of minority
soldiers is

25:45.344 --> 25:49.581
an ugly, but undeniable
theme of American history.

25:49.581 --> 25:53.886
YOHURU WILLIAMS: Ultimately,
what happens is, you go from
this moment where Johnson

25:53.886 --> 25:58.557
is celebrated by his own
community, and yet has to deal
with the reality that the United

25:58.557 --> 26:03.862
States government, those that
hold power, those in power are
not doing anything to meet

26:03.862 --> 26:07.733
not only his needs, but the
needs of other soldiers who
fought bravely for their
country.

26:07.733 --> 26:11.170
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Because of
his wounds, Henry Johnson could
not work after returning

26:11.170 --> 26:16.141
from the war. And because those
wounds went undocumented, he was
ineligible for military

26:16.141 --> 26:23.182
benefits. He died in 1929,
penniless and ravaged by
alcoholism. The president said

26:23.182 --> 26:26.685
today's ceremony was a small way
to right the wrongs done to
Johnson and his fellow

26:26.685 --> 26:29.421
service members.

26:29.421 --> 26:34.493
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham in Washington.

26:34.493 --> 26:48.340
GWEN IFILL: Even if Congress
reined in government
surveillance powers today,
evidence of a different

26:48.340 --> 26:53.345
sort of privacy concerns
surfaced, this time at the FBI.

26:53.345 --> 26:59.084
The Associated Press reported
that the FBI operates a fleet of
undercover planes shielded

26:59.084 --> 27:05.791
by fake company names that flew
surveillance over at least 30
cities in 11 states during

27:05.791 --> 27:08.293
a 30-day period. They're
equipped with video cameras and
sometimes equipment to gather

27:08.293 --> 27:11.530
cell phone area.

27:11.530 --> 27:15.267
The FBI says the flights target
suspected criminals and that, in
most cases, a warrant

27:15.267 --> 27:18.537
is not necessary.

27:18.537 --> 27:21.473
Jack Gillum is one of the
reporters at the Associated
Press on the story.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.475
Describe the secret fleet
that you guys wrote about.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.310
JACK GILLUM, Associated
Press: Well, most

27:25.310 --> 27:28.447
often, if you were going to look
up a tail number -- that is the
number that is emblazoned

27:28.447 --> 27:32.985
on the back of the plane -- you
might go to the FAA's database
of that aircraft. Sometimes,

27:32.985 --> 27:39.191
it might say it belongs to Jack
Gillum or a corporation, maybe
Google, Microsoft, a

27:39.191 --> 27:44.863
corporate jet of sorts, but all
of these aircraft belong to
these sort of strange-looking
companies,

27:44.863 --> 27:48.767
M.G. Research being one of them,
a mix of letters, sometimes the
word research, sometimes

27:48.767 --> 27:52.671
other names, that all trace
back to a bunch of P.O. Boxes.

27:52.671 --> 27:57.876
Now, this came to light after
this aircraft was spotted and
reported by The Washington

27:57.876 --> 28:02.614
Post in early May during some
civil unrest following the death
of Freddie Gray in Baltimore.

28:02.614 --> 28:07.319
Now, what we found is we wanted
to look and see, are there are
more aircraft like

28:07.319 --> 28:11.123
this, and started digging
through FAA records and other
air flight radar patterns to see

28:11.123 --> 28:13.659
just the full scope
of this operation.

28:13.659 --> 28:16.228
GWEN IFILL: So, let's go back
to this idea of dummy
corporations. What's the point

28:16.228 --> 28:19.865
of shielding the owners
of these planes?

28:19.865 --> 28:25.837
JACK GILLUM: The FBI says that
when they want to do this sort
of fictitious company,

28:25.837 --> 28:29.741
it's that they don't want to
give criminals on the ground a
heads-up that when they look

28:29.741 --> 28:38.283
at the sky above they're going
to see a plane that belongs to
the FBI or to the U.S.
government.

28:34.246 --> 28:39.918
They also say that they want to
keep operational security. So
if you have -- if know that

28:39.918 --> 28:43.221
it's an FBI plane, you know
where it takes off and lands,
you might be able to sabotage

28:43.221 --> 28:48.460
it. Now, that doesn't really
sit well in the minds of a lot
of people for whom these

28:48.460 --> 28:53.165
planes are circling above
overhead, and sometimes they get
very concerned, even calling
911,

28:53.165 --> 28:56.001
asking who is this guy above
my house and what is he doing?

28:56.001 --> 28:58.904
GWEN IFILL: What does the FBI
say when they get these
questions? What are -- or what

28:58.904 --> 29:01.807
do they say to you that
they're looking for?

29:01.807 --> 29:05.877
JACK GILLUM: Well, leading up
into this report, until we spoke
to some law enforcement

29:05.877 --> 29:10.515
officials, is that they had
largely told in either reports,
either in local news reports

29:10.515 --> 29:13.385
or when people had asked,
they largely remained silent.

29:13.385 --> 29:17.489
The Federal Aviation
Administration, which of course
registers the planes, had also
largely

29:17.489 --> 29:24.363
remained silent. In this case,
U.S. government officials said
that, no, we're behind these,

29:24.363 --> 29:30.569
we set up these dummy
corporations to keep secrecy, or
at least to not let people know

29:30.569 --> 29:34.272
what these planes are, but
indeed that the program is also
not secret.

29:34.272 --> 29:38.243
GWEN IFILL: So this was one of
those issues that was kind of
hiding in plain sight. People

29:38.243 --> 29:40.012
saw these planes, they knew
something was up, but the
government never confirmed it

29:40.012 --> 29:41.046
until now?

29:41.046 --> 29:43.649
JACK GILLUM: That's right.

29:43.649 --> 29:48.220
And it was the volume of the
flights that stood out to us.
So we were able to look

29:48.220 --> 29:54.359
at lot of flight radar data
going -- following these flights
from Seattle to Houston, Dallas

29:54.359 --> 29:59.231
to the Boston area. We were
able to stitch the flights
together initially by not just

29:59.231 --> 30:05.003
looking at these registrations
back to these dummy companies in
rural Virginia, but also

30:05.003 --> 30:10.676
the aircraft registration
records, which had what appeared
to be fictitious CEOs, one man

30:10.676 --> 30:12.844
signing his name at least three
different ways across several of
these companies that

30:12.844 --> 30:14.713
were set up.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.615
GWEN IFILL: I think the name
was Robert Lindley. And, as far
as you know, he doesn't

30:16.615 --> 30:18.316
exist.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.919
JACK GILLUM: Yes, right. And
the FBI and the government
generally says it would not

30:20.919 --> 30:23.255
confirm if he's an employee.

30:23.255 --> 30:28.427
GWEN IFILL: Now, this doesn't
require a court, a judge. We
were talking about the

30:28.427 --> 30:30.962
Patriot Act. That required a
secret court to sign off on some
of the surveillance. This

30:30.962 --> 30:33.131
doesn't?

30:33.131 --> 30:36.535
JACK GILLUM: Law enforcement
officials will say that when
you're viewing somebody from

30:36.535 --> 30:40.005
the sky, there's no Fourth
Amendment protection here.

30:40.005 --> 30:45.310
The question really becomes, as
technology evolves, is just how
specific can a technology

30:45.310 --> 30:49.514
be? Ten years ago, 15 years
ago, a pair of binoculars might
have been all that does

30:49.514 --> 30:54.386
the trick. Now you have H.D.
video. You can zoom in very
closely. And the concern

30:54.386 --> 30:58.590
for civil libertarians and
privacy advocates is if you're
up there and you're recording

30:58.590 --> 31:02.027
this video and it gets more
granular over time, what's going
to be used with that video,

31:02.027 --> 31:05.197
how it's going to be stored,
and can you rewind your life?

31:05.197 --> 31:08.266
GWEN IFILL: And it's not just
video. There is actual
equipment attached to some of
these

31:08.266 --> 31:10.969
planes that can track cell
phones in a way -- like from
cell phone tower to cell phone

31:10.969 --> 31:11.670
tower?

31:11.670 --> 31:13.705
JACK GILLUM: That's right.

31:13.705 --> 31:19.611
And the FBI says that this
practice is extremely rare, a
rare occurrence. But this
technology,

31:19.611 --> 31:23.915
which has been used in some
criminal cases, tricks cell
phones below into thinking that

31:23.915 --> 31:28.253
it's a cell tower and coughs up
some basic subscriber data,
effectively allowing police,

31:28.253 --> 31:31.256
in this case the FBI, to
know who's down below.

31:31.256 --> 31:34.192
GWEN IFILL: If you're
barbecuing in your backyard, and
you have your cell phone in

31:34.192 --> 31:36.561
your pocket, it's possible that
there's a plane that flies above
your backyard who knows

31:36.561 --> 31:39.064
who you are and
what you're doing?

31:39.064 --> 31:42.934
JACK GILLUM: If they are
capturing that cell phone
surveillance and they are able

31:42.934 --> 31:46.204
to tie that serial number to
your cell phone to your name,
they could probably do that.

31:46.204 --> 31:48.440
GWEN IFILL: Or theoretically a
terrorist could be caught the
same way.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.741
JACK GILLUM: At a
barbecue possibly, too.

31:49.741 --> 31:50.842
GWEN IFILL: Possibly.

31:50.842 --> 31:54.713
Jack Gillum of the
Associated Press, thank you.

31:54.713 --> 32:00.218
JACK GILLUM: Thank you.

32:00.218 --> 32:06.691
JUDY WOODRUFF: As homelessness
has grown in cities across the
country, more so-called

32:06.691 --> 32:11.263
street papers have cropped
up to help tell the story.

32:11.263 --> 32:14.900
We went back to look again at
how one newspaper in the
nation's capital is doing 10
years

32:14.900 --> 32:16.735
later.

32:16.735 --> 32:21.072
The "NewsHour"'s Anne Davenport
found it is expanding its
mission.

32:21.072 --> 32:24.309
WOMAN: It's my honor and
privilege to welcome you this
evening to Cinema From the
Streets,

32:24.309 --> 32:31.216
a cooperation of amazing talent
by our colleagues, both housed
and unhoused.

32:31.216 --> 32:36.254
ANNE DAVENPORT: When you think
of red carpet film premieres,
this is not the customary

32:36.254 --> 32:41.459
scene. Among this group are
developing filmmakers who appear
in their own documentary about

32:41.459 --> 32:45.130
homelessness. They are or have
been homeless in the nation's
capital and are now seeing

32:45.130 --> 32:48.466
their work on the big screen.

32:48.466 --> 32:55.040
Three short films were recently
produced by Capturing Hope, part
of an organization called

32:55.040 --> 33:00.579
Street Sense. The team members
are eager to get out their story
and learn valuable

33:00.579 --> 33:09.521
production skills. Street Sense
also publishes the only
newspaper by and for the
homeless

33:09.521 --> 33:16.761
in Washington, enabling sellers
to make $1.50 for every $2 paper
sold. The twice-monthly

33:16.761 --> 33:22.133
newspaper also trains
participants in journalism and a
variety of forms of writing,
with 12,000

33:22.133 --> 33:31.076
issues sold each addition.

33:31.076 --> 33:41.453
Now, in a novel approach, the
Street Sense organization is
expanding more heavily into

33:41.453 --> 33:47.025
arts education and digital media
in order to help homeless people
get a toehold in diverse

33:47.025 --> 33:53.365
creative careers. Workshops and
apprenticeships are led by
volunteer professionals.

33:53.365 --> 34:10.315
In addition to the filmmaking,
there's theater, interactive
art, digital photography, where

34:10.315 --> 34:13.752
one participant shared a
first-person piece documenting
his heart condition.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.520
BRIAN CAROME, Executive
Director, Street Sense:

34:15.520 --> 34:20.191
Our vision is that we're a
full-spectrum media company,
that we're spreading the word

34:20.191 --> 34:22.360
about homelessness.

34:22.360 --> 34:27.165
ANNE DAVENPORT: Brian Carome
leads Street Sense. This is the
paper's 11th year and

34:27.165 --> 34:34.339
it is housed here at the
Episcopal Church of the Epiphany
in downtown Washington. Fifty

34:34.339 --> 34:38.610
percent of its support comes
from individual contributions,
25 percent from newspaper sales,

34:38.610 --> 34:41.246
and 15 percent from
foundations and corporations.

34:41.246 --> 34:45.717
BRIAN CAROME: We have
two missions here.

34:45.717 --> 34:50.155
One is economic opportunities
for men and women who are
homeless. You can walk in

34:50.155 --> 34:54.225
the doors today and be out
working today, even if you don't
have a penny in your pocket,

34:54.225 --> 34:58.997
even if you just got to of jail,
even if you slept outside last
night, even if you're still

34:58.997 --> 35:03.335
struggling with serious
disabilities. And we're proud
of that work.

35:03.335 --> 35:08.306
And then our second half of our
mission is public education.
We're -- the content of

35:08.306 --> 35:15.480
our media is meant to impact
hearts and minds in this
community. And the new media
that

35:15.480 --> 35:21.686
we're doing, the media beyond
the print, beyond the newspaper,
is also, we believe, creating

35:21.686 --> 35:27.225
avenues for much higher-paying
employment than you can
experience selling a newspaper

35:27.225 --> 35:30.061
on a street corner.

35:30.061 --> 35:36.668
ANNE DAVENPORT: Sasha Williams,
who was raped at gunpoint
earlier in life, has been

35:36.668 --> 35:42.207
homeless off and on for a number
years. She has just landed
stable housing, enabling her

35:42.207 --> 35:45.844
to move out of a shelter with
her 2-year-old daughter, Eboni
(ph). She is now documenting

35:45.844 --> 35:51.082
the conditions there
for a future film.

35:51.082 --> 35:54.919
Sasha is the main videographer
for the Cinema From the Streets
films that debuted. She

35:54.919 --> 35:57.555
wants to pursue a
career in this craft.

35:57.555 --> 36:00.658
SASHA WILLIAMS, Street Sense
Participant: I still have to
redo my resume, which I

36:00.658 --> 36:04.562
like to do, because it shows the
stuff that I have been doing
with myself, which is a

36:04.562 --> 36:07.966
good look for me to think
about the positive stuff.

36:07.966 --> 36:12.937
And it's really helping me to
build up myself, being a good
mom, being a woman. They treat

36:12.937 --> 36:19.644
me like I'm a genuine colleague.
They don't treat me like I'm
just a client.

36:19.644 --> 36:24.215
ANNE DAVENPORT: James Davis is
training a new Street Sense
vendor on the do's and

36:24.215 --> 36:29.387
don'ts of selling the paper on
the street and representing the
organization. Davis

36:29.387 --> 36:33.658
would know. He had recently
joined Street Sense when the
"NewsHour" interviewed him

36:33.658 --> 36:38.696
10 falls ago. He was a homeless
engineer, laid off from his
security clearance job and

36:38.696 --> 36:41.466
in the midst of a divorce
and deepening depression.

36:41.466 --> 36:45.970
JAMES DAVIS, Street Sense: It's
just more than a newspaper.
It's more giving back

36:45.970 --> 36:47.939
in the sense of helping people.

36:47.939 --> 36:51.743
ANNE DAVENPORT: Davis was also
contributing poetry to the
paper.

36:51.743 --> 36:56.347
JAMES DAVIS: Hope turns to
despair while they gather at a
place called some, the men

36:56.347 --> 37:00.051
with worn look of
life on their faces.

37:00.051 --> 37:06.491
ANNE DAVENPORT: And today? In
addition to counseling new
vendors, he advocates on

37:06.491 --> 37:12.097
behalf of the National Coalition
for the Homeless in forums and
works at Metro part time. He

37:12.097 --> 37:16.201
lives independently, and still
writes and sells papers,
pocketing an average of $100

37:16.201 --> 37:19.671
a day, with the possibility of a
few hundred dollars around the
holidays.

37:19.671 --> 37:25.610
JAMES DAVIS: I have a customer
base that's already in place. I
believe we put out a

37:25.610 --> 37:29.714
good product. And people really
look forward to reading the
paper. Maybe this was my

37:29.714 --> 37:33.751
purpose to go through
homelessness, so I can know what
I'm talking about, so I can help

37:33.751 --> 37:35.587
others.

37:35.587 --> 37:40.358
ANNE DAVENPORT: Currently in
Washington, D.C., proper, there
are almost 7,300 homeless

37:40.358 --> 37:45.530
people in the city and close to
12,000 in the D.C. metro area,
though many think that

37:45.530 --> 37:50.735
count may be low. Recent
statistics show there are 41,000
households active on the

37:50.735 --> 37:57.976
wait-list for D.C. housing.
More than 20,000 listed
themselves as homeless.

37:57.976 --> 38:01.279
Nancy Burnett works with an
angel investor organization and
runs a financial educators

38:01.279 --> 38:03.414
group.

38:03.414 --> 38:05.650
NANCY BURNETT, Alliance of
Securities and Financial
Educators: If I was given a
choice

38:05.650 --> 38:09.821
for the same price, let's say,
to have a videographer who has
got a lot of experience, a lot
of

38:09.821 --> 38:15.560
awards, and I would take them at
the same time that I would take
this population of

38:15.560 --> 38:19.097
learners. They have a different
eye, they have a different ear.
They have -- you know,

38:19.097 --> 38:21.533
their soul is different.

38:21.533 --> 38:27.338
BRIAN CAROME: One of the things
is the powerful transformational
effect that self-expression

38:27.338 --> 38:30.675
has on our lives, because you
have got to first believe in
yourself to claw your way

38:30.675 --> 38:34.979
out of this deep hole
that is homelessness.

38:34.979 --> 38:44.088
ANNE DAVENPORT: So, as James
Davis and Sasha Williams and
others continue their efforts

38:44.088 --> 38:49.394
for a more stable existence,
they help each other in this
collaborative workshop
environment.

38:49.394 --> 38:56.935
In Washington, D.C., I'm Anne
Davenport for the "PBS
NewsHour."

38:56.935 --> 38:58.069
(SINGING)

38:58.069 --> 39:03.741
GWEN IFILL: That's
a nice voice.

39:03.741 --> 39:07.378
Go online to see a link to the
recently-released films about
homelessness, and to hear from

39:07.378 --> 39:11.349
a Street Sense filmmaker
and his mentor.

39:11.349 --> 39:15.553
And we will be back with a look
at a new approach to schooling
in Pakistan.

39:15.553 --> 39:19.791
But, first, it's pledge week on
PBS. This break allows your
public television station

39:19.791 --> 39:22.894
to ask for your support. And
that support helps keep programs
like ours on the air.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.762
(BREAK)

39:24.762 --> 39:30.168
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to one
woman's efforts to find answers
in one of the world's most

39:30.168 --> 39:32.604
distressed school systems.

39:32.604 --> 39:36.674
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro reports from Karachi,
Pakistan, part of his series

39:36.674 --> 39:39.310
Agents for Change.

39:39.310 --> 39:44.549
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Eleven-year-old Aqsa (ph) has
high ambitions.

39:44.549 --> 39:50.121
GIRL: First, I want to be a
public speaker, and then
president of Pakistan to change.

39:50.121 --> 39:55.860
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
To change things?

39:55.860 --> 40:00.431
How do you harness the energy
and the enthusiasm of young
children?

40:00.431 --> 40:02.867
If you became president of
Pakistan, what would you like to
do?

40:02.867 --> 40:07.171
GIRL: First, I will clean the
litter, because the biggest
problem is litter.

40:07.171 --> 40:10.875
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In Lyari,
one of Karachi's toughest
neighborhoods, Aqsa is part of
an

40:10.875 --> 40:15.046
experiment started six years ago
called the Kiran (ph) School.
The children here are

40:15.046 --> 40:19.417
encouraged to think big, to use
their imaginations. But the
gritty reality just outside of a

40:19.417 --> 40:22.587
city often racked by terrorism
and violence looms large.

40:22.587 --> 40:27.191
GIRL: There are many people who
are like, they are heartless, so
they kill people.

40:27.191 --> 40:31.796
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: What kind
of terrorism do you see in
Lyari?

40:31.796 --> 40:35.967
GIRL: They killed one man at
night. It was late, 2:00. They
came and they killed

40:35.967 --> 40:37.835
and went.

40:37.835 --> 40:41.372
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Eleven-year-old Hammad (ph) also
has witnessed killing first
hand.

40:41.372 --> 40:45.677
He wants to be a robotics
scientist when he grows up.

40:45.677 --> 40:49.747
BOY: Robots, like, do
everything. And they will stop
terrorism, not kill them, but

40:49.747 --> 40:53.451
they will stop terrorism and
just give to the police.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.321
SABINA KHATRI, Founder, Kiran
School: He said that, why can't
we have robots in Lyari

40:56.321 --> 40:57.989
as policemen?

40:57.989 --> 41:01.726
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Sabina
Khatri is the school founder.

41:01.726 --> 41:05.863
SABINA KHATRI: Nobody can kill
the robots. The bad people will
be defeated.

41:05.863 --> 41:11.936
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A mother of
grown children, Khatri lived in
Europe for many years before

41:11.936 --> 41:16.507
returning to Karachi. She
started the Kiran School six
years ago, based on the
Montessori

41:16.507 --> 41:22.447
learning model, admitting just
20 students each year, the goal,
prepare them to attend

41:22.447 --> 41:25.650
top private English-language
schools, alongside children from
Karachi's tiny upper class.

41:25.650 --> 41:29.354
She's raised scholarships and
donations in a foundation for
her social enterprise. The

41:29.354 --> 41:32.090
children have thrived, Khatri
says, even become Harvard
material.

41:32.090 --> 41:37.995
SABINA KHATRI: And this is one
of the principals who told me
that this kid can make it to
Harvard.

41:37.995 --> 41:42.934
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Problem is,
the vast majority of children in
Lyari and Pakistan

41:42.934 --> 41:49.240
will go nowhere. Just 2 percent
of the government's budget goes
to education, and much of that

41:49.240 --> 41:53.644
is squandered. Public schools
are in decrepit condition.
Fifty percent lack electricity;

41:53.644 --> 41:58.916
40 percent have no toilets.
Many are stripped of furniture.
And it gets worse.

41:58.916 --> 42:03.955
It's not uncommon in this
country for there to be public
schools that exist only on
paper.

42:03.955 --> 42:07.992
The money's been allocated, but
no building's been built, no
students enrolled. The only

42:07.992 --> 42:12.997
thing that is up and running is
the payroll for so-called
teachers. They are, in fact,

42:12.997 --> 42:14.866
mostly beneficiaries
of political favors.

42:14.866 --> 42:17.735
Khatri says the
government is starting to

42:17.735 --> 42:22.573
face facts, and it's invited
outsiders to take over failing
schools. A few months

42:22.573 --> 42:28.246
ago, Khatri adopted this Lyari
middle school. Her first task
was to hire new teachers

42:28.246 --> 42:33.551
and tell most of the old ones,
tenured, so they could not be
fired, to just stay away.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.754
SABINA KHATRI: They come and
make -- create troubles in the
school.

42:36.754 --> 42:41.392
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, you
would just as soon have them
be...

42:41.392 --> 42:44.695
SABINA KHATRI: Yes. I just
tell them that, if you're
creating trouble here, it's
better

42:44.695 --> 42:48.232
that you don't come.

42:48.232 --> 42:52.336
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Her next
step, rearrange classes to
cluster students by ability, not

42:52.336 --> 42:54.672
grade level.

42:54.672 --> 43:01.946
SABINA KHATRI: Although they do
say that they are in the eighth
grade or ninth grade,

43:01.946 --> 43:06.217
they can't even -- they don't
even know how to write their
name in Urdu, let alone in

43:06.217 --> 43:08.052
English.

43:08.052 --> 43:14.826
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
students here have been put in
an intense remedial curriculum.

43:14.826 --> 43:20.565
There's strong emphasis on
inquiry and critical thinking,
instead of the more common rote

43:20.565 --> 43:32.477
learning. The school also
teaches Islamic values that
Khatri says are too often
neglected,

43:32.477 --> 43:38.049
like tolerance. It's a
challenge in a conservative and
in many ways isolated society.

43:38.049 --> 43:43.721
SABINA KHATRI: The biggest
criticism and concern was that
maybe we were very modern,

43:43.721 --> 43:51.629
that they feel that we teach our
children music and dance and we
are making them broad-minded.

43:51.629 --> 43:59.170
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And she's
poised to take a controversial
step.

43:59.170 --> 44:05.643
SABINA KHATRI: We have actually
taken permission for a
co-education school. So, we
want to

44:05.643 --> 44:09.747
admit girls now, because we
already have 250 boys in school.

44:09.747 --> 44:16.120
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Regular
meetings with parents and the
community are also part of

44:16.120 --> 44:23.027
the job. When one woman at a
recent open house worried the
school was teaching liberal

44:23.027 --> 44:28.132
values, Khatri asked an
11-year-old from the Kiran
School to respond.

44:28.132 --> 44:32.870
SABINA KHATRI: She actually
said that, you know, we believe
in God. The way we have

44:32.870 --> 44:36.807
learned about God is, God is
love. But that is not the way
other children are taught.

44:36.807 --> 44:39.477
It's always taught that God
will punish you. God loves you.

44:39.477 --> 44:40.912
They were quiet.

44:40.912 --> 44:43.681
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
And accepting?

44:43.681 --> 45:00.998
SABINA KHATRI: It was a
wonderful -- yes, I think so,
because, then, after that, the

45:00.998 --> 45:09.907
same lady, she said, I
want an admission form.

45:09.907 --> 45:22.687
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: One parent
was assuaged, but Khatri says
intolerance remains a threat.

45:22.687 --> 45:36.500
So, community service projects
are another way to win the
neighborhood over. But in

45:36.500 --> 45:42.873
a country racked by instability,
there is no guarantee.

45:42.873 --> 45:58.522
SABINA KHATRI: Anything can
happen to me any time,
especially in the situation I
am,

45:58.522 --> 46:15.439
and especially the kind of
things that have been happening
in our country, because social
workers have been

46:15.439 --> 46:29.687
targeted lately, in the past two
or three years. Anyone who's
trying to help out people,

46:29.687 --> 46:33.991
they just kill them.

46:33.991 --> 47:18.035
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Still,
Khatri, who was recently joined
by a prominent business leader,

47:18.035 --> 47:53.170
plans to persist with what she
calls a promising prototype to
fix a broken school system.

47:53.170 --> 48:04.648
She and many others say it's
where intolerance and most of
Pakistan's social and economic

48:04.648 --> 48:07.284
problems have their root.

48:07.284 --> 48:14.692
I'm Fred de Sam Lazaro for the
"PBS NewsHour" in Karachi,
Pakistan.

48:14.692 --> 48:24.435
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's reporting
is a partnership with the
Under-Told Stories Project at
Saint

48:24.435 --> 48:27.872
Mary's University of Minnesota.

48:27.872 --> 48:53.430
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: Paleontologists in
Brazil have stumbled upon a bird
fossil

48:53.430 --> 49:16.554
that is so well-preserved, its
long tail feathers may have even
retained some of their original

49:16.554 --> 49:27.331
coloring. Considering it's
roughly 115 million years old,
that's quite a find. Read about

49:27.331 --> 51:15.439
the discovery, and see an
artist's rendering of its
colorful plumage, on our home
page.

51:15.439 --> 51:59.483
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

51:59.483 --> 52:57.107
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's a

52:57.107 --> 53:15.959
long

53:15.959 --> 53:16.960
time to keep the color.

53:16.960 --> 53:17.361
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

53:17.361 --> 53:19.196
(LAUGHTER)

53:19.196 --> 53:23.700
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tune in later
this week. Miles O'Brien kicks
off a series, Cracking

53:23.700 --> 53:30.107
Ebola's Code. Miles travels to
Sierra Leone and trails local
and international doctors

53:30.107 --> 53:35.712
searching for the origins of the
virus, testing possible
vaccines, as they try to end the

53:35.712 --> 53:40.384
worst outbreak of the virus in
history, and prepare for the
next one. That starts Thursday

53:40.384 --> 53:43.287
on the "PBS NewsHour."

53:43.287 --> 53:45.189
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:45.189 --> 53:47.257
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:47.257 --> 53:50.961
We will see you online and again
here tomorrow evening. For all
of us here at the "PBS

53:50.961 --> 53:57.334
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
