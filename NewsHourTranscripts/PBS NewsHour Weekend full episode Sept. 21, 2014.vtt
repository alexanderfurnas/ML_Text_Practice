06:56.650 --> 06:59.786
THE FIRST TIME IN A CLIMATE

06:59.786 --> 07:01.554
VISUAL DEMONSTRATION OF HOW MANY

07:01.554 --> 07:03.256
PEOPLE FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT

07:03.256 --> 07:04.424
ORGANIZATIONS REALLY CARE ABOUT

07:04.424 --> 07:05.225
THIS.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.693
THERE ARE A LOT OF LABOR GROUPS

07:06.693 --> 07:08.094

07:08.094 --> 07:09.929
GROUPS THAT ARE COMING IN,

07:09.929 --> 07:11.898
DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES, BUT YOU

07:19.439 --> 07:21.508
EQUALITY GROUPS ARE COMING IN,

07:21.508 --> 07:23.376
AND I THINK THE BIG THING HAS

07:23.376 --> 07:24.944
BEEN THE REALIZATION THAT

07:24.944 --> 07:26.413
CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T JUST

07:26.413 --> 07:27.180
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.848
IT IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE, A

07:28.848 --> 07:30.250
SOCIAL EQUALITY ISSUE.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.518
IT IS A LABOR ISSUE.

07:31.518 --> 07:32.852
IT IS KIND OF EVERYBODY'S ISSUE.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.487

ALL OF THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES

08:15.462 --> 08:16.996
CAN ACTUALLY AGREE ON, YOU KNOW,

08:16.996 --> 08:18.598
YOU HAVE

08:18.598 --> 08:20.300
COUNTRIES THAT DIDN'T EXACT

THAT ARE OFTEN THE HARDEST HIT

08:38.985 --> 08:39.853
WITH CLIMATE CHANGE.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.621
IS TO SET ASIDE TO HELP THEM

POGONYI SAYS LEVELS OF ANTI-ROMA

13:33.346 --> 13:34.514

13:34.514 --> 13:35.548
CONSISTENT SINCE THE EARLY

13:35.548 --> 13:36.582
1990S.

13:36.582 --> 13:38.584
BUT THE JOBBIK PARTY, HE SAYS,

13:38.584 --> 13:39.519
IS THE FIRST POLITICAL BLOC TO

13:39.519 --> 13:41.854
CAPITALIZE ON THOSE FEELINGS.

13:41.854 --> 13:43.623
>> PEOPLE LIVING PARTICULARLY IN

13:43.623 --> 13:44.757
RURAL AREAS, POOR RURAL AREAS

13:44.757 --> 13:45.925
HAVE THE SENSE OF BEING

13:45.925 --> 13:49.328
ABANDONED BY THE GOVERNMENT.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.097
I MEAN, THEY FACE PETTY CRIME,

13:51.097 --> 13:52.198
AND THEY REALIZE THAT THE

13:52.198 --> 13:54.167
GOVERNMENT, THE AUTHORITIES DO

13:54.167 --> 13:56.436
AND CAN DO NOTHING.

13:56.436 --> 14:00.173
AND AT THAT POINT SOME PEOPLE

14:00.173 --> 14:01.174
APPEAR AND THEY SAY, WE WILL

PROTECT YOU.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.144

14:07.013 --> 14:09.115
DEFEND THE TERM GYPSY CRIME,

14:09.115 --> 14:12.385
CALLING IT A UNIQUE FORM OF

14:12.385 --> 14:14.187
DELINQUENCY, DIFFERENT FROM THE

CRIMES OF THE MAJORITY IN NATURE

14:24.363 --> 14:26.799
ROMA-MAJORITY COMMUNITIES.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.367
>> THE WAY I SEE IT THE PROBLEM

14:28.367 --> 14:30.203
IS, AND THEY ARE PERFECTLY AWARE

14:30.203 --> 14:31.738
OF THIS, THE JOBBIK PARTY, THAT

14:31.738 --> 14:33.272
BY USING THE WORD GYPSY AND THE

14:33.272 --> 14:33.940
WORD CRIME IN THE SAME SENTENCE,

14:33.940 --> 14:39.645
IT BRANDS EVERYONE.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.948
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A SINGLE

14:41.948 --> 14:43.716
ROMA, A SINGLE CREDIBLE ROMA

14:43.716 --> 14:44.884
LEADER, WHO SAYS THERE ARE NO

14:44.884 --> 14:46.786
CRIMINALS AMONG THE ROMA

14:46.786 --> 14:48.221
POPULATION, JUST AS THERE ARE A

14:48.221 --> 14:49.589
SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF CRIMINALS

14:49.589 --> 14:51.958
AMONG THE NON-ROMA POPULATION.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.226
BUT THEY SAY IT'S BECAUSE OF

14:53.226 --> 14:54.527
POVERTY, NOT BECAUSE OF

14:54.527 --> 14:56.295
BELONGING TO A CERTAIN ETHNIC

14:56.295 --> 14:57.630
GROUP.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.099
>> Reporter: IN HUNGARY TODAY,

15:00.099 --> 15:01.601
70% OF ROMA LIVE BELOW THE

15:11.043 --> 15:12.478
IS WORKING TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS

15:12.478 --> 15:13.212
FOR ROMA BUT THOSE PLANS WILL

15:13.212 --> 15:15.615
TAKE TIME.

15:15.615 --> 15:16.616

15:16.616 --> 15:18.484
BREAKTHROUGH.

15:18.484 --> 15:19.786

15:19.786 --> 15:21.287
AGREEMENT IN PROFESSIONAL

15:21.287 --> 15:22.722
CIRCLES AS WELL AS IN POLITICS

15:22.722 --> 15:24.524
THAT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY

15:24.524 --> 15:26.192
CONSISTENT ACTUALLY ON APPLYING

15:26.192 --> 15:27.827
THESE MEASURES ON THE LONG RUN.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.262
THAT MEANS AT LEAST TEN YEARS.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.330
THE ROMA ISSUE HAS BEEN WITH US

15:31.330 --> 15:33.332
NOT ONLY FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF

15:33.332 --> 15:34.901
YEARS OR DECADES IT'S A SIX

15:34.901 --> 15:37.336
HUNDRED YEARS OLD ISSUE.

15:37.336 --> 15:38.471
WE'VE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER WITH

15:46.012 --> 15:51.517
THAT WE'VE BEEN LIVING WITH THE

15:52.718 --> 15:54.153
ALREADY SEPARATING YOURSELF FROM

15:54.153 --> 15:55.354
PEOPLE WHO ARE HUNGARIAN

15:55.354 --> 15:56.889
CITIZENS, RIGHT?

15:56.889 --> 15:57.990
>> IT'S AN ONGOING DEBATE

15:57.990 --> 15:58.925
ACTUALLY, EVEN WITH THE ROMA

15:58.925 --> 16:00.259
THEMSELVES.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.627
THEY ALSO USE THIS TERMINOLOGY,

SOMEONE IS ROMA OR NOT, CITY

16:20.813 --> 16:21.747
LEADERSHIP IS NOT APPROACHING

16:21.747 --> 16:22.682
THIS AS AN ETHNIC OR RACIAL

16:22.682 --> 16:23.349
ISSUE.

16:23.349 --> 16:24.283
IT IS IN FACT SAD THAT THE ISSUE

16:24.283 --> 16:25.384
HAS BEEN RAISED AS ONE AT ALL.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.019
WE APPROACH IT AS AN ENDEAVOR TO

16:27.019 --> 16:29.255
ERADICATE AN IMPOVERISHED SLUM.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.890

PAY EVICTED TENANTS UP TO $8,500

16:36.395 --> 16:37.964
TO FIND A NEW HOME.

ONLY LEAD TO CONFLICT.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.059
>> (translated): I THINK THE

17:07.059 --> 17:08.160
SOLUTION IS NOT TO EVICT PEOPLE

17:08.160 --> 17:09.161

17:09.161 --> 17:10.296
ANOTHER SETTLEMENT, OR TO THROW

17:10.296 --> 17:11.530
FAMILIES OUT INTO THE STREET.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.498
IF WE DO THAT THE PROBLEM GETS

17:12.498 --> 17:13.833
BIGGER AND CREATES MORE TENSION.

17:31.517 --> 17:33.185
HERE, AT THE WASTE PLANT.

18:39.518 --> 18:41.253
BIG TAPESTRY IF YOU WILL OF

18:41.253 --> 18:42.755
LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR ONE

DAY PUTTING HUMAN BOOTSMA ON

18:44.156 --> 18:45.024
MARS.

18:45.024 --> 18:46.325
WE HOPE.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.694
YOU JUST DON'T FLY OFF IN A

18:48.694 --> 18:49.462
ROCKET AND LAND THERE.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.963
YOU NEED TO LEARN ABOUT THE

SOIL, THE GROUND, GND IN THIS

18:54.166 --> 18:55.634
CASE THE ATMOSPHERE.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.336
ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS, THE

18:57.336 --> 18:58.337
OVERRIDING QUESTIONS WHICH

18:58.337 --> 18:59.605
TROUBLES SCIENTISTS AND WHICH

18:59.605 --> 19:01.007
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH FUTURE

19:01.007 --> 19:02.174
EXPLORATION OF MARS IS WHAT

19:02.174 --> 19:03.943
HAPPENED TO THE PLANET OVER THE

19:03.943 --> 19:05.044
PAST 3 BILLION YEARS?

19:05.044 --> 19:06.178
IT USED TO BE WARM AND WET, AND

19:06.178 --> 19:07.947
NOW IT IS OFTEN DRY AND AWFULLY

19:07.947 --> 19:10.383
COLD... WHAT HAPPENED ALONG THE

19:10.383 --> 19:11.083
WAY?

19:11.083 --> 19:12.251
AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS GOING

19:12.251 --> 19:13.753
ON IN THE FRINGES OF THE

19:13.819 --> 19:17.790
ATMOSPHERE, WHICH IS WHAT MAVEN

19:17.790 --> 19:20.593
WILL DO, WILL HELP THE

19:20.593 --> 19:23.129
SCIENTISTS LEARN, DID THE SOLAR

19:23.129 --> 19:24.463
WINDS BLOW THE ATMOSPHERE AWAY,

19:24.463 --> 19:26.866
IS THIS WHAT HAPPENED AS IT WENT

19:26.866 --> 19:28.300
THERE 2 ULTIMATE CLIMATE CHANGE?

19:28.300 --> 19:30.436
>> SO THERE ARE GOING TO BE

19:30.436 --> 19:31.971
MULTIPLE ORBITERS AROUND THIS

19:31.971 --> 19:34.306
PLANET IF THE UNITED STATES

SUCCESSFULLY

19:35.741 --> 19:36.942
SATELLITE INTO THE RIGHT ORBIT

19:36.942 --> 19:40.246
AND THEN ON TUESDAY INDIA HAS

19:40.246 --> 19:41.881
ONE, THAT HOPEFULLY THEY WILL

19:41.881 --> 19:43.082
SUCCEED AS WELL?

19:43.082 --> 19:44.450

19:44.450 --> 19:46.719
IF EVERYBODY SUCCEEDS, IF THE

19:46.719 --> 19:49.188
U.S. AND MASON AND THE INDIA

19:49.188 --> 19:50.890
SUCCEEDS WITH THEIR FIRST ENTER

19:50.890 --> 19:52.925
PLANETARY MISSION, WHICH IS AN

19:52.925 --> 19:54.627
EXCITING THINK THING IN ITS OWN

19:54.627 --> 19:56.062
RIGHT .. THAT WILL PUT FIVE

19:56.062 --> 19:57.997
CRAFT IN ORBIT AROUND MARS DOING

19:57.997 --> 20:00.166
ALL KINDS OF WORK,

20:00.166 --> 20:01.000
SCIENTIFICALLY.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.035
LOOKING AT THE PLANET ITSELF,

20:03.035 --> 20:06.072
OBTAINING IMAGERY, MASS

20:06.072 --> 20:07.239
SPECTROMETRY, LOOKING AT THE

20:07.239 --> 20:10.643
SOLAR WIND, IONATION, A WHOLE

20:10.643 --> 20:12.278
HOST OF THINGS ABOUT THE

20:12.278 --> 20:14.880
MAGNETIC FIELD AND ALSO ..

20:14.880 --> 20:15.915
ASSISTING WHAT IS ON THE GROUND.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.117
WE HAVE TWO ROVERS ON THE

20:18.117 --> 20:19.919
GROUND, OPPORTUNITY AND

20:19.919 --> 20:21.320
CURIOSITY, BOTH NASA CRAFT.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.855
THAT ARE DOING THEIR SCIENTIFIC

20:22.855 --> 20:23.789
WORK.

20:23.789 --> 20:26.625
ON THE ONE HAND, THESE, SOME OF

20:26.625 --> 20:28.828
THESE SATELLITES SERVE AS

20:28.828 --> 20:30.496
RELAYS, COMMUNICATION RELAYS FOR

20:30.563 --> 20:31.931
THE ROVERS ON THE GROUND AND

20:31.931 --> 20:32.832
ALSO THE SCIENCE THEY CONDUCT ON

20:32.832 --> 20:34.066
THE GROUND IS COMPARED TO THE

20:34.066 --> 20:35.601
SCIENCE THAT IS DONE IN ORBIT,

20:35.601 --> 20:38.337
AND THAT HELPS SCIENTISTS MAKE

20:38.337 --> 20:39.405
COMPARISONS WHICH ARE USEFUL.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.640
>> INCIDENTALLY, ON

20:41.640 --> 20:43.175
OCTOBER 19TH, THERE IS A COMET

20:43.175 --> 20:45.878
THAT IS GOING TO NEARLY STRIKE

20:45.878 --> 20:46.812
MARS, AND THERE IS SOME CONCERN

20:46.812 --> 20:48.247
THAT THESE CRAFT MIGHT, YOU

20:48.247 --> 20:50.149
KNOW, BE IN HARM'S WAY,

20:50.149 --> 20:51.484
FORTUNATELY THAT WON'T BE THE

20:51.484 --> 20:53.452
CASE, BUT THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE

20:53.452 --> 20:54.954
THEY MIGHT GET SOME IMAGERY AND

20:54.954 --> 20:56.155
CERTAINLY SOME INTERESTING

20:56.155 --> 20:57.022
SCIENCE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

20:57.022 --> 20:58.524
A COMET ENTERS AN ATMOSPHERE.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.892
>> SO ALL THIS INFORMATION FROM

20:59.892 --> 21:01.594
ALL OF THESE MISSIONS MEANS

21:01.594 --> 21:03.262
WHAT? HUMANS WILL SET FOOT ON

21:03.329 --> 21:05.297
MARS IN A COUPLE OF DECADES?

21:05.297 --> 21:07.967
>> THAT IS THE LONG RANGE PLAN.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.401
THE DEVIL OF COURSE IS IN THE

21:09.401 --> 21:11.437
DETAILS, AND OF COURSE THE

21:11.437 --> 21:12.771
BUDGET, BUT NO ONE THINGS IT IS

21:12.771 --> 21:14.240
A WISE IDEA TO GO TO MARS

21:14.240 --> 21:15.774
WITHOUT LAYING THE GROUNDWORK

21:15.774 --> 21:17.109
SCIENTIFICALLY AND ROBOTICALLY,

21:17.109 --> 21:18.878
AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN

21:18.878 --> 21:21.013
SEEING IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY FOR A

21:21.013 --> 21:22.181
NUMBER OF YEARS NOW, YOU KNOW,

21:22.181 --> 21:23.983
GOING BACK TO THE PATHFINDER

21:23.983 --> 21:24.650
MISSION ON MARS.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.385
IT IS KIND OF A TWO TRACK THING.

21:26.385 --> 21:29.321
ON THE ONE HAND, SCIENTISTS ARE

21:29.321 --> 21:31.557
GETTING GOALS THAT COME STRICT

21:31.557 --> 21:32.791
STRICTLY OUT OF ROBOTIC

21:32.791 --> 21:33.726
ANYTHING THAT HELP THEM

21:33.726 --> 21:34.660
UNDERSTAND, ARE WE ALONE IN THE

21:34.660 --> 21:35.494
UNIVERSE?

21:35.494 --> 21:36.896
WAS THERE A SECOND GENESIS OF

21:36.896 --> 21:38.697
LIFE ON MARS IS A FUNDAMENTALLY

21:38.697 --> 21:40.332
GOOD QUESTION SEPARATE FROM

21:40.332 --> 21:41.667
WHETHER WE PUT HUMAN BEINGS ON

21:41.667 --> 21:43.269
THE PLANET.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.070
BUT ULTIMATELY, THE SAME

21:45.070 --> 21:46.839
SCIENTISTS WILL TELL YOU THAT A

21:46.839 --> 21:48.541
GEOLOGIST ON THE GROUND WITH A

21:48.541 --> 21:50.676
HAMMER AND THE ABILITY TO CHIP A

21:50.676 --> 21:52.411
ROCKAWAY HERE AND THERE CAN DO

21:52.411 --> 21:54.880
IN A MATTER OF HOURS WHAT ROBOT

21:54.880 --> 21:56.749
WOULD TAKE WEEKS TO DO.

21:56.749 --> 21:58.551
SO THE IDEA THAT SCIENTISTS MAY

21:58.551 --> 22:00.319
ONE DAY BE THERE ON THE GROUND

22:00.319 --> 22:02.588
MAY BE THE ONLY WAY THAT WILL

22:02.588 --> 22:04.390
ANSWER ALL OF THESE BIG

22:04.390 --> 22:05.324
SCIENTIFIC QUESTIONS AND PLUS IT

22:05.324 --> 22:08.127
IS A BIG PART OF THE OVERALL

22:08.127 --> 22:09.662
PICTURE OF EXPLORING THE COSMOS

22:09.662 --> 22:11.497
AND WONDERING IF, IN FACT, HUMAN

22:11.497 --> 22:12.731
BEINGS ARE EVER GOING TO LEAVE

22:12.731 --> 22:14.233
THIS PLANET IN A MEANINGFUL WAY.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.123
HERE IS AN EXCERPT SHOWING HOW

22:38.123 --> 22:39.325
KOCH DEALT WITH THE TRANSIT

22:39.325 --> 22:42.661
STRIKE IN 1980.

22:42.661 --> 22:44.196

22:44.196 --> 22:48.734
OVERLOOKS THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE.

22:48.734 --> 22:51.604
I SEE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

22:51.604 --> 22:53.706
WALKING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

22:59.345 --> 23:00.813
AND I SAY TO BOB, I AM GOING TO

23:00.813 --> 23:01.814
TO GO DOWNSTAIRS.

23:01.814 --> 23:04.450
I DIDN'T SAY WHY.

23:04.450 --> 23:05.517
HI EVERYBODY.

23:10.956 --> 23:13.626
