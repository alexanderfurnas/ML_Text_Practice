00:25.625 --> 00:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES, United Nations
Secretary-General:
The truth is that the Security
Council has

00:27.460 --> 00:32.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been, now for a large period,
essentially
divided, not only on Syria, on
several other

00:32.932 --> 00:33.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situations.

00:33.933 --> 00:35.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

that's often

00:49.182 --> 00:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used, which is the missing white
women syndrome,
where if you're not with blonde
hair and blue

00:54.854 --> 00:57.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eyes, your story is just not
sensational enough.

00:57.624 --> 00:59.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

suspect in the deadly attack on
the Champs
Elysees.

01:43.236 --> 01:47.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prosecutors identified him as
Karim Cheurfi,

carried a note

01:47.140 --> 01:49.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

01:49.075 --> 01:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

01:56.116 --> 02:00.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

he didn't show any signs of
radicalization

02:00.954 --> 02:02.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or signs of conversion.

02:08.194 --> 02:09.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

02:09.729 --> 02:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The famed boulevard was shut

crazy.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a wave of panic that
came over everything.

02:22.675 --> 02:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All of this
just two days
before polls open in the
presidential election.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

-- "will have a big effect on
the presidential
election."

02:43.863 --> 02:48.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, he told the Associated

No particular rush, but we will

But health care is coming along
well.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Government is coming along
really well.

04:11.184 --> 04:13.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

much he has

04:23.730 --> 04:25.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actually done so far.

04:25.398 --> 04:29.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wrote -- quote -- "No matter
how much I
accomplish during the ridiculous
standard

04:29.502 --> 04:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the first 100 days, it has
been a lot.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Media will kill."

the news media;

07:57.777 --> 08:10.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

08:14.760 --> 08:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act will
continue this weekend,
ahead of Congress' return to
Washington.

08:20.600 --> 08:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me to talk about the
latest developments
is White House correspondent
John Yang.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, John, Congress coming back
next week.

08:28.074 --> 08:33.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before they left, there was talk
of trying
to resurrect some sort of deal
on health care

08:33.412 --> 08:34.380 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reform.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where does it stand?

08:36.215 --> 08:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, Judy, talking
to senior White
House officials today, there is
a glimmer,

08:38.784 --> 08:43.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a glimmer of optimism that their
efforts to
bring together the conservative
and moderate

08:43.923 --> 08:52.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
factions of the House
Republicans has led
to language that just may
satisfy both sides.

08:52.999 --> 08:58.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They hope to present that
language to lawmakers
on a conference call, a House
Republican conference

08:59.005 --> 09:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call tomorrow to get a better
sense of where
things stand.

09:03.009 --> 09:07.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, there
seems to be
a little bit of a -- if not a
misunderstanding,

09:08.014 --> 09:11.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least a back and forth on the
timetable
here.

09:11.851 --> 09:13.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the one hand, they seem to be
in a hurry
to get it done.

09:13.986 --> 09:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, we just heard
the president
saying, well, it doesn't really
matter whether

09:17.356 --> 09:18.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's next week.

09:18.357 --> 09:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, that's right.

09:19.358 --> 09:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You heard the president said
that.

09:21.160 --> 09:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Sean Spicer, the White House
press secretary
said, if we get it done next
week, great.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
If we don't, no problem.

09:27.266 --> 09:29.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will get it done when we have
the votes.

09:29.502 --> 09:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are others, other
officials in this
White House who would love it if
they could

09:33.773 --> 09:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get a vote before that symbolic
100 days of
the administration are up.

09:39.946 --> 09:46.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, one
other thing
that is on the agenda next week
is funding

09:46.185 --> 09:47.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the government.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The temporary arrangement they
had runs out
at the end of the week.

09:51.223 --> 09:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do they stand on that?

09:53.059 --> 09:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, this afternoon,
OMB Director
Mitt Mulvaney had a conference
call directing

09:56.395 --> 10:02.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
department heads to prepare for
a possible
government showdown, but he and
other White

10:02.234 --> 10:07.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House officials say they are
confident it
will not happen, that the
government funding

10:07.239 --> 10:09.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will continue one way or
another.

10:09.942 --> 10:15.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they also -- a senior
administration official
also says that these talks could
tell us a

10:15.181 --> 10:21.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot about the next four years
and the willingness
of both sides to compromise --
Judy.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, we will be watching.

10:23.489 --> 10:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang at the White House,
thank you.

10:36.268 --> 10:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France is on edge ahead of
Sunday's presidential
election, after last night's
attack in Paris.

10:41.974 --> 10:47.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vote, which features an
array of candidates,
is the first of two rounds.

10:47.113 --> 10:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Independent centrist candidate
Emmanuel Macron
appears in the polls to hold a
slight edge

10:52.284 --> 10:54.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over Marine Le Pen.

10:54.387 --> 11:00.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is the leader of the far
right-wing anti-immigrant
National Front, and is hoping
for a Trump-style

11:00.292 --> 11:03.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
win to upend the traditional
establishment.

11:03.763 --> 11:09.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The top two vote-getters will
compete in the
second and final round on May 7.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Paris, special
correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Heavily armed
police were
patrolling the Champs Elysees
this morning

11:16.308 --> 11:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a high-profile show of force.

11:19.245 --> 11:24.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others carried flowers to honor
a fallen colleague,
providing a stark contrast on
the opposite

11:24.183 --> 11:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
side of the grandest of Parisian
boulevards.

11:27.720 --> 11:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the place where the officer
was killed,
union official Denis Jacob had
this message.

11:31.924 --> 11:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENIS JACOB, France (through
translator):
Society mustn't fall into a mass
psychosis.

11:35.828 --> 11:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People shouldn't be paranoid
that someone
can come behind their back and
kill them.

11:39.165 --> 11:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This shooting
is the latest
in a series of terrorist attacks
in France

11:43.536 --> 11:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the past couple of years.

11:45.438 --> 11:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It began with the massacre at
the Charlie
Hebdo satirical magazine, and
then, on November

11:50.109 --> 11:56.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 13th, with the shootings at
the Bataclan
music club and across Paris, and
then in July

11:56.048 --> 11:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last year in Nice, when there
was the truck
massacre.

11:58.584 --> 12:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The death toll over the past
couple of years
is around the 230 mark.

12:01.887 --> 12:07.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There may only have been a
handful of casualties
last night, but the timing of
this shooting

12:07.159 --> 12:09.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could not have been more
significant.

12:09.428 --> 12:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Political analyst Jean-Yves
Camus doesn't
believe the attack will
drastically impact

12:13.532 --> 12:16.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the outcome of Sunday's vote,
but has this
proviso:

12:16.802 --> 12:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN-YVES CAMUS, Political
Analyst: If there's
going to be a benefit,
certainly, Marine Le

12:20.673 --> 12:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pen will benefit from the fact
that this was
a jihadi attack, that,
apparently, what we

12:26.846 --> 12:30.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know this morning, the guy came
from Belgium
or was a Belgian citizen.

12:30.916 --> 12:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, she will say, I want to
bring back borders.

12:34.620 --> 12:43.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Immigration
control is Marine
Le Pen's signature message.

12:43.963 --> 12:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has sanitized the party in
recent years
to broaden its mainstream
appeal.

12:49.201 --> 12:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She replaced her nationalist
father as leader,
expelled him from the party for
his racist

12:53.973 --> 12:58.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and anti-Semitic statements, and
she watered
down the Front's extreme
right-wing tendencies.

12:58.644 --> 13:03.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARINE LE PEN, French
Presidential Candidate
(through translator): I'm
telling you that

13:03.549 --> 13:08.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's at stake on Sunday, and I
have repeated
it tirelessly over the campaign
because I

13:08.120 --> 13:09.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
believe it.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is civilization.

13:10.790 --> 13:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Sunday, the choice is simple:
either a
France reborn, or a France that
founders.

13:18.063 --> 13:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm telling you that I intend to
protect you.

13:21.901 --> 13:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But as this
brief protest
demonstrates, Marine Le Pen's
detractors regard

13:28.274 --> 13:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her as the most divisive of
political leaders.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They abhor her attempts to wrap
herself in
the flag.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARINE LE PEN (through
translator): I love
France.

13:35.614 --> 13:38.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love it from the bottom of my
heart, from
the bottom of my soul.

13:39.018 --> 13:45.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am a woman, and, as such, I
feel with extreme
violence all the restrictions of
our freedom

13:45.424 --> 13:50.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we're seeing within our
country because
of the developing Islamic
fundamentalism.

13:50.462 --> 13:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Mikael Sala is
on Le Pen's
campaign team.

13:54.733 --> 13:58.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKAEL SALA, Le Pen Adviser:
Donald Trump
was saying, we're going to make
America great

13:58.537 --> 14:00.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again, and we're going to make
America grow
again.

14:00.806 --> 14:03.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, this is exactly what
Marine Le Pen will
do for France.

14:03.309 --> 14:04.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She will make it great again.

14:04.577 --> 14:08.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the French, they really
aspire to that.

14:08.280 --> 14:14.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want France to be great
again, and they
feel in their gut that Marine Le
Pen is that

14:14.520 --> 14:16.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
person.

14:16.655 --> 14:24.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The potential
impact of Le
Pen's policies would be felt
most keenly in

14:24.597 --> 14:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Barbes, a Parisian district
dominated by immigrants.

14:28.634 --> 14:33.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France has nine million people
living beneath
the poverty line, and this
market represents

14:33.205 --> 14:35.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a snapshot.

14:35.074 --> 14:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Habiba Belhout, a Muslim,
supports the Socialist
candidate who's trailing in
fifth place.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is concerned by Le Pen's
rhetoric.

14:42.681 --> 14:46.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HABIBA BELHOUT, France (through
translator):
Well, she's a racist, first of
all.

14:46.252 --> 14:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really gives the impression
that we're
going decades back, back to 1939
to 1945.

14:51.657 --> 14:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She talks about the Muslims,
about immigration,
when there's so much more.

14:55.861 --> 14:57.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more problems than that to deal
with.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yesterday, I heard her say
she was the
only woman candidate who defends
women.

15:01.267 --> 15:05.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I'm sorry, but she doesn't
represent
me at all.

15:05.537 --> 15:11.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: According to
opinion polls,
the current front-runner is
Emmanuel Macron,

15:11.076 --> 15:16.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who abandoned the Socialists and
set up his
own independent party called On
the Move,

15:16.415 --> 15:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to attract those who yearn for a
moderate
middle-ground candidate.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: The main contestants in
this election
are either the far right or the
far left.

15:23.956 --> 15:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's not what we
want in France.

15:26.792 --> 15:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't want a racist, nor a
communist president
for France.

15:32.398 --> 15:36.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there are solutions
other than
extreme solutions for the
country.

15:36.368 --> 15:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm pro-European and I'm for
progressive solutions
for my country.

15:41.807 --> 15:47.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Macron is a
39-year-old former
investment banker, and reputedly
a millionaire.

15:47.846 --> 15:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a former economy minister in
the Socialist
government, he's promising to
simultaneously

15:52.618 --> 15:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reduce unemployment, while
removing 120,000
civil servants.

15:57.389 --> 16:03.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMMANUEL MACRON, French
Presidential Candidate
(through translator): In France,
in this wounded

16:03.829 --> 16:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, in this weary country,
we don't want
tomorrow to be like yesterday.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm making a commitment
before you here
this afternoon.

16:11.704 --> 16:16.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You, who are the living part of
France, the
beating heart of France, we will
give France

16:16.675 --> 16:20.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back its optimism, its faith in
the future.

16:20.379 --> 16:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, Former President
of the United
States: Hello.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EMMANUEL MACRON: Hello, Mr.
President.

16:25.150 --> 16:26.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How are you?

16:26.885 --> 16:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: And Macron got
an unusual
boost yesterday before the
attack: a call

16:28.754 --> 16:32.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from former President Barack
Obama, which
Macron quickly tweeted out.

16:32.524 --> 16:38.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The main message I
have is to
wish you all the best in the
coming days.

MALCOLM BRABANT: Former
conservative Prime
Minister Francois Fillon could
be forgiven

16:42.601 --> 16:45.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for looking enviously at
Macron's poll numbers.

16:45.270 --> 16:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fillon was once regarded as the
favorite to
become president, but his
popularity slumped

16:50.676 --> 16:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after he was placed under
investigation for
misuse of public funds.

16:54.980 --> 16:59.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But analysts believe the
shooting might help
him make a comeback.

16:59.885 --> 17:03.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In France, there are normally
two presidential
election rounds.

17:03.055 --> 17:07.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two leading candidates from
the first
round contest the second.

17:07.359 --> 17:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For teacher Veronique Dadou, her
main concern
is the future of her students,
which is why

17:12.197 --> 17:16.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she has turned to the hard-left
candidate,
Jean-Luc Melenchon, who has had
an unexpected

17:16.935 --> 17:18.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
surge in popularity.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VERONIQUE DADOU, France (through
translator):
The one thing that blocks
everything else

17:21.006 --> 17:25.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is unemployment, and that has a
direct impact
on the young people, because
they're the ones

17:25.911 --> 17:29.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are prevented from accessing
a decent,
proper social life.

17:29.415 --> 17:32.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their personal development,
everything's on
hold for them because of that.

17:33.018 --> 17:37.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But this
Melenchon rally
earlier in the week was
overshadowed by news

17:37.389 --> 17:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the security services had
arrested two
Islamists in Marseille who were
allegedly

17:42.461 --> 17:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
planning an attack on one of the
campaigns.

17:44.363 --> 17:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN-LUC MELENCHON, French
Presidential Candidate
(through translator): We are not
afraid, and,

17:49.368 --> 17:51.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even tonight, we are
demonstrating this.

17:51.737 --> 17:56.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's have even more debate,
respectful debate,
but debate nonetheless, to show
that nothing

17:56.608 --> 18:00.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will conquer our democracy, and
that criminals
can do nothing against it.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The French people are free.

18:02.114 --> 18:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The Le Pen camp
plays up
similarities with the Trump
campaign, but

18:06.251 --> 18:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
according to analyst Jean-Yves
Camus, Americans
should be wary.

18:09.254 --> 18:15.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEAN-YVES CAMUS: The impact for
the United
States will be bad, because
Marine Le Pen

18:15.594 --> 18:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
belongs to those kind of radical
right parties
which are highly prejudiced
against the United

18:22.968 --> 18:24.736 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

18:24.770 --> 18:30.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is because she doesn't want
the United
States to have a prominent say
in international

18:30.242 --> 18:31.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
affairs.

18:31.243 --> 18:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She wants to opt out of NATO.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She wants to end free trade.

18:35.414 --> 18:40.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Sunday's first
round is considered
to be the most unpredictable
election in decades.

18:40.919 --> 18:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A third of all voters are said
to be undecided.

18:43.222 --> 18:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Paris.

18:49.928 --> 19:01.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to my
interview with United
Nations Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres.

19:01.840 --> 19:07.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took office on January 1,
after a decade
as head of the U.N.'s Refugee
Agency.

19:07.513 --> 19:12.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I sat down with him this
afternoon for his
first American television
interview since

19:12.618 --> 19:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
becoming secretary-general.

19:14.653 --> 19:18.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spoke at the World Bank here
in Washington,
where he is attending the annual
meeting of

19:18.757 --> 19:22.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bank and International
Monetary Fund.

19:22.594 --> 19:24.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Secretary-General, thank you
for talking
with us.

19:24.596 --> 19:25.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES, United Nations
Secretary-General:
Pleasure.

19:25.864 --> 19:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You were at the
White House
earlier today.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You met briefly with President
Trump.

19:30.269 --> 19:36.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You also spent some time with
the national
security adviser, H.R. McMaster.

19:36.141 --> 19:37.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you discuss?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: Well, we
discussed, of course,
the problems of the world, and
especially

19:40.779 --> 19:44.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how the U.N. and the U.S. can
cooperate better.

19:44.950 --> 19:52.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is, for me, clear that the
world needs
a United States that is engaged
in security

19:52.491 --> 19:55.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues, in development issues,
in human rights
issues.

19:55.527 --> 20:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The contribution of the United
States for
global affairs is absolutely
crucial.

20:01.767 --> 20:05.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the cooperation with the
U.N. is very
important from our perspective.

20:05.304 --> 20:11.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I presume the U.N. can also
be very useful
to the United States, especially
if we will

20:11.310 --> 20:16.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able, as I strongly intend,
to have a more
dynamic, more reformed, more
nimble U.N.

20:16.748 --> 20:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I ask because we
have been
hearing -- we know that this --
because this

20:20.385 --> 20:26.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president has said so, he has
concerns that
the U.N. and other international
organizations

20:26.658 --> 20:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have already gotten a lot of
support from
the U.S., and now may be a good
time for the

20:30.629 --> 20:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. to pull back, and to pull
back in foreign
aid, in humanitarian aid.

20:35.334 --> 20:37.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How concerned are you that they
may do that?

20:37.603 --> 20:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: Well, he also
said that
the U.N. has a lot of potential.

20:40.072 --> 20:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's my role to try to
prove that
that potential can be translated
into reality.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you do
that?

20:46.044 --> 20:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: Well, we need
to be able
to demonstrate that what we do
in today's

20:52.618 --> 20:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world, in humanitarian aid, the
enormous effort
to minimize the tragic
situations that we

20:59.858 --> 21:05.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see all over the world, I think,
without the
U.N., people would suffer much
more, and the

21:05.564 --> 21:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
situation would be much more
terrible.

21:07.366 --> 21:11.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this is a
president who
has spoken about pulling back,
pulling the

21:11.670 --> 21:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. back from the rest of the
world, except
maybe, now we see, in a military
sense.

21:17.476 --> 21:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you worried about that?

21:19.278 --> 21:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: I think the
U.S. is too
important for the U.S. to be
possible to pull

21:23.782 --> 21:25.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

21:25.584 --> 21:32.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that it's very important
to have the
United States' engagement in
many situations

21:32.224 --> 21:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have around the world, be it
in Syria,
be it in the African context.

21:37.796 --> 21:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United States represents an
important
set of values, human rights,
values related

21:45.337 --> 21:47.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to freedom, to democracy.

21:47.306 --> 21:50.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the foreign policy
engagement of the
United States is a very
important guarantee

21:50.809 --> 21:54.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that those values can be
properly pursued.

21:54.379 --> 21:59.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in that regard, the
cooperation between
the U.S. and U.N. is absolutely
essential

21:59.284 --> 22:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for those values to be preserved
in our world.

22:01.153 --> 22:05.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But are you not
at all concerned
about cuts in U.S. contributions
to the United

22:05.757 --> 22:07.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nations and to the other U.N.
agencies?

22:07.592 --> 22:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: Well, I hope
those cuts
will not materialize.

22:11.430 --> 22:16.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope that we -- we need to
do better
and to do more.

22:16.635 --> 22:19.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we need to be able also to
be more cost-effective.

22:19.805 --> 22:28.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are ready to discuss with
the United
States how to make our work more
able to correspond

22:28.880 --> 22:33.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
also to what it is the
aspiration of the American
people.

22:33.285 --> 22:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is my deep belief that
when a country
is so concerned -- there are so
strong reasons

22:41.727 --> 22:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be concerned with global
terrorism, with
the security of the American
people -- that

22:47.332 --> 22:53.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it is very important to
recognize that that
is not possible to guarantee if,
at the same

22:53.705 --> 22:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time, the country is not very
active in addressing
the root causes of terror.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you
mentioned terrorism.

22:58.877 --> 22:59.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You mentioned security.

22:59.945 --> 23:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is focus today on Paris.

23:01.847 --> 23:04.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're calling it a terrorist
attack.

23:04.349 --> 23:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's every reason to believe
this is going
to raise concerns in leading up
to the French

23:09.154 --> 23:16.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elections this weekend, pushing
the -- what
is already an anti-foreigner
sentiment to

23:16.328 --> 23:18.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be even stronger.

23:18.163 --> 23:23.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As someone who heads the
preeminent international
organization, the U.N., how
concerned are

23:23.468 --> 23:25.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you about that?

23:25.270 --> 23:27.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: I was -- for
10 years, I
was the United Nations high
commissioner for

23:27.839 --> 23:29.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
refugees.

23:29.741 --> 23:33.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I always fought for the
possibility for
those that flee conflict in
desperate situations

23:33.779 --> 23:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have access to international
protection.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is absolutely crucial.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's an essential democratic
value.

23:40.285 --> 23:45.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I think it's important to
recognize in
today's world is that all of our
societies

23:45.357 --> 23:49.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are multiethnic, multi-religious
and multicultural.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that is a positive thing.

23:51.396 --> 23:54.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a richness, and also
strength.

23:54.132 --> 23:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also have to recognize
that, for those
societies to be harmonious,
there is a lot

23:59.604 --> 24:03.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the investment that needs to
be made in
social cohesion and inclusivity.

24:03.575 --> 24:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the important thing to
recognize, and
particularly Europe, most of the
terrorist

24:07.779 --> 24:11.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks are not done by people
that came from
the outside.

24:11.249 --> 24:13.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are homegrown.

24:13.118 --> 24:17.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, in North America,
both in Canada
and the United States, it has
been much easier

24:17.122 --> 24:21.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for communities to live together
than in several
European countries.

24:21.393 --> 24:24.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So much to ask
you about, Mr.
Secretary-General.

24:24.563 --> 24:30.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One thing I don't want to leave
out, of course,
is Syria.

24:30.402 --> 24:31.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People look at the U.N.

24:31.703 --> 24:35.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. has been involved in
trying to find
peace in Syria.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It hasn't happened.

24:37.175 --> 24:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are critics saying the
Security Council
is paralyzed, hasn't been able
to move on

24:41.847 --> 24:43.648 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

24:43.682 --> 24:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a very critical story
coming out of
The New York Times over the
weekend looking

24:46.384 --> 24:52.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the failure of the U.N., the
U.N. system,
to be able to deal with
something like Syria.

24:52.691 --> 24:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you look at Syria?

24:54.426 --> 24:56.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How do you see the
responsibility of the U.N.
there?

24:56.928 --> 24:59.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: With peace
about security,
there is a central body.

24:59.764 --> 25:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that body is the Security
Council.

25:01.766 --> 25:08.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the Security Council that
has the responsibility
to preserve peace and to address
the situations

25:08.340 --> 25:10.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of conflict.

25:10.141 --> 25:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The truth is that the Security
Council has
been, now for a large period,
essentially

25:14.145 --> 25:17.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
divided, not only on Syria, on
several other
situations.

25:17.649 --> 25:22.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that division has led to
paralysis of
the capacity of the
international community

25:22.254 --> 25:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to come together and to push for
an effective
political solution in Syria.

25:26.157 --> 25:27.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what can be
done about
it?

25:27.893 --> 25:30.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: Now, it's high
time for
all those that have an influence
on the parties

25:30.328 --> 25:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the conflict to understand
that it is
in the interest of everybody to
put an end

25:35.000 --> 25:36.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this conflict.

25:36.735 --> 25:44.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this kind of persuasion,
this kind of
intense pressure, I believe it's
my duty to

25:44.676 --> 25:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do, even if I recognize that the
contradictions
and the different perceptions of
interest

25:50.515 --> 25:53.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that exist are making it very
difficult.

25:53.051 --> 25:55.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this is
clearly a priority
for you?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: It is a
priority for me.

25:57.222 --> 26:03.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To see these people that has
been so hospitable
to others now suffering so much,
and being

26:03.828 --> 26:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rejected also in so many parts
of the world,
it really breaks my heart.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two other things
I want to
ask you about.

26:10.335 --> 26:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is the reports recently
building on previous
reports about U.N. peacekeepers
in different

26:17.375 --> 26:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parts of the world being guilty
of the worst
kind of sexual abuse, sexual
assault on vulnerable

26:25.951 --> 26:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, women, children, boys,
girls.

26:29.688 --> 26:34.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now that this is coming into the
open, what
is the responsibility of the
U.N. to make

26:34.893 --> 26:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure this doesn't happen again,
and are people
being held accountable for it?

26:39.998 --> 26:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: Well, it is a
huge responsibility.

26:41.700 --> 26:44.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I have taken it very
seriously.

26:44.069 --> 26:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the first reforms I
presented already
to the General Assembly was
exactly on redesigning

26:50.075 --> 26:54.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all our capacity to respond to
sexual exploitation
and abuse, and trying to create
the conditions

26:54.980 --> 26:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to mobilize member states to
assume their
responsibilities.

26:58.717 --> 27:04.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We -- U.N., we cannot condemn a
soldier to
jail because of that.

27:04.589 --> 27:09.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It must be the country to which
the soldier
belongs.

27:09.361 --> 27:12.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we need to be able to create
the conditions
for that to be possible.

27:12.697 --> 27:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need to do the job
ourselves of a much
better protection of the
victims.

27:17.035 --> 27:23.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We must be absolutely
determined, with a
zero-tolerance
policy in this regard.

27:23.375 --> 27:28.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also need to pay tribute
to those that
are sacrificing their lives to
protect other

27:28.880 --> 27:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lives, and that -- sometimes
also do not see
that properly recognized.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last question.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were not very long ago on
the African
continent.

27:37.489 --> 27:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know there are four different
countries
experiencing famine to one
degree or another,

27:43.328 --> 27:46.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not because of a lack of food,
but because
of conflict.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you have spoken about this.

27:48.366 --> 27:50.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's received some attention.

27:50.502 --> 27:55.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you get others to
understand the problem?

27:55.306 --> 27:59.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because every country has a
different reason
for the conflict in each one.

27:59.878 --> 28:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you get the rest of the
world to pay
attention, to make a difference,
when people

28:04.149 --> 28:08.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are -- who don't deserve to die
are dying
by the thousands and more?

28:08.286 --> 28:12.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: We are doing
our best to
raise awareness and to mobilize
the international

28:12.590 --> 28:15.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community in support to the
victims of these
situations.

28:15.660 --> 28:20.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had recently in Oslo a
conference on the
Lake Chad Basin.

28:20.598 --> 28:29.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm doing on Tuesday to Geneva
for a conference,
pledging conference, to support
the victims

28:29.908 --> 28:31.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Yemen.

28:31.109 --> 28:33.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have another conference
in London
on Somalia.

28:33.478 --> 28:38.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we are really trying to
mobilize the international
community in order to have an
adequate response,

28:39.017 --> 28:43.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knowing that that response
cannot be only
humanitarian.

28:43.521 --> 28:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That response -- as you said,
when you said
that the real reason for this
famine is the

28:49.160 --> 28:51.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conflict, that response needs to
be political.

28:51.129 --> 28:54.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr.
Secretary-General, you
have a full plate.

28:54.332 --> 28:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we thank you very much for
talking with
us today.

28:56.301 --> 29:00.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES: It was a
pleasure.

29:00.505 --> 29:09.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:09.581 --> 29:14.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and Michael Gerson analyze the
week's news;

29:14.319 --> 29:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and In My Humble Opinion,
reflections on our
addiction to technology.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first: missing children and
a racial divide.

29:23.962 --> 29:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Washington, D.C.,
Police Department
tried to raise awareness about
missing children

29:28.800 --> 29:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and teenagers by posting their
images on social
media, the campaign backfired,
sparking some

29:35.006 --> 29:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national outrage and fears of an
epidemic
of missing children of color.

29:40.378 --> 29:45.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the story also exposed many
risks that
young people face when they
leave home, including

29:45.917 --> 29:48.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exploitation and sex
trafficking.

29:48.987 --> 29:50.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our report.

29:50.989 --> 29:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On a recent
night in downtown
Washington, D.C., a drop-in
center for homeless

29:55.627 --> 29:58.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and at-risk youth begins to fill
up.

29:58.463 --> 30:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's pizza, and games, and a
movie in the
back.

30:04.335 --> 30:08.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gabrielle Martin is a regular in
this refuge,
which is run by the nonprofit
Sasha Bruce

30:08.973 --> 30:10.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Youthwork.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GABRIELLE MARTIN, Homeless: I
have been on
my own, basically, since I was
15.

30:11.943 --> 30:13.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Fifteen years
old?

30:13.378 --> 30:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GABRIELLE MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

30:14.579 --> 30:18.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now I'm 27, so I have been
homeless for
12 years.

30:18.149 --> 30:22.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Young people
here have access
to food, showers and a place to
relax for

30:22.821 --> 30:24.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a few hours.

30:24.389 --> 30:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Martin says this center is
essential, because
homeless life can be exhausting.

30:28.359 --> 30:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GABRIELLE MARTIN: It can get
frustrating sometimes,
like, not knowing how you're
going to eat

30:33.464 --> 30:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or where you're going to sleep
the next day.

30:36.835 --> 30:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, we will just find
excuses to go
to the hospital, just so that we
have somewhere

30:41.973 --> 30:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to sleep that night, you know?

30:43.842 --> 30:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Martin first
ran away from
home in high school, after
coming out as gay

30:46.377 --> 30:48.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to her disapproving parents.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says she's struggled with
drug addiction
and has bounced in and out of
various living

30:52.851 --> 30:54.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
situations ever since.

30:54.719 --> 30:58.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GABRIELLE MARTIN: If I wasn't in
the streets,
I was at different friends'
houses, or I would

30:58.957 --> 31:03.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually date people that I knew
had their
own place, just so I could stay
there.

31:03.595 --> 31:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That led to a
pregnancy
with someone she was living
with.

31:07.665 --> 31:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Martin's parents reported her
missing around
the time she turned 17, and up
until last

31:12.470 --> 31:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
December, she says she was still
considered
a missing person by Washington,
D.C., police.

31:17.008 --> 31:20.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GABRIELLE MARTIN: Even though
I'm 27 now,
I was still considered a runaway
because I

31:20.712 --> 31:22.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ran away when I was a juvenile.

31:22.447 --> 31:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it was still in their --
it's still in
their system.

31:24.782 --> 31:27.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The desperate search for
missing teens
in Washington, D.C.

31:27.919 --> 31:30.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Outrage about missing
children in the
District.

31:30.288 --> 31:34.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A spate of
more recent cases
in the nation's capital were
thrust into the

31:34.125 --> 31:39.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spotlight last month after
Washington, D.C.,
police, for the first time,
started posting

31:39.497 --> 31:43.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
alerts about all missing
children on social
media.

31:43.468 --> 31:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prior to this year, they would
usually only
notify the public of missing
children when

31:46.905 --> 31:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they suspected foul play.

31:49.140 --> 31:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after celebrities like Viola
Davis and
LL Cool J retweeted the alerts,
the story

31:54.312 --> 31:59.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went viral, fueling concerns
that D.C. had
a sudden epidemic of missing
kids.

31:59.617 --> 32:01.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: We can't go nowhere by
ourselves.

32:01.886 --> 32:06.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't do nothing, because
we're all just
get worried about somebody
trying to take

32:06.858 --> 32:08.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The story
turned out to
be largely overblown.

32:10.461 --> 32:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not only was there was not a
spike in missing
kids, but 2016 saw fewer
children go missing

32:15.667 --> 32:17.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than the year before.

32:17.502 --> 32:22.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, Washington, D.C.,
acting Police Chief
Peter Newsham doesn't regret
using social

32:22.607 --> 32:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
media to highlight these cases.

32:24.409 --> 32:27.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER NEWSHAM, Acting
Washington, D.C., Police
Chief: It took on some legs that
we hadn't

32:27.512 --> 32:31.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anticipated, but I do think that
it was an
eye-opener for a lot of people
to see how

32:31.582 --> 32:35.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many young people we do have
that run away.

32:35.153 --> 32:38.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Newsham also
says that nearly
all the missing kids are
located.

32:38.589 --> 32:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER NEWSHAM: We find 99
percent of those
kids.

32:42.327 --> 32:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the awareness that has
come about
as a result of this, though, is
a lot of people

32:46.764 --> 32:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are asking the question, why are
they leaving
in the first place?

32:50.668 --> 32:55.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other question which is
really important
to get to the bottom of is, what
happened

32:55.573 --> 32:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to them while they were away?

32:57.375 --> 32:59.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRICA WILSON, President, Black
and Missing
Foundation, Inc.: Regardless of
why a child

32:59.177 --> 33:04.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going missing, we need to
find out what
are they running away from and
who they're

33:04.115 --> 33:05.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
running away to.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Derrica Wilson
is the president
of the Black and Missing
Foundation.

33:08.820 --> 33:13.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While she applauds D.C.'s
attempt to raise
awareness, she says that, for
too long, the

33:13.891 --> 33:19.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
media and public officials have
ignored cases
of children of color going
missing.

33:19.330 --> 33:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, according to the FBI,
while blacks
make up just 13 percent of the
U.S. population,

33:24.502 --> 33:28.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they make up more than 38
percent of all missing
youth.

33:28.139 --> 33:31.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: It's heart-wrenchingly
frustrating
that we don't have answers as to
where she

33:31.709 --> 33:33.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is right now.

33:33.478 --> 33:36.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For example,
8-year-old
Relisha Rudd went missing in
Washington in

33:36.347 --> 33:38.082 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2014.

33:38.116 --> 33:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the time, her mother begged
for her daughter's
return.

33:40.752 --> 33:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAMIKA YOUNG, Mother: Come back
home to your
mother safely and unarmed.

33:47.258 --> 33:48.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I love you.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Over three
years later,
she's still missing, and Wilson
says Relisha

33:52.830 --> 33:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rudd never became a household
name, not like
Chandra Levy, or Natalee
Holloway, or even

33:58.202 --> 34:03.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the more recent case of
Elizabeth Thomas,
the Tennessee 15-year-old who
was kidnapped

34:03.107 --> 34:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by her teacher, and found
yesterday.

34:04.876 --> 34:09.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: A FOX News alert now on a
nationwide
manhunt coming to an end, and
apparently a

34:09.714 --> 34:11.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
successful one.

34:11.516 --> 34:13.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fifteen-year-old Elizabeth
Thomas is safe.

34:13.651 --> 34:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DERRICA WILSON: This is not an
epidemic that
just popped up.

34:16.921 --> 34:20.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is something that's been
going on for
quite some time.

34:20.324 --> 34:25.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a term that's often
used, which is
the missing white women
syndrome, where if

34:25.463 --> 34:30.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're not with blonde hair and
blue eyes,
your story is just not
sensational enough.

34:30.034 --> 34:34.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Even the
terminology we
use about missing kids needs to
change, according

34:34.472 --> 34:39.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Robert Lowery, vice president
at the National
Center for Missing and Exploited
Children.

34:39.777 --> 34:42.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His organization no longer uses
the term runaway.

34:42.113 --> 34:43.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT LOWERY, Vice President,
National Center
for Missing and Exploited
Children: Because

34:43.915 --> 34:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the moment we put on our poster
that this
is a runaway child, we deal with
a desensitized

34:49.554 --> 34:51.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
public, a desensitized media.

34:51.456 --> 34:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Because people
just think,
oh, they ran away, it's their
fault in some

34:54.425 --> 34:55.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

34:55.960 --> 34:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT LOWERY: This child ran
away because
they're a behavioral problem.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's not the case.

34:58.396 --> 35:04.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: When she was a
kid in Chicago,
Tina Frundt left home after a
typical teenage

35:04.535 --> 35:06.237 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fight.

35:06.270 --> 35:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA FRUNDT, Founder, Courtney's
House: On
my 14th birthday, I got mad at
my parents

35:07.638 --> 35:10.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I couldn't stay out past
7:00.

35:10.475 --> 35:14.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She called a
man who had
befriended her, but he kidnapped
her, took

35:14.212 --> 35:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her to Cleveland and forced her
to work for
his grandmother, who ran a local
prostitution

35:19.517 --> 35:21.285 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ring.

35:21.319 --> 35:23.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA FRUNDT: He came from a
family of pimps,
so his grandmother is actually
the one who

35:23.588 --> 35:25.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
controlled us.

35:25.356 --> 35:30.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She used to tell me that God
wanted me to
be a ho, and that's what we were
put on earth

35:30.094 --> 35:31.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

35:31.929 --> 35:35.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A year into
her ordeal,
the police raided the home and
she was freed.

35:35.233 --> 35:39.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While her trafficker never faced
charges,
she spent a year in juvenile
detention.

35:39.937 --> 35:41.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was 15 years old.

35:41.772 --> 35:44.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA FRUNDT: And I was charged
with prostitution,
you know?

35:44.442 --> 35:45.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At 15?

35:45.443 --> 35:46.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TINA FRUNDT: Yes.

35:46.444 --> 35:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And Frundt
isn't alone.

35:48.179 --> 35:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One in six children reported to
a federal
database that tracks those who
leave home

35:51.516 --> 35:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are involved in sex trafficking.

35:54.018 --> 36:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, she runs Courtney's
House, a Washington,
D.C., nonprofit that counsels
young sex traffic

36:00.391 --> 36:02.093 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
survivors.

36:02.126 --> 36:04.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA FRUNDT: The reason why the
survivors
bond with me is because my story
really is

36:04.795 --> 36:06.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their story.

36:06.197 --> 36:07.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it happened the same way.

36:07.999 --> 36:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Gabrielle
Martin says more
needs to be done to prevent kids
from leaving

36:11.269 --> 36:13.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
home in the first place.

36:13.137 --> 36:17.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she says the answer isn't
simply to publish
more names on the list of kids
missing in

36:17.642 --> 36:19.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington, D.C.

36:19.544 --> 36:22.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GABRIELLE MARTIN: I know a few
of those people
on that list, and it's like
they're not really

36:22.680 --> 36:24.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
missing persons.

36:24.282 --> 36:27.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're people who just chose to
move on,
because what they left behind
sucked.

36:27.285 --> 36:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, I think people don't
really care about
kids that are in the system, and
that's what

36:32.056 --> 36:34.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
makes us -- that's what makes us
choose to
run away.

36:34.959 --> 36:38.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Since the
beginning of the
year, more than 700 young people
have been

36:38.563 --> 36:41.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reported missing in Washington,
D.C.

36:41.232 --> 36:43.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sixteen of those cases remain
open.

36:43.734 --> 36:48.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city announced more police
officers are
being assigned to these cases,
and it's creating

36:48.139 --> 36:53.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a task force to address the
factors driving
kids to leave home in the first
place.

36:53.277 --> 37:00.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Washington, D.C.

37:00.618 --> 37:12.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the
analysis of Shields
and Gerson.

37:12.230 --> 37:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
Washington Post columnist
Michael Gerson.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
David Brooks is away.

37:18.369 --> 37:20.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to you, gentlemen.

37:20.238 --> 37:25.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There was a special
congressional election
this week, Mark Shields, in
Georgia, the Sixth

37:25.443 --> 37:26.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
District.

37:26.444 --> 37:27.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Really?

37:27.445 --> 37:28.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Really.

37:28.446 --> 37:29.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: My question is,
the Democrats
fell just short.

37:32.283 --> 37:36.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Lessons learned, wider
implications, what
did you see?

37:36.087 --> 37:38.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I saw all of
them.

37:38.789 --> 37:40.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:40.625 --> 37:45.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The Democrat, a
30-year-old
rookie with experience in public
life of being

37:45.796 --> 37:55.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a congressional aide on Capitol
Hill, managed
to raise over $8 million from
activists around

37:55.806 --> 38:03.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country who are committed
and his own
support, and managed to get,
Judy, more votes

38:03.381 --> 38:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than the first five Republicans
in a district
that Mitt Romney won by 20
points that has

38:08.886 --> 38:14.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been electing nothing but
Republicans to Congress,
including Dr. Tom Price, the
secretary of

38:14.492 --> 38:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HHS, by -- and Newt Gingrich by
substantial
margins.

38:20.097 --> 38:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he didn't get the magic 50
percent, which
in the jungle primary of
Georgia, where everybody's

38:25.303 --> 38:27.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in it, is the magic number.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I would say it was
impressive.

38:29.173 --> 38:32.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
After Kansas, what it means...

38:32.476 --> 38:34.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where they had
another special
election.

38:34.278 --> 38:37.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Had a special
election, where
the Democrat didn't win, but,
again, in a

38:37.882 --> 38:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
district that Donald Trump had
won by 23 points,
he won -- he lost only by seven.

38:42.720 --> 38:43.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Even more
impressive, actually.

38:44.021 --> 38:45.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, that's right.

38:45.122 --> 38:46.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The Democrats,
they have cut
the margin.

38:47.692 --> 38:51.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, right now, I would say the
wind is at
the Democrats' back.

38:51.429 --> 38:52.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does that mean?

38:52.430 --> 38:53.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is the significance?

38:53.431 --> 38:54.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The significance is this.

38:54.432 --> 38:56.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If the Democrats do win,
surprising.

38:56.767 --> 39:01.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be quite surprising if
they could
win in Montana, quite frankly,
because it's

39:01.339 --> 39:02.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an 11-point Republican
advantage.

39:02.506 --> 39:03.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's another
election coming
up soon.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: For Ryan Zinke's
seat.

39:05.376 --> 39:08.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it does, Judy, it means
they're going to
get better candidates.

39:08.913 --> 39:10.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what happens when you win
special elections.

39:10.815 --> 39:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You start to get -- recruit
better candidates
for the next general election,
more attractive,

39:16.220 --> 39:18.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more appealing, more competent
candidates.

39:18.923 --> 39:22.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the other side starts to see
retirements.

39:22.426 --> 39:27.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Candidates in tough races decide
to spend
more time with their family,
rather than doing

39:27.164 --> 39:28.132 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a contested...

39:28.165 --> 39:29.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:29.300 --> 39:30.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see
in these tea
leaves?

39:30.568 --> 39:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, it's not
unusual for
this to happen.

39:32.970 --> 39:36.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most presidents in their first
midterms don't
do very well.

39:36.907 --> 39:38.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this is happening early.

39:39.009 --> 39:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is happening 90 days into a
new presidency.

39:41.979 --> 39:45.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this is supposed to be a
high point
of presidential influence.

39:45.416 --> 39:51.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're seeing in both
these data points
is a very serious problem for
Republicans.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're hurting in places they
shouldn't be
hurting.

39:53.758 --> 39:57.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that has great
significance.

39:57.128 --> 40:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, who knows how it
trends in the future,
but, right now, I think
Republicans are seeing

40:02.767 --> 40:04.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alarm bells ringing.

40:04.635 --> 40:09.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And knowing that,
if the Democrats
can mount strong candidates in
these districts,

40:09.440 --> 40:10.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're in trouble.

40:10.541 --> 40:13.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that's -- can they do that
in 2018, or
not?

40:13.277 --> 40:20.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think the
prospect of
winning has encouraged people to
run.

40:20.317 --> 40:27.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would just point out, in
defense of the
Sixth District, that, while Mitt
Romney carried

40:27.558 --> 40:34.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
college-educated whites by 14
percent over
Barack Obama in 2012, Donald
Trump only carried

40:34.432 --> 40:37.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them by four points over Hillary
Clinton.

40:37.902 --> 40:44.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a district where
college-educated
voters are remarkably -- the
percentage of

40:44.375 --> 40:47.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them is remarkably high, one of
the 10 highest
in the country.

40:47.178 --> 40:52.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael, you
mentioned Republicans
may be feeling a little nervous,
the White

40:52.716 --> 40:54.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House feeling a little nervous.

40:54.852 --> 40:58.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some Republicans feeling
comfortable enough
to start criticizing this
president.

40:58.689 --> 41:02.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had two Republican senators
in this past
week.

41:02.326 --> 41:08.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joni Ernst -- these are sort of
gentle criticisms
-- the senator from Iowa, came
out and said

41:08.165 --> 41:12.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president needs to spend
less time at
his Mar-a-Lago resort on the
weekends, more

41:12.470 --> 41:14.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time at the White House.

41:14.438 --> 41:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you had Senator James
Lankford of Oklahoma
and a few other Republicans
saying the president

41:18.709 --> 41:20.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
needs to release his tax
returns.

41:20.411 --> 41:21.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

41:21.912 --> 41:25.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this just the
kind of typical
intraparty split, or what?

41:25.749 --> 41:29.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: No, I think it
means something.

41:29.787 --> 41:35.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every Republican candidate has
to make a Trump
calibration to determine what
percentage they

41:35.893 --> 41:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support the president and what
they don't,
depending on their districts.

41:39.296 --> 41:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, there is a huge
difference between
a president at 60 percent and a
president

41:43.033 --> 41:44.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the low 40s.

41:44.835 --> 41:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People feel like they don't need
to explain
things for him that are
difficult to explain.

41:50.841 --> 41:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You watch some members, like Tom
Cotton, a
senator who I really like, a
sharp guy, trying

41:56.213 --> 42:01.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to defend why the president
won't release
his tax returns, and looks
foolish in the

42:01.852 --> 42:02.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Right.

42:04.688 --> 42:07.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: So, some of the
cost, the
intimidation factor has been
reduced because

42:07.224 --> 42:08.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the president's standing.

42:09.026 --> 42:12.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some people are just not
going to put
up with explaining the
unexplainable.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I agree with
Michael.

42:14.999 --> 42:19.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Lankford of Oklahoma,
this is the
reddest of red states, Oklahoma.

42:19.870 --> 42:25.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he's a true-blue
conservative, no pun
intended, he, Senator James
Lankford.

42:25.910 --> 42:28.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was asked about the tax
returns.

42:28.679 --> 42:33.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And his answer was, he promised
he would,
and, therefore, he should.

42:33.651 --> 42:35.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, it was that
straightforward.

42:35.352 --> 42:38.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That -- it's unassailable logic
that's absolutely
true.

42:38.188 --> 42:41.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he had -- he promised a
number of times
that he would do so.

42:41.392 --> 42:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then he said the promise was --
he, the president,
said the promise was negated
because he won

42:45.596 --> 42:47.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the election.

42:47.364 --> 42:51.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president today, in an
Associated Press
interview, said he was going to
have a big,

42:51.635 --> 42:55.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
huge, wonderful tax cut bill
next week.

42:55.940 --> 43:00.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And anybody on either side of
the aisle will
have a tough time answering the
question,

43:00.411 --> 43:07.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if this is the proposal, what
will it mean
for -- what will President
Trump's tax cut

43:07.051 --> 43:11.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean for billionaire citizen
Trump's personal
taxes?

43:11.755 --> 43:12.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I think that is...

43:12.756 --> 43:13.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:13.757 --> 43:14.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's a
question.

43:14.758 --> 43:16.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:16.560 --> 43:17.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: He's materially
undermining
his ability to get that
legislation through

43:17.895 --> 43:20.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Congress because of his
refusal to receive
this material.

43:20.764 --> 43:24.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are not going to pass,
including many
Republicans, a law without
knowing how it

43:24.902 --> 43:26.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
benefits the president.

43:26.704 --> 43:29.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as far as we
know, there
is no intention, is that right,
on the part

43:29.640 --> 43:32.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the White House to -- or the
president
to release it.

43:32.276 --> 43:34.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, it's a -- I
used to be
a political hack.

43:34.812 --> 43:35.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe I still am.

43:35.813 --> 43:37.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:37.648 --> 43:40.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: But it's a pretty
safe -- you
have all the Cabinet officers
had to provide

43:40.317 --> 43:43.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their income information for
confirmation.

43:43.988 --> 43:45.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wilbur Ross is a billionaire.

43:45.556 --> 43:47.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All you have to do is run the
numbers.

43:47.825 --> 43:51.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would the proposed tax cut
mean for Wilbur
Ross?

43:51.629 --> 43:54.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would it mean for Steve
Mnuchin, the
secretary of the treasury?

43:54.331 --> 43:55.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

43:55.432 --> 43:56.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: What would it mean
for any of
the...

43:56.667 --> 43:58.102 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:58.135 --> 43:59.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you don't
have that information
on the president.

43:59.570 --> 44:00.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: For him.

44:00.838 --> 44:03.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is going to put -- it
will increase
pressure on him.

44:03.073 --> 44:06.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will make -- it will put
Republicans very
much on the defensive.

44:06.176 --> 44:07.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two other things.

44:08.012 --> 44:13.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, Michael, some wrinkles
this week when
it comes to foreign policy,
defense policy,

44:13.651 --> 44:18.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the story about the carrier
group that the
president said was on its way to
North Korea.

44:18.088 --> 44:20.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It turned out it was heading in
the other
direction.

44:20.658 --> 44:24.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon came back and said,
well, there
was a miscommunication.

44:24.294 --> 44:31.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other is, frankly,
different signals
coming from the Cabinet
officers, from -- even

44:31.135 --> 44:34.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the secretary of state, on
Turkey and
from the White House.

44:34.805 --> 44:40.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Are these just sort of
incidental things that
happen, or what?

44:40.277 --> 44:42.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do we read all of this?

44:42.179 --> 44:44.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: No, some of it
is real incompetence
in the aircraft carrier
circumstance, but

44:44.314 --> 44:45.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that might not have been the
White House.

44:45.983 --> 44:47.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it was genuine incompetence.

44:47.651 --> 44:51.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I look at something like the
president saying
that Korea was once part of
China.

44:51.855 --> 44:52.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

44:53.023 --> 44:54.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: That is not just
mispronouncing
a name.

44:54.825 --> 44:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is offending a country that
is our ally
in the midst of a crisis.

44:59.096 --> 45:00.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is serious.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there are also some
tensions.

45:02.433 --> 45:06.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is tension here between
the president's
word, ethno-nationalist, retreat
from the

45:06.637 --> 45:13.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world, and his personnel, people
that he's
chosen, like McMaster and like
Mattis.

45:13.444 --> 45:14.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are internationalists.

45:14.712 --> 45:17.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not consistent with his
public voice.

45:17.114 --> 45:20.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you have those divisions
within the administration.

45:20.284 --> 45:24.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has picked a variety of
people that don't
seem to share his foreign policy
vision.

45:24.755 --> 45:29.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that creates questions on --
natural questions
on the part of both friends and
enemies: Who

45:29.226 --> 45:33.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speaks for the administration,
under what
circumstance?

45:33.964 --> 45:39.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thanks to the
public partnership,
private-public partnership, they
keep track

45:39.103 --> 45:41.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of a very interesting number.

45:41.105 --> 45:45.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the number of
Senate-confirmable
important positions there are in
every administration.

45:45.642 --> 45:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is 554 that the Senate has
to confirm
that every president appoints.

45:51.148 --> 45:54.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As of this moment, 473 have not
been appointed.

45:54.685 --> 45:56.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

45:56.520 --> 46:00.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think -- so, I
think, Judy,
what you have in part is just
they're thin,

46:00.124 --> 46:02.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
their -- the level of
competence, the level
of trust.

46:02.626 --> 46:05.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is that lack of
cohesiveness.

46:05.662 --> 46:10.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But -- and Donald Trump has kind
of boasted
that he's keeping people off
balance.

46:10.901 --> 46:16.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every president, when he gets in
trouble domestically
or gets stalled domestically or
just fails

46:16.406 --> 46:21.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his domestic agenda, loves to
go on foreign
policy, where he has a far freer
rein.

46:21.879 --> 46:25.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's not the first one to do
this.

46:25.816 --> 46:31.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to sustain and forge and
maintain a coalition,
it's based on trust.

46:31.388 --> 46:35.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's based not on
unpredictability or mercurial
behavior.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's based on a sense of
dependability.

46:37.761 --> 46:46.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we talk about the USS Carl
Vinson steaming
toward the Indian Ocean, when
they -- the

46:46.203 --> 46:50.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Koreans were told, our allies,
and the Japanese
were told it was headed toward
the Korean

46:50.674 --> 46:52.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Peninsula.

46:52.075 --> 46:55.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Judy, that sends tremors,
quite frankly,
through our allies.

46:56.013 --> 47:00.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they have more serious
problems than
just having egg on their face.

47:00.617 --> 47:05.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And they have
been mocking
the U.S. in China, and certainly
in North

47:05.322 --> 47:06.290 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

47:06.323 --> 47:08.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

47:08.158 --> 47:10.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The last thing I
want to ask
both of you about comes out of
news from FOX

47:10.327 --> 47:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News Channel, Michael, that Bill
O'Reilly,
who was their, I guess,
highest-rated news

47:16.667 --> 47:23.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
star, has left, been forced out
after these
allegations by a number of women
about sexual

47:23.407 --> 47:31.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harassment, and, I guess,
secret, until now,
payouts, payments to these
women, $25 million

47:31.949 --> 47:34.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
severance, we're told.

47:34.318 --> 47:36.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does this mean in the world
of media?

47:36.620 --> 47:39.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Certainly, in the world of
conservative media,
it's a big teal.

47:39.723 --> 47:42.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, it's an
epic change
in conservative media.

47:42.226 --> 47:47.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been the most important
Republican
influence, I think, bar none,
over the last

47:47.497 --> 47:48.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
15 years.

47:48.832 --> 47:52.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FOX News has played that role
for many activist
Republicans.

47:52.436 --> 47:58.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now the brains of the
operation, Ailes,
and the face of the operation,
O'Reilly, are

47:58.308 --> 47:59.943 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gone.

47:59.977 --> 48:01.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a massive change.

48:01.745 --> 48:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also an indication just --
maybe one
way to put it is, sometimes,
conservatives

48:06.650 --> 48:08.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
need liberals.

48:08.218 --> 48:11.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And liberals have been talking
about workplace
equality for a long time.

48:11.989 --> 48:14.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they were absolutely right.

48:14.625 --> 48:21.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is a case where FOX
tolerated the intolerable,
and did so time after time.

48:21.865 --> 48:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a systemic problem.

48:23.700 --> 48:25.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think they need to face
that very directly.

48:25.869 --> 48:27.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just over 30, 40
seconds.

48:27.738 --> 48:29.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

48:29.506 --> 48:34.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, I think it's always been
about power
more than about sex, sexual
harassment.

48:34.878 --> 48:39.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's men in position of power
who have had
women who have been vulnerable,
who have needed

48:39.216 --> 48:41.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
promotions, who have needed
jobs, who have
needed just sustenance.

48:42.019 --> 48:48.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's all -- and I think what
we see in
this, quite frankly, societally,
is a revolt

48:48.625 --> 48:49.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and a revolution.

48:49.660 --> 48:53.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what we saw, cable TV is
about two things.

48:53.130 --> 48:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about eyeballs, the number
of people
who watch it, and it's about
dollar signs.

48:56.733 --> 49:00.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His eyeballs, the number of
people who watched
Bill O'Reilly, was still up
there, but the

49:00.704 --> 49:02.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dollar signs were hurting.

49:02.439 --> 49:04.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Corporate sponsors were
withdrawing.

49:04.274 --> 49:09.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was because women, and
men, too, but
women led it, and they led a
boycott and they

49:09.579 --> 49:10.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
led a threat.

49:10.847 --> 49:13.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, I think, can change
our society
for the better.

49:13.884 --> 49:15.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Mark
Shields, Michael
Gerson, thank you both.

49:15.352 --> 49:23.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Thank you.

49:23.193 --> 49:31.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
Adam Alter,
a professor at New York
University's Stern

49:32.002 --> 49:38.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
School of Business and the
author of "Irresistible:
The Rise of Addictive
Technology," shares

49:38.508 --> 49:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his humble opinion on our
addiction to technology.

49:41.111 --> 49:43.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM ALTER, Associate Professor
of Marketing,
New York University Stern School
of Business:

49:43.880 --> 49:48.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2004, I left my family and
friends in Sydney,
Australia, to begin a Ph.D. in
psychology

49:48.518 --> 49:50.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at Princeton.

49:50.354 --> 49:53.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was lucky to find a group of
close friends,
but we were all busy, and at the
end of most

49:54.024 --> 49:56.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
days, I would return to my room
alone.

49:56.593 --> 50:00.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One night, I stumbled on a
primitive online
slot machine game called Slots.

50:01.031 --> 50:05.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. law prohibited online
gambling, so I
wasn't playing for real money,
but I found

50:05.902 --> 50:08.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the game impossible to resist.

50:08.205 --> 50:11.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of winning money, I
would win small
rewards in the form of bells and
flashing

50:11.708 --> 50:13.610 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lights.

50:13.643 --> 50:17.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bells and flashing lights may
sound like trivial
rewards, but, in those moments
of loneliness,

50:17.581 --> 50:19.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they scratched a psychological
itch.

50:19.983 --> 50:24.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I played so often that I started
to imagine
the reels on the slot machine
spinning during

50:24.554 --> 50:26.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the day.

50:26.289 --> 50:30.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in one of my classes,
we were learning
about a series of experiments on
isolated

50:30.360 --> 50:32.496 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
caged pigeons.

50:32.529 --> 50:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the birds were trained to
peck a button
that sometimes delivered food,
but sometimes

50:36.500 --> 50:40.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delivered nothing, they pecked
the button
hundreds of times, even when
they were no

50:40.971 --> 50:45.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
longer hungry, because their
isolation was
soothed by each gamble.

50:45.609 --> 50:47.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was a eureka moment for me.

50:47.411 --> 50:50.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was behaving a lot like these
birds.

50:50.580 --> 50:53.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Slots wasn't nourishing, but I
played for
hours.

50:53.283 --> 50:57.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My obsession lasted six months,
only ending
when I started dating a
classmate.

50:57.954 --> 51:03.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I learned that addiction isn't
only about
injecting a drug or playing a
game compulsively.

51:03.226 --> 51:05.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It also has to scratch a
psychological itch.

51:05.529 --> 51:07.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For me, that itch was
loneliness.

51:08.031 --> 51:12.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For someone else, it might be
depression numbed
with narcotics or boredom numbed
with a video

51:12.436 --> 51:14.104 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
game.

51:14.137 --> 51:18.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the world has changed a lot
since I stopped
playing Slots more than a decade
ago.

51:18.508 --> 51:23.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Many of us have those
psychological itches
that need scratching, from
anxiety to stress

51:23.046 --> 51:25.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to low self-esteem.

51:25.082 --> 51:29.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have access to relief in
the form of
smartphones and tablets.

51:29.653 --> 51:35.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wherever we go, those devices
bring us social
networks, games, e-mail, and
text messages,

51:35.525 --> 51:41.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each delivering or withholding
rewards in
the form of replies, shares, and
likes, just

51:41.198 --> 51:46.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as that small button did for the
caged lab
animals and slots did for me.

51:46.269 --> 51:50.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For most of us, it's difficult
to avoid the
screens that deliver addictive
experiences

51:50.507 --> 51:55.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
altogether, so the key is to
live part of
each day screen-free.

51:55.378 --> 51:59.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lock your smartphone and tablet
in a drawer
from, say, 5:00 to 7:00 p.m.

51:59.216 --> 52:03.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You will know you're succeeding
if, for at
least part of the day, you can't
tell that

52:03.854 --> 52:07.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's 2017 based only on what you
can see.

52:07.357 --> 52:11.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you're looking out at the
ocean or standing
in a forest or having a
conversation with

52:11.294 --> 52:17.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
someone, it could be 2017, but
it could also
be 1950 or 1700.

52:17.701 --> 52:21.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The key is to make at least a
thin slice of
every day timeless.

52:21.505 --> 52:28.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: "Washington Week"
airs later
tonight on PBS, with its newly
named moderator,

52:28.178 --> 52:31.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Robert Costa of The Washington
Post.

52:31.348 --> 52:32.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's here now to give us a
preview.

52:32.716 --> 52:33.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bob, congratulations.

52:33.717 --> 52:34.718 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

52:34.751 --> 52:36.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
®MD-BO /ROBERT COSTA: Thanks so
much, Judy.

52:36.119 --> 52:37.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's great to be here.

52:37.888 --> 52:41.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have a great roundtable
tonight to
discuss the apparent disconnect
between the

52:41.725 --> 52:45.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House and congressional
Republicans
over the repeal of Obamacare.

52:45.862 --> 52:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is so much on tax
reform to discuss,
as well as the border wall that
they're trying

52:50.100 --> 52:51.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to impose.

52:51.568 --> 52:54.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, we will explain why Bernie
Sanders is
back on the campaign trail.

52:54.638 --> 52:56.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's later tonight on
"Washington Week"
-- Judy.

52:56.840 --> 52:58.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will be
watching.

52:58.241 --> 52:59.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, again, congratulations.

52:59.242 --> 53:01.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Thank you.

53:01.111 --> 53:06.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on "PBS
NewsHour" Saturday:
Scientists plan to march on
Washington, and

53:06.516 --> 53:09.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some are even considering a run
for office.

53:09.653 --> 53:11.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why did you run for office?

53:11.454 --> 53:13.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAUGHNESSY NAUGHTON, 314
Action: Well, one
of the reasons was, I was really
concerned

53:13.557 --> 53:20.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the anti-science rhetoric
we hear out
of so many politicians, and the
cuts to basic

53:20.297 --> 53:25.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
research funding that I think
are putting
us behind, as well as hurting us
economically.

53:26.002 --> 53:31.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB YOUNG, Western Carolina
University: I
think it is problematic when
scientists are

53:31.741 --> 53:40.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lumping together scientific
issues with other
points of advocacy that may be
viewed as having

53:40.383 --> 53:44.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a party affiliation or a
particular political
bend.

53:44.120 --> 53:48.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
night on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."

53:48.425 --> 53:50.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday.

53:50.227 --> 53:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will speak to Facebook's
Sheryl Sandberg
about her struggle to move
forward after her

53:56.399 --> 53:58.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
husband's death.

53:58.034 --> 53:59.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:59.402 --> 54:00.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:00.403 --> 54:01.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

54:01.404 --> 54:09.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
