JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:54.788 --> 00:55.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:58.859 --> 01:02.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Welcome to this "PBS NewsHour"
special coverage of the first
debate between the two
major-party

01:02.896 --> 01:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential candidates, Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump.

01:06.867 --> 01:11.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The stage is set at Hofstra
University on Long Island, New
York.

01:11.338 --> 01:16.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the election 43 days away
the race tightening, a lot is on
the line tonight, Judy.

01:16.276 --> 01:19.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It certainly is,
Gwen, and given that this is the
first time these two

01:19.513 --> 01:22.582 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
have faced each
other one on one.

01:22.582 --> 01:26.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lester Holt of NBC News
will be moderating.

01:26.286 --> 01:32.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining us at the table are our
regular contributors, syndicated
columnist Mark Shields, New York

01:32.059 --> 01:35.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Times columnist David Brooks,
and from The Cook Political
Report, Amy Walter.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We welcome all you have here
for the next two hours.

01:38.231 --> 01:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Amy, let's start with you.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you looking for?

01:41.768 --> 01:42.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Each of these candidates
has an enthusiasm gap

01:42.569 --> 01:44.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
problem within their own party.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, they have got to get
their partisans fired up.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For Hillary Clinton,
it's young people.

01:48.742 --> 01:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Donald Trump, he's got to
get those white college-educated
voters back into the Republican

01:51.578 --> 01:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fold, where they have been.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they have got to get
those voters, both of them, who
are torn, don't like either

01:56.917 --> 02:00.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
choice they have in front
of them, to pick them.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mark Shields, what
would you... surprise you the
most of what these candidates
might

02:02.823 --> 02:04.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or might not do tonight?

02:04.391 --> 02:06.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Does Donald
Trump dare to be boring?

02:06.293 --> 02:11.765 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Does he come out
sedated/presidential?

02:11.765 --> 02:16.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And can Hillary Clinton, who is
a marvelous and superior
deliverer of information, make

02:16.403 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an emotional connection
with American voters?

02:19.439 --> 02:21.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, what are
you on the edge of your seat
looking for?

02:21.108 --> 02:22.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: We have been
around each other too long.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wrote down emotional
connection.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:24.344 --> 02:25.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Did you?

02:25.846 --> 02:26.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: This is
not a cognitive night.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is not philosophy.

02:27.447 --> 02:30.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not grand strategy.

02:30.450 --> 02:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's moment of intimacy, that
unscripted moment when the
unconscious is revealed that
will

02:34.454 --> 02:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be replayed on YouTube over
and over and over again.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so it's just, is he
commanding or is he cruel?

02:40.961 --> 02:45.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is she relatable and does
she seem calmly smart?

02:45.799 --> 02:49.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's whether people get that
vibe, the first they vibe, that
will determine the night.

02:49.036 --> 02:51.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is this about what
they know or who they are?

02:51.238 --> 02:55.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, I think it's
mostly about who they are.

02:55.375 --> 03:00.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For voters at this stage of the
game, they are looking up on
that dais to see who they

03:00.347 --> 03:03.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can spend the next four years
with, who they want to invite
into their homes moment after

03:03.183 --> 03:05.218 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
moment.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many voters say, I don't want
either one of them in there.

03:06.420 --> 03:07.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A lot of them.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: A lot of
voters are saying that.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is the one maybe that
they're not going to like, but
they will feel comfortable

03:11.191 --> 03:13.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enough.

03:13.560 --> 03:17.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark, people
are going to be fact-checking
this debate.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to be raising
questions about whether what
either one of them said was
correct

03:19.933 --> 03:21.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No,
you're right, Judy.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if it's what they know,
it will be a short evening...

03:25.272 --> 03:27.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:27.674 --> 03:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: for the Republican
nominee, whose knowledge bank
has been overdrawn.

03:33.346 --> 03:38.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's about, more
than anything else, each case,
what does he know, his command

03:38.552 --> 03:42.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of it, is he comfortable
with it, and who she is.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that is
really the question.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: And there
is the gender politics.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, we're turning now to
Lester Holt of NBC News.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRANSCRIPT START

03:49.996 --> 03:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Good evening from Hofstra
University in Hempstead, New
York.

03:50.530 --> 03:51.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm Lester Holt, anchor
of "NBC Nightly News."

03:51.731 --> 03:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to welcome you to the
first presidential debate.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The participants tonight are
Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton.

03:54.501 --> 03:53.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This debate is sponsored by the
Commission on Presidential
Debates, a nonpartisan,
nonprofit

03:53.934 --> 03:56.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organization.

03:56.369 --> 04:00.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The commission drafted tonight's
format, and the rules have been
agreed to by the campaigns.

04:00.207 --> 04:06.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 90-minute debate is divided
into six segments, each 15
minutes long.

04:06.012 --> 04:10.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We'll explore three topic areas
tonight: Achieving prosperity;
America's direction; and
securing

04:10.917 --> 04:13.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

04:13.954 --> 04:17.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the start of each segment, I
will ask the same lead-off
question to both candidates,

04:17.657 --> 04:21.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they will each have up
to two minutes to respond.

04:21.194 --> 04:25.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From that point until the end of
the segment, we'll have an open
discussion.

04:25.398 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The questions are mine and have
not been shared with the
commission or the campaigns.

04:30.036 --> 04:33.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The audience here in the room
has agreed to remain silent so
that we can focus on what

04:33.140 --> 04:35.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the candidates are saying.

04:35.876 --> 04:41.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will invite you to applaud,
however, at this moment, as we
welcome the candidates:

04:41.448 --> 04:44.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic nominee for president
of the United States, Hillary
Clinton, and Republican nominee

04:44.618 --> 04:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for president of the United
States, Donald J. Trump.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

04:53.860 --> 05:01.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: How are you, Donald?

05:01.801 --> 05:03.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

05:03.470 --> 05:11.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Good luck to you.

05:11.378 --> 05:14.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

05:14.581 --> 05:19.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I don't expect us to cover
all the issues of this campaign
tonight, but I remind everyone,

05:19.953 --> 05:23.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there are two more presidential
debates scheduled.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to focus on many of
the issues that voters tell us
are most important, and

05:27.027 --> 05:29.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we're going to press
for specifics.

05:29.796 --> 05:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am honored to have this role,
but this evening belongs to the
candidates and, just as
important,

05:33.099 --> 05:35.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the American people.

05:35.835 --> 05:39.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Candidates, we look forward to
hearing you articulate your
policies and your positions,

05:39.039 --> 05:41.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as well as your visions
and your values.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, let's begin.

05:44.444 --> 05:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're calling this opening
segment "Achieving Prosperity."

05:47.480 --> 05:50.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And central to that is jobs.

05:50.784 --> 05:54.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are two economic
realities in America today.

05:54.554 --> 05:58.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been a record six
straight years of job growth,
and new census numbers show
incomes

05:58.458 --> 06:03.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have increased at a record rate
after years of stagnation.

06:03.129 --> 06:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, income inequality
remains significant, and nearly
half of Americans are living
paycheck

06:07.133 --> 06:10.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to paycheck.

06:10.070 --> 06:14.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beginning with you, Secretary
Clinton, why are you a better
choice than your opponent

06:14.374 --> 06:18.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to create the kinds of jobs that
will put more money into the
pockets of American works?

06:18.712 --> 06:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, thank you,
Lester, and thanks to Hofstra
for hosting us.

06:24.484 --> 06:29.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The central question in this
election is really what kind of
country we want to be and what

06:29.089 --> 06:32.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kind of future we'll
build together.

06:32.726 --> 06:37.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today is my granddaughter's
second birthday, so I think
about this a lot.

06:37.330 --> 06:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, we have to build an
economy that works for everyone,
not just those at the top.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means we need new jobs,
good jobs, with rising incomes.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want us to invest in you.

06:47.807 --> 06:51.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want us to invest
in your future.

06:51.311 --> 06:56.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That means jobs in
infrastructure, in advanced
manufacturing, innovation and
technology,

06:56.883 --> 07:00.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clean, renewable energy, and
small business, because most of
the new jobs will come from

07:00.353 --> 07:02.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
small business.

07:02.689 --> 07:06.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We also have to make
the economy fairer.

07:06.559 --> 07:11.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That starts with raising the
national minimum wage and also
guarantee, finally, equal pay

07:11.698 --> 07:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for women's work.

07:13.833 --> 07:18.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: I also want to see more
companies do profit-sharing.

07:18.505 --> 07:21.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you help create the profits,
you should be able to share in
them, not just the executives

07:21.241 --> 07:24.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the top.

07:24.577 --> 07:31.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want us to do more to
support people who are
struggling to balance family and
work.

07:31.384 --> 07:35.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I've heard from so many of you
about the difficult choices you
face and the stresses that
you're

07:35.422 --> 07:37.223 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
under.

07:37.223 --> 07:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So let's have paid family
leave, earned sick days.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's be sure we have affordable
child care and debt-free
college.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How are we going to do it?

07:45.832 --> 07:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to do it by having
the wealthy pay their fair share
and close the corporate

07:48.535 --> 07:51.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
loopholes.

07:51.171 --> 07:57.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, we tonight are on the
stage together, Donald Trump and
I. Donald, it's good to be

07:57.711 --> 08:00.880 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with you.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to have a debate
where we are talking about the
important issues facing

08:04.651 --> 08:07.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our country.

08:07.854 --> 08:13.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to judge us, who can
shoulder the immense, awesome
responsibilities of the
presidency,

08:13.526 --> 08:17.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who can put into action the
plans that will make your life
better.

08:17.597 --> 08:21.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hope that I will be able to
earn your vote on November 8th.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.236 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
HOLT: Secretary
Clinton, thank you.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump, the same
question to you.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about putting money... more
money into the pockets of
American workers.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have up to two minutes.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.610 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: 21:08:32
Thank you, Lester.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our jobs are fleeing
the country.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're going to Mexico.

08:34.981 --> 08:38.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're going to many
other countries.

08:38.017 --> 08:42.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You look at what China is doing
to our country in terms of
making our product.

08:42.422 --> 08:46.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're devaluing their
currency, and there's nobody in
our government to fight them.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we have a very good fight.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we have a winning fight.

08:50.830 --> 08:54.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because they're using our
country as a piggy bank to
rebuild China, and many other
countries

08:54.834 --> 08:57.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are doing the same thing.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we're losing our good
jobs, so many of them.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When you look at what's
happening in Mexico, a friend of
mine who builds plants said it's

09:03.777 --> 09:06.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the eighth wonder of the world.

09:06.780 --> 09:09.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're building some of the
biggest plants anywhere in the
world, some of the most
sophisticated,

09:09.349 --> 09:11.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some of the best plants.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
With the United States,
as he said, not so much.

09:14.687 --> 09:17.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So Ford is leaving.

09:17.056 --> 09:20.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You see that, their small
car division leaving.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thousands of jobs leaving
Michigan, leaving Ohio.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're all leaving.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we can't allow it
to happen anymore.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As far as child care is
concerned and so many other
things, I think Hillary and I
agree

09:30.537 --> 09:33.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on that.

09:33.206 --> 09:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We probably disagree a little
bit as to numbers and amounts
and what we're going to do, but

09:37.777 --> 09:40.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
perhaps we'll be talking
about that later.

09:40.513 --> 09:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have to stop our jobs
from being stolen from us.

09:45.585 --> 09:51.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to stop our companies
from leaving the United States
and, with it, firing all

09:51.391 --> 09:53.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of their people.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All you have to do is take a
look at Carrier air conditioning
in Indianapolis.

09:57.664 --> 09:59.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They left... fired 1,400 people.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're going to Mexico.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So many hundreds and hundreds
of companies are doing this.

10:04.404 --> 10:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: We cannot let it happen.

10:08.408 --> 10:14.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under my plan, I'll be reducing
taxes tremendously, from 35
percent to 15 percent for
companies,

10:14.848 --> 10:17.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
small and big businesses.

10:17.584 --> 10:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's going to be a job creator
like we haven't seen since
Ronald Reagan.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's going to be a
beautiful thing to watch.

10:23.556 --> 10:24.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Companies will come.

10:24.524 --> 10:25.625 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They will build.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They will expand.

10:26.759 --> 10:29.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
New companies will start.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I look very, very
much forward to doing it.

10:31.831 --> 10:36.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to renegotiate our trade
deals, and we have to stop these
countries from stealing

10:36.069 --> 10:38.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our companies and our jobs.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton,
would you like to respond?

10:40.707 --> 10:43.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I think that
trade is an important issue.

10:43.943 --> 10:46.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, we are 5 percent of
the world's population; we have
to trade with the other

10:46.713 --> 10:49.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
95 percent.

10:49.015 --> 10:53.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we need to have
smart, fair trade deals.

10:53.186 --> 11:00.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also, though, need to have a
tax system that rewards work and
not just financial transactions.

11:00.260 --> 11:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the kind of plan that Donald
has put forth would be
trickle-down economics all over
again.

11:05.365 --> 11:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it would be the most
extreme version, the biggest tax
cuts for the top percent of

11:11.271 --> 11:14.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the people in this country
than we've ever had.

11:14.173 --> 11:18.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I call it trumped-up
trickle-down, because that's
exactly what it would be.

11:18.878 --> 11:22.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is not how we
grow the economy.

11:22.615 --> 11:26.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just have a different view
about what's best for growing
the economy, how we make

11:26.686 --> 11:30.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investments that will actually
produce jobs and rising incomes.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we come at it from
somewhat different perspectives.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I understand that.

11:35.695 --> 11:42.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Donald was very
fortunate in his life, and
that's all to his benefit.

11:42.201 --> 11:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He started his business with $14
million, borrowed from his
father, and he really believes

11:47.840 --> 11:51.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the more you help wealthy
people, the better off we'll be
and that everything will

11:51.544 --> 11:52.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work out from there.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't buy that.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have a different experience.

11:55.982 --> 11:56.983 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
My father was a
small-businessman.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He worked really hard.

11:59.986 --> 12:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He printed drapery fabrics on
long tables, where he pulled out
those fabrics and he went

12:05.191 --> 12:10.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down with a silkscreen and
dumped the paint in and took the
squeegee and kept going.

12:10.229 --> 12:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what I believe is the
more we can do for the middle
class, the more we can invest

12:15.234 --> 12:19.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in you, your education, your
skills, your future, the better
we will be off and the

12:19.706 --> 12:21.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
better we'll grow.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the kind of economy
I want us to see again.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
21:12:21

12:24.510 --> 12:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: Let me follow up with Mr.
Trump, if you can.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You've talked about creating 25
million jobs, and you've
promised to bring back millions

12:29.449 --> 12:32.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of jobs for Americans.

12:32.418 --> 12:35.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How are you going to bring back
the industries that have left
this country for cheaper labor

12:35.488 --> 12:38.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overseas?

12:38.024 --> 12:41.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How, specifically, are you going
to tell American manufacturers
that you have to come back?

12:41.394 --> 12:46.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, for one thing...
and before we start on that...
my father gave me a very

12:46.699 --> 12:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
small loan in 1975, and I built
it into a company that's worth
many, many billions of

12:51.070 --> 12:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dollars, with some of the
greatest assets in the world,
and I say that only because

12:54.240 --> 12:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's the kind of thinking
that our country needs.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our country's in deep trouble.

12:58.978 --> 13:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know what we're doing
when it comes to devaluations
and all of these countries

13:02.315 --> 13:03.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all over the world,
especially China.

13:03.549 --> 13:07.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're the best, the
best ever at it.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What they're doing to us
is a very, very sad thing.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So we have to do that.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to renegotiate
our trade deals.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Lester, they're taking our
jobs, they're giving incentives,
they're doing things that,

13:17.764 --> 13:19.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
frankly, we don't do.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let me give you the
example of Mexico.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have a VAT tax.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're on a different system.

13:24.303 --> 13:28.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When we sell into
Mexico, there's a tax.

13:28.374 --> 13:31.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When they sell in... automatic,
16 percent, approximately.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
When they sell into
us, there's no tax.

13:34.013 --> 13:37.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a defective agreement.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been defective for a long
time, many years, but the
politicians haven't done
anything

13:39.719 --> 13:41.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about it.

13:41.688 --> 13:45.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, in all fairness to
Secretary Clinton... yes, is
that OK?

13:45.224 --> 13:46.592 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Good.

13:46.592 --> 13:48.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want you to be very happy.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's very important to me.

13:51.230 --> 13:54.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in all fairness to Secretary
Clinton, when she started
talking about this, it was

13:54.834 --> 13:56.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really very recently.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.638 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
She's been doing
this for 30 years.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And why hasn't she made
the agreements better?

14:00.840 --> 14:03.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The NAFTA agreement
is defective.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just because of the tax and many
other reasons, but just because
of the fact...

14:06.212 --> 14:08.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Let me interrupt
just a moment, but...

14:08.414 --> 14:12.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Secretary Clinton and
others, politicians, should have
been doing this for years, not

14:12.952 --> 14:15.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right now, because of the fact
that we've created a movement.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They should have been
doing this for years.

14:19.292 --> 14:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's happened to our jobs and
our country and our economy
generally is... look, we owe

14:25.431 --> 14:27.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$20 trillion.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We cannot do it any
longer, Lester.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: 21:14:28 Back to
the question, though.

14:31.204 --> 14:35.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How do you bring back...
specifically bring back jobs,
American manufacturers?

14:35.074 --> 14:36.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you make them
bring the jobs back?

14:36.743 --> 14:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, the first thing you
do is don't let the jobs leave.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The companies are leaving.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I could name, I mean, there
are thousands of them.

14:43.082 --> 14:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're leaving, and they're
leaving in bigger numbers than
ever.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what you do is you say,
fine, you want to go to Mexico
or some other country, good

14:49.388 --> 14:50.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
luck.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We wish you a lot of luck.

14:52.959 --> 14:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you think you're going to
make your air conditioners or
your cars or your cookies

14:56.395 --> 15:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or whatever you make and bring
them into our country without a
tax, you're wrong.

15:01.501 --> 15:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once you say you're going to
have to tax them coming in, and
our politicians never

15:05.471 --> 15:09.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do this, because they have
special interests and the
special interests want those
companies

15:09.642 --> 15:12.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to leave, because in many
cases, they own the companies.

15:12.712 --> 15:16.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So what I'm saying is, we
can stop them from leaving.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.751 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have to stop
them from leaving.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's a big, big factor.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: Let me let Secretary
Clinton get in here.

15:22.755 --> 15:27.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: 21:15:19 Well, let's
stop for a second and remember
where we were eight years ago.

15:27.994 --> 15:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had the worst financial
crisis, the Great Recession, the
worst since the 1930s.

15:33.599 --> 15:40.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was in large part because
of tax policies that slashed
taxes on the wealthy, failed

15:40.606 --> 15:46.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to invest in the middle class,
took their eyes off of Wall
Street, and created a perfect

15:46.479 --> 15:48.781 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
storm.

15:48.781 --> 15:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, Donald was one of the
people who rooted for the
housing crisis.

15:53.152 --> 15:57.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, back in 2006, "Gee, I
hope it does collapse, because
then I can go in and buy

15:57.456 --> 15:58.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some and make some money."

15:58.958 --> 16:00.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, it did collapse.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: 21:16:02 That's
called business, by the way.

16:02.595 --> 16:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Nine million people...
nine million people lost their
jobs.

16:06.432 --> 16:08.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Five million people
lost their homes.

16:08.401 --> 16:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And $13 trillion in family
wealth was wiped out.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, we have come
back from that abyss.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it has not been easy.

16:18.845 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're now on the precipice of
having a potentially much better
economy, but the last

16:25.117 --> 16:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing we need to do is to go
back to the policies that failed
us in the first place.

16:32.124 --> 16:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Independent experts have looked
at what I've proposed and looked
at what Donald's proposed,

16:36.696 --> 16:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and basically they've said this,
that if his tax plan, which
would blow up the debt by

16:43.236 --> 16:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over $5 trillion and would in
some instances disadvantage
middle-class families compared

16:50.176 --> 16:55.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the wealthy, were to go into
effect, we would lose 3.5
million jobs and maybe have

16:55.381 --> 16:59.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
another recession.

16:59.118 --> 17:03.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They've looked at my plans and
they've said, OK, if we can do
this, and I intend to get

17:03.289 --> 17:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it done, we will have 10 million
more new jobs, because we will
be making investments

17:08.995 --> 17:10.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where we can grow the economy.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Take clean energy.

17:13.332 --> 17:18.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some country is going to be the
clean-energy superpower of the
21st century.

17:18.304 --> 17:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald thinks that climate
change is a hoax perpetrated by
the Chinese.

17:21.407 --> 17:22.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it's real.

17:22.408 --> 17:23.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I did not.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I did not.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I do not say that.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.545 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: I think
science is real.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I do not say that.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And I think it's
important that we grip this and
deal with it, both at home and

17:30.449 --> 17:31.817 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
abroad.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And here's what we can do.

17:33.319 --> 17:35.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can deploy a half a
billion more solar panels.

17:35.621 --> 17:38.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can have enough clean
energy to power every home.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can build a new
modern electric grid.

17:41.928 --> 17:45.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a lot of jobs; that's a
lot of new economic activity.

17:45.998 --> 17:52.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So I've tried to be very
specific about what we can and
should do, and I am determined

17:52.405 --> 17:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we're going to get the
economy really moving again,
building on the progress we've

17:57.109 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made over the last eight years,
but never going back to what got
us in trouble in the

17:59.845 --> 18:00.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first place.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HOLT: Mr. Trump?

18:02.315 --> 18:03.716 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: She talks
about solar panels.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We invested in a solar
company, our country.

18:05.484 --> 18:06.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was a disaster.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They lost plenty of
money on that one.

18:09.855 --> 18:14.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, look, I'm a great believer
in all forms of energy, but
we're putting a lot of people

18:14.760 --> 18:16.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of work.

18:16.228 --> 18:19.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our energy policies
are a disaster.

18:19.065 --> 18:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our country is losing so much in
terms of energy, in terms of
paying off our debt.

18:23.736 --> 18:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't do what you're looking
to do with $20 trillion in debt.

18:28.307 --> 18:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Obama administration, from
the time they've come in, is
over 230 years' worth of debt,

18:34.347 --> 18:37.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and he's topped it.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's doubled it in a course of
almost eight years,
seven-and-a-half years, to be
semi-

18:40.686 --> 18:41.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exact.

18:41.921 --> 18:43.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So I will tell you this.

18:43.956 --> 18:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to do a much better
job at keeping our jobs.

18:49.762 --> 18:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to do a much better
job at giving companies
incentives to build new
companies

18:54.000 --> 18:57.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or to expand, because
they're not doing it.

18:57.003 --> 19:01.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:18:59 And all you have to do
is look at Michigan and look at
Ohio and look at all

19:01.507 --> 19:07.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of these places where so many of
their jobs and their companies
are just leaving, they're

19:07.113 --> 19:08.748 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gone.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, Hillary, I'd
just ask you this.

19:10.383 --> 19:14.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You've been doing
this for 30 years.

19:14.520 --> 19:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why are you just thinking about
these solutions right now?

19:17.390 --> 19:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For 30 years, you've been doing
it, and now you're just starting
to think of solutions.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, actually...

19:21.293 --> 19:22.194 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: I will
bring... excuse me.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will bring back jobs.

19:24.196 --> 19:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't bring back jobs.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, actually, I have
thought about this quite a bit.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.

19:29.835 --> 19:33.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: And I have...
Well, not quite that long.

19:33.773 --> 19:37.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think my husband did a
pretty good job in the 1990s.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a lot about what worked
and how we can make it work
again...

19:39.812 --> 19:40.913 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: Well, he
approved NAFTA...

19:40.913 --> 19:42.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:42.615 --> 19:44.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: million new
jobs, a balanced budget...

19:44.450 --> 19:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which
is the single worst trade deal
ever approved in this country.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Incomes went
up for everybody.

19:48.754 --> 19:53.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Manufacturing jobs went up also
in the 1990s, if we're actually
going to look at the facts.

19:53.392 --> 19:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was in the Senate, I had
a number of trade deals that
came before me, and I held

19:57.163 --> 19:59.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them all to the same test.

19:59.598 --> 20:01.600 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Will they create
jobs in America?

20:01.600 --> 20:03.536 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Will they raise
incomes in America?

20:03.536 --> 20:06.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And are they good for
our national security?

20:06.272 --> 20:08.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some of them I voted for.

20:08.240 --> 20:13.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The biggest one, a multinational
one known as CAFTA, I voted
against.

20:13.279 --> 20:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And because I hold the same
standards as I look at all of
these trade deals.

20:18.350 --> 20:25.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's not assume that trade
is the only challenge we have in
the economy.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it is a part of it, and
I've said what I'm going to do.

20:27.693 --> 20:30.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm going to have a
special prosecutor.

20:30.629 --> 20:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to enforce the trade
deals we have, and we're going
to hold people accountable.

20:34.700 --> 20:40.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was secretary of state,
we actually increased American
exports globally 30 percent.

20:40.606 --> 20:44.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We increased them to
China 50 percent.

20:44.443 --> 20:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I know how to really work to
get new jobs and to get exports
that helped to create more

20:49.949 --> 20:51.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new jobs.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Very quickly...

20:53.419 --> 20:54.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: But you haven't done it
in 30 years or 26 years or any
number you want to...

20:54.820 --> 20:55.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, I've been
a senator, Donald...

20:55.521 --> 20:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: You haven't done it.

20:56.455 --> 20:57.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You haven't done it.

20:57.923 --> 20:58.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: And I have been
a secretary of state...

20:58.424 --> 20:59.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Excuse me.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.760 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: And I
have done a lot...

21:01.760 --> 21:03.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Your husband signed
NAFTA, which was one of the
worst things that ever happened

21:03.362 --> 21:04.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the manufacturing industry.

21:04.563 --> 21:05.231 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: Well,
that's your opinion.

21:05.231 --> 21:07.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is your opinion.

21:07.867 --> 21:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: You go to New England,
you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania,
you go anywhere you want,
Secretary

21:12.505 --> 21:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, and you will see
devastation where manufacture is
down 30, 40, sometimes 50
percent.

21:18.377 --> 21:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAFTA is the worst trade deal
maybe ever signed anywhere, but
certainly ever signed in this

21:21.180 --> 21:23.149 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now you want to approve
Trans-Pacific Partnership.

21:25.451 --> 21:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You were totally in favor of it.

21:28.554 --> 21:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then you heard what I was
saying, how bad it is, and you
said, I can't win that debate.

21:32.324 --> 21:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you know that if you did
win, you would approve that, and
that will be almost as bad

21:35.194 --> 21:36.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as NAFTA.

21:36.495 --> 21:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nothing will ever top NAFTA.

21:38.063 --> 21:41.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, that
is just not accurate.

21:41.367 --> 21:47.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was against it once it was
finally negotiated and the terms
were laid out.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I wrote about that in...

21:48.474 --> 21:49.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: You called it
the gold standard.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:51.076 --> 21:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: You called it the gold
standard of trade deals.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You said it's the finest
deal you've ever seen.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CLINTON: No.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And then you heard what I
said about it, and all of a
sudden you were against it.

21:59.852 --> 22:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know
you live in your own reality,
but that is not the facts.

22:04.957 --> 22:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The facts are... I did say I
hoped it would be a good deal,
but when it was negotiated...

22:07.893 --> 22:09.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Not.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLINTON: which I was not
responsible for, I concluded it
wasn't.

22:12.431 --> 22:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I wrote about that in my book...

22:13.766 --> 22:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: So is it President
Obama's fault?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: before you
even announced.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Is it President
Obama's fault?

22:17.102 --> 22:18.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Look, there
are differences...

22:18.771 --> 22:20.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Secretary, is it
President Obama's fault?

22:20.673 --> 22:21.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: There are...

22:21.774 --> 22:24.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Because he's pushing it.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: There are different
views about what's good for our
country, our economy, and our

22:27.680 --> 22:30.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leadership in the world.

22:30.816 --> 22:35.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's important to
look at what we need to do to
get the economy going again.

22:35.421 --> 22:40.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why I said new jobs with
rising incomes, investments, not
in more tax cuts that would

22:40.125 --> 22:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
add $5 trillion to the debt.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: But you have no plan.

22:43.162 --> 22:44.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: But in... oh, but I do.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Secretary,
you have no plan.

22:46.632 --> 22:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: In fact, I have
written a book about it.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's called "Stronger Together."

22:49.702 --> 22:50.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can pick it up
tomorrow at a bookstore...

22:50.903 --> 22:51.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: That's about
all you've...

22:51.437 --> 22:52.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:52.738 --> 22:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Folks, we're going to...

22:53.973 --> 22:54.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: or at an
airport near you.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: We're going to move to...

22:56.976 --> 22:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: But it's because I see
this... we need to have strong
growth, fair growth, sustained

22:59.979 --> 23:02.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
growth.

23:02.581 --> 23:06.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also have to look at how we
help families balance the
responsibilities at home and the

23:06.752 --> 23:08.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
responsibilities at business.

23:08.787 --> 23:13.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we have a very
robust set of plans.

23:13.826 --> 23:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people have looked at both
of our plans, have concluded
that mine would create 10
million

23:19.265 --> 23:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs and yours would lose us 3.5
million jobs, and explode the
debt which would have a
recession.

23:23.602 --> 23:27.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: You are going to approve
one of the biggest tax cuts in
history.

23:27.306 --> 23:30.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:23:20 You are going to
approve one of the biggest tax
increases in history.

23:30.776 --> 23:34.246 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You are going to
drive business out.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your regulations are a disaster,
and you're going to increase
regulations all over the

23:37.049 --> 23:39.051 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And by the way, my tax cut is
the biggest since Ronald Reagan.

23:41.453 --> 23:43.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm very proud of it.

23:43.756 --> 23:46.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will create tremendous
numbers of new jobs.

23:46.425 --> 23:51.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But regulations, you are going
to regulate these businesses out
of existence.

23:51.297 --> 23:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I go around... Lester, I
tell you this, I've been all
over.

23:55.167 --> 23:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I go around, despite
the tax cut, the thing... the
things that business as in

23:59.571 --> 24:05.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people like the most is the fact
that I'm cutting regulation.

24:05.110 --> 24:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have regulations on top of
regulations, and new companies
cannot form and old companies

24:09.848 --> 24:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are going out of business.

24:12.217 --> 24:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you want to increase the
regulations and make them even
worse.

24:14.386 --> 24:17.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to cut regulations.

24:17.690 --> 24:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going to cut taxes big
league, and you're going to
raise taxes big league, end of
story.

24:23.395 --> 24:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Let me get you to pause
right there, because we're going
to move into... we're

24:24.697 --> 24:25.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to move into
the next segment.

24:25.431 --> 24:26.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to talk taxes...

24:26.899 --> 24:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: That can't... that
can't be left to stand.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Please just take 30
seconds and then we're going to
go on.

24:30.369 --> 24:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I kind of assumed that
there would be a lot of these
charges and claims, and

24:33.972 --> 24:35.107 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so...

24:35.107 --> 24:37.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Facts.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: So we have taken the
home page of my website,
HillaryClinton.com, and we've

24:39.812 --> 24:43.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
turned it into a fact-checker.

24:43.415 --> 24:48.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So if you want to see in
real-time what the facts are,
please go and take a look.

24:48.387 --> 24:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Because what I have proposed...

24:49.955 --> 24:51.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: And take a look at
mine, also, and you'll see.

24:51.523 --> 24:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: would not add a penny
to the debt, and your plans
would add $5 trillion

24:55.427 --> 24:57.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the debt.

24:57.830 --> 25:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I have proposed would cut
regulations and streamline them
for small businesses.

25:04.036 --> 25:10.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I have proposed would be
paid for by raising taxes on the
wealthy, because they

25:10.876 --> 25:15.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have made all the
gains in the economy.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's time that the
wealthy and corporations paid
their fair share to support

25:17.516 --> 25:19.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this country.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Well, you just
opened the next segment.

25:20.219 --> 25:20.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, could I just
finish... I think I...

25:20.486 --> 25:22.254 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:22.254 --> 25:23.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: I'm going to give you
a chance right here...

25:23.889 --> 25:24.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I think I should... you
go to her website, and you take
a look at her website.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.024 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
HOLT: with a new
15-minute segment...

25:26.024 --> 25:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: She's going to raise
taxes $1.3 trillion.

25:27.593 --> 25:28.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...

25:28.827 --> 25:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: And look at her website.

25:30.662 --> 25:31.930 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know what?

25:31.930 --> 25:33.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's no difference than this.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.500 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
She's telling us
how to fight ISIS.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just go to her website.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She tells you how to fight
ISIS on her website.

25:38.670 --> 25:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think General Douglas
MacArthur would like that too
much.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: The next segment,
we're continuing...

25:43.409 --> 25:45.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, at least I
have a plan to fight ISIS.

25:45.344 --> 25:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: achieving prosperity...

25:47.179 --> 25:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: No, no, you're telling
the enemy everything you want to
do.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: No, we're not.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, we're not.

25:51.116 --> 25:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: See, you're telling the
enemy everything you want to do.

25:53.285 --> 25:56.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No wonder you've been
fighting... no wonder you've
been fighting ISIS your entire
adult

25:56.622 --> 25:58.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

25:58.957 --> 26:02.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: That's a... that's...
go to the please, fact checkers,
get to work.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: OK, you are
unpacking a lot here.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're still on the issue
of achieving prosperity.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I want to talk about taxes.

26:09.601 --> 26:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fundamental difference
between the two of you concerns
the wealthy.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, you're
calling for a tax increase on
the wealthiest Americans.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.110 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I'd like you to
further defend that.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Mr. Trump, you're calling
for tax cuts for the wealthy.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'd like you to defend that.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this next two-minute
answer goes to you, Mr. Trump.

26:25.150 --> 26:27.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I'm really calling
for major jobs, because the
wealthy are going create

26:27.820 --> 26:29.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tremendous jobs.

26:29.655 --> 26:31.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're going to expand
their companies.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're going to do
a tremendous job.

26:33.325 --> 26:36.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm getting rid of the
carried interest provision.

26:36.562 --> 26:39.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you really look, it's not
a tax... it's really not a great
thing for the wealthy.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a great thing for
the middle class.

26:41.934 --> 26:45.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a great thing for
companies to expand.

26:45.070 --> 26:49.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when these people are going
to put billions and billions of
dollars into companies, and

26:49.675 --> 26:54.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they're going to bring $2.5
trillion back from overseas,
where they can't bring

26:54.379 --> 26:59.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the money back, because
politicians like Secretary
Clinton won't allow them to
bring the money

26:59.284 --> 27:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back, because the taxes are so
onerous, and the bureaucratic
red tape, so what... is so

27:03.021 --> 27:05.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bad.

27:05.691 --> 27:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what they're doing is they're
leaving our country, and
they're, believe it or not,
leaving

27:09.294 --> 27:12.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because taxes are too high and
because some of them have lots
of money outside of our

27:12.764 --> 27:15.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

27:15.267 --> 27:17.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And instead of bringing it back
and putting the money to work,
because they can't work

27:17.536 --> 27:21.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out a deal to... and everybody
agrees it should be brought
back.

27:21.240 --> 27:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of that, they're leaving
our country to get their money,
because they can't bring

27:26.178 --> 27:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their money back into our
country, because of bureaucratic
red tape, because they can't

27:29.748 --> 27:32.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get together.

27:32.217 --> 27:35.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because we have... we have a
president that can't sit them
around a table and get them

27:35.454 --> 27:36.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to approve something.

27:36.555 --> 27:39.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And here's the thing.

27:39.124 --> 27:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans and Democrats agree
that this should be done, $2.5
trillion.

27:42.694 --> 27:44.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I happen to think
it's double that.

27:44.730 --> 27:50.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's probably $5 trillion that
we can't bring into our country,
Lester.

27:50.035 --> 27:54.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with a little leadership,
you'd get it in here very
quickly, and it could be put

27:54.873 --> 27:57.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to use on the inner cities and
lots of other things, and it
would be beautiful.

27:57.876 --> 28:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we have no leadership.

28:00.412 --> 28:02.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And honestly, that starts
with Secretary Clinton.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.248 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
21:28:01

28:03.248 --> 28:05.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HOLT: All right.

28:05.551 --> 28:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have two minutes of the same
question to defend tax increases
on the wealthiest

28:07.719 --> 28:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Americans, Secretary Clinton.

28:09.821 --> 28:10.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I have a feeling that
by, the end of this evening, I'm
going to be blamed for

28:10.989 --> 28:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
everything that's ever happened.

28:12.591 --> 28:13.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Why not?

28:13.992 --> 28:15.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Why not?

28:15.460 --> 28:16.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yeah, why not?

28:16.728 --> 28:18.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:18.664 --> 28:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, just join the debate
by saying more crazy things.

28:22.568 --> 28:25.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, let me say this, it
is absolutely the case...

28:25.203 --> 28:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: There's nothing crazy
about not letting our companies
bring their money back into

28:28.006 --> 28:29.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their country.

28:29.908 --> 28:30.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HOLT: This is... this is
Secretary Clinton's two minutes,
please.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Yes.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Yeah, well, let's
start the clock again, Lester.

28:35.213 --> 28:39.184 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We've looked at
your tax proposals.

28:39.184 --> 28:45.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't see changes in the
corporate tax rates or the kinds
of proposals you're referring

28:45.324 --> 28:49.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to that would cause the
repatriation, bringing back of
money that's stranded overseas.

28:49.828 --> 28:50.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I happen to support that.

28:50.862 --> 28:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Then you didn't read it.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I happen to... I happen
to support that in a way that
will actually work to our

28:55.867 --> 28:59.037 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
benefit.

28:59.037 --> 29:04.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when I look at what you have
proposed, you have what is
called now the 21:29:01 Trump

29:04.710 --> 29:08.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loophole, because it would so
advantage you and the business
you do.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You've proposed an
approach that has a...

29:10.616 --> 29:13.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Who gave it that name?

29:13.018 --> 29:13.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The first I've... who
gave it that name?

29:13.418 --> 29:15.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:15.153 --> 29:16.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, this is
Secretary Clinton's two minutes.

29:16.021 --> 29:17.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: $4 billion tax
benefit for your family.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when you look at what
you are proposing...

29:18.690 --> 29:19.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: How much?

29:19.825 --> 29:20.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How much for my family?

29:20.792 --> 29:21.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: it is...

29:21.827 --> 29:23.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Lester, how much?

29:23.295 --> 29:23.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: as I said,
trumped-up trickle-down.

29:23.929 --> 29:27.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trickle-down did not work.

29:27.432 --> 29:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It got us into the mess we
were in, in 2008 and 2009.

29:32.170 --> 29:35.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Slashing taxes on the
wealthy hasn't worked.

29:35.140 --> 29:40.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a lot of really smart,
wealthy people know that.

29:40.045 --> 29:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are saying, hey, we
need to do more to make the
contributions we should be
making

29:44.316 --> 29:46.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to rebuild the middle class.

29:46.218 --> 29:49.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: I don't think
top-down works in America.

29:49.888 --> 29:55.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think building the middle
class, investing in the middle
class, making college debt-free

29:55.060 --> 30:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so more young people can get
their education, helping people
refinance their... their debt

30:00.666 --> 30:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from college at a lower rate.

30:03.001 --> 30:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are the kinds of things
that will really boost the
economy.

30:07.039 --> 30:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Broad-based, inclusive growth is
what we need in America, not
more advantages for people

30:12.344 --> 30:13.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the very top.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...

30:16.048 --> 30:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Typical politician.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All talk, no action.

30:20.118 --> 30:22.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sounds good, doesn't work.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Never going to happen.

30:24.956 --> 30:31.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our country is suffering because
people like Secretary Clinton
have made such bad decisions

30:31.430 --> 30:34.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in terms of our jobs and in
terms of what's going on.

30:34.399 --> 30:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, look, we have the worst
revival of an economy since the
Great Depression.

30:40.305 --> 30:43.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And believe me: We're
in a bubble right now.

30:43.408 --> 30:46.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the only thing that looks
good is the stock market, but if
you raise interest rates

30:46.812 --> 30:49.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even a little bit, that's
going to come crashing down.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.717 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We are in a big,
fat, ugly bubble.

30:51.717 --> 30:54.086 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And we better be
awfully careful.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have a Fed that's
doing political things.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This Janet Yellen of the Fed.

31:00.258 --> 31:04.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Fed is doing political... by
keeping the interest rates at
this level.

31:04.896 --> 31:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And believe me: The day Obama
goes off, and he leaves, and
goes out to the golf course

31:09.000 --> 31:13.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the rest of his life to play
golf 21:31:00, when they raise
interest rates, you're going

31:13.038 --> 31:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see some very bad things
happen, because the Fed is not
doing their job.

31:16.374 --> 31:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Fed is being more political
than Secretary Clinton.

31:21.546 --> 31:24.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking
about the burden that Americans
have to pay, yet you have not

31:24.683 --> 31:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
released your tax returns.

31:27.452 --> 31:32.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reason nominees have
released their returns for
decades is so that voters will

31:32.457 --> 31:39.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
know if their potential
president owes money to who he
owes it to and any business
conflicts.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't Americans have a right to
know if there are any conflicts
of interest?

31:41.700 --> 31:43.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: I don't mind releasing
I'm under a routine audit.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it'll be released.

31:45.871 --> 31:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And... as soon as the audit's
finished, it will be released.

31:49.040 --> 31:54.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you will learn more about
Donald Trump by going down to
the federal elections, where

31:54.412 --> 32:01.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I filed a 104-page essentially
financial statement of sorts,
the forms that they have.

32:01.453 --> 32:05.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It shows income... in fact, the
income... I just looked today...
the income is filed at

32:05.724 --> 32:11.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
$694 million for this
past year, $694 million.

32:11.963 --> 32:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you would have told me I was
going to make that 15 or 20
years ago, I would have been

32:13.665 --> 32:15.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very surprised.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's the kind of thinking
that our country needs.

32:18.837 --> 32:25.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we have a country that's
doing so badly, that's being
ripped off by every single
country

32:25.010 --> 32:31.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the world, it's the kind of
thinking that our country needs,
because everybody... Lester,

32:31.750 --> 32:36.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have a trade deficit with all
of the countries that we do
business with, of almost $800
billion

32:36.922 --> 32:38.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a year.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know what that is?

32:40.258 --> 32:43.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means, who's negotiating
these trade deals?

32:43.061 --> 32:46.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have people that are
political hacks negotiating our
trade deals.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: The IRS says an audit...

32:47.199 --> 32:49.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Excuse me.

32:49.534 --> 32:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: of your taxes... you're
perfectly free to release your
taxes during an audit.

32:54.039 --> 32:58.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the question, does the
public's right to know outweigh
your personal...

32:58.176 --> 32:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I told you, I will
release them as soon as the
audit.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, I've been under audit
almost for 15 years.

33:03.315 --> 33:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:33:00 I know a lot of wealthy
people that have never been
audited.

33:06.017 --> 33:07.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I said, do you get audited?

33:07.185 --> 33:09.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I get audited almost every year.

33:09.521 --> 33:10.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And in a way, I should
be complaining.

33:10.889 --> 33:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not even complaining.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't mind it.

33:13.158 --> 33:13.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's almost become
a way of life.

33:13.959 --> 33:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I get audited by the IRS.

33:15.760 --> 33:16.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But other people don't.

33:16.895 --> 33:19.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I will say this.

33:19.631 --> 33:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a situation in this
country that has to be taken
care of.

33:25.170 --> 33:31.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will release my tax returns...
against my lawyer's wishes...
when she releases her 33,000

33:31.176 --> 33:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
e-mails that have been deleted.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
As soon as she releases
them, I will release.

33:36.181 --> 33:37.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

33:37.515 --> 33:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will release my tax returns.

33:40.785 --> 33:42.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's against... my
lawyers, they say, "Don't do
it."

33:42.888 --> 33:44.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will tell you this.

33:44.656 --> 33:50.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No... in fact, watching shows,
they're reading the papers.

33:50.395 --> 33:53.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost every lawyer says, you
don't release your returns until
the audit's complete.

33:53.131 --> 33:54.733 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
When the audit's
complete, I'll do it.

33:54.733 --> 33:57.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I would go against them
if she releases her e-mails.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: So it's negotiable?

33:59.571 --> 34:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: It's not negotiable, no.

34:00.572 --> 34:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let her release the e-mails.

34:01.573 --> 34:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why did she delete 33,000...

34:02.774 --> 34:04.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Well, I'll let
her answer that.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But let me just admonish the
audience one more time.

34:06.311 --> 34:08.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There was an agreement.

34:08.079 --> 34:09.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We did ask you to be silent,
so it would be helpful for us.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton?

34:11.950 --> 34:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I think you've
seen another example of
bait-and-switch here.

34:17.822 --> 34:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For 40 years, everyone running
for president has released their
tax returns.

34:22.193 --> 34:25.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can go and see nearly, I
think, 39, 40 years of our tax
returns, but everyone has

34:25.463 --> 34:28.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done it.

34:28.099 --> 34:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know the IRS has made clear
there is no prohibition on
releasing it when you're under

34:31.937 --> 34:34.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
audit.

34:34.139 --> 34:38.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you've got to ask yourself,
why won't he release his tax
returns?

34:38.343 --> 34:40.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think there may
be a couple of reasons.

34:40.912 --> 34:44.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
First, maybe he's not as
rich as he says he is.

34:44.816 --> 34:49.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Second, maybe he's not as
charitable as he claims to be.

34:49.688 --> 34:55.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Third, we don't know
all of his business dealings,
but we have been told through
investigative

34:55.927 --> 35:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporting that he owes about
$650 million to Wall Street and
foreign banks.

35:03.268 --> 35:08.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or maybe he doesn't want the
American people, all of you
watching tonight, to know that

35:08.239 --> 35:13.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's paid nothing in federal
taxes, because the only years
that anybody's ever seen were

35:13.545 --> 35:18.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a couple of years when he had to
turn them over to state
authorities when he was trying

35:18.183 --> 35:21.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get a casino license, and
they showed he didn't pay any
federal income tax.

35:21.753 --> 35:24.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
21:35:27 TRUMP: That
makes me smart.

35:24.489 --> 35:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: So if he's paid zero,
that means zero for troops, zero
for vets, zero for schools

35:29.627 --> 35:32.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or health.

35:32.931 --> 35:40.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think probably he's not
all that enthusiastic about
having the rest of our country
see what

35:40.705 --> 35:44.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the real reasons are, because it
must be something really
important, even terrible, that
he's

35:44.142 --> 35:46.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trying to hide.

35:46.945 --> 35:50.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the financial disclosure
statements, they don't give you
the tax rate.

35:50.215 --> 35:55.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't give you all the
details that tax returns would.

35:55.286 --> 36:00.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it just seems to me that
this is something that the
American people deserve to see.

36:00.425 --> 36:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have no reason to believe
that he's ever going to release
his tax returns, because

36:05.563 --> 36:06.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's something he's hiding.

36:06.731 --> 36:08.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And we'll guess.

36:08.900 --> 36:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We'll keep guessing at what
it might be that he's hiding.

36:13.304 --> 36:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think the question is,
were he ever to get near the
White House, what would be

36:17.842 --> 36:19.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those conflicts?

36:19.377 --> 36:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who does he owe money to?

36:22.480 --> 36:26.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, he owes you the answers to
that, and he should provide
them.

36:26.651 --> 36:28.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: He also... he also raised
the issue of your e-mails.

36:28.486 --> 36:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you want to respond to that?

36:29.421 --> 36:31.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CLINTON: I do.

36:31.089 --> 36:34.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, I made a mistake
using a private e-mail.

36:34.225 --> 36:36.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: That's for sure.

36:36.494 --> 36:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And if I had to do it
over again, I would, obviously,
do it differently.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I'm not going to
make any excuses.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a mistake, and I take
responsibility for that.

36:44.369 --> 36:45.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HOLT: Mr. Trump?

36:45.837 --> 36:49.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: That was more
than a mistake.

36:49.574 --> 36:50.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was done purposely.

36:50.675 --> 36:51.943 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

36:51.943 --> 36:52.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was not a mistake.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was done purposely.

36:55.146 --> 37:01.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you have your staff taking
the Fifth Amendment, taking the
Fifth so they're not

37:01.653 --> 37:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prosecuted, when you have the
man that set up the illegal
server taking the Fifth, I

37:06.091 --> 37:08.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think it's disgraceful.

37:08.693 --> 37:13.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And believe me, this country
thinks it's really thinks it's
disgraceful, also.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as my tax returns, you
don't learn that much from tax
returns.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That I can tell you.

37:18.002 --> 37:20.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You learn a lot from
financial disclosure.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you should go down
and take a look at that.

37:22.740 --> 37:26.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The other thing, I'm
extremely underleveraged.

37:26.778 --> 37:30.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The report that said $650...
which, by the way, a lot of
friends of mine that know my

37:30.748 --> 37:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business say, boy, that's
really not a lot of money.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not a lot of money
relative to what I had.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The buildings that were in
question, they said in the same
report, which was... actually,

37:39.958 --> 37:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it wasn't even a bad story, to
be honest with you, but the
buildings are worth $3.9
billion.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the $650 isn't even on that.

37:46.397 --> 37:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's not $650.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's much less than that.

37:50.635 --> 37:52.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I could give you a list of
banks, I would if that would
help you, I would give you

37:52.370 --> 37:54.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a list of banks.

37:54.139 --> 37:56.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These are very fine
institutions, very fine banks.

37:56.374 --> 37:57.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I could do that very quickly.

37:57.542 --> 37:58.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I am very underleveraged.

37:58.643 --> 38:00.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have a great company.

38:00.178 --> 38:02.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have a tremendous income.

38:02.380 --> 38:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the reason I say that is
not in a braggadocios way.

38:06.751 --> 38:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's because it's about time
that this country had somebody
running it that has an idea
about

38:11.222 --> 38:14.125 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money.

38:14.125 --> 38:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we have $20 trillion in
debt, and our country's a mess,
you know, it's one thing

38:19.030 --> 38:22.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have $20 trillion in debt and
our roads are good and our
bridges are good and
everything's

38:22.167 --> 38:24.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in great shape, our airports.

38:24.002 --> 38:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
21:38:25 Our airports are like
from a third world country.

38:27.839 --> 38:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You land at LaGuardia, you land
at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you
land at Newark, and you

38:32.911 --> 38:37.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come in from Dubai and Qatar and
you see these incredible... you
come in from China, you

38:37.682 --> 38:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see these incredible airports,
and you land we've become a
third world country.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So the worst of all
things has happened.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We owe $20 trillion,
and we're a mess.

38:47.725 --> 38:50.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We haven't even started.

38:50.795 --> 38:57.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we've spent $6 trillion in
the Middle East, according to a
report that I just saw.

38:57.402 --> 39:01.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether it's 6 or 5, but it
looks like it's 6, $6 trillion
in the Middle East, we could

39:01.339 --> 39:03.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have rebuilt our country twice.

39:03.374 --> 39:05.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's really a shame.

39:05.543 --> 39:09.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's politicians like
Secretary Clinton that have
caused this problem.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.050 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Our country has
tremendous problems.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're a debtor nation.

39:13.484 --> 39:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're a serious debtor nation.

39:16.554 --> 39:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have a country that needs
new roads, new tunnels, new
bridges, new airports, new

39:20.325 --> 39:22.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
schools, new hospitals.

39:22.760 --> 39:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we don't have the money,
because it's been squandered on
so many of your ideas.

39:26.898 --> 39:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: We'll let you respond and
we'll move on to the next
segment.

39:28.967 --> 39:30.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And maybe because you
haven't paid any federal income
tax for a lot of years.

39:30.568 --> 39:32.270 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

39:32.270 --> 39:34.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the other thing I
think is important...

39:34.105 --> 39:36.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: It would be
squandered, too, believe me.

39:36.641 --> 39:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: is if your... if your
main claim to be president of
the United States is your

39:40.845 --> 39:44.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business, then I think we
should talk about that.

39:44.983 --> 39:50.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, your campaign manager
said that you built a lot of
businesses on the backs

39:50.021 --> 39:52.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of little guys.

39:52.390 --> 39:57.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, indeed, I have met a lot of
the people who were stiffed by
you and your businesses,

39:57.128 --> 39:59.731 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Donald.

39:59.731 --> 40:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've met dishwashers, painters,
architects, glass installers,
marble installers, drapery

40:08.406 --> 40:15.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
installers, like my dad was, who
you refused to pay when they
finished the work that you

40:15.113 --> 40:17.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
asked them to do.

40:17.882 --> 40:20.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have an architect in the
audience who designed one of
your clubhouses at one of your
golf

40:20.985 --> 40:23.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
courses.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a beautiful facility.

40:24.589 --> 40:29.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It immediately was put to use.

40:29.193 --> 40:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you wouldn't pay what the
man needed to be paid, what he
was charging you to do...

40:34.632 --> 40:36.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good
job and I was unsatisfied with
his work...

40:36.634 --> 40:37.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, to...

40:37.969 --> 40:39.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Which our country
should do, too.

40:39.971 --> 40:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Do the thousands of
people that you have stiffed
over the course of your business

40:44.876 --> 40:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not deserve some kind of apology
from someone who has taken their
labor, taken the goods

40:52.350 --> 40:55.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they produced, and
then refused to pay them?

40:55.987 --> 40:59.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:40 I can only say that I'm
certainly relieved that my late
father never did business with

40:59.023 --> 41:01.526 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

41:01.526 --> 41:05.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He provided a good middle-class
life for us, but the people he
worked for, he expected

41:05.763 --> 41:09.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the bargain to be
kept on both sides.

41:09.801 --> 41:16.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when we talk about your
business, you've taken business
bankruptcy six times.

41:16.474 --> 41:21.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There are a lot of great
businesspeople that have never
taken bankruptcy once.

41:21.612 --> 41:23.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You call yourself
the King of Debt.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You talk about leverage.

41:26.551 --> 41:31.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You even at one time suggested
that you would try to negotiate
down the national debt of

41:31.556 --> 41:32.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Wrong.

41:33.358 --> 41:35.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Wrong.

41:35.927 --> 41:41.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, sometimes there's
not a direct transfer of skills
from business to government,

41:41.399 --> 41:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but sometimes what happened in
business would be really bad for
government.

41:44.702 --> 41:46.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...

41:46.137 --> 41:48.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: And we need to
be very clear about that.

41:48.373 --> 41:51.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: So, yeah, I think
I do think it's time.

41:51.075 --> 41:51.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Look, it's all words,
it's all sound bites.

41:51.709 --> 41:55.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I built an unbelievable company.

41:55.246 --> 41:58.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the greatest assets
anywhere in the world, real
estate assets anywhere in the

41:58.483 --> 42:01.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world, beyond the United States,
in Europe, lots of different
places.

42:01.586 --> 42:04.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's an unbelievable company.

42:04.655 --> 42:12.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on occasion, four times, we
used certain laws that are
there.

42:12.563 --> 42:18.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when Secretary Clinton talks
about people that didn't get
paid, first of all, they did

42:18.469 --> 42:22.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get paid a lot, but taken
advantage of the laws of the
nation.

42:22.874 --> 42:26.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, if you want to change the
laws, you've been there a long
time, change the laws.

42:26.577 --> 42:31.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I take advantage of the laws
of the nation because I'm
running a company.

42:31.916 --> 42:36.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My obligation right now is to do
well for myself, my family, my
employees, for my companies.

42:36.654 --> 42:39.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's what I do.

42:39.257 --> 42:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what she doesn't say is that
tens of thousands of people that
are unbelievably happy and

42:44.362 --> 42:45.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that love me.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'll give you an example.

42:48.266 --> 42:53.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're just opening up on
Pennsylvania Avenue right next
to the White House, so if I
don't

42:53.471 --> 42:57.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get there one way, I'm going to
get to Pennsylvania Avenue
another.

42:57.708 --> 43:01.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we're opening the
Old Post Office.

43:01.078 --> 43:04.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Under budget, ahead of schedule,
saved tremendous money.

43:04.749 --> 43:07.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm a year ahead of schedule.

43:07.318 --> 43:10.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what this
country should be doing.

43:10.822 --> 43:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We build roads and they cost two
and three and four times what
they're supposed to cost.

43:14.892 --> 43:19.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We buy products for our military
and they come in at costs that
are so far above what

43:19.730 --> 43:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were supposed to be,
because we don't have people
that know what they're doing.

43:23.134 --> 43:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we look at the budget, the
budget is bad to a large extent
because we have people

43:27.472 --> 43:32.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that have no idea as to
what to do and how to buy.

43:32.844 --> 43:37.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump International is way
under budget and way ahead of
schedule.

43:37.715 --> 43:40.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we should be able to
do that for our country.

43:40.985 --> 43:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Well, we're well behind
schedule, so I want to move to
our next segment.

43:44.489 --> 43:46.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We move into our next segment
talking about America's
direction.

43:46.791 --> 43:49.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And let's start by
talking about race.

43:49.427 --> 43:54.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The share of Americans who say
race relations are bad in this
country is the highest it's

43:54.432 --> 43:59.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been in decades, much of it
amplified by shootings of
African-Americans by police, as
we've seen

43:59.003 --> 44:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.

44:02.773 --> 44:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Race has been a big issue in
this campaign, and one of you is
going to have to bridge

44:04.709 --> 44:06.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a very wide and bitter gap.

44:06.944 --> 44:09.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So how do you heal the divide?

44:09.547 --> 44:11.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton, you
get two minutes on this.

44:11.015 --> 44:14.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, you're right.

44:14.218 --> 44:20.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Race remains a significant
challenge in our country.

44:20.958 --> 44:27.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, race still
determines too much, often
determines where people live,
determines

44:27.064 --> 44:31.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what kind of education in their
public schools they can get,
and, yes, it determines how

44:31.269 --> 44:34.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're treated in the
criminal justice system.

44:34.906 --> 44:40.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We've just seen those two tragic
examples in both Tulsa and
Charlotte.

44:40.211 --> 44:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we've got to do several
things at the same time.

44:44.215 --> 44:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to restore trust between
communities and the police.

44:53.291 --> 44:59.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to work to make sure
that our police are using the
best training, the best
techniques,

44:59.530 --> 45:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they're well prepared to
use force only when necessary.

45:07.438 --> 45:13.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone should be respected by
the law, and everyone should
respect the law.

45:13.644 --> 45:17.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Right now, that's not
the case in a lot of our
neighborhoods.

45:17.915 --> 45:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I have, ever since the first
day of my campaign, called for
criminal justice reform.

45:23.321 --> 45:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've laid out a platform that I
think would begin to remedy some
of the problems we have

45:28.259 --> 45:31.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the criminal justice system.

45:31.996 --> 45:36.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we also have to recognize,
in addition to the challenges
that we face with policing,

45:36.934 --> 45:42.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:45:35 there are so many good,
brave police officers who
equally want reform.

45:42.406 --> 45:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have to bring communities
together in order to begin
working on that as a mutual

45:46.611 --> 45:49.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
goal.

45:49.113 --> 45:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we've got to get guns out of
the hands of people who should
not have them.

45:53.985 --> 45:59.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The gun epidemic is the leading
cause of death of young
African-American men, more than

45:59.323 --> 46:02.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the next nine causes
put together.

46:02.493 --> 46:04.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we have to do two
things, as I said.

46:04.629 --> 46:05.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to restore trust.

46:05.963 --> 46:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to work with the police.

46:08.666 --> 46:12.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to make sure they
respect the communities and the
communities respect them.

46:12.837 --> 46:17.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have to tackle the plague
of gun violence, which is a big
contributor to a lot of the

46:17.308 --> 46:18.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
problems that we're
seeing today.

46:18.809 --> 46:19.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: All right, Mr. Trump,
you have two minutes.

46:19.777 --> 46:22.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you heal the divide?

46:22.079 --> 46:26.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, first of all,
Secretary Clinton doesn't want
to use a couple of words, and

46:26.651 --> 46:28.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's law and order.

46:28.753 --> 46:31.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we need law and order.

46:31.155 --> 46:35.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If we don't have it, we're
not going to have a country.

46:35.326 --> 46:40.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I look at what's going
on in Charlotte, a city I love,
a city where I have investments,

46:40.898 --> 46:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I look at what's going on
throughout various parts of our
country, whether it's

46:44.802 --> 46:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I can just keep naming
them all day long... we need law
and order in our country.

46:51.409 --> 46:55.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just got today the, as you
know, the endorsement of the
Fraternal Order of Police, we
just

46:55.813 --> 46:58.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just came in.

46:58.983 --> 47:03.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have endorsements from, I
think, almost every police
group, very... I mean, a large

47:03.354 --> 47:06.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
percentage of them in
the United States.

47:06.957 --> 47:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a situation where we
have our inner cities,
African-Americans, Hispanics are

47:14.065 --> 47:18.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
living in he'll because
it's so dangerous.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You walk down the
street, you get shot.

47:20.805 --> 47:27.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:47:17 In Chicago, they've had
thousands of shootings,
thousands since January 1st.

47:28.212 --> 47:29.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thousands of shootings.

47:29.380 --> 47:31.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm saying, where is this?

47:31.048 --> 47:32.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is this a war-torn country?

47:32.783 --> 47:34.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are we doing?

47:34.418 --> 47:36.387 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And we have to
stop the violence.

47:36.387 --> 47:40.024 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have to bring
back law and order.

47:40.024 --> 47:44.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a place like Chicago, where
thousands of people have been
killed, thousands over the

47:44.562 --> 47:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last number of years, in fact,
almost 4,000 have been killed
since Barack Obama became

47:49.967 --> 47:54.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president, over... almost 4,000
people in Chicago have been
killed.

47:54.939 --> 47:57.942 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have to bring
back law and order.

47:57.942 --> 48:02.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, whether or not in a place
like Chicago you do stop and
frisk, which worked very well,

48:02.246 --> 48:04.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mayor Giuliani is here,
worked very well in New York.

48:04.515 --> 48:07.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It brought the crime
rate way down.

48:07.685 --> 48:10.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you take the gun away from
criminals that shouldn't be
having it.

48:10.588 --> 48:13.824 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We have gangs
roaming the street.

48:13.824 --> 48:16.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in many cases, they're
illegally here, illegal
immigrants.

48:16.827 --> 48:17.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they have guns.

48:17.862 --> 48:19.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they shoot people.

48:19.363 --> 48:20.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we have to be very strong.

48:20.831 --> 48:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we have to be very vigilant.

48:23.267 --> 48:26.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to be... we have
to know what we're doing.

48:26.003 --> 48:30.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, our police, in many
cases, are afraid to do
anything.

48:30.641 --> 48:36.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to protect our inner
cities, because African-American
communities are being decimated

48:36.881 --> 48:38.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by crime, decimated.

48:38.983 --> 48:42.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Your two... your two
minutes expired, but I do want
to follow up.

48:42.353 --> 48:46.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
21:48:38 Stop-and-frisk was
ruled unconstitutional in New
York, because it largely singled
out

48:46.423 --> 48:48.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
black and Hispanic young men.

48:48.225 --> 48:50.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: No, you're wrong.

48:50.628 --> 48:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It went before a judge, who was
a very against-police judge.

48:56.400 --> 48:59.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was taken away from her.

48:59.336 --> 49:02.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our mayor, our new mayor,
refused to go forward with the
case.

49:02.439 --> 49:05.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They would have won an appeal.

49:05.042 --> 49:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at it, throughout
the country, there are many
places where it's allowed.

49:07.845 --> 49:10.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: The argument is that it's
a form of racial profiling.

49:10.447 --> 49:13.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: No, the argument is that
we have to take the guns away
from these people that

49:13.617 --> 49:15.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have them and they are bad
people that shouldn't have them.

49:15.986 --> 49:18.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
These are felons.

49:18.389 --> 49:23.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are people that are bad
people that shouldn't be...
21:49:18 when you have 3,000

49:23.227 --> 49:30.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shootings in Chicago from
January 1st, when you have 4,000
people killed in Chicago by

49:30.601 --> 49:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guns, from the beginning of the
presidency of Barack Obama, his
hometown, you have to

49:36.207 --> 49:37.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have stop-and-frisk.

49:37.241 --> 49:39.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You need more police.

49:39.410 --> 49:43.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You need a better community,
you know, relation.

49:43.781 --> 49:45.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't have good community
relations in Chicago.

49:45.649 --> 49:46.784 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's terrible.

49:46.784 --> 49:48.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have property there.

49:48.385 --> 49:51.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's terrible what's
going on in Chicago.

49:51.222 --> 49:53.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But when you look... and
Chicago's not the only... you go
to Ferguson, you go to so many

49:53.123 --> 49:55.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
different places.

49:55.192 --> 49:57.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You need better relationships.

49:57.094 --> 50:00.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I agree with Secretary
Clinton on this.

50:00.431 --> 50:02.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: You need better
relationships between the
communities and the police,
because in

50:02.466 --> 50:05.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some cases, it's not good.

50:05.769 --> 50:10.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you look at Dallas, where
the relationships were really
studied, the relationships were

50:10.574 --> 50:16.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really a beautiful thing, and
then five police officers were
killed one night very violently.

50:18.515 --> 50:20.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So there's some bad
things going on.

50:20.050 --> 50:21.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Some really bad things.

50:21.151 --> 50:22.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton...

50:22.720 --> 50:25.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: But we need... Lester,
we need law and order.

50:25.389 --> 50:30.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need law and order in the
inner cities, because the people
that are most affected

50:30.728 --> 50:34.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
by what's happening are
African-American and Hispanic
people.

50:34.999 --> 50:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's very unfair to them
what our politicians are
allowing to happen.

50:39.370 --> 50:41.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

50:41.672 --> 50:49.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: 21:50:36 Well, I've
heard... I've heard Donald say
this at his rallies, and

50:49.146 --> 50:55.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's really unfortunate that he
paints such a dire negative
picture of black communities

50:55.319 --> 50:56.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our country.

50:56.320 --> 50:58.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Ugh.

50:58.789 --> 51:03.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: You know, the vibrancy
of the black church, the black
businesses that employ so

51:03.427 --> 51:08.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many people, the opportunities
that so many families are
working to provide for their

51:08.198 --> 51:11.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kids.

51:11.535 --> 51:16.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a lot that we should be
proud of and we should be
supporting and lifting up.

51:16.173 --> 51:20.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we do always have to make
sure we keep people safe.

51:20.711 --> 51:25.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are the right ways of
doing it, and then there are
ways that are ineffective.

51:25.783 --> 51:31.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Stop-and-frisk was found to be
unconstitutional and, in part,
because it was ineffective.

51:31.789 --> 51:34.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It did not do what
it needed to do.

51:34.558 --> 51:37.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, I believe in
community policing.

51:37.194 --> 51:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in fact, violent crime is
one-half of what it was in 1991.

51:42.166 --> 51:45.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Property crime is
down 40 percent.

51:45.669 --> 51:48.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We just don't want to
see it creep back up.

51:48.038 --> 51:53.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We've had 25 years of
very good cooperation.

51:53.978 --> 51:58.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there were some problems,
some unintended consequences.

51:58.949 --> 52:05.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Too many young African-American
and Latino men ended up in jail
for nonviolent offenses.

52:05.823 --> 52:11.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's just a fact that if
you're a young African-American
man and you do the same thing

52:11.395 --> 52:18.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a young white man, you are
more likely to be arrested,
charged, convicted, and
incarcerated.

52:18.569 --> 52:23.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we've got to address the
systemic racism in our criminal
justice system.

52:23.374 --> 52:27.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
21:52:20 We cannot just
say law and order.

52:27.644 --> 52:35.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to say... we have to
come forward with a plan that is
going to divert people

52:35.085 --> 52:39.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the criminal justice
system, deal with mandatory
minimum sentences, which have
put

52:39.723 --> 52:42.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too many people away for too
long for doing too little.

52:42.860 --> 52:46.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need to have more
second chance programs.

52:46.530 --> 52:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm glad that we're ending
private prisons in the federal
system; I want to see them

52:50.100 --> 52:52.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ended in the state system.

52:52.803 --> 52:57.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You shouldn't have a profit
motivation to fill prison cells
with young Americans.

52:57.875 --> 53:01.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So there are some positive
ways we can work on this.

53:01.912 --> 53:09.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I believe strongly that
commonsense gun safety measures
would assist us.

53:09.720 --> 53:14.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Right now... and this is
something Donald has supported,
along with the gun lobby...
right

53:14.391 --> 53:18.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
now, we've got too many
military-style weapons on the
streets.

53:18.062 --> 53:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In a lot of places, our
police are outgunned.

53:22.466 --> 53:27.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need comprehensive background
checks, and we need to keep guns
out of the hands of those

53:27.871 --> 53:30.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who will do harm.

53:30.707 --> 53:35.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we finally need to pass a
prohibition on anyone who's on
the terrorist watch list

53:35.979 --> 53:38.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from being able to buy
a gun in our country.

53:38.982 --> 53:43.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:53:39 If you're too dangerous
to fly, you are too dangerous to
buy a gun.

53:43.087 --> 53:46.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there are things we can do,
and we ought to do it in a
bipartisan way.

53:46.790 --> 53:49.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton, last
week, you said we've got to do
everything possible to improve

53:49.560 --> 53:52.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policing, to go right
at implicit bias.

53:52.596 --> 53:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:53:50 Do you believe that
police are implicitly biased
against black people?

53:56.433 --> 54:01.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Lester, I think
implicit bias is a problem for
everyone, not just police.

54:01.405 --> 54:06.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, unfortunately, too many
of us in our great country jump
to conclusions about

54:06.977 --> 54:09.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
each other.

54:09.947 --> 54:15.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And therefore, I think we need
all of us to be asking hard
questions about, you know,

54:15.252 --> 54:19.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
why am I feeling this way?

54:19.289 --> 54:24.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when it comes to policing,
since it can have literally
fatal consequences, I have

54:24.695 --> 54:30.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, in my first budget, we
would put money into that budget
to help us deal with implicit

54:30.801 --> 54:35.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bias by retraining a lot
of our police officers.

54:35.339 --> 54:39.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've met with a group of very
distinguished, experienced
police chiefs a few weeks ago.

54:39.409 --> 54:40.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They admit it's an issue.

54:40.544 --> 54:43.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They've got a lot of concerns.

54:43.347 --> 54:46.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:54:38 Mental health is one of
the biggest concerns, because
now police are having to

54:46.950 --> 54:51.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
handle a lot of really difficult
mental health problems on the
street.

54:51.221 --> 54:55.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want support, they want
more training, they want more
assistance.

54:55.993 --> 54:59.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think the federal
government could be in a
position where we would offer
and provide

54:59.096 --> 55:00.297 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

55:00.297 --> 55:01.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Mr. Trump...

55:01.632 --> 55:02.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I'd like to
respond to that.

55:02.232 --> 55:04.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HOLT: Please.

55:04.668 --> 55:08.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: First of all, I agree,
and a lot of people even within
my own party want to give

55:08.105 --> 55:11.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certain rights to people on
watch lists and no-fly lists.

55:11.008 --> 55:13.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I agree with you.

55:13.243 --> 55:17.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When a person is on a watch list
or a no-fly list, and I have the
endorsement of the NRA,

55:17.414 --> 55:19.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which I'm very proud of.

55:19.650 --> 55:22.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are very, very good
people, and they're protecting
the Second Amendment.

55:22.686 --> 55:27.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think we have to look very
strongly at no-fly lists and
watch lists.

55:27.824 --> 55:29.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when people are on there,
even if they shouldn't be on
there, we'll help them, we'll

55:29.760 --> 55:32.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help them legally, we'll
help them get off.

55:32.095 --> 55:36.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I tend to agree with
that quite strongly.

55:36.066 --> 55:39.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do want to bring up the fact
that you were the one that
brought up the words 21:55:33

55:39.436 --> 55:43.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
super-predator about
young black youth.

55:43.640 --> 55:47.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a term that I think
was a... it's it's been horribly
met, as you know.

55:47.077 --> 55:49.580 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I think you've
apologized for it.

55:49.580 --> 55:52.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think it was a
terrible thing to say.

55:52.983 --> 55:57.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And when it comes to
stop-and-frisk, you know, you're
talking about takes guns away.

55:57.554 --> 56:01.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I'm talking about taking
guns away from gangs and people
that use them.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think... I really
don't think you disagree with me
on this, if you want

56:03.493 --> 56:05.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to know the truth.

56:05.929 --> 56:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think maybe there's a
political reason why you can't
say it, but I really don't
believe

56:09.566 --> 56:15.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in New York City,
stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200
murders, and stop-and-frisk
brought

56:15.072 --> 56:17.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it down to 500 murders.

56:17.641 --> 56:19.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Five hundred murders
is a lot of murders.

56:19.343 --> 56:22.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's hard to believe, 500 is
like supposed to be good?

56:22.412 --> 56:26.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we went from 2,200 to 500.

56:26.183 --> 56:28.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it was continued
on by Mayor Bloomberg.

56:28.919 --> 56:31.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it was terminated
by current mayor.

56:31.521 --> 56:35.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But stop-and-frisk had a
tremendous impact on the safety
of New York City.

56:35.325 --> 56:37.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tremendous beyond belief.

56:37.327 --> 56:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So when you say it has no
impact, it really did.

56:39.263 --> 56:42.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It had a very, very big impact.

56:42.032 --> 56:46.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, it's also fair to
say, if we're going to talk
about mayors, that under the

56:46.336 --> 56:49.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
current mayor, crime has
continued to drop, including
murders.

56:49.106 --> 56:50.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So there is...

56:50.207 --> 56:51.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: No, you're wrong.

56:51.108 --> 56:52.242 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're wrong.

56:52.242 --> 56:53.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: No, I'm not.

56:53.243 --> 56:54.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Murders are up.

56:54.044 --> 56:55.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right.

56:55.112 --> 56:56.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You check it.

56:56.947 --> 56:58.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: New York... New York
has done an excellent job.

56:58.582 --> 57:02.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I give credit... I give
credit across the board going
back two mayors, two police

57:02.619 --> 57:05.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chiefs, because it has worked.

57:05.622 --> 57:10.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And other communities need to
come together to do what will
work, as well.

57:10.694 --> 57:14.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look, one murder is too many.

57:14.131 --> 57:19.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is important that we
learn about what has been
effective.

57:19.436 --> 57:23.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And not go to things that sound
good that really did not have
the kind of impact that

57:23.573 --> 57:26.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we would want.

57:26.043 --> 57:29.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who disagrees with keeping
neighborhoods safe?

57:29.613 --> 57:36.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's also add, 21:57:30 no
one should disagree about
respecting the rights of young

57:36.153 --> 57:40.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
men who live in those
neighborhoods.

57:40.190 --> 57:46.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we need to do a better
job of working, again, with the
communities, faith communities,

57:46.863 --> 57:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business communities, as well as
the police to try to deal with
this problem.

57:50.133 --> 57:51.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: This conversation
is about race.

57:51.935 --> 57:53.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, Mr. Trump, I have
to ask you for five...

57:53.136 --> 57:54.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I'd like to just
respond, if I might.

57:54.004 --> 57:55.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Please... 20 seconds.

57:55.005 --> 57:57.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I'd just like to respond.

57:57.174 --> 57:58.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: Please respond, then I've
got a quick follow-up for you.

57:58.408 --> 58:00.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: I will.

58:00.577 --> 58:04.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, the African-American
community has been let down by
our politicians.

58:04.715 --> 58:08.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They talk good around election
time, like right now, and after
the election, they said,

58:08.218 --> 58:12.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
see ya later, I'll see
you in four years.

58:12.022 --> 58:15.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The African-American
community... because... Look,
the community within the inner
cities

58:15.826 --> 58:20.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has been so badly treated.

58:20.197 --> 58:24.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They've been abused and used in
order to get votes by Democrat
politicians, because that's

58:24.434 --> 58:26.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what it is.

58:26.169 --> 58:27.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They've controlled these
communities for up to 100 years.

58:27.971 --> 58:29.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...

58:29.172 --> 58:30.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

58:30.640 --> 58:31.441 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: Well,
I... I do think...

58:31.441 --> 58:33.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: And I will tell you,

58:33.443 --> 58:34.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Nobody knows the
system better than me. I alone
can fix it.

58:34.811 --> 58:34.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I'm
going to close my campaign
focused on opportunities for
kids

58:34.411 --> 58:36.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and fairness for families.

58:36.713 --> 58:37.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Hillary failed on
the economy. Everything she
touched didn't work out,
nothing.

58:37.614 --> 58:37.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Even if
you're totally opposed to Donald
Trump, you may still have

58:37.314 --> 58:38.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some questions about me.

58:38.882 --> 58:39.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.
I'm Judy Woodruff.

58:39.449 --> 58:41.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

58:41.952 --> 58:42.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Welcome to this "PBS NewsHour"
special coverage of the first
debate between the two
major-party

58:42.018 --> 58:43.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential candidates, Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump.

58:43.653 --> 58:44.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The stage is set at Hofstra
University on Long Island, New
York. With the election 43

58:44.287 --> 58:45.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days away the race tightening, a
lot is on the line tonight,
Judy.

58:45.522 --> 58:45.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It certainly is,
Gwen, and given that this is the
first time these two

58:45.622 --> 58:46.790 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
have faced each
other one on one.

58:46.790 --> 58:48.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lester Holt of NBC News
will be moderating.

58:48.658 --> 58:49.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining us at the table are our
regular contributors, syndicated
columnist Mark Shields, New York

58:49.559 --> 58:49.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Times columnist David Brooks,
and from The Cook Political
Report, Amy Walter.

58:49.926 --> 58:50.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We welcome all you have here
for the next two hours.

58:50.427 --> 58:51.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Amy, let's start with you.

58:51.428 --> 58:53.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you looking for?

58:53.597 --> 58:54.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Each of these candidates
has an enthusiasm gap

58:54.564 --> 58:55.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problem within their own party.
So, they have got to get their
partisans fired up.

58:55.599 --> 58:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For Hillary Clinton, it's young
people. For Donald Trump, he's
got to get those white

58:56.700 --> 58:57.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college-educated voters back
into the Republican fold, where
they have been. And then they

58:57.734 --> 58:57.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have got to get those voters,
both of them, who are torn,
don't like either choice they

58:57.667 --> 59:00.003 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
have in front of
them, to pick them.

59:00.003 --> 58:59.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mark Shields, what
would you... surprise you the
most of what these candidates
might

58:59.336 --> 59:01.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or might not do tonight?

59:01.638 --> 59:02.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Does Donald Trump
dare to be boring? Does he come
out sedated/presidential?

59:02.572 --> 59:02.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And can Hillary Clinton, who is
a marvelous and superior
deliverer of information, make

59:02.839 --> 59:04.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an emotional connection
with American voters?

59:04.441 --> 59:05.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, what are
you on the edge of your seat
looking for?

59:05.675 --> 59:05.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: We have been
around each other too long. I
wrote down emotional connection.

59:05.175 --> 59:06.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

59:06.376 --> 59:07.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Did you?

59:07.878 --> 59:09.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: This is
not a cognitive night.

59:09.679 --> 59:10.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not philosophy. This is
not grand strategy. It's moment
of intimacy, that unscripted

59:10.614 --> 59:10.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moment when the unconscious is
revealed that will be replayed
on YouTube over and over

59:10.213 --> 59:12.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and over again.

59:12.582 --> 59:13.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so it's just, is he
commanding or is he cruel? Is
she relatable and does she seem

59:13.583 --> 59:13.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calmly smart? And it's whether
people get that vibe, the first
they vibe, that will

59:13.350 --> 59:15.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
determine the night.

59:15.085 --> 59:16.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is this about what
they know or who they are?

59:16.086 --> 59:17.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, I think it's
mostly about who they are.

59:17.654 --> 59:18.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For voters at this stage of the
game, they are looking up on
that dais to see who they

59:18.789 --> 59:18.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can spend the next four years
with, who they want to invite
into their homes moment after

59:18.088 --> 59:20.123 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
moment.

59:20.123 --> 59:20.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many voters say, I don't want
either one of them in there.

59:20.457 --> 59:21.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A lot of them.

59:21.825 --> 59:23.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: A lot of
voters are saying that.

59:23.727 --> 59:23.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is the one maybe that
they're not going to like, but
they will feel comfortable

59:23.093 --> 59:25.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enough.

59:25.695 --> 59:26.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Mark, people
are going to be fact-checking
this debate. They're going

59:26.596 --> 59:26.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be raising questions about
whether what either one of them
said was correct or not.

59:26.797 --> 59:28.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No,
you're right, Judy.

59:28.131 --> 59:28.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if it's what they know,
it will be a short evening...

59:28.198 --> 59:30.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

59:30.600 --> 59:31.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: for the Republican
nominee, whose knowledge bank
has been overdrawn.

59:31.768 --> 59:32.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's about, more
than anything else, each case,
what does he know, his command

59:32.736 --> 59:32.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it, is he comfortable with
it, and who she is. And I think
that is really the question.

59:32.836 --> 59:33.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: And there
is the gender politics.

59:33.236 --> 59:34.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

59:34.938 --> 59:35.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, we're turning now to
Lester Holt of NBC News.

59:35.238 --> 59:37.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRANSCRIPT START

59:37.741 --> 59:38.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Good evening from Hofstra
University in Hempstead, New
York. I'm Lester Holt, anchor

59:38.442 --> 59:39.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of "NBC Nightly News." I want to
welcome you to the first
presidential debate.

59:39.743 --> 59:40.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The participants tonight are
Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton. This debate is
sponsored

59:40.777 --> 59:41.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by the Commission on
Presidential Debates, a
nonpartisan, nonprofit
organization. The

59:41.711 --> 59:42.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commission drafted tonight's
format, and the rules have been
agreed to by the campaigns.

59:42.913 --> 59:43.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 90-minute debate is divided
into six segments, each 15
minutes long. We'll explore
three

59:43.647 --> 59:44.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
topic areas tonight: Achieving
prosperity; America's direction;
and securing America.

59:44.681 --> 59:45.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the start of each segment, I
will ask the same lead-off
question to both candidates,

59:45.615 --> 59:45.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they will each have up to
two minutes to respond. From
that point until the end

59:45.882 --> 59:47.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the segment, we'll
have an open discussion.

59:47.584 --> 59:48.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The questions are mine and have
not been shared with the
commission or the campaigns. The

59:48.919 --> 59:48.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
audience here in the room has
agreed to remain silent so that
we can focus on what the
candidates

59:48.251 --> 59:50.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are saying.

59:50.654 --> 59:51.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will invite you to applaud,
however, at this moment, as we
welcome the candidates:

59:51.755 --> 59:51.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic nominee for president
of the United States, Hillary
Clinton, and Republican nominee

59:51.988 --> 59:52.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for president of the United
States, Donald J. Trump.

59:52.222 --> 59:53.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

59:53.557 --> 59:54.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: How are you, Donald?

59:54.224 --> 59:55.392 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

59:55.392 --> 59:56.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Good luck to you.

59:56.226 --> 59:58.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

59:58.728 --> 59:59.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I don't expect us to cover
all the issues of this campaign
tonight, but I remind everyone,

59:59.763 --> 01:00:00.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are two more presidential
debates scheduled. We are going
to focus on many of the issues

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:01.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that voters tell us are most
important, and we're going to
press for specifics. I am
honored

01:00:01.798 --> 01:00:01.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have this role, but this
evening belongs to the
candidates and, just as
important,

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:03.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the American people.

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:04.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Candidates, we look forward to
hearing you articulate your
policies and your positions,

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as well as your visions and
your values. So, let's begin.

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:06.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're calling this opening
segment "Achieving Prosperity."
And central to that is jobs.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:07.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are two economic realities
in America today. There's been a
record six straight

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:08.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years of job growth, and new
census numbers show incomes have
increased at a record rate

01:00:08.672 --> 01:00:09.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after years of stagnation.
However, income inequality
remains significant, and nearly

01:00:09.039 --> 01:00:10.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
half of Americans are living
paycheck to paycheck.

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:11.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beginning with you, Secretary
Clinton, why are you a better
choice than your opponent

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:12.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to create the kinds of jobs that
will put more money into the
pockets of American works?

01:00:12.476 --> 01:00:13.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, thank you,
Lester, and thanks to Hofstra
for hosting us.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:14.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The central question in this
election is really what kind of
country we want to be and what

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:15.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of future we'll build
together. Today is my
granddaughter's second birthday,
so

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:16.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think about this a lot. First,
we have to build an economy that
works for everyone,

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just those at the top. That
means we need new jobs, good
jobs, with rising incomes.

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:18.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want us to invest in you. I
want us to invest in your
future. That means jobs in
infrastructure,

01:00:18.915 --> 01:00:19.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in advanced manufacturing,
innovation and technology,
clean, renewable energy, and
small

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:20.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business, because most of the
new jobs will come from small
business. We also have to

01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:21.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make the economy fairer. That
starts with raising the national
minimum wage and also

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:22.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guarantee, finally, equal
pay for women's work.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I also want to see more
companies do profit-sharing. If
you help create the

01:00:23.687 --> 01:00:24.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
profits, you should be able to
share in them, not just the
executives at the top.

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:25.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want us to do more to
support people who are
struggling to balance family and
work.

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:26.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I've heard from so many of you
about the difficult choices you
face and the stresses that
you're

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:26.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under. So let's have paid family
leave, earned sick days. Let's
be sure we have affordable

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:28.658 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
child care and
debt-free college.

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:28.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How are we going to do it? We're
going to do it by having the
wealthy pay their fair

01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:30.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
share and close the
corporate loopholes.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, we tonight are on the
stage together, Donald Trump and
I. Donald, it's good to be

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:32.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with you. We're going to have a
debate where we are talking
about the important issues

01:00:32.863 --> 01:00:33.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facing our country. You have to
judge us, who can shoulder the
immense, awesome
responsibilities

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:34.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the presidency, who can put
into action the plans that will
make your life better.

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:34.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hope that I will be able to
earn your vote on November 8th.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:36.633 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
HOLT: Secretary
Clinton, thank you.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:37.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump, the same question to
you. It's about putting money...
more money into the

01:00:37.167 --> 01:00:38.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pockets of American workers.
You have up to two minutes.

01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:39.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: 21:08:32 Thank you,
Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the
country. They're going to

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:40.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mexico. They're going to many
other countries. You look at
what China is doing to our
country

01:00:40.837 --> 01:00:41.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of making our product.
They're devaluing their
currency, and there's nobody in
our

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:42.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government to fight them. And we
have a very good fight. And we
have a winning fight. Because

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:42.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're using our country as a
piggy bank to rebuild China, and
many other countries

01:00:42.539 --> 01:00:44.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are doing the same thing.

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:45.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're losing our good jobs,
so many of them. When you look
at what's happening in

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mexico, a friend of mine who
builds plants said it's the
eighth wonder of the world.

01:00:47.043 --> 01:00:47.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're building some of the
biggest plants anywhere in the
world, some of the most
sophisticated,

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:48.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the best plants. With
the United States, as he said,
not so much.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:49.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So Ford is leaving. You see
that, their small car division
leaving. Thousands of jobs
leaving

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:50.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michigan, leaving Ohio. They're
all leaving. And we can't allow
it to happen anymore. As

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far as child care is concerned
and so many other things, I
think Hillary and I agree

01:00:51.781 --> 01:00:52.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on that. We probably disagree a
little bit as to numbers and
amounts and what we're going

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:53.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do, but perhaps we'll be
talking about that later.

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:54.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have to stop our jobs
from being stolen from us. We
have to stop our companies from

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:55.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaving the United States and,
with it, firing all of their
people. All you have to do is

01:00:55.785 --> 01:00:56.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take a look at Carrier air
conditioning in Indianapolis.
They left... fired 1,400 people.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:57.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to Mexico. So many
hundreds and hundreds of
companies are doing this.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:58.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: We cannot let it happen.
Under my plan, I'll be reducing
taxes tremendously, from

01:00:58.855 --> 01:00:59.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
35 percent to 15 percent for
companies, small and big
businesses. That's going to be a
job

01:00:59.656 --> 01:00:59.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
creator like we haven't seen
since Ronald Reagan. It's going
to be a beautiful thing

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:01.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to watch.

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:02.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Companies will come. They will
build. They will expand. New
companies will start. And

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:03.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I look very, very much forward
to doing it. We have to
renegotiate our trade deals, and

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have to stop these countries
from stealing our companies and
our jobs.

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:05.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton,
would you like to respond?

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:06.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I think that
trade is an important issue. Of
course, we are 5 percent of the

01:01:06.696 --> 01:01:06.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world's population; we have to
trade with the other 95 percent.
And we need to have

01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:08.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
smart, fair trade deals.

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also, though, need to have a
tax system that rewards work and
not just financial transactions.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:10.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the kind of plan that Donald
has put forth would be
trickle-down economics all over
again.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:11.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it would be the most
extreme version, the biggest tax
cuts for the top percent of

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:12.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the people in this country
than we've ever had.

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:12.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I call it trumped-up
trickle-down, because that's
exactly what it would be. That
is not

01:01:12.469 --> 01:01:14.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how we grow the economy.

01:01:14.738 --> 01:01:15.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just have a different view
about what's best for growing
the economy, how we make

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:16.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investments that will actually
produce jobs and rising incomes.

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:17.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we come at it from
somewhat different perspectives.
I understand that. You know,

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:18.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald was very fortunate in his
life, and that's all to his
benefit. He started his

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:19.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business with $14 million,
borrowed from his father, and he
really believes that the more

01:01:19.843 --> 01:01:19.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you help wealthy people, the
better off we'll be and that
everything will work out from

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:22.012 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:22.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't buy that. I have a
different experience. My father
was a small-businessman. He
worked

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:23.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really hard. He printed drapery
fabrics on long tables, where he
pulled out those fabrics

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:23.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and he went down with a
silkscreen and dumped the paint
in and took the squeegee and
kept

01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:25.882 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:26.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what I believe is the
more we can do for the middle
class, the more we can invest

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:27.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in you, your education, your
skills, your future, the better
we will be off and the

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:28.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better we'll grow. That's the
kind of economy I want us to see
again. 21:12:21

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:29.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Let me follow up with Mr.
Trump, if you can. You've talked
about creating 25 million

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs, and you've promised to
bring back millions of jobs for
Americans. How are you going to

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:31.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring back the industries that
have left this country for
cheaper labor overseas? How,
specifically,

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:32.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are you going to tell American
manufacturers that you have to
come back?

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:33.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, for one thing...
and before we start on that...
my father gave me a very

01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:34.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
small loan in 1975, and I built
it into a company that's worth
many, many billions of

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:35.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dollars, with some of the
greatest assets in the world,
and I say that only because

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's the kind of thinking
that our country needs.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:38.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our country's in deep trouble.
We don't know what we're doing
when it comes to devaluations

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:38.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and all of these countries all
over the world, especially
China. They're the best, the
best

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:39.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ever at it. What they're doing
to us is a very, very sad thing.

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:40.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have to do that. We have
to renegotiate our trade deals.
And, Lester, they're taking

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:41.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
our jobs, they're giving
incentives, they're doing things
that, frankly, we don't do.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:43.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me give you the example of
Mexico. They have a VAT tax.
We're on a different system.

01:01:43.199 --> 01:01:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we sell into Mexico,
there's a tax. When they sell
in... automatic, 16 percent,
approximately.

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:44.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When they sell into us, there's
no tax. It's a defective
agreement. It's been defective

01:01:44.668 --> 01:01:45.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a long time, many years, but
the politicians haven't done
anything about it.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:45.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, in all fairness to
Secretary Clinton yes, is that
OK? Good. I want you to be

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very happy. It's very
important to me.

01:01:47.771 --> 01:01:48.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in all fairness to Secretary
Clinton, when she started
talking about this, it was

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:49.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really very recently. She's been
doing this for 30 years. And why
hasn't she made the

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:50.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreements better? The NAFTA
agreement is defective. Just
because of the tax and many

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:51.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other reasons, but just
because of the fact...

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:52.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Let me interrupt
just a moment, but...

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:53.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Secretary Clinton and
others, politicians, should have
been doing this for years, not

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:55.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now, because of the fact
that we've created a movement.
They should have been

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:55.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing this for years. What's
happened to our jobs and our
country and our economy
generally

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:56.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is... look, we owe $20 trillion.
We cannot do it any longer,
Lester.

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:57.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: 21:14:28 Back to the
question, though. How do you
bring back... specifically bring

01:01:57.714 --> 01:01:58.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
back jobs, American
manufacturers? How do you make
them bring the jobs back?

01:01:58.815 --> 01:01:59.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, the first thing you
do is don't let the jobs leave.
The companies are leaving.

01:01:59.816 --> 01:01:59.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I could name, I mean, there are
thousands of them. They're
leaving, and they're leaving

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:01.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in bigger numbers than ever.

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:02.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what you do is you say,
fine, you want to go to Mexico
or some other country, good

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:03.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
luck. We wish you a lot of luck.
But if you think you're going to
make your air conditioners

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:03.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or your cars or your cookies or
whatever you make and bring them
into our country without

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a tax, you're wrong.

01:02:05.755 --> 01:02:07.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once you say you're going to
have to tax them coming in, and
our politicians never

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:07.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do this, because they have
special interests and the
special interests want those
companies

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:08.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to leave, because in many cases,
they own the companies. So what
I'm saying is, we can

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:09.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stop them from leaving. We have
to stop them from leaving. And
that's a big, big factor.

01:02:09.092 --> 01:02:10.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: Let me let Secretary
Clinton get in here.

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:11.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: 21:15:19 Well, let's
stop for a second and remember
where we were eight years ago.

01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:12.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had the worst financial
crisis, the Great Recession, the
worst since the 1930s. That

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:13.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was in large part because of tax
policies that slashed taxes on
the wealthy, failed

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:13.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to invest in the middle class,
took their eyes off of Wall
Street, and created a perfect

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:15.899 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
storm.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, Donald was one of the
people who rooted for the
housing crisis. He said, back

01:02:16.933 --> 01:02:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does
collapse, because then I can go
in and buy some and make some

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:18.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money." Well, it did collapse.

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:19.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: 21:16:02 That's
called business, by the way.

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:20.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Nine million people...
nine million people lost their
jobs. Five million people

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:21.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lost their homes. And $13
trillion in family wealth was
wiped out.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:22.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, we have come back from that
abyss. And it has not been easy.
So we're now on the

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:23.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
precipice of having a
potentially much better economy,
but the last thing we need to do

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:24.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to go back to the policies
that failed us in the first
place.

01:02:24.841 --> 01:02:25.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Independent experts have looked
at what I've proposed and looked
at what Donald's proposed,

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:26.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and basically they've said this,
that if his tax plan, which
would blow up the debt by

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:27.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over $5 trillion and would in
some instances disadvantage
middle-class families compared

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:27.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the wealthy, were to go into
effect, we would lose 3.5
million jobs and maybe have

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
another recession.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:30.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They've looked at my plans and
they've said, OK, if we can do
this, and I intend to get

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:31.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it done, we will have 10 million
more new jobs, because we will
be making investments

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:33.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where we can grow the economy.
Take clean energy. Some country
is going to be the clean-

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:32.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energy superpower of the 21st
century. Donald thinks that
climate change is a hoax
perpetrated

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:34.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by the Chinese. I
think it's real.

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:34.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: I did not. I did not.
I do not say that.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:35.652 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: I think
science is real.

01:02:35.652 --> 01:02:37.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I do not say that.

01:02:37.887 --> 01:02:38.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And I think it's
important that we grip this and
deal with it, both at home and

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:40.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abroad. And here's what we can
do. We can deploy a half a
billion more solar panels.

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:40.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can have enough clean energy
to power every home. We can
build a new modern electric
grid.

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:41.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a lot of jobs; that's a
lot of new economic activity.

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:42.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So I've tried to be very
specific about what we can and
should do, and I am determined

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:43.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we're going to get the
economy really moving again,
building on the progress we've

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:43.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made over the last eight years,
but never going back to what got
us in trouble in the

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first place.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HOLT: Mr. Trump?

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:47.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: She talks about solar
panels. We invested in a solar
company, our country. That was

01:02:47.197 --> 01:02:48.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a disaster. They lost plenty
of money on that one.

01:02:48.932 --> 01:02:49.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, look, I'm a great believer
in all forms of energy, but
we're putting a lot of people

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of work. Our energy policies
are a disaster. Our country is
losing so much in terms of

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
energy, in terms of paying off
our debt. You can't do what
you're looking to do with $20

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trillion in debt.

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:53.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Obama administration, from
the time they've come in, is
over 230 years' worth of debt,

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:53.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he's topped it. He's doubled
it in a course of almost eight
years, seven-and-a-half years,

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:55.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be semi-exact.

01:02:55.905 --> 01:02:57.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I will tell you this. We have
to do a much better job at
keeping our jobs. And we have

01:02:57.073 --> 01:02:56.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do a much better job at
giving companies incentives to
build new companies or to
expand,

01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because they're not doing it.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:02:59.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:18:59 And all you have to do
is look at Michigan and look at
Ohio and look at all

01:02:59.909 --> 01:02:59.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of these places where so many of
their jobs and their companies
are just leaving, they're

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:01.845 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gone.

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:02.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Hillary, I'd just ask you
this. You've been doing this for
30 years. Why are you

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:03.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just thinking about these
solutions right now? For 30
years, you've been doing it, and

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:03.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
now you're just starting
to think of solutions.

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, actually...

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:06.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I will bring... excuse
me. I will bring back jobs. You
can't bring back jobs.

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:06.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, actually, I have
thought about this quite a bit.

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:08.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.

01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:09.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And I have... well, not
quite that long. I think my
husband did a pretty good

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:09.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job in the 1990s. I think a lot
about what worked and how we can
make it work again...

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:10.453 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: Well, he
approved NAFTA...

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:13.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: million new
jobs, a balanced budget...

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: He approved NAFTA, which
is the single worst trade deal
ever approved in this country.

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:14.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Incomes went up for
everybody. Manufacturing jobs
went up also in the 1990s, if
we're actually

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to look at the facts.

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:17.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was in the Senate, I had
a number of trade deals that
came before me, and I held

01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:19.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them all to the same test. Will
they create jobs in America?
Will they raise incomes in

01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America? And are they good for
our national security? Some of
them I voted for. The biggest

01:03:19.863 --> 01:03:20.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one, a multinational one known
as CAFTA, I voted against. And
because I hold the same

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:21.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
standards as I look at all
of these trade deals.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's not assume that trade
is the only challenge we have in
the economy. I think

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is a part of it, and I've
said what I'm going to do. I'm
going to have a special
prosecutor.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to enforce the trade
deals we have, and we're going
to hold people accountable.

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:25.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was secretary of state,
we actually increased American
exports globally 30 percent.

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:26.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We increased them to China 50
percent. So I know how to really
work to get new jobs

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:26.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to get exports that helped
to create more new jobs.

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Very quickly...

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:29.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: But you haven't done it
in 30 years or 26 years or any
number you want to...

01:03:29.072 --> 01:03:30.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, I've been
a senator, Donald...

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:31.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: You haven't done it.
You haven't done it.

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:31.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: And I have been
a secretary of state...

01:03:31.574 --> 01:03:32.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Excuse me.

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:34.911 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: And I
have done a lot...

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:34.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Your husband signed
NAFTA, which was one of the
worst things that ever happened

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:36.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the manufacturing industry.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:38.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, that's your
opinion. That is your opinion.

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: You go to New England,
you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania,
you go anywhere you want,
Secretary

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:40.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, and you will see
devastation where manufacture is
down 30, 40, sometimes 50
percent.

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:39.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAFTA is the worst trade deal
maybe ever signed anywhere, but
certainly ever signed in this

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:41.851 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:42.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now you want to approve
Trans-Pacific Partnership. You
were totally in favor of

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:43.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it. Then you heard what I was
saying, how bad it is, and you
said, I can't win that

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:44.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate. But you know that if you
did win, you would approve that,
and that will be almost

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:45.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as bad as NAFTA. Nothing
will ever top NAFTA.

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:46.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, that is just not
accurate. I was against it once
it was finally negotiated

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:47.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the terms were laid out.
I wrote about that in...

01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:47.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: You called it
the gold standard.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:49.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: You called it the gold
standard of trade deals. You
said it's the finest deal

01:03:49.592 --> 01:03:50.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you've ever seen.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.962 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CLINTON: No.

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:53.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And then you heard what I
said about it, and all of a
sudden you were against it.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:55.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know
you live in your own reality,
but that is not the facts.

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:54.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The facts are... I did say I
hoped it would be a good deal,
but when it was negotiated...

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Not.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLINTON: which I was not
responsible for, I concluded it
wasn't. I wrote about that

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:58.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in my book...

01:03:58.101 --> 01:03:58.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: So is it President
Obama's fault?

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:00.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: before you
even announced.

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Is it President
Obama's fault?

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Look, there
are differences...

01:04:02.105 --> 01:04:02.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Secretary, is it
President Obama's fault?

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:03.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: There are...

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:06.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Because he's pushing it.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:06.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: There are different
views about what's good for our
country, our economy, and our

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:07.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leadership in the world. And I
think it's important to look at
what we need to do to

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:08.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get the economy going again.
That's why I said new jobs with
rising incomes, investments,

01:04:08.378 --> 01:04:08.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not in more tax cuts that would
add $5 trillion to the debt.

01:04:08.778 --> 01:04:09.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: But you have no plan.

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:11.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: But in... oh, but I do.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:12.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Secretary,
you have no plan.

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:13.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: In fact, I have written
a book about it. It's called
"Stronger Together." You can

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pick it up tomorrow
at a bookstore...

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:14.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: That's about
all you've...

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:17.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Folks, we're going to...

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:17.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: or at an
airport near you.

01:04:17.787 --> 01:04:20.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: We're going to move to...

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:20.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: But it's because I see
this... we need to have strong
growth, fair growth, sustained

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:20.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growth. We also have to look at
how we help families balance the
responsibilities at home

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the responsibilities
at business.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:23.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have a very robust set of
plans. And people have looked at
both of our plans, have

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:24.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concluded that mine would create
10 million jobs and yours would
lose us 3.5 million jobs,

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:25.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and explode the debt which
would have a recession.

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:26.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: You are going to approve
one of the biggest tax cuts in
history. 21:23:20 You

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:28.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are going to approve one of the
biggest tax increases in
history. You are going to drive

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:27.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business out. Your regulations
are a disaster, and you're going
to increase regulations all

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over the place.

01:04:29.933 --> 01:04:31.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by the way, my tax cut is
the biggest since Ronald Reagan.
I'm very proud of it.

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:30.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will create tremendous
numbers of new jobs. But
regulations, you are going to
regulate

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:33.036 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
these businesses
out of existence.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:33.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I go around... Lester, I
tell you this, I've been all
over. And when I go around,

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:34.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
despite the tax cut, the
thing... the things that
business as in people like the
most is

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:36.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fact that I'm cutting
regulation. You have regulations
on top of regulations, and

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:36.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new companies cannot form and
old companies are going out of
business. And you want to

01:04:36.239 --> 01:04:37.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
increase the regulations
and make them even worse.

01:04:37.774 --> 01:04:38.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to cut regulations.
I'm going to cut taxes big, and
you're going to

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.943 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
raise taxes big
league, end of story.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:40.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Let me get you to pause
right there, because we're going
to move into... we're

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:41.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to move into the next
segment. We're going to talk
taxes...

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:42.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: That can't... that
can't be left to stand.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:43.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Please just take 30
seconds and then we're going to
go on.

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:43.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I kind of assumed that
there would be a lot of these
charges and claims, and

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:44.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so...

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Facts.

01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:48.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: So we have taken the
home page of my website,
HillaryClinton.com, and we've

01:04:48.184 --> 01:04:48.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turned it into a fact-checker.
So if you want to see in
real-time what the facts are,
please

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:49.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go and take a look. Because
what I have proposed...

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: And take a look at
mine, also, and you'll see.

01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:51.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: would not add a penny
to the debt, and your plans
would add $5 trillion

01:04:51.955 --> 01:04:52.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to the debt. What I have
proposed would cut regulations
and streamline them for small

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:54.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
businesses. What I have proposed
would be paid for by raising
taxes on the wealthy,

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:54.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they have made all the
gains in the economy. And I
think it's time that the wealthy

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:55.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and corporations paid their fair
share to support this country.

01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:56.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Well, you just
opened the next segment.

01:04:56.292 --> 01:04:56.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, could I just
finish... I think I...

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:04:58.328 --> 01:04:59.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: I'm going to give you
a chance right here...

01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:00.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I think I should... you
go to her website, and you take
a look at her website.

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.297 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
HOLT: with a new
15-minute segment...

01:05:01.297 --> 01:05:01.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: She's going to raise
taxes $1.3 trillion.

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:04.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, I'm going to...

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:05.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: And look at her website.
You know what? It's no
difference than this. She's
telling

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:05.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us how to fight ISIS. Just go to
her website. She tells you how
to fight ISIS on her website.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:06.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think General Douglas
MacArthur would like that too
much.

01:05:06.169 --> 01:05:07.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: The next segment,
we're continuing...

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, at least I
have a plan to fight ISIS.

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:09.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: achieving prosperity...

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:10.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: No, no, you're telling
the enemy everything you want to
do.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: No, we're
not. No, we're not.

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:12.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: See, you're telling the
enemy everything you want to do.
No wonder you've been fighting

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:13.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no wonder you've been fighting
ISIS your entire adult life.

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: That's a... that's...
go to the please, fact checkers,
get to work.

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:16.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: OK, you are unpacking a
lot here. And we're still on the
issue of achieving prosperity.

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:15.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I want to talk about taxes.
The fundamental difference
between the two of you concerns

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the wealthy.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:18.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, you're
calling for a tax increase on
the wealthiest Americans. I'd

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:19.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like you to further defend that.
And, Mr. Trump, you're calling
for tax cuts for the

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:19.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wealthy. I'd like you to defend
that. And this next two-minute
answer goes to you, Mr.

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:21.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:23.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I'm really calling
for major jobs, because the
wealthy are going create

01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:22.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tremendous jobs. They're going
to expand their companies.
They're going to do a tremendous

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:25.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:25.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm getting rid of the carried
interest provision. And if you
really look, it's not a tax...
it's

01:05:25.955 --> 01:05:26.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really not a great thing for the
wealthy. It's a great thing for
the middle class. It's

01:05:26.156 --> 01:05:28.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a great thing for
companies to expand.

01:05:28.057 --> 01:05:28.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when these people are going
to put billions and billions of
dollars into companies, and

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they're going to bring $2.5
trillion back from overseas,
where they can't bring

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:31.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the money back, because
politicians like Secretary
Clinton won't allow them to
bring the money

01:05:31.094 --> 01:05:30.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back, because the taxes are so
onerous, and the bureaucratic
red tape, so what... is so

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bad.

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:33.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what they're doing is they're
leaving our country, and
they're, believe it or not,
leaving

01:05:33.997 --> 01:05:34.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because taxes are too high and
because some of them have lots
of money outside of our

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:35.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country. And instead of bringing
it back and putting the money to
work, because they can't

01:05:35.832 --> 01:05:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work out a deal to... and
everybody agrees it should be
brought back.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of that, they're leaving
our country to get their money,
because they can't bring

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:38.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their money back into our
country, because of bureaucratic
red tape, because they can't

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:39.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get together. Because we have...
we have a president that can't
sit them around a table

01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:41.304 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
and get them to
approve something.

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:42.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And here's the thing.
Republicans and Democrats agree
that this should be done, $2.5
trillion.

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:43.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I happen to think it's double
that. It's probably $5 trillion
that we can't bring into our
country,

01:05:43.006 --> 01:05:44.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lester. And with a little
leadership, you'd get it in here
very quickly, and it could

01:05:44.007 --> 01:05:45.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be put to use on the inner
cities and lots of other things,
and it would be beautiful.

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:46.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have no leadership. And
honestly, that starts with
Secretary Clinton. 21:28:01

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: All right. You have two
minutes of the same question to
defend tax increases on the

01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:48.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wealthiest Americans,
Secretary Clinton.

01:05:48.011 --> 01:05:47.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I have a feeling that
by, the end of this evening, I'm
going to be blamed for

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:48.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
everything that's ever happened.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:49.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Why not?

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:50.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Why not? Yeah, why not?

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:52.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, just join the debate
by saying more crazy things.
Now, let me say this, it is

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
absolutely the case...

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:54.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: There's nothing crazy
about not letting our companies
bring their money back into

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:56.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their country.

01:05:56.553 --> 01:05:56.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HOLT: This is... this is
Secretary Clinton's two minutes,
please.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:59.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Yes.

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:00.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Yeah, well, let's start
the clock again, Lester. We've
looked at your tax proposals.

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:01.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't see changes in the
corporate tax rates or the kinds
of proposals you're referring

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:00.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to that would cause the
repatriation, bringing back of
money that's stranded overseas.
I

01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:01.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happen to support that.

01:06:01.891 --> 01:06:04.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Then you didn't read it.

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:04.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I happen to... I happen
to support that in a way that
will actually work to our

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:05.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
benefit. But when I look at what
you have proposed, you have what
is called now the

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:06.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:29:01 Trump loophole, because
it would so advantage you and
the business you do.

01:06:06.229 --> 01:06:07.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You've proposed an
approach that has a...

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:07.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Who gave it that name?
The first I've... who gave it
that name?

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, this is
Secretary Clinton's two minutes.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: $4 billion tax benefit
for your family. And when you
look at what you are

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
proposing...

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:12.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: How much? How
much for my family?

01:06:12.735 --> 01:06:13.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: it is...

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:16.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Lester, how much?

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:17.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: as I said, trumped-up
trickle-down. Trickle-down did
not work. It got us into

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mess we were in, in 2008 and
2009. Slashing taxes on the
wealthy hasn't worked.

01:06:18.141 --> 01:06:19.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of really smart,
wealthy people know that. And
they are saying, hey, we need

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:20.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to do more to make the
contributions we should be
making to rebuild the middle
class.

01:06:20.343 --> 01:06:21.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: I don't think top-down
works in America. I think
building the middle class,
investing

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:22.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the middle class, making
college debt-free so more young
people can get their education,

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:22.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
helping people refinance
their... their debt from college
at a lower rate. Those are the

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:23.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kinds of things that will really
boost the economy. Broad-based,
inclusive growth is

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:23.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what we need in America, not
more advantages for people at
the very top.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're...

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:27.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Typical politician. All
talk, no action. Sounds good,
doesn't work. Never going to

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:27.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen. Our country is suffering
because people like Secretary
Clinton have made such bad

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:29.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decisions in terms of our jobs
and in terms of what's going on.

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:30.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, look, we have the worst
revival of an economy since the
Great Depression. And believe

01:06:30.119 --> 01:06:31.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me: We're in a bubble right now.
And the only thing that looks
good is the stock market,

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but if you raise interest rates
even a little bit, that's going
to come crashing down.

01:06:32.055 --> 01:06:33.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are in a big, fat, ugly
bubble. And we better be awfully
careful. And we have a Fed

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:33.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's doing political things.
This Janet Yellen of the Fed.
The Fed is doing political

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by keeping the interest rates at
this level. And believe me: The
day Obama goes off, and

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:36.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he leaves, and goes out to the
golf course for the rest of his
life to play golf 21:31:00,

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:36.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they raise interest rates,
you're going to see some very
bad things happen, because

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:38.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Fed is not doing their job.
The Fed is being more political
than Secretary Clinton.

01:06:38.194 --> 01:06:39.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, we're talking
about the burden that Americans
have to pay, yet you have not

01:06:39.195 --> 01:06:40.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
released your tax returns. And
the reason nominees have
released their returns for
decades

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:41.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is so that voters will know if
their potential president owes
money to... who he owes it

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:40.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to and any business conflicts.
Don't Americans have a right to
know if there are any conflicts

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:43.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of interest?

01:06:43.066 --> 01:06:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I don't mind releasing...
I'm under a routine audit. And
it'll be released. And

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:45.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as soon as the audit's
finished, it will be released.

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:46.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you will learn more about
Donald Trump by going down to
the federal elections, where

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:47.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I filed a 104-page essentially
financial statement of sorts,
the forms that they have. It
shows

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:48.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
income... in fact, the income...
I just looked today... the
income is filed at $694 million

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:48.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for this past year, $694
million. If you would have told
me I was going to make that 15
or

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:50.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
20 years ago, I would
have been very surprised.

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:51.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's the kind of thinking
that our country needs. When we
have a country that's doing

01:06:51.074 --> 01:06:52.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so badly, that's being ripped
off by every single country in
the world, it's the kind

01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:53.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of thinking that our country
needs, because everybody...
Lester, we have a trade deficit

01:06:53.243 --> 01:06:53.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with all of the countries that
we do business with, of almost
$800 billion a year. You know

01:06:53.576 --> 01:06:54.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what that is? That means, who's
negotiating these trade deals?

01:06:54.744 --> 01:06:54.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have people that are
political hacks negotiating our
trade deals.

01:06:54.978 --> 01:06:55.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: The IRS says an audit...

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:58.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Excuse me.

01:06:58.114 --> 01:06:58.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: of your taxes... you're
perfectly free to release your
taxes during an audit.

01:06:58.915 --> 01:07:00.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the question, does the
public's right to know outweigh
your personal...

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:01.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I told you, I will
release them as soon as the
audit. Look, I've been under

01:07:01.117 --> 01:07:01.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
audit almost for 15 years.
21:33:00 I know a lot of wealthy
people that have never been

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:03.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
audited. I said, do you get
audited? I get audited almost
every year.

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:04.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a way, I should be
complaining. I'm not even
complaining. I don't mind it.
It's

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:05.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost become a way of life. I
get audited by the IRS. But
other people don't.

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:06.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say this. We have a
situation in this country that
has to be taken care of. I will

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:06.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
release my tax returns...
against my lawyer's wishes...
when she releases her 33,000
e-mails

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:06.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have been deleted. As soon
as she releases them, I will
release.

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:09.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:10.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will release my tax returns.
And that's against... my
lawyers, they say, "Don't do

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:11.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it." I will tell you this. No...
in fact, watching shows, they're
reading the papers.

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost every lawyer says, you
don't release your returns until
the audit's complete. When

01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:11.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the audit's complete, I'll do
it. But I would go against them
if she releases her e-mails.

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:14.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: So it's negotiable?

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: It's not negotiable, no.
Let her release the e-mails. Why
did she delete 33,000...

01:07:15.098 --> 01:07:16.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Well, I'll let her answer
that. But let me just admonish
the audience one more

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:15.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time. There was an agreement. We
did ask you to be silent, so it
would be helpful for us.

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:18.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton?

01:07:18.301 --> 01:07:19.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I think you've
seen another example of
bait-and-switch here. For 40
years,

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:20.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everyone running for president
has released their tax returns.
You can go and see nearly,

01:07:20.069 --> 01:07:21.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, 39, 40 years of our tax
returns, but everyone has done
it. We know the IRS

01:07:21.004 --> 01:07:22.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has made clear there is no
prohibition on releasing it when
you're under audit.

01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:23.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you've got to ask yourself,
why won't he release his tax
returns? And I think there

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:23.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be a couple of reasons.
First, maybe he's not as rich as
he says he is. Second, maybe

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:25.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he's not as charitable
as he claims to be.

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:26.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Third, we don't know
all of his business dealings,
but we have been told through
investigative

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporting that he owes about
$650 million to Wall Street and
foreign banks. Or maybe

01:07:27.176 --> 01:07:28.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he doesn't want the American
people, all of you watching
tonight, to know that he's paid

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:29.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nothing in federal taxes,
because the only years that
anybody's ever seen were a
couple

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:29.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of years when he had to turn
them over to state authorities
when he was trying to get

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:30.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a casino license, and they
showed he didn't pay any federal
income tax.

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:32.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
21:35:27 TRUMP: That
makes me smart.

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:33.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: So if he's paid zero,
that means zero for troops, zero
for vets, zero for schools

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:34.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or health. And I think probably
he's not all that enthusiastic
about having the rest of

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:34.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our country see what the real
reasons are, because it must be
something really important,

01:07:34.317 --> 01:07:36.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even terrible, that
he's trying to hide.

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:37.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the financial disclosure
statements, they don't give you
the tax rate. They don't give

01:07:37.186 --> 01:07:38.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you all the details that tax
returns would. And it just seems
to me that this is something

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:38.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the American people deserve
to see. And I have no reason to
believe that he's ever

01:07:38.821 --> 01:07:40.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going to release his tax
returns, because there's
something he's hiding.

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:41.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we'll guess. We'll keep
guessing at what it might be
that he's hiding. But I think

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:42.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the question is, were he ever to
get near the White House, what
would be those conflicts?

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:41.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who does he owe money to? Well,
he owes you the answers to that,
and he should provide

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:44.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

01:07:44.127 --> 01:07:43.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: He also... he also raised
the issue of your e-mails. Do
you want to respond to

01:07:43.626 --> 01:07:46.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:45.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: I do. You know, I made
a mistake using a private
e-mail. TRUMP: That's for

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:48.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sure.

01:07:48.131 --> 01:07:49.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And if I had to do it
over again, I would, obviously,
do it differently. But

01:07:49.198 --> 01:07:48.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to make any
excuses. It was a mistake, and I
take responsibility for that.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:51.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HOLT: Mr. Trump?

01:07:51.334 --> 01:07:52.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: That was more than a
mistake. That was done
purposely. OK? That was not a
mistake.

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was done purposely. When
you have your staff taking the
Fifth Amendment, taking the

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:54.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fifth so they're not prosecuted,
when you have the man that set
up the illegal server

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking the Fifth, I think it's
disgraceful. And believe me,
this country thinks it's...
really

01:07:54.037 --> 01:07:56.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thinks it's disgraceful, also.

01:07:56.139 --> 01:07:57.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as my tax returns, you
don't learn that much from tax
returns. That I can tell

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:56.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you. You learn a lot from
financial disclosure. And you
should go down and take a look
at

01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:59.208 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing, I'm extremely
underleveraged. The report that
said $650... which, by the

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way, a lot of friends of mine
that know my business say, boy,
that's really not a lot

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:02.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of money. It's not a lot of
money relative to what I had.

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:03.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The buildings that were in
question, they said in the same
report, which was... actually,

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:03.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it wasn't even a bad story, to
be honest with you, but the
buildings are worth $3.9
billion.

01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:05.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the $650 isn't even on that.
But it's not $650. It's much
less than that.

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:06.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I could give you a list of
banks, I would if that would
help you, I would give you

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a list of banks. These are very
fine institutions, very fine
banks. I could do that very
quickly.

01:08:07.383 --> 01:08:08.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am very underleveraged. I have
a great company. I have a
tremendous income. And the
reason

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:08.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I say that is not in a
braggadocios way. It's because
it's about time that this
country

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:10.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had somebody running it that
has an idea about money.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we have $20 trillion in
debt, and our country's a mess,
you know, it's one thing

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:12.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have $20 trillion in debt and
our roads are good and our
bridges are good and
everything's

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:13.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in great shape, our airports.
21:38:25 Our airports are like
from a third world country.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:14.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You land at LaGuardia, you land
at Kennedy, you land at LAX, you
land at Newark, and you

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:15.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come in from Dubai and Qatar and
you see these incredible... you
come in from China, you

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:16.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see these incredible airports,
and you land we've become a
third world country.

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:17.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the worst of all things has
happened. We owe $20 trillion,
and we're a mess. We haven't

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:18.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even started. And we've spent $6
trillion in the Middle East,
according to a report

01:08:18.194 --> 01:08:18.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I just saw. Whether it's 6
or 5, but it looks like it's 6,
$6 trillion in the Middle

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:20.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
East, we could have rebuilt
our country twice.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:21.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's really a shame. And
it's politicians like Secretary
Clinton that have caused this

01:08:21.364 --> 01:08:22.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
problem. Our country has
tremendous problems. We're a
debtor nation. We're a serious
debtor

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:23.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation. And we have a country
that needs new roads, new
tunnels, new bridges, new
airports,

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:22.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new schools, new hospitals. And
we don't have the money, because
it's been squandered on

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:24.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so many of your ideas.

01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:26.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: We'll let you respond and
we'll move on to the next
segment.

01:08:26.135 --> 01:08:25.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And maybe because you
haven't paid any federal income
tax for a lot of years.

01:08:25.735 --> 01:08:27.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:28.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the other thing I
think is important...

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:30.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: It would be
squandered, too, believe me.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: is if your... if your
main claim to be president of
the United States is your

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:31.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business, then I think we should
talk about that. You know, your
campaign manager said

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:33.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that you built a lot of
businesses on the backs of
little guys.

01:08:33.142 --> 01:08:34.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, indeed, I have met a lot of
the people who were stiffed by
you and your businesses,

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:35.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald. I've met dishwashers,
painters, architects, glass
installers, marble installers,
drapery

01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:34.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
installers, like my dad was, who
you refused to pay when they
finished the work that you

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:37.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
asked them to do.

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have an architect in the
audience who designed one of
your clubhouses at one of your
golf

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:38.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courses. It's a beautiful
facility. It immediately was put
to use. And you wouldn't pay
what

01:08:38.648 --> 01:08:40.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the man needed to be paid, what
he was charging you to do...

01:08:40.016 --> 01:08:39.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Maybe he didn't do a good
job and I was unsatisfied with
his work...

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:41.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, to...

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Which our country
should do, too.

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:44.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Do the thousands of
people that you have stiffed
over the course of your business

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:44.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not deserve some kind of apology
from someone who has taken their
labor, taken the goods

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:46.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they produced, and
then refused to pay them?

01:08:46.322 --> 01:08:47.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:40 I can only say that I'm
certainly relieved that my late
father never did business with

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:47.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you. He provided a good
middle-class life for us, but
the people he worked for, he
expected

01:08:47.357 --> 01:08:49.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the bargain to be
kept on both sides.

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:50.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when we talk about your
business, you've taken business
bankruptcy six times. There

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:51.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are a lot of great
businesspeople that have never
taken bankruptcy once. You call
yourself

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:51.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the King of Debt. You talk about
leverage. You even at one time
suggested that you would

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:51.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try to negotiate down the
national debt of the United
States.

01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:54.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:54.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, sometimes there's
not a direct transfer of skills
from business to government,

01:08:54.931 --> 01:08:55.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes what hapened in
business would be bad for
government.

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Let's let Mr. Trump...

01:08:56.499 --> 01:08:58.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: And we need to
be very clear about that.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: So, yeah, I think... I do
think it's time. Look, it's all
words, it's all sound

01:08:59.369 --> 01:09:00.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bites. I built an unbelievable
company. Some of the greatest
assets anywhere in the world,

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
real estate assets anywhere in
the world, beyond the United
States, in Europe, lots

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of different places. It's
an unbelievable company.

01:09:02.405 --> 01:09:03.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But on occasion, four times, we
used certain laws that are
there. And when Secretary
Clinton

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:03.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talks about people that didn't
get paid, first of all, they did
get paid a lot, but taken

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:05.308 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
advantage of the
laws of the nation.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:06.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, if you want to change the
laws, you've been there a long
time, change the laws. But

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I take advantage of the laws of
the nation because I'm running a
company. My obligation

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:06.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now is to do well for
myself, my family, my employees,
for my companies. And that's

01:09:06.776 --> 01:09:09.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what I do.

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:10.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what she doesn't say is that
tens of thousands of people that
are unbelievably happy and

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:11.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that love me. I'll give you an
example. We're just opening up
on Pennsylvania Avenue right

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:10.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next to the White House, so if I
don't get there one way, I'm
going to get to Pennsylvania

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:13.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Avenue another.

01:09:13.316 --> 01:09:14.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're opening the Old Post
Office. Under budget, ahead of
schedule, saved tremendous

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money. I'm a year ahead of
schedule. And that's what this
country should be doing.

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:16.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We build roads and they cost two
and three and four times what
they're supposed to cost.

01:09:16.219 --> 01:09:17.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We buy products for our military
and they come in at costs that
are so far above what

01:09:17.286 --> 01:09:18.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were supposed to be,
because we don't have people
that know what they're doing.

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:19.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we look at the budget, the
budget is bad to a large extent
because we have people

01:09:19.255 --> 01:09:20.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have no idea as to what to
do and how to buy. The Trump
International is way under

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:21.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
budget and way ahead of
schedule. And we should be able
to do that for our country.

01:09:21.324 --> 01:09:22.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Well, we're well behind
schedule, so I want to move to
our next segment. We move

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:21.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into our next segment talking
about America's direction. And
let's start by talking about

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:24.360 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
race.

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:25.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The share of Americans who say
race relations are bad in this
country is the highest it's

01:09:25.561 --> 01:09:26.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been in decades, much of it
amplified by shootings of
African-Americans by police, as
we've seen

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:26.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently in Charlotte and Tulsa.
Race has been a big issue in
this campaign, and one

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:28.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of you is going to have to
bridge a very wide and bitter
gap.

01:09:28.097 --> 01:09:29.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So how do you heal the divide?
Secretary Clinton, you get two
minutes on this.

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, you're right.
Race remains a significant
challenge in our country.
Unfortunately,

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:31.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
race still determines too much,
often determines where people
live, determines what kind of

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:32.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
education in their public
schools they can get, and, yes,
it determines how they're
treated

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:31.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the criminal justice system.
We've just seen those two tragic
examples in both Tulsa

01:09:31.868 --> 01:09:34.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Charlotte.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we've got to do several
things at the same time. We have
to restore trust between

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:36.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communities and the police. We
have to work to make sure that
our police are using the

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:37.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
best training, the best
techniques, that they're well
prepared to use force only when
necessary.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone should be respected by
the law, and everyone should
respect the law.

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:39.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Right now, that's not
the case in a lot of our
neighborhoods. So I have, ever

01:09:39.342 --> 01:09:40.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since the first day of my
campaign, called for criminal
justice reform. I've laid out

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:39.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a platform that I think would
begin to remedy some of the
problems we have in the criminal

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:42.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
justice system.

01:09:42.378 --> 01:09:43.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we also have to recognize,
in addition to the challenges
that we face with policing,

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:45:35 there are so many good,
brave police officers who
equally want reform. So we have

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:45.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to bring communities together in
order to begin working on that
as a mutual goal. And

01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:46.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we've got to get guns out of the
hands of people who should not
have them.

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The gun epidemic is the leading
cause of death of young
African-American men, more than

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the next nine causes put
together. So we have to do two
things, as I said. We have to
restore

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:49.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trust. We have to work with the
police. We have to make sure
they respect the communities

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:49.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the communities respect
them. And we have to tackle the
plague of gun violence, which

01:09:49.986 --> 01:09:51.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a big contributor to a lot of
the problems that we're seeing
today.

01:09:51.054 --> 01:09:52.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you
have two minutes. How do you
heal the divide?

01:09:52.355 --> 01:09:53.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, first of all,
Secretary Clinton doesn't want
to use a couple of words, and

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:52.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's law and order. And we
need law and order. If we don't
have it, we're not going

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:55.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to have a country.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:56.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I look at what's going
on in Charlotte, a city I love,
a city where I have investments,

01:09:56.259 --> 01:09:57.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I look at what's going on
throughout various parts of our
country, whether it's

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:58.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I can just keep naming
them all day long... we need law
and order in our country.

01:09:58.561 --> 01:09:59.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just got today the, as you
know, the endorsement of the
Fraternal Order of Police, we
just

01:09:59.495 --> 01:09:59.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
just came in. We have
endorsements from, I think,
almost every police group,
very... I

01:09:59.695 --> 01:10:01.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean, a large percentage of
them in the United States.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a situation where we
have our inner cities,
African-Americans, Hispanics are

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:03.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
living in he'll because it's so
dangerous. You walk down the
street, you get shot.

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21:47:17 In Chicago, they've had
thousands of shootings,
thousands since January 1st.

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:05.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of shootings. And I'm
saying, where is this? Is this a
war-torn country? What

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:06.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are we doing? And we have to
stop the violence. We have to
bring back law and order. In a

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:07.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place like Chicago, where
thousands of people have been
killed, thousands over the last

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of years, in fact, almost
4,000 have been killed since
Barack Obama became president,

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:07.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over... almost 4,000 people in
Chicago have been killed. We
have to bring back law and

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

01:10:10.406 --> 01:10:11.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, whether or not in a place
like Chicago you do stop and
frisk, which worked very well,

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mayor Giuliani is here, worked
very well in New York. It
brought the crime rate way down.

01:10:12.075 --> 01:10:13.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you take the gun away from
criminals that shouldn't be
having it.

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:14.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have gangs roaming the
street. And in many cases,
they're illegally here, illegal
immigrants.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:14.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have guns. And they
shoot people. And we have to be
very strong. And we have

01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:16.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be very vigilant.

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:17.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to be... we have to know
what we're doing. Right now, our
police, in many cases,

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:17.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are afraid to do anything. We
have to protect our inner
cities, because African-American

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:19.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
communities are being decimated
by crime, decimated.

01:10:19.615 --> 01:10:20.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOLT: Your two... your two
minutes expired, but I do want
to follow up. 21:48:38
Stop-and-frisk

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:19.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was ruled unconstitutional in
New York, because it largely
singled out black and Hispanic

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:22.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
young men.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:23.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: No, you're wrong. It went
before a judge, who was a very
against-police judge.

01:10:23.286 --> 01:10:24.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was taken away from her. And
our mayor, our new mayor,
refused to go forward with

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:24.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the case. They would have won an
appeal. If you look at it,
throughout the country, there

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:25.755 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
are many places
where it's allowed.

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: The argument is that it's
a form of racial profiling.

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:27.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: No, the argument is that
we have to take the guns away
from these people that

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have them and they are bad
people that shouldn't have them.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:30.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are felons. These are
people that are bad people that
shouldn't be... 21:49:18 when

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:31.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have 3,000 shootings in
Chicago from January 1st, when
you have 4,000 people killed in

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:31.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chicago by guns, from the
beginning of the presidency of
Barack Obama, his hometown,

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you have to have stop-and-frisk.

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:34.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need more police. You need a
better community, you know,
relation. You don't have good
community

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:33.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relations in Chicago. It's
terrible. I have property there.
It's terrible what's going

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:36.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on in Chicago.

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:37.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But when you look... and
Chicago's not the only... you go
to Ferguson, you go to so many

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:38.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different places. You need
better relationships. I agree
with Secretary Clinton on this.

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:38.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: You need better
relationships between the
communities and the police,
because in

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:40.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some cases, it's not good.

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:41.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you look at Dallas, where
the relationships were really
studied, the relationships were

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:41.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really a beautiful thing, and
then five police officers were
killed one night very violently.

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:42.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So there's some bad things going
on. Some really bad things.

01:10:42.138 --> 01:10:44.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton...

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: But we need... Lester, we
need law and order. And we need
law and order in the

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:46.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inner cities, because the people
that are most affected by what's
happening are African-American

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:45.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Hispanic people. And it's
very unfair to them what our
politicians are allowing

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to happen.

01:10:47.043 --> 01:10:49.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:50.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: 21:50:36 Well, I've
heard... I've heard Donald say
this at his rallies, and

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:49.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's really unfortunate that he
paints such a dire negative
picture of black communities

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:50.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our country.

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Ugh.

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:54.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: You know, the vibrancy
of the black church, the black
businesses that employ so

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:55.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many people, the opportunities
that so many families are
working to provide for their

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:54.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids. There's a lot that we
should be proud of and we should
be supporting and lifting

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:57.420 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:58.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we do always have to make
sure we keep people safe. There
are the right ways of doing

01:10:58.387 --> 01:10:59.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, and then there are ways that
are ineffective. Stop-and-frisk
was found to be unconstitutional

01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:00.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, in part, because it was
ineffective. It did not do what
it needed to do.

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I believe in community
policing. And, in fact, violent
crime is one-half of what

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was in 1991. Property crime
is down 40 percent. We just
don't want to see it creep

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:03.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back up. We've had 25 years
of very good cooperation.

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:04.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there were some problems,
some unintended consequences.
Too many young African-American

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:05.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Latino men ended up in jail
for nonviolent offenses. And
it's just a fact that if you're

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a young African-American man and
you do the same thing as a young
white man, you are more

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:07.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely to be arrested, charged,
convicted, and incarcerated. So
we've got to address

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the systemic racism in our
criminal justice system.
21:52:20 We cannot just say law
and

01:11:08.364 --> 01:11:09.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order. We have to say... we have
to come forward with a plan that
is going to divert people

01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:09.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the criminal justice
system, deal with mandatory
minimum sentences, which have
put

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too many people away for too
long for doing too little.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:12.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to have more second
chance programs. I'm glad that
we're ending private prisons

01:11:12.368 --> 01:11:13.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the federal system; I want to
see them ended in the state
system. You shouldn't have

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:13.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a profit motivation to fill
prison cells with young
Americans. So there are some
positive

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:15.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ways we can work on this.

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:16.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I believe strongly that
commonsense gun safety measures
would assist us. Right now

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:17.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this is something Donald has
supported, along with the gun
lobby... right now, we've

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:18.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got too many military-style
weapons on the streets. In a lot
of places, our police are

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:18.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outgunned. We need comprehensive
background checks, and we need
to keep guns out of the

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:20.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hands of those who will do harm.

01:11:20.343 --> 01:11:21.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we finally need to pass a
prohibition on anyone who's on
the terrorist watch list

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:22.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from being able to buy a gun in
our country. 21:53:39 If you're
too dangerous to fly, you

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:22.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are too dangerous to buy a gun.
So there are things we can do,
and we ought to do it in

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:24.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a bipartisan way.

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:25.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton, last
week, you said we've got to do
everything possible to improve

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:25.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
policing, to go right at
implicit bias. 21:53:50 Do you
believe that police are
implicitly

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:27.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
biased against black people?

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:28.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Lester, I think
implicit bias is a problem for
everyone, not just police. I

01:11:28.417 --> 01:11:29.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think, unfortunately, too many
of us in our great country jump
to conclusions about each

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:29.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other. And therefore, I think we
need all of us to be asking hard
questions about, you

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
know, why am I feeling this way?

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when it comes to policing,
since it can have literally
fatal consequences, I have

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:32.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, in my first budget, we
would put money into that budget
to help us deal with implicit

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:34.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bias by retraining a lot
of our police officers.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:35.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I've met with a group of very
distinguished, experienced
police chiefs a few weeks ago.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They admit it's an issue.
They've got a lot of concerns.
21:54:38 Mental health is one

01:11:36.392 --> 01:11:36.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the biggest concerns, because
now police are having to handle
a lot of really difficult

01:11:36.492 --> 01:11:38.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mental health problems
on the street.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:39.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want support, they want
more training, they want more
assistance. And I think the

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:39.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal government could be in a
position where we would offer
and provide that.

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:40.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Mr. Trump...

01:11:40.396 --> 01:11:40.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I'd like to
respond to that.

01:11:40.997 --> 01:11:43.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HOLT: Please.

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: First of all, I agree,
and a lot of people even within
my own party want to give

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:45.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certain rights to people on
watch lists and no-fly lists. I
agree with you. When a person

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:46.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is on a watch list or a no-fly
list, and I have the endorsement
of the NRA, which I'm

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:47.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very proud of. These are very,
very good people, and they're
protecting the Second Amendment.

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:48.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think we have to look very
strongly at no-fly lists and
watch lists. And when

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:49.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people are on there, even if
they shouldn't be on there,
we'll help them, we'll help them

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:50.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legally, we'll help them get
off. But I tend to agree with
that quite strongly.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:51.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do want to bring up the fact
that you were the one that
brought up the words 21:55:33

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:52.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
super-predator about young black
youth. And that's a term that I
think was a... it's... it's

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:52.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been horribly met, as you know.
I think you've apologized for
it. But I think it was a
terrible

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:54.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thing to say.

01:11:54.577 --> 01:11:55.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when it comes to
stop-and-frisk, you know, you're
talking about takes guns away.
Well,

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:56.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm talking about taking guns
away from gangs and people that
use them. And I don't think

01:11:56.179 --> 01:11:57.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I really don't think you
disagree with me on this, if you
want to know the truth.

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:58.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think maybe there's a
political reason why you can't
say it, but I really don't
believe

01:11:58.481 --> 01:11:59.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in New York City,
stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200
murders, and stop-and-frisk
brought

01:11:59.482 --> 01:11:59.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it down to 500 murders. Five
hundred murders is a lot of
murders. It's hard to believe,

01:11:59.248 --> 01:12:01.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
500 is like supposed to be good?

01:12:01.384 --> 01:12:02.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we went from 2,200 to 500.
And it was continued on by Mayor
Bloomberg. And it was

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:03.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terminated by current mayor. But
stop-and-frisk had a tremendous
impact on the safety

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:03.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of New York City. Tremendous
beyond belief. So when you say
it has no impact, it really

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:05.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
did. It had a very,
very big impact.

01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:06.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, it's also fair to
say, if we're going to talk
about mayors, that under the

01:12:06.189 --> 01:12:06.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
current mayor, crime has
continued to drop, including
murders. So there is...

01:12:06.556 --> 01:12:07.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: No, you're
wrong. You're wrong.

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: No, I'm not.

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:10.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Murders are up.
All right. You check it.

01:12:10.393 --> 01:12:11.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: New York... New York
has done an excellent job. And I
give credit... I give

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:12.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
credit across the board going
back two mayors, two police
chiefs, because it has worked.

01:12:12.295 --> 01:12:13.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And other communities need to
come together to do what will
work, as well.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:14.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, one murder is too many.
But it is important that we
learn about what has been
effective.

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:14.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And not go to things that sound
good that really did not have
the kind of impact that

01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:16.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we would want. Who disagrees
with keeping neighborhoods safe?

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's also add, 21:57:30 no
one should disagree about
respecting the rights of young

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
men who live in those
neighborhoods. And so we need to
do a better job of working,
again,

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:18.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the communities, faith
communities, business
communities, as well as the
police to try

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:20.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to deal with this problem.

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:20.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: This conversation is about
race. And so, Mr. Trump, I have
to ask you for five...

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:21.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I'd like to just
respond, if I might.

01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:22.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Please... 20 seconds.

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:23.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I'd just like to respond.

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:25.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: Please respond, then I've
got a quick follow-up for you.

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:26.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I will. Look, the
African-American community has
been let down by our
politicians.

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:26.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They talk good around election
time, like right now, and after
the election, they said,

01:12:26.609 --> 01:12:28.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
see ya later, I'll see
you in four years.

01:12:28.644 --> 01:12:29.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The African-American
community... because... Look,
the community within the inner
cities

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:30.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been so badly treated.
They've been abused and used in
order to get votes by Democrat

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:29.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politicians, because that's what
it is. They've controlled these
communities for up to 100

01:12:29.912 --> 01:12:31.247 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:32.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, let me...

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:12:33.482 --> 01:12:35.351 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: Well,
I... I do think...

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:36.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And I will tell you, you
look at the inner cities... and
I just left Detroit, and

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:37.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just left Philadelphia, and I
just... you know, you've seen
me, I've been all over the

01:12:37.386 --> 01:12:38.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place. You decided to stay home,
and that's OK. But I will tell
you, I've been all over.

01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:39.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I've met some of the
greatest people I'll ever meet
within these communities. And
they

01:12:39.488 --> 01:12:38.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are very, very upset with what
their politicians have told them
and what their politicians

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:40.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have done.

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, I...

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:43.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: 21:58:53 I think... I
think... I think Donald just
criticized me for preparing

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:43.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for this debate. And, yes, I
did. And you know what else I
prepared for? I prepared

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:43.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be president. 21:59:06 And
I think that's a good thing.

01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:46.562 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:12:46.562 --> 01:12:47.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, for five years,
you perpetuated a false claim
that the nation's first black

01:12:47.363 --> 01:12:48.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president was not a natural-born
citizen. You questioned his
legitimacy. In the last

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:49.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
couple of weeks, you
acknowledged what most Americans
have accepted for years: The
president

01:12:49.165 --> 01:12:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was born in the United States.
Can you tell us what took you so
long?

01:12:50.533 --> 01:12:51.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I'll tell you very...
well, just very simple to say.
Sidney Blumenthal works for

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:52.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the campaign and close... very
close friend of Secretary
Clinton. And her campaign
manager,

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:52.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Patti Doyle, went to... during
the campaign, her campaign
against President Obama, fought

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:54.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very hard. And you can go look
it up, and you can check it out.

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:55.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And if you look at CNN
this past week, Patti Solis
Doyle was on Wolf Blitzer saying

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:56.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this happened. Blumenthal
sent McClatchy, highly respected
reporter at McClatchy, to

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:56.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kenya to find out about it. They
were pressing it very hard. She
failed to get the birth

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:58.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
certificate.

01:12:58.507 --> 01:12:58.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I got involved, I didn't
fail. I got him to give the
birth certificate. So I'm

01:12:58.941 --> 01:12:59.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
satisfied with it. And I'll tell
you why I'm satisfied with it.

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:00.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: That was...

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:03.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Because I want to get on
to defeating ISIS, because I
want to get on to creating

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:04.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs, because I want to get on
to having a strong border,
because I want to get on to

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things that are very important
to me and that are very
important to the country.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:06.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: I will let you respond.
It's important. But I just want
to get the answer here. The

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:06.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
birth certificate was produced
in 2011. You've continued to
tell the story and question the

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:07.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president's legitimacy in
2012, '13, '14, '15...

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:09.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Yeah.

01:13:09.252 --> 01:13:10.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: as recently as January. So
the question is, what changed
your mind?

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:11.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, nobody was pressing
it, nobody was caring much about
it. I figured you'd

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:12.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ask the question tonight, of
course. But nobody was caring
much about it. But I was the one

01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:13.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that got him to produce the
birth certificate. And I think I
did a good job.

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:14.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton also fought
it. I mean, you know... now,
everybody in mainstream is

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:15.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to say, oh, that's not
true. Look, it's true. Sidney
Blumenthal sent a reporter...
you

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:16.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just have to take a look at CNN,
the last week, the interview
with your former campaign

01:13:16.626 --> 01:13:17.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
manager. And she was involved.
But just like she can't bring
back jobs, she can't produce.

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:18.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: I'm sorry. I'm just going
to follow up... and I will let
you respond to that,

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:18.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because there's a lot there. But
we're talking about racial
healing in this segment. What

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:19.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do you say to Americans,
people of color who...

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:22.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, it was very... I
say nothing. I say nothing,
because I was able to get him

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:23.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to produce it. He should have
produced it a long time before.
I say nothing.

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let me just tell you. When
you talk about healing, I think
that I've developed very,

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very good relationships over the
last little while with the
African-American community.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think you can see that.

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:27.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I feel that they really
wanted me to come to that
conclusion. And I think I did a
great

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:27.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job and a great service not only
for the country, but even for
the president, in getting him

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:28.204 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to produce his
birth certificate.

01:13:28.204 --> 01:13:29.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:30.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Well, just
listen to what you heard.

01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:32.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:33.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And clearly, as Donald just
admitted, he knew he was going
to stand on this debate stage,

01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:33.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Lester Holt was going to be
asking us questions, so he tried
to put the whole racist

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:35.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
birther lie to bed.

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:36.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it can't be dismissed that
easily. He has really started
his political activity

01:13:36.646 --> 01:13:37.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
based on this racist lie that
our first black president was
not an American citizen. There

01:13:37.613 --> 01:13:38.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was absolutely no evidence for
it, but he persisted, he
persisted year after year,
because

01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:38.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of his supporters, people
that he was trying to bring into
his fold, apparently

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:40.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believed it or wanted
to believe it.

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:41.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, remember, Donald started
his career back in 1973 being
sued by the Justice Department

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:42.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for racial discrimination
because 22:03:18 he would not
rent apartments in one of his

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:43.452 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
developments to
African-Americans, and he made
sure that the people who worked
for him

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:44.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understood that was the policy.
He actually was sued twice by
the Justice Department.

01:13:44.687 --> 01:13:45.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he has a long record of
engaging in racist behavior. And
the birther lie was a very
hurtful

01:13:45.554 --> 01:13:46.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one. You know, Barack Obama is a
man of great dignity. And I
could tell how much it bothered

01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:47.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him and annoyed him that this
was being touted and used
against him.

01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:48.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I like to remember what
Michelle Obama said in her
amazing speech at our Democratic

01:13:48.491 --> 01:13:48.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Convention: When they
go low, we go high. And Barack
Obama went high, despite

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump's best efforts
to bring him down.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:51.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, you can respond
and we're going to move on to
the next segment.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:52.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I would love to respond.
First of all, I got to watch in
preparing for this some

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:53.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of your debates against Barack
Obama. You treated him with
terrible disrespect. And

01:13:53.663 --> 01:13:54.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I watched the way you talk now
about how lovely everything is
and how wonderful you are. It

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:55.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't work that way. You were
after him, you were trying to...
you even sent out or

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:55.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your campaign sent out pictures
of him in a certain garb, very
famous pictures. I don't

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think you can deny that.

01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:58.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But just last week, your
campaign manager said it was
true. So when you tried to act

01:13:58.234 --> 01:13:59.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
22:04:42 holier than thou, it
really doesn't work. It really
doesn't.

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:00.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes,
when I was very young, I went
into my father's company,

01:14:00.569 --> 01:14:01.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had a real estate company in
Brooklyn and Queens, and we,
along with many, many other

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
companies throughout the
country... it was a federal
lawsuit... were sued. We settled

01:14:02.338 --> 01:14:03.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the suit with zero... with no
admission of guilt. It was very
easy to do.

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:04.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I notice you bring that
up a lot. And, you know, I also
notice the very nasty
commercials

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:04.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you do on me in so many
different ways, which I don't do
on you. Maybe I'm trying

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:06.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to save the money.

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:07.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, frankly, I look... I look
at that, and I say, isn't that
amazing? Because I settled

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:07.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that lawsuit with no admission
of guilt, but that was a lawsuit
brought against many real

01:14:07.843 --> 01:14:09.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
estate firms, and it's
just one of those things.

01:14:09.779 --> 01:14:10.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'll go one step further. In
Palm Beach, Florida, tough
community, a brilliant
community, a

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:11.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wealthy community, probably the
wealthiest community there is in
the world, I opened

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:12.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a club, and really got great
credit for it. No discrimination
against African-Americans,

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:13.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
against Muslims, against
anybody. And it's a tremendously
successful club. And I'm so

01:14:13.516 --> 01:14:14.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
glad I did it. And I have been
given great credit for what I
did. And I'm very, very

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:15.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proud of it. And that's the way
I feel. That is the true way I
feel.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:16.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Our next segment is called
"Securing America." We want to
start with a 21st century

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:17.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
war happening every day in this
country. Our institutions are
under cyber attack, and our

01:14:17.486 --> 01:14:17.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secrets are being stolen. So my
question is, who's behind it?
And how do we fight it?

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Clinton, this
answer goes to you.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:20.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I think cyber
security, cyber warfare will be
one of the biggest challenges

01:14:20.589 --> 01:14:21.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
facing the next president,
because clearly we're facing at
this point two different kinds

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:22.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of adversaries. There are the
independent hacking groups that
do it mostly for commercial

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:23.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
reasons to try to steal
information that they can use to
make money.

01:14:23.659 --> 01:14:24.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
22:06:49 But increasingly, we
are seeing cyber attacks coming
from states, organs of states.

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:25.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The most recent and troubling of
these has been Russia. There's
no doubt now that Russia

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:26.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has used cyber attacks against
all kinds of organizations in
our country, and I am deeply

01:14:26.595 --> 01:14:26.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concerned about this. I know
Donald's very praiseworthy of
Vladimir Putin, but Putin

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:27.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is playing a really...

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:29.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: tough, long game here.
And one of the things he's done
is to let loose cyber

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:31.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
attackers to hack into
government files, to hack into
personal files, hack into the
Democratic

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:32.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Committee. And we
recently have learned that, you
know, that this is one of their

01:14:32.501 --> 01:14:33.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
preferred methods of trying to
wreak havoc and collect
information. We need to make it

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:34.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very clear... whether it's
Russia, China, Iran or anybody
else... the United States

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:35.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has much greater capacity. And
we are not going to sit idly by
and permit state actors

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:36.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go after our information, our
private-sector information or
our public-sector information.

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:37.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to have to make
it clear that we don't want to
use the kinds of tools that

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:37.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have. We don't want to engage
in a different kind of warfare.
But we will defend the citizens

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:39.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this country.

01:14:39.442 --> 01:14:40.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the Russians need to
understand that. I think they've
been treating it as almost

01:14:40.476 --> 01:14:41.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a probing, how far would we go,
how much would we do. And that's
why I was so... I was so

01:14:41.644 --> 01:14:42.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shocked when Donald publicly
22:08:41 invited Putin to hack
into Americans. That is just

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:42.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unacceptable. It's one of the
reasons why 50 national security
officials who served

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:43.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Republican information
in administrations...

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Your two minutes
have expired.

01:14:45.548 --> 01:14:46.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: have said that Donald
is unfit to be the
commander-in-chief. It's
comments

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:47.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like that that really worry
people who understand the
threats that we face.

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:47.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, you have two
minutes and the same question.
Who's behind it? And how

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do we fight it?

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:50.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I do want to say that I
was just endorsed and more are
coming next week... it will

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:51.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be over 200 admirals, many of
them here... admirals and
generals endorsed me to lead
this country.

01:14:51.387 --> 01:14:52.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That just happened, and many
more are coming. And I'm very
proud of it.

01:14:52.688 --> 01:14:53.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In addition, I was just endorsed
by ICE. They've never endorsed
anybody before on immigration.

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:54.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was just endorsed by ICE. I
was just recently endorsed...
16,500 Border Patrol agents.

01:14:54.623 --> 01:14:55.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So when Secretary Clinton talks
about this, I mean, I'll take
the admirals and I'll take

01:14:55.858 --> 01:14:56.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the generals any day over the
political hacks that I see that
have led our country so
brilliantly

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:56.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the last 10 years with
their knowledge. OK? Because
look at the mess that we're in.

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:58.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look at the mess that we're in.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:14:59.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as the cyber, I agree to
parts of what Secretary Clinton
said. 22:09:52 We should

01:14:59.628 --> 01:15:00.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be better than anybody else, and
perhaps we're not. I don't think
anybody knows it was Russia

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:01.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that broke into the DNC. She's
saying Russia, Russia, Russia,
but I don't... maybe it was.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:02.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it could be Russia, but
it could also be China. It could
also be lots of other people.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:02.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also could be somebody
sitting on their bed that weighs
400 pounds, OK?

01:15:02.798 --> 01:15:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: You don't know
who broke in to DNC.

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:05.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what did we learn with DNC?
We learned that 22:10:29 Bernie
Sanders was taken advantage

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:05.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of by your people, by Debbie
Wasserman Schultz. Look what
happened to her. But Bernie
Sanders

01:15:05.768 --> 01:15:07.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was taken advantage of.
That's what we learned.

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:08.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, whether that was Russia,
whether that was China, whether
it was another country,

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:08.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't know, because the truth
is, under President Obama we've
lost control of things

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:10.506 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
that we used to
have control over.

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:11.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We came in with the Internet, we
came up with the Internet, and I
think Secretary Clinton

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:11.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and myself would agree very
much, when you look at what ISIS
is doing with the Internet,

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:13.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're beating us at
our own game. ISIS.

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:14.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have to get very, very
tough on cyber and cyber
warfare. It is... it is a huge
problem.

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:15.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a son. He's 10 years old.
He has computers. He is so good
with these computers, it's
unbelievable.

01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:16.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The security aspect of cyber is
very, very tough. And maybe it's
hardly doable.

01:15:16.545 --> 01:15:17.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will say, we are not doing
the job we should be doing. But
that's true throughout

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:17.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our whole governmental society.
We have so many things that we
have to do better, Lester,

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:18.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and certainly cyber
is one of them.

01:15:18.314 --> 01:15:20.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:21.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I think there are
a number of issues that we
should be addressing. I

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:22.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have put forth a plan to defeat
ISIS. It does involve going
after them online. I think we

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:23.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to do much more with our
tech companies to prevent ISIS
and their operatives from

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:23.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being able to use the Internet
to radicalize, even direct
people in our country and Europe

01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:25.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and elsewhere.

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:26.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we also have to intensify
our air strikes against ISIS and
eventually support our Arab

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:26.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Kurdish partners to be able
to actually take out ISIS in
Raqqa, end their claim of

01:15:26.288 --> 01:15:28.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being a Caliphate.

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:29.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're making progress. Our
military is assisting in Iraq.
And we're hoping that within the

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:29.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year we'll be able to push ISIS
out of Iraq and then, you know,
really squeeze them in

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:31.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:32.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have to be cognizant of
the fact that they've had
foreign fighters coming to
volunteer

01:15:32.661 --> 01:15:33.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for them, foreign money, foreign
weapons, 22:12:35 so we have to
make this the top priority.

01:15:33.629 --> 01:15:34.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would also do everything
possible to take out their
leadership. I was involved

01:15:34.597 --> 01:15:35.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a number of efforts to take
out Al Qaida leadership when I
was secretary of state,

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:36.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including, of course, taking out
bin Laden. And I think we need
to go after Baghdadi,

01:15:36.999 --> 01:15:37.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well, make that one of our
organizing principles. Because
we've got to defeat ISIS, and
we've

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:38.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got to do everything we can to
disrupt their propaganda efforts
online.

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:39.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: You mention ISIS, and we
think of ISIS certainly as over
there, but there are American

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:40.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citizens who have been inspired
to commit acts of terror on
American soil, the latest

01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:41.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
incident, of course, the
bombings we just saw in New York
and New Jersey, the knife

01:15:41.604 --> 01:15:42.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack at a mall in Minnesota,
in the last year, deadly attacks
in San Bernardino and

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:42.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Orlando. I'll ask this to both
of you. Tell us specifically how
you would prevent homegrown

01:15:42.805 --> 01:15:44.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attacks by American
citizens, Mr. Trump?

01:15:44.607 --> 01:15:45.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, first I have to say
one thing, very important.
22:13:32 Secretary Clinton

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:46.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is talking about taking out
ISIS. "We will take out ISIS."
Well, President Obama and

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:47.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton created a
vacuum the way they got out of
Iraq, because they got out

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:47.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what, they shouldn't have been
in, but once they got in, the
way they got out was

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a disaster. And ISIS was formed.

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:50.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So she talks about taking them
out. She's been doing it a long
time. She's been trying

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:51.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take them out for a long
time. But they wouldn't have
even been formed if they left

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:51.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some troops behind, like 10,000
or maybe something more than
that. And then you wouldn't have

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:53.749 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had them.

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:54.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or, as I've been saying for a
long time, and I think you'll
agree, because I said it to

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:55.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you once, had we taken the
oil... and we should have taken
the oil... ISIS would not have

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:56.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been able to form either,
because the oil was their
primary source of income. And
now

01:15:56.786 --> 01:15:56.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have the oil all over the
place, including the oil... a
lot of the oil in Libya, which

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:57.353 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
was another one
of her disasters.

01:15:57.353 --> 01:15:59.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:15:59.755 --> 01:15:59.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: 22:14:31 Well, I hope
the fact-checkers are turning up
the volume and really working

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:00.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hard. Donald supported
the invasion of Iraq.

01:16:00.256 --> 01:16:02.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Wrong.

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:02.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: That is absolutely
proved over and over again.

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:04.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Wrong. Wrong.

01:16:04.693 --> 01:16:05.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: He actually advocated
for the actions we took in Libya
and urged that Gadhafi be

01:16:05.094 --> 01:16:06.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken out, after actually doing
some business with him one time.

01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:07.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: But the larger point...
and he says this constantly...
is George W. Bush made

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:08.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the agreement about when
American troops would leave
Iraq, not Barack Obama.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:09.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the only way that American
troops could have stayed in Iraq
is to get an agreement

01:16:09.765 --> 01:16:09.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the then-Iraqi government
that would have protected our
troops, and the Iraqi government

01:16:09.365 --> 01:16:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would not give that.

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But let's talk about the
question you asked, Lester. The
question you asked is, what do

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:12.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we do here in the United States?
That's the most important part
of this. How do we prevent

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:14.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attacks? How do we
protect our people?

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we've got to have an
intelligence surge, where we are
looking for every scrap

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:17.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of information. I was so proud
of law enforcement in New York,
in Minnesota, in New Jersey.

01:16:17.072 --> 01:16:17.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, they responded so
quickly, so professionally to
the attacks that occurred by
Rahami. And

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:17.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they brought him down. And we
may find out more information
because he is still alive,

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:19.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which may prove to be an
intelligence benefit.

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:20.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we've got to do everything we
can to vacuum up intelligence
from Europe, from the Middle

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:20.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
East. That means we've got to
work more closely with our
allies, and that's something
that

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:24.847 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Donald has been
very dismissive of.

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:30.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're working with NATO, the
longest military alliance in the
history of the world, to really

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:35.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turn our attention to terrorism.
We're working with our friends
in the Middle East, many

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:42.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of which, as you know, are
Muslim majority nations. Donald
has consistently insulted

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:47.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Muslims abroad, Muslims at home,
when we need to be cooperating
with Muslim nations and

01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:49.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the American
Muslim community.

01:16:49.839 --> 01:16:56.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're on the front lines. They
can provide information to us
that we might not get anywhere

01:16:56.145 --> 01:17:02.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else. They need to have close
working cooperation with law
enforcement in these
communities,

01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:07.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not be alienated and pushed away
as some of Donald's rhetoric,
unfortunately, has led

01:17:07.122 --> 01:17:08.357 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:09.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Mr. Trump...

01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:11.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I have to respond.

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:17.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Please respond. TRUMP: The
secretary said very strongly
about working with... we've

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:21.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been working with them for many
years, and we have the greatest
mess anyone's ever seen.

01:17:21.937 --> 01:17:26.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You look at the Middle East,
it's a total mess. Under your
direction, to a large extent.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:29.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you look at the Middle East,
you started the Iran deal,
that's another beauty where

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:34.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have a country that was
ready to fall, I mean, they were
doing so badly. They were

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:38.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choking on the sanctions. And
now they're going to be actually
probably a major power

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:41.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at some point pretty soon,
the way they're going.

01:17:41.624 --> 01:17:46.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when you look at NATO, I was
asked on a major show, what do
you think of NATO? And

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:51.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have to understand, I'm a
businessperson. I did really
well. But I have common sense.

01:17:51.567 --> 01:17:56.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I said, well, I'll tell you.
I haven't given lots of thought
to NATO. But two things.

01:17:56.171 --> 01:18:00.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number one, the 28 countries of
NATO, many of them aren't paying
their fair share. Number

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:04.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two... and that bothers me,
because we should be asking...
we're defending them, and they

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:10.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should at least be paying us
what they're supposed to be
paying by treaty and contract.

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:15.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, number two, I said, and
very strongly, NATO could be
obsolete, because... and I was

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:19.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very strong on this, and it was
actually covered very accurately
in the New York Times, which

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:26.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is unusual for the New York
Times, to be honest but I said,
they do not focus on terror.

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:29.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was very strong. And
I said it numerous times.

01:18:29.972 --> 01:18:33.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And about four months ago, I
read on the front page of the
Wall Street Journal that NATO

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:40.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is opening up a major terror
division. And I think that's
great. And I think we should

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:46.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
get... because we pay
approximately 73 percent of the
cost of NATO. It's a lot of
money to

01:18:46.355 --> 01:18:50.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protect other people. But I'm
all for NATO. But I said they
have to focus on terror, also.

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:54.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're going to do that.
And that was believe me... I'm
sure I'm not going to

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:58.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get credit for it... but that
was largely because of what I
was saying and my criticism

01:18:58.167 --> 01:19:00.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of NATO.

01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:06.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have to get NATO to
go into the Middle East with us,
in addition to surrounding

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:11.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nations, and we have to 22:19:03
knock the hell out of ISIS, and
we have to do it fast,

01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:19.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when ISIS formed in this vacuum
created by Barack Obama and
Secretary Clinton. And believe

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:23.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, you were the ones that took
out the troops. Not only that,
you named the day. They couldn't

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:24.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe it. They sat back
probably and said, I can't
believe it. They said...

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:25.894 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: Lester,
we've covered...

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:27.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: No, wait a minute.

01:19:27.162 --> 01:19:29.198 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: We've
covered this ground.

01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:32.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: When they formed, when
they formed, this is something
that never should have happened.

01:19:32.067 --> 01:19:36.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It should have never happened.
Now, you're talking about taking
out ISIS. But you were

01:19:36.839 --> 01:19:41.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there, and you were secretary of
state when it was a little
infant. Now it's in over 30

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:45.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
countries. And you're going to
stop them? I don't think so.

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:49.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these
are judgment questions. You had
supported the war in Iraq

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:51.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before the invasion.
What makes your...

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: I did not support
the war in Iraq.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:55.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HOLT: In 2002...

01:19:55.257 --> 01:20:00.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: That is a mainstream
media nonsense put out by her,
because she... frankly, I

01:20:00.262 --> 01:20:03.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think the best person in her
campaign is mainstream media.

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: My question is,
since you supported it...

01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:05.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Just... would
you like to hear...

01:20:05.234 --> 01:20:07.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: why is your...
Why is your judgment...

01:20:07.102 --> 01:20:11.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Wait a minute. I was
against the war in Iraq. Just so
you put it out.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: The record shows
otherwise, but why... why was...

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:13.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: The record
does not show that.

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Why was... is
your judgment any...

01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:20.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: The record shows that I'm
right. When I did an interview
with Howard Stern, very

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:25.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lightly, first time anyone's
asked me that, I said, very
lightly, I don't know, maybe,

01:20:25.187 --> 01:20:31.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who knows? Essentially. I then
did an interview with Neil
Cavuto. We talked about the
economy

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is more important. I then spoke
to Sean Hannity, which everybody
refuses to call Sean Hannity.

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:43.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had numerous conversations
with Sean Hannity at Fox. And
Sean Hannity said... and he
called

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:46.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me the other day... and I spoke
to him about it... he said you
were totally against the

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:48.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
war, because he was for the war.

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Why is your
judgment better than...

01:20:50.412 --> 01:20:54.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And when he... excuse me.
And that was before the war
started. Sean Hannity said

01:20:54.083 --> 01:20:58.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very strongly to me and other
people... he's willing to say
it, but nobody wants to call

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:01.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him. I was against the war. He
said, you used to have fights
with me, because Sean was in

01:21:01.223 --> 01:21:04.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
favor of the war.

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:09.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I understand that side,
also, not very much, because we
should have never been there.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:14.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But nobody called Sean Hannity.
And then they did an article in
a major magazine, shortly

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:19.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after the war started. I think
in '04. But they did an article
which had me totally against

01:21:19.675 --> 01:21:23.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the war in Iraq.

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:27.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of your compatriots
said, you know, whether it was
before or right after, Trump

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:31.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was definitely... because if you
read this article, there's no
doubt. But if somebody

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:36.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I'll ask the press... if
somebody would call up Sean
Hannity, this was before the

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:41.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
war started. He and I used to
have arguments about the war. I
said, it's a terrible and

01:21:41.463 --> 01:21:45.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a stupid thing. It's going to
destabilize the Middle East. And
that's exactly what it's

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:47.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
done. It's been a disaster.

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:49.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: My reference was to what
you had said in 2002, and my
question was...

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:51.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: No, no. You
didn't hear what I said.

01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:52.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Why is your judgment...
why is your judgment any
different than Mrs. Clinton's

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:54.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
judgment?

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:57.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: 22:21:48 Well, I have
much better judgment than she
does. There's no question about
that.

01:21:57.646 --> 01:22:00.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I also have a much better
temperament than she has, you
know?

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:02.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:07.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have a much better... she
spent... let me tell you... she
spent hundreds of millions

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:12.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of dollars on an advertising...
you know, they get Madison
Avenue into a room, they

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put names... oh, temperament,
let's go after I think my
strongest asset, maybe by far,

01:22:17.366 --> 01:22:21.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is my temperament. I have a
winning temperament. I know how
to win. She does not have a...

01:22:21.603 --> 01:22:24.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:29.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Wait. The AFL-CIO the
other day, behind the blue
screen, I don't know who you
were

01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:33.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking to, Secretary Clinton,
but you were totally out of
control. I said, there's a

01:22:33.849 --> 01:22:35.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
person with a temperament
that's got a problem.

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:38.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Secretary Clinton?

01:22:38.220 --> 01:22:42.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Whew, OK.

01:22:42.558 --> 01:22:45.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:22:45.561 --> 01:22:51.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk about two important
issues that were briefly
mentioned by Donald, first,
NATO.

01:22:51.934 --> 01:22:57.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, NATO as a military
alliance has something called
Article 5, and basically

01:22:57.172 --> 01:23:03.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it says this: An attack on one
is an attack on all. And you
know the only time it's ever

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:09.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been invoked? After 9/11, when
the 28 nations of NATO said that
they would go to Afghanistan

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:19.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with us to fight terrorism,
something that they still are
doing by our side.

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:25.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With respect to Iran, when I
became secretary of state, Iran
was weeks away from having

01:23:25.601 --> 01:23:32.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
enough nuclear material to form
a bomb. They had mastered the
nuclear fuel cycle under

01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:36.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Bush administration. They
had built covert facilities.
They had stocked them with
centrifuges

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:40.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that were whirling away.

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:45.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we had sanctioned them. I
voted for every sanction against
Iran when I was in the Senate,

01:23:45.821 --> 01:23:51.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it wasn't enough. So I spent
a year-and-a-half putting
together a coalition that
included

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia and China to impose the
toughest sanctions on Iran.

01:23:57.833 --> 01:24:04.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we did drive them to the
negotiating table. And my
successor, John Kerry, and
President

01:24:04.339 --> 01:24:12.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama got a deal that put a lid
on Iran's nuclear program
without firing a single shot.

01:24:12.014 --> 01:24:17.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's diplomacy. That's
coalition-building. That's
working with other nations.

01:24:17.019 --> 01:24:23.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other day, I saw Donald
saying that there were some
Iranian sailors on a ship in the

01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:30.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
waters off of Iran, and they
were taunting American sailors
who were on a nearby ship.

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:34.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, you know, if they
taunted our sailors, 22:24:28
I'd blow them out of the water
and

01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:36.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
start another war. That's
not good judgment.

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:39.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: That would
not start a war.

01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:44.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLINTON: That is not the right
temperament to be
commander-in-chief, to be
taunted.

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:46.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the worst part...

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:48.784 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
TRUMP: No, they
were taunting us.

01:24:48.784 --> 01:24:53.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: of what we heard Donald
say has been about nuclear
weapons. He has said repeatedly

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:59.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he didn't care if other
nations got nuclear weapons,
Japan, South Korea, even Saudi
Arabia.

01:24:59.695 --> 01:25:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has been the policy of the
United States, Democrats and
Republicans, to do everything

01:25:04.666 --> 01:25:10.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we could to reduce the
proliferation of nuclear
weapons. He even said, well, you
know, if

01:25:10.305 --> 01:25:14.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there were nuclear war in East
Asia, well, you know, that's
fine...

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:15.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TRUMP: Wrong.

01:25:15.677 --> 01:25:16.345 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CLINTON: have a
good time, folks.

01:25:16.345 --> 01:25:18.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRUMP: It's lies.

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:24.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And, in fact, his
22:25:17 cavalier attitude about
nuclear weapons is so deeply

01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:31.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
troubling. That is the
number-one threat we face in the
world. And it becomes
particularly

01:25:31.493 --> 01:25:36.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threatening if terrorists ever
get their hands on any nuclear
material. So a man who can

01:25:36.865 --> 01:25:42.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be provoked by a tweet should
not have his fingers anywhere
near the nuclear codes, as

01:25:42.004 --> 01:25:46.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far as I think anyone with any
sense about this should be
concerned.

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:48.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: That line's getting a
little bit old, I must say. I
would like to...

01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:49.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: It's a good one,
though. It well describes the
problem.

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:52.481 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:56.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: It's not an accurate one
at all. It's not an accurate
one. So I just want to give

01:25:56.318 --> 01:26:01.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of things... and just to
respond. I agree with her on one
thing. The single greatest

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:08.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problem the world has is nuclear
armament, nuclear weapons,
22:26:04 not global warming,

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:13.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like you think and your
your president thinks.

01:26:13.368 --> 01:26:19.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nuclear is the single greatest
threat. Just to go down the
list, we defend Japan, we defend

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:24.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Germany, we defend South Korea,
we defend Saudi Arabia, we
defend countries. They do

01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:29.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not pay us. But they should be
paying us, because we are
providing tremendous service

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:34.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we're losing a fortune.
That's why we're losing... we're
losing... we lose on everything.

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:40.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I say, who makes these... we
lose on everything. All I said,
that it's very possible that if

01:26:40.429 --> 01:26:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they don't pay a fair share,
because this isn't 40 years ago
where we could do what

01:26:44.633 --> 01:26:49.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're doing. We can't defend
Japan, a behemoth, selling us
cars by the million...

01:26:49.004 --> 01:26:51.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: We need to move on.

01:26:51.339 --> 01:26:55.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, wait, but it's very
important. All I said was, they
may have to defend themselves

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:59.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or they have to help us out.
We're a country that owes $20
trillion. They have to help

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:00.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us out.

01:27:00.449 --> 01:27:02.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Our last...

01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:07.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: As far as the nuclear is
concerned, I agree. It is the
single greatest threat

01:27:07.055 --> 01:27:09.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that this country has.

01:27:09.257 --> 01:27:12.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Which leads to my next
question, as we enter our last
segment here (inaudible)

01:27:12.394 --> 01:27:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the subject of securing America.
On nuclear weapons, President
Obama reportedly considered

01:27:17.466 --> 01:27:21.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
changing the nation's
longstanding policy on first
use. Do you support the current
policy?

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump, you have
two minutes on that.

01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:28.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Well, I have to say that,
you know, for what Secretary
Clinton was saying about

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:34.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear with Russia, she's very
cavalier in the way she talks
about various countries.

01:27:34.216 --> 01:27:38.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Russia has been expanding
their... they have a much newer
capability than we do. We

01:27:38.954 --> 01:27:42.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have not been updating
from the new standpoint.

01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:47.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I looked the other night. I was
seeing B-52s, they're old enough
that your father, your

01:27:47.696 --> 01:27:52.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grandfather could be flying
them. We are not we are not
keeping up with other countries.

01:27:52.901 --> 01:27:56.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would like everybody to end
it, just get rid of it. But I
would certainly not do first

01:27:56.705 --> 01:27:59.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
strike.

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:05.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that once the nuclear
alternative happens, it's over.
At the same time, we have

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:09.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be prepared. I can't take
anything off the table. Because
you look at some of these

01:28:09.851 --> 01:28:14.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries, you look at North
Korea, we're doing nothing
there. China should solve that

01:28:14.789 --> 01:28:20.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problem for us. 22:28:09 China
should go into North Korea.
China is totally powerful as

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:23.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it relates to North Korea.

01:28:23.265 --> 01:28:26.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by the way, another one
powerful is the worst deal I
think I've ever seen negotiated

01:28:26.535 --> 01:28:29.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you started is the Iran
deal. Iran is one of their
biggest trading partners. Iran

01:28:29.738 --> 01:28:33.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has power over North Korea.

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:39.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when they made that horrible
deal with Iran, they should have
included the fact that

01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:43.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they do something with respect
to North Korea. And they should
have done something with respect

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:46.688 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to Yemen and all
these other places.

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:51.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when asked to Secretary
Kerry, why didn't you do that?
Why didn't you add other things

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the deal? One of the great
giveaways of all time, of all
time, including $400 million

01:28:58.633 --> 01:29:04.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in cash. Nobody's ever seen that
before. That turned out to be
wrong. It was actually $1.7

01:29:04.773 --> 01:29:12.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
billion in cash, obviously, I
guess for the hostages. It
certainly looks that way.

01:29:12.113 --> 01:29:18.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you say to yourself, why
didn't they make the right deal?
This is one of the worst deals

01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:25.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever made by any country in
history. The deal with Iran will
lead to nuclear problems. All

01:29:25.727 --> 01:29:27.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have to do is sit back 10
years, and they don't have to do
much.

01:29:27.729 --> 01:29:29.598 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
HOLT: Your two
minutes is expired.

01:29:29.598 --> 01:29:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And they're going to end
up getting nuclear. I met with
Bibi Netanyahu the other

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day. Believe me, he's
not a happy camper.

01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:38.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: All right. Mrs. Clinton,
Secretary Clinton, you have two
minutes.

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:43.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: 22:29:30 Well, let
me... let me start by saying,
words matter. Words matter when

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:49.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you run for president. And they
really matter when you are
president. And I want to
reassure

01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:55.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our allies in Japan and South
Korea and elsewhere that we have
mutual defense treaties and we

01:29:55.457 --> 01:29:58.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will honor them.

01:29:58.893 --> 01:30:05.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is essential that America's
word be good. And so I know that
this campaign has caused

01:30:05.834 --> 01:30:12.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some questioning and worries on
the part of many leaders across
the globe. I've talked

01:30:12.274 --> 01:30:18.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a number of them. But I
want to... on behalf of myself,
and I think on behalf of

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:24.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a majority of the American
people, say that, you know, our
word is good.

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:30.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also important that we look
at the entire global situation.
There's no doubt that we

01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have other problems with Iran.
But personally, I'd rather deal
with the other problems having

01:30:38.066 --> 01:30:43.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put that lid on their nuclear
program than still to be facing
that.

01:30:43.405 --> 01:30:47.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald never tells you what
he would do. Would he have
started a war? Would he have

01:30:47.642 --> 01:30:54.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bombed Iran? If he's going to
criticize a deal that has been
very successful in giving

01:30:54.649 --> 01:31:01.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us access to Iranian facilities
that we never had before, then
he should tell us what his

01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:06.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alternative would be. But it's
like his plan to defeat ISIS. He
says it's a secret plan,

01:31:06.361 --> 01:31:10.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but the only secret is
that he has no plan.

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:15.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
22:31:04 So we need to be more
precise in how we talk about
these issues. People around

01:31:15.337 --> 01:31:22.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the word follow our presidential
campaigns so closely, trying to
get hints about what

01:31:22.610 --> 01:31:29.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we will do. Can they rely on us?
Are we going to lead the world
with strength and in accordance

01:31:29.751 --> 01:31:35.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with our values? That's what I
intend to do. I intend to be a
leader of our country that

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:41.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people can count on, both here
at home and around the world, to
make decisions that will

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:46.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
further peace and prosperity,
but also stand up to bullies,
whether they're abroad or at

01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:48.970 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

01:31:48.970 --> 01:31:54.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We cannot let those who would
try to destabilize the world to
interfere with American
interests

01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:55.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and security...

01:31:55.877 --> 01:31:57.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Your two minutes is...

01:31:57.312 --> 01:31:58.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: to be given
any opportunities at all.

01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:00.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: is expired.

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:00.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: Lester, one
thing I'd like to say.

01:32:00.949 --> 01:32:02.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: Very quickly.
Twenty seconds.

01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:07.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I will go very quickly.
But I will tell you that Hillary
will tell you to go

01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:12.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to her website and read all
about how to defeat ISIS, which
she could have defeated by never

01:32:12.427 --> 01:32:15.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having it, you know, get going
in the first place. Right now,
it's getting tougher and

01:32:15.864 --> 01:32:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tougher to defeat them, because
they're in more and more places,
more and more states,

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:19.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more and more nations.

01:32:19.734 --> 01:32:22.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: Mr. Trump...

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:25.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And it's a big problem.
And as far as Japan is
concerned, I want to help all

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:33.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of our allies, but we are losing
billions and billions of
dollars. We cannot be the

01:32:33.515 --> 01:32:37.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policemen of the world. We
cannot protect countries all
over the world...

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:38.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOLT: We have just...

01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:40.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: where they're not
paying us what we need.

01:32:40.054 --> 01:32:42.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: We have just a
few final questions...

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:45.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: And she doesn't say that,
because she's got no business
ability. We need heart. We

01:32:45.727 --> 01:32:50.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need a lot of things. But you
have to have some basic ability.
And sadly, she doesn't

01:32:50.899 --> 01:32:54.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have that. All of the things
that she's talking about could
have been taken care of during

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:59.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last 10 years, let's say,
while she had great power. But
they weren't taken care of.

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:02.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if she ever wins this race,
they won't be taken care of.

01:33:02.877 --> 01:33:05.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, this year
Secretary Clinton became the
22:32:57 first woman nominated

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:10.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for president by a major party.
Earlier this month, you said she
doesn't have, quote, "a

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:14.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
presidential look." She's
standing here right now. What
did you mean by that?

01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:18.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: She doesn't have the
look. She doesn't have the
stamina. I said she doesn't have

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:23.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the stamina. And I don't believe
she does have the stamina. To be
president of this

01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:26.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country, you need
tremendous stamina.

01:33:26.668 --> 01:33:28.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: The quote was, "I just
don't think she has the
presidential look."

01:33:28.136 --> 01:33:30.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRUMP: You have... wait a
minute. Wait a minute, Lester.
You asked me a question. Did you
ask

01:33:30.672 --> 01:33:33.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
me a question?

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:39.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to be able to negotiate
our trade deals. You have to be
able to negotiate, that's

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:45.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right, with Japan, with Saudi
Arabia. I mean, can you imagine,
we're defending Saudi Arabia?

01:33:45.587 --> 01:33:48.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with all of the money they
have, we're defending them, and
they're not paying? All

01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:53.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have to do is speak to them.
Wait. You have so many different
things you have to

01:33:53.361 --> 01:33:56.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to do, and I don't
believe that Hillary has the
stamina.

01:33:56.531 --> 01:33:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Let's let her respond.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:07.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: 22:33:52 Well, as soon
as he travels to 112 countries
and negotiates a peace deal,

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:15.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a cease-fire, a release of
dissidents, an opening of new
opportunities in nations around

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:19.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world, or even spends 11
hours testifying in front of a
congressional committee, he

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:20.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can talk to me about stamina.

01:34:20.522 --> 01:34:22.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:22.924 --> 01:34:30.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: The world... let me tell
you. Let me tell you. Hillary
has experience, but it's

01:34:30.265 --> 01:34:33.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bad experience. We have made so
many bad deals during the
last... so she's got experience,

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:34.903 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that I agree.

01:34:34.903 --> 01:34:37.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:37.305 --> 01:34:41.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's bad, bad experience.
Whether it's the Iran deal that
you're so in love with,

01:34:41.943 --> 01:34:48.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where we gave them $150 billion
back, whether it's the Iran
deal, whether it's anything

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:54.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can... name... you almost
can't name a good deal. I agree.
She's got experience,

01:34:54.188 --> 01:34:57.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's bad experience. And
this country can't afford to
have another four years of

01:34:57.325 --> 01:34:59.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that kind of experience.

01:34:59.193 --> 01:35:01.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: We are at... we are
at the final question.

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:03.431 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:04.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, one thing.
One thing, Lester.

01:35:04.632 --> 01:35:06.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: Very quickly, because
we're at the final question now.

01:35:06.267 --> 01:35:12.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: You know, he tried to
switch from looks to stamina.
But this is a man who has

01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:18.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called women pigs, slobs and
dogs, and someone who has said
pregnancy is an inconvenience

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:20.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to employers, who has said...

01:35:20.949 --> 01:35:23.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I never said that.

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:26.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: women don't deserve
equal pay unless they do as good
a job as men.

01:35:26.154 --> 01:35:28.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: I didn't say that.

01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:35.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: And one of the worst
things he said was about a woman
in a beauty contest. He

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:41.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
loves beauty contests,
supporting them and hanging
around them. And he called this
woman

01:35:41.736 --> 01:35:46.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
22:35:35 "Miss Piggy." Then he
called her "Miss Housekeeping,"
because she was Latina.

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:48.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald, she has a name.

01:35:48.743 --> 01:35:50.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRUMP: Where did you find this?
Where did you find this?

01:35:50.378 --> 01:35:51.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CLINTON: Her name
is Alicia Machado.

01:35:51.112 --> 01:35:52.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP: Where did you find this?

01:35:52.747 --> 01:35:55.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: And she has become a
U.S. citizen, and you can bet...

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:57.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON:
she's going to vote this
November.

01:35:57.218 --> 01:35:57.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRUMP: OK, good. Let
me just tell you...

01:35:57.885 --> 01:36:00.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:36:00.321 --> 01:36:02.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, could we just
take 10 seconds and then we ask
the final question...

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:07.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: You know, Hillary is
hitting me with tremendous
commercials. Some of it's said

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:12.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in entertainment. Some of it's
said... somebody who's been very
vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell,

01:36:12.867 --> 01:36:15.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said very tough things to her,
and I think everybody would
agree that she deserves it

01:36:15.803 --> 01:36:18.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and nobody feels sorry for her.

01:36:18.272 --> 01:36:20.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you want to know the truth?
I was going to say something...

01:36:20.675 --> 01:36:24.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLT: Please very quickly.

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:30.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: extremely rough to
Hillary, to her family, and I
said to myself, "I can't

01:36:30.818 --> 01:36:36.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do it. I just can't do it. It's
inappropriate. It's not nice."
But she spent hundreds of

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:41.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
millions of dollars on negative
ads on me, many of which are
absolutely untrue. They're

01:36:41.496 --> 01:36:44.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
untrue. And they're
misrepresentations.

01:36:44.932 --> 01:36:50.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will tell you this,
Lester: It's not nice. And I
don't deserve that.

01:36:50.438 --> 01:36:55.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
22:36:42 But it's certainly not
a nice thing that she's done.
It's hundreds of millions

01:36:55.043 --> 01:36:58.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of ads. And the only gratifying
thing is, I saw the polls come
in today, and with all

01:36:58.713 --> 01:37:00.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of that money...

01:37:00.348 --> 01:37:02.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HOLT: We have to move on
to the final question.

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:04.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: $200 million is spent,
and I'm either winning or tied,
and I've spent practically

01:37:04.919 --> 01:37:06.020 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nothing.

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:37:08.523 --> 01:37:11.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: One of you will not win
this election. So my final
question to you tonight, are you

01:37:11.893 --> 01:37:16.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
willing to accept the outcome as
the will of the voters?
Secretary Clinton?

01:37:16.164 --> 01:37:21.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: Well, I support our
democracy. And sometimes you
win, sometimes you lose. But

01:37:21.803 --> 01:37:28.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I certainly will support the
outcome of this election.

01:37:28.009 --> 01:37:32.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know Donald's trying very
hard to plant doubts about it,
but I hope the people out

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:38.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there understand: This
election's really up to you.
It's not about us so much as it
is

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:43.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about you and your families and
the kind of country and future
you want. So I sure hope

01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:48.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you will get out and vote as
though your future depended on
it, because I think it does.

01:37:48.429 --> 01:37:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: Mr. Trump, very quickly,
same question. Will you accept
the outcome as the will of

01:37:51.566 --> 01:37:57.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the voters? TRUMP: I want to
make America great again. We are
a nation that is seriously

01:37:57.004 --> 01:38:01.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
troubled. We're losing our jobs.
People are pouring into our
country.

01:38:01.309 --> 01:38:07.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other day, we were deporting
800 people. And perhaps they
passed the wrong button,

01:38:07.048 --> 01:38:11.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they pressed the wrong button,
or perhaps worse than that, it
was corruption, but these

01:38:11.419 --> 01:38:17.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people that we were going to
deport for good reason ended up
becoming citizens. Ended up

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:21.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
becoming citizens. And it was
800. And now it turns out it
might be 1,800, and they don't

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:22.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even know.

01:38:22.764 --> 01:38:24.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOLT: Will you accept the
outcome of the election?

01:38:24.499 --> 01:38:28.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: Look, here's the story. I
want to make America great
again. I'm going to be able

01:38:28.035 --> 01:38:31.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do it. I don't believe
Hillary will. The answer is, if
she wins, I will absolutely

01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:31.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
support her.

01:38:31.973 --> 01:38:34.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:38:34.542 --> 01:38:37.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOLT: All right. Well, that is
going to do it for us. That
concludes our debate for this

01:38:37.712 --> 01:38:39.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evening, a spirit one. We
covered a lot of ground,
22:38:33 not everything as I
suspected

01:38:39.947 --> 01:38:43.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we would.

01:38:43.084 --> 01:38:47.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The next presidential debates
are scheduled for October 9th at
Washington University in

01:38:47.522 --> 01:38:51.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
St. Louis and October 19th at
the University of Nevada Las
Vegas. The conversation will

01:38:51.793 --> 01:38:54.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
continue.

01:38:54.462 --> 01:38:58.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A reminder. The vice
presidential debate is scheduled
for October 4th at Longwood
University

01:38:58.366 --> 01:39:03.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Farmville, Virginia. My
thanks to Hillary Clinton and to
Donald Trump and to Hofstra

01:39:03.571 --> 01:39:08.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
University for hosting us
tonight. Good night, everyone.
22:38:58

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:12.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And that concludes
the first debate between Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump.

01:39:12.914 --> 01:39:15.349 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We watched them
there on the stage.

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:21.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining Gwen Ifill and me here
in our studio for some analysis,
syndicated columnist Mark

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:27.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Shields, New York Times
columnist David Brooks, and Amy
Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

01:39:27.128 --> 01:39:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields, they did cover a
lot of ground, from jobs to
taxes, from race to ISIS, and

01:39:31.833 --> 01:39:37.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just now women. What did
you make of it all?

01:39:37.071 --> 01:39:41.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think that,
first of all, Donald Trump made
it about him, rather than

01:39:41.876 --> 01:39:44.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the American people.

01:39:44.612 --> 01:39:50.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that was missing in his
message. And I really think that
he is remarkable political

01:39:53.688 --> 01:39:58.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figure, in that, if you think
about American presidents,
whether it's Ronald Reagan or

01:39:58.159 --> 01:40:03.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Kennedy or Barack Obama or
Franklin Roosevelt, there was
always an optimism to them.

01:40:03.698 --> 01:40:09.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is a very dark and rather
dreary message, that we're
surrounded by people who are not

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:16.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
simply incompetent, but who are
cutting deals, who have
conflicts of interest.

01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:22.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If... Hillary Clinton, I thought
was Hillary Clinton. She was
factual. She was well-organized

01:40:22.283 --> 01:40:27.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in her thinking, not
particularly likable, did not
come across as... did not reveal
much

01:40:27.188 --> 01:40:31.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about herself, other that
anecdote about her dad again and
the nod to the grandchild at

01:40:31.025 --> 01:40:33.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the opening.

01:40:33.728 --> 01:40:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I really thought Trump did...
Failed his test of
presidential...

01:40:38.733 --> 01:40:42.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And as we watch the
families come on stage, as is
typical after these debates,

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:46.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Clintons, former President
Bill Clinton and Hillary
Clinton, of course. And Chelsea

01:40:46.807 --> 01:40:49.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton is there as well.

01:40:49.043 --> 01:40:51.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on the other half of the
stage, Melania and Donald Trump,
his sons, his daughters,

01:40:51.012 --> 01:40:53.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
others.

01:40:53.514 --> 01:40:59.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Amy, we... I counted... we
counted it up. Hillary Clinton
referred to Donald Trump

01:40:59.687 --> 01:41:05.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by his first name, Donald...
most people call him Mr.
Trump... 22 times. She clearly
had

01:41:05.092 --> 01:41:08.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it in her mind that she wanted
to get under his skin, to bug
him. Did it work?

01:41:08.663 --> 01:41:13.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, he was on the
defensive much more than he was
on the offense in this

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:18.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate, whether it was on
question of the birtherism, on
his taxes, his support for

01:41:18.306 --> 01:41:24.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Iraq War, the debate about
women, and his things he said
about women, about stamina.

01:41:24.378 --> 01:41:30.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a debate in which she
was able... and I think that
Mark is completely right. Trump

01:41:30.918 --> 01:41:35.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made it about himself, but she
helped him to make it about
himself.

01:41:35.289 --> 01:41:42.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, she didn't provide the
vision. I think that there are a
lot of folks, even on the

01:41:42.229 --> 01:41:47.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic side, looking for
that sense of, what is the
bigger message of Hillary
Clinton?

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:53.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's very smart. She has all of
the facts outlined. She has all
the policy papers up

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.576 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on her Web site.

01:41:55.576 --> 01:42:01.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the bigger, sort of cohesive
vision for where we take
America, I just... I don't know

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:04.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we still saw
that in this debate.

01:42:04.652 --> 01:42:07.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how do you
see this? Did either one of them
do what they needed

01:42:07.054 --> 01:42:09.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do tonight?

01:42:09.490 --> 01:42:12.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it wasn't...
if what they needed to do was
make me feel better about

01:42:12.460 --> 01:42:16.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country, they failed. It was
the opposite of elevating on
both sides.

01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:20.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I thought, for the first
half-hour, that Donald Trump was
winning. And I thought that was

01:42:20.468 --> 01:42:24.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, he may be obnoxious,
but he is a change agent. And
the first half-hour was

01:42:24.705 --> 01:42:27.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on his turf.

01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:30.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And her answers, Hillary
Clinton's answers, went it was
on... gets to policy, it can't

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:34.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just be three things. It has to
be 16 things. And you get in
laundry list mode.

01:42:34.815 --> 01:42:38.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then she started attacking him.
And she had two devastatingly
good answers, on the birther

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:42.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issue and the tax return issue,
which were really good assaults
on him. So, even though

01:42:42.556 --> 01:42:46.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she's not good at describing a
policy, she's really good at
going after him.

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:51.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the debate got on, and
Donald Trump became Donald
Trump. And with every answer,

01:42:51.465 --> 01:42:55.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was digging it a little
deeper. His birther answer was
abysmal, and bunch of bad
answers

01:42:55.102 --> 01:43:01.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all in a row. The race issue was
terrible, the looks issue, bad.

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:04.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he just... at his lack of
preparation, and, frankly, a lot
of his policies and his

01:43:04.745 --> 01:43:07.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
character just got worse and
worse and worse. So, I think you
would have to say this was

01:43:07.348 --> 01:43:09.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a Clinton night.

01:43:09.817 --> 01:43:13.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: John Yang is in...
at Hofstra University for us
tonight. He's at the site

01:43:13.387 --> 01:43:15.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of tonight's debate.

01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:19.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm wondering what the scene
is like there, John, how it's
going over.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, I tell you, the
spinners are just coming out.
I'm just in front of

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:27.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Donald Trump holding room.

01:43:27.468 --> 01:43:34.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can see them coming by here.
Before, Senator Claire McCaskill
came by. She's obviously

01:43:34.508 --> 01:43:39.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a supporter of Secretary
Clinton. She was telling me that
she felt... and this is sort

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:44.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the line coming out of
their... the Clinton room
tonight... that Donald Trump,
once again,

01:43:44.218 --> 01:43:47.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they say, showed that he wasn't
prepared to be president.

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:52.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say that this was... they
say that it came right from the
top, when the secretary

01:43:52.927 --> 01:43:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was able to give what they
say... what they're saying was a
coherent policy about providing

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:02.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
jobs in America. But he wasn't.

01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:08.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tried to... Governor Christie
went by, wouldn't stop. I'm
trying to see if I can get
someone

01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:11.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the Trump campaign
to get their reaction.

01:44:11.779 --> 01:44:15.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, so far, that's what
we have gotten so far.

01:44:15.416 --> 01:44:17.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK, John, we're
going to let you keep searching
for people in the room to talk

01:44:17.485 --> 01:44:19.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to. And we will get back to you.

01:44:19.987 --> 01:44:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark, I want
to come to you, because was
there any... David was saying

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:28.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Donald Trump did better in
the first half-hour, when they
talked about jobs, and

01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:31.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he talked about jobs leaving the
country. Did Hillary Clinton
ever have an answer to

01:44:31.665 --> 01:44:34.235 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

01:44:34.235 --> 01:44:36.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I thought...
I mean, she was defensive.
There's no question about it.

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:39.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was defensive on the TPP.

01:44:39.006 --> 01:44:43.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But her answer that there were
more manufacturing jobs... she
did the defense of her husband's

01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:48.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economic record, not a very... a
rather tepid defense. There was
a hell of a defense to

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:53.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be made for Bill Clinton's eight
years of 22 million jobs and the
lowest unemployment

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:55.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates for African-Americans in
the history of the country,
balancing the budget.

01:44:55.956 --> 01:45:00.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She did... she just said more
manufacturing jobs in the '90s.

01:45:00.528 --> 01:45:04.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I want to say, in defense of
Trump, and not to be totally...
I have never heard a

01:45:04.999 --> 01:45:07.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
presidential candidate... and I
have heard 40 of them... say,
I'm extremely underleveraged.

01:45:07.334 --> 01:45:09.737 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:45:09.737 --> 01:45:13.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, that was a
rather remarkable statement, if
you think about it.

01:45:13.941 --> 01:45:19.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when he talked about not
paying taxes, he said, it would
be squandered, too. That's

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:26.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why he didn't pay any taxes. And
I thought those were... the
explanation, the one that

01:45:26.654 --> 01:45:30.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be most memorable, was
that, who hacked the DNC? It
wasn't Russia. Could have been

01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:32.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia. Could have been China.
Could have been some other
country, or it could have

01:45:32.993 --> 01:45:36.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been someone sitting on the
bed that weighs 400 pounds.

01:45:36.163 --> 01:45:37.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know if the bed weighs
400 pounds or the person weighs
400 pounds.

01:45:37.164 --> 01:45:39.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:45:39.466 --> 01:45:41.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And that is your
definition of "in defense of
Donald Trump"?

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:42.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: That
was it. That was it.

01:45:42.503 --> 01:45:44.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Just checking.

01:45:44.104 --> 01:45:44.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He touched me.
I'm underleveraged myself.

01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:45.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:45:45.239 --> 01:45:47.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:45:47.508 --> 01:45:50.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Can we talk a little
bit about the line of
questioning on race?

01:45:50.511 --> 01:45:55.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because when... I never heard
presidential candidate in the
debate call the person that

01:45:55.683 --> 01:45:59.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he or she is running against,
use the word racist, three
times. And also, when he was

01:45:59.887 --> 01:46:04.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asked about race, Donald Trump
talked about law and order.

01:46:04.058 --> 01:46:06.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What were the dog whistles in
the room? Or maybe they weren't
even dog whistles. Everybody

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could hear them.

01:46:07.061 --> 01:46:09.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

01:46:09.463 --> 01:46:15.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump's answer, whenever
there's an issue on... whether
it's on race, whether

01:46:15.102 --> 01:46:19.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's on policing, whether it's
on terrorism, he always comes
back to, it's all about law

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:20.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and order. We're going to get
the police. We're going to get
stuff done, because that's

01:46:20.608 --> 01:46:23.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
how things work.

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:30.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we also know that that is an
answer that is not a comfortable
answer for many people

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:37.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the African-American
community and in... among
nonwhite voters, about who gets
profiled when

01:46:37.424 --> 01:46:43.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have stop and frisk programs,
when we have law and order, what
that actually means.

01:46:43.197 --> 01:46:49.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These were questions that were
not the kinds of questions that
Donald Trump answers
particularly

01:46:49.103 --> 01:46:53.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well. But that's not who he's
playing to. We talked about this
a lot during the convention.

01:46:53.674 --> 01:46:57.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Throughout this... throughout
the convention, throughout this
debate, Donald Trump talked

01:46:57.945 --> 01:47:02.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the same people he's been
talking to this entire campaign.
There are a group of voters

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:09.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out there who are white, who are
working class who he's done
very, very well with. And those

01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:12.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are voters he expects to take
him all the way throughout this
election.

01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:16.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's not interested in
reaching out and getting beyond
that base.

01:47:16.697 --> 01:47:19.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You know, David,
picking up what Amy is saying,
it seems to me that much

01:47:19.867 --> 01:47:23.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this debate was on territory
where Donald Trump is
uncomfortable, I mean, the whole

01:47:23.904 --> 01:47:28.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
birther question. Lester Holt
raised that. He pushed Donald
Trump on that. He pushed

01:47:28.309 --> 01:47:32.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him on his tax returns, which
we have been talking about.

01:47:32.146 --> 01:47:34.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These were areas where Donald
Trump was back against the
ropes.

01:47:34.315 --> 01:47:36.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

01:47:36.684 --> 01:47:40.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think Holt was tougher on
Trump than on Clinton. Maybe
there's more to work with

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:44.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there. And he certainly exposed
some vulnerabilities. The
defense that "I have a country
club in

01:47:44.625 --> 01:47:47.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Palm Beach which allows in
minorities," that's not... that
is not your good defense.

01:47:47.461 --> 01:47:50.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But...

01:47:50.230 --> 01:47:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump is apparently
already tweeting that there
weren't good questions about
e-mails,

01:47:52.633 --> 01:47:53.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about Benghazi...

01:47:53.667 --> 01:47:55.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

01:47:55.169 --> 01:47:56.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the
Clinton Foundation.

01:47:56.103 --> 01:47:57.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: And
somewhat fair, actually.

01:47:57.971 --> 01:48:00.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But here is way think it's going
to happen. I think he really
looked bad on some of the

01:48:00.674 --> 01:48:05.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially some of the racial
stuff, on the gender stuff, a
lot of stuff.

01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:10.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think we can expect his
polls to drop as after the
convention season. But,

01:48:10.951 --> 01:48:15.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Amy said, that's not his
audience. And, two, he is
thematically so consistent. We

01:48:15.489 --> 01:48:19.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are under assault, we're under
assault, we're under assault.

01:48:19.259 --> 01:48:24.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it wouldn't surprise me if
he then... his numbers then
began to go up, as they have

01:48:24.665 --> 01:48:27.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the last couple weeks, with
all this stuff. He's already
said all this before.

01:48:27.501 --> 01:48:30.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I might also add
that, if you want to know, we
have been keeping track of

01:48:30.571 --> 01:48:33.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the things that were true, the
things that were false that were
said tonight on our Web

01:48:33.807 --> 01:48:38.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
site, PBS.org/NewsHour. Just go
there and find what all of our
experts, including our

01:48:38.846 --> 01:48:41.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own... well, Margaret Warner,
our own Paul Solman are
telling... answering these
questions.

01:48:41.148 --> 01:48:43.183 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Pulling it together.

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:47.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But facts... facts
seemed to be an important issue
here than... or lack thereof,

01:48:47.554 --> 01:48:51.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tonight, Mark. And that was
also Hillary Clinton's turf.

01:48:51.392 --> 01:48:54.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. No,
that's where she is.

01:48:54.962 --> 01:49:01.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she can't give a short
answer. That is a real problem.
There is a little bit of,

01:49:01.969 --> 01:49:08.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let me tell you how much I know.
And I... I don't even know the
capital of Sweden, but

01:49:08.142 --> 01:49:13.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I can tell you what the
principal products of Sweden are
and how long, you know,
Stockholm

01:49:13.247 --> 01:49:19.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I think that is... but I
have... again, there are moments
in the debate which I think

01:49:19.353 --> 01:49:21.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we can't ignore.

01:49:21.822 --> 01:49:26.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is, "You don't learn a
lot from the tax returns, that,
I can tell you," explaining

01:49:26.794 --> 01:49:31.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why he hasn't released his own
taxes, and said paying no
federal taxes makes me smart.

01:49:31.899 --> 01:49:38.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I'm sorry. I mean, the cops
and E-4s in the Marine Corps and
schoolteachers and

01:49:38.138 --> 01:49:44.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
registered nurses who pay taxes
every year, I don't know if not
paying taxes for the two

01:49:44.178 --> 01:49:47.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
years that he has on the
record is a recommendation.

01:49:47.147 --> 01:49:49.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:49:49.383 --> 01:49:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I would agree with
you, if the Republican debates
hadn't happened.

01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And maybe it's just the
Republican audiences are
different. But the rules are a
little

01:49:56.623 --> 01:50:00.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different this year. And a lot
of things where he says, I'm
smart, I got away with this,

01:50:00.294 --> 01:50:04.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I do think that has some
resonance in a country of
high-end social distrust. And I
do think

01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:07.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of the rules are a little
different applying to him.

01:50:07.634 --> 01:50:11.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Do you think those
respectable people who have come
to him in the last few

01:50:11.071 --> 01:50:13.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weeks, I mean, the thoughtful,
have been kind of overlooking
it? Do you think they were

01:50:13.874 --> 01:50:14.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
made comfortable tonight?

01:50:14.641 --> 01:50:16.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:16.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Total squirming.
Total squirming.

01:50:16.643 --> 01:50:18.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:50:18.946 --> 01:50:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes. And that's
really the question: Did he pass
the judgment test?

01:50:20.447 --> 01:50:24.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to the point of... which I
don't know that he was able to
pass the judgment, temperament

01:50:24.218 --> 01:50:28.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
test. I don't think that that
was he gets high marks on that.

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:32.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on the question about where
the country feels that we're
going, we're pretty evenly

01:50:32.226 --> 01:50:35.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
divided between whether... and
this is the Wall Street Journal
poll... is our country

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:38.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
losing ground or is our country
making progress? Forty-eight
percent say losing ground.
Forty-five

01:50:38.799 --> 01:50:41.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
percent say making progress.

01:50:41.969 --> 01:50:47.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not surprisingly, among white
Americans, plus-11 losing
ground, among nonwhite
Americans, plus-28

01:50:47.508 --> 01:50:50.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
making progress.

01:50:50.143 --> 01:50:53.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so when you see these
candidates literally talking
past each other, as you pointed
out,

01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:55.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on race issues, on so many other
issues about where we're
going...

01:50:55.249 --> 01:50:57.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Taxes.

01:50:57.451 --> 01:50:59.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: on taxes, it's
literally we have a country that
is seeing the direction

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:01.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we're going in
completely differently.

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:05.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think all three
of you were saying before the
debate that Hillary Clinton

01:51:05.259 --> 01:51:10.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight needed to be more
likable. She needed to... Mark,
what was your term? She needed

01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:12.499 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to...

01:51:12.499 --> 01:51:14.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: At the end
of it, say, not a bad egg.

01:51:14.167 --> 01:51:14.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not a bad egg.

01:51:14.868 --> 01:51:16.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:19.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Like to
have in the carpool.

01:51:19.006 --> 01:51:20.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But she
did she do that tonight?

01:51:20.574 --> 01:51:22.109 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: In
the PTA meeting.

01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:25.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did
that happen or not?

01:51:25.512 --> 01:51:28.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No. I don't
think... I don't think she
wasn't unlikable, but she
certainly

01:51:28.649 --> 01:51:29.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there wasn't any...

01:51:29.616 --> 01:51:32.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: What?

01:51:32.052 --> 01:51:34.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: There wasn't any
point in which you got a peek
into her... who she is, what

01:51:34.955 --> 01:51:37.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
makes her tick.

01:51:37.024 --> 01:51:39.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I never hear anybody
ask whether Donald Trump is
likable.

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:40.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Oh, sure we do.

01:51:40.827 --> 01:51:41.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes?

01:51:41.929 --> 01:51:42.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

01:51:42.829 --> 01:51:44.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes?

01:51:44.498 --> 01:51:44.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: And he's
thoroughly unlikable.

01:51:44.831 --> 01:51:46.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:51:46.466 --> 01:51:47.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: It's not
really an open question.

01:51:47.267 --> 01:51:47.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Oh, I
see. Oh, I see.

01:51:47.834 --> 01:51:50.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:54.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, the Wall
Street Journal/NBC poll, to come
back to what Amy was just
talking

01:51:54.875 --> 01:52:00.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about, he started 28/59
favorable/unfavorable, and now
he's at 29.

01:52:00.147 --> 01:52:04.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're going
quickly back to Hofstra
university in New York.

01:52:04.017 --> 01:52:05.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Our John Yang is there.

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:08.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John, you have maybe
found a Trump person?

01:52:08.655 --> 01:52:11.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Hi, John.

01:52:11.425 --> 01:52:17.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I have got... we have
been talking to some of the
Trump supporters here now.

01:52:17.397 --> 01:52:22.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They think... and the one point
that they have been repeating
over and over again is

01:52:22.102 --> 01:52:27.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the point, actually, that he
repeated over and over again in
the debate, was hitting

01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:34.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
at Clinton as a career
politician, that reinforcing
this idea that he's the... that
career politicians

01:52:34.014 --> 01:52:38.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Hillary Clinton are the
reason for the problems we're
seeing now.

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:43.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's been a signature line of
his campaign and, in many ways,
one reason for a lot of

01:52:43.657 --> 01:52:46.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the support of the campaign. And
that's what we're hearing over
and over again from the

01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:49.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump supporters here tonight.

01:52:49.296 --> 01:52:52.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In fact, John, that
was one of the big lines
tonight, which is that she has

01:52:52.232 --> 01:52:55.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
experience, but it's bad
experience, right? And so they
are picking up on that.

01:52:55.135 --> 01:52:57.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Right.

01:52:57.504 --> 01:52:59.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So...
and, John, thank you.

01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:01.008 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:53:01.008 --> 01:53:02.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

01:53:02.009 --> 01:53:04.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: No, go ahead.

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:09.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was just going
to bring it back here and say to
David, is that effective?

01:53:09.249 --> 01:53:11.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something that sticks
that he keeps repeating?

01:53:11.485 --> 01:53:14.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I think
it does, actually.

01:53:14.121 --> 01:53:18.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you looked at her, just take
him out of the debate, she does
look like a career politician.

01:53:18.225 --> 01:53:21.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She does repeat a lot of things.
She doesn't quite make human
convention... connection.

01:53:21.495 --> 01:53:25.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in year that's very unusual,
she's not that unusual.

01:53:25.799 --> 01:53:30.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I thought she did fine, and
with some devastatingly good
assaults. But, again, as

01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:34.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark said, he was the subject.
And he did negative.

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:37.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, and that's
been the theme throughout this
campaign, right?

01:53:37.477 --> 01:53:42.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wherever the spotlight goes, if
it's placed on you, the
candidate, you are likely to
drop

01:53:42.549 --> 01:53:45.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the polls. When the spotlight
gets to the other candidate...
because this race has just

01:53:45.218 --> 01:53:48.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
simply been a referendum on who
the worst candidate is, right?

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:52.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when it... if it goes to
the spotlight now on Donald
Trump and how much he was on

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:56.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defense, it's not going to be
how well Clinton did as much as
how poorly he did. And if it

01:53:56.630 --> 01:54:02.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goes over to Hillary Clinton,
then she becomes the focus. Her
numbers suffer.

01:54:02.202 --> 01:54:06.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the end of the day, the
candidate who wins is the
candidate who doesn't get in
that

01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:09.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
spotlight for the
last couple of weeks.

01:54:09.376 --> 01:54:13.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask a
question about just one big
policy issue that he seemed to
land

01:54:13.313 --> 01:54:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few blows on. And that was on
trade, when he kind of basically
made the point that she

01:54:17.484 --> 01:54:20.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had changed her mind. And
he drove that point home.

01:54:20.587 --> 01:54:22.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: He did.

01:54:22.923 --> 01:54:25.392 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:54:25.392 --> 01:54:28.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The question I
had, as he was doing that,
was... are his interruptions a

01:54:28.829 --> 01:54:32.099 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
sign of strength
or obnoxiousness?

01:54:32.099 --> 01:54:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he... there's no question,
he dominated the dialogue. She
was very much playing defense

01:54:35.802 --> 01:54:38.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the first part there.

01:54:38.939 --> 01:54:42.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as David
said, in the first half-hour, it
seemed to be that he was

01:54:42.576 --> 01:54:45.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
getting the better of
a couple of points.

01:54:45.579 --> 01:54:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then, as we moved into the
debate, it seemed to me Hillary
Clinton felt more comfortable

01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:51.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coming after him and
sticking with some...

01:54:51.818 --> 01:54:53.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:54:53.687 --> 01:54:54.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, she baited
him. There's no question.

01:54:54.955 --> 01:54:57.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Oh, yes.

01:54:57.557 --> 01:55:01.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Donald was baited. And he
not, in that sense, go after her
the way I thought he would.

01:55:01.995 --> 01:55:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought his own defense of his
positions was really faulty.

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, time for all
three of you to ask... really
quick answers.

01:55:08.135 --> 01:55:10.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Uh-oh.

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:11.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Expectations in
advance, did they meet your
expectations afterward?

01:55:11.972 --> 01:55:14.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, they did.

01:55:14.007 --> 01:55:15.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

01:55:15.442 --> 01:55:16.643 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mark?

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:17.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

01:55:17.511 --> 01:55:19.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:55:19.312 --> 01:55:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: My expectations
have never been met. No.

01:55:21.848 --> 01:55:22.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We may ask you
this question again tomorrow.

01:55:22.816 --> 01:55:25.619 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
David?

01:55:25.619 --> 01:55:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Not a kamikaze
night for him. So, it's not a
career-ender, not a
campaign-ender,

01:55:27.687 --> 01:55:29.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but not a good night.

01:55:29.723 --> 01:55:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All right. I think
I gave you, like, one word.

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:34.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

01:55:34.027 --> 01:55:37.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I can say... yes, agree that
it was a better night for
Hillary Clinton, but it does

01:55:37.130 --> 01:55:40.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
not feel like it was the
defining end-all, be-all of this
campaign.

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, hey, we
have only got six weeks to go.

01:55:43.303 --> 01:55:45.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You know what that
means. We are going to have to
come back and do it again

01:55:45.906 --> 01:55:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right here at this table, maybe
October 4 for the vice
presidential debate.

01:55:51.244 --> 01:55:55.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That concludes our coverage of
the first presidential debate,
but there's whole lot more, as
we

01:55:55.916 --> 01:56:00.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were saying, online. You can
watch highlights. Plus, see how
"NewsHour" staff, from Margaret

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Warner to Paul Solman, as you
were saying, and more put what
the candidates said in context.

01:56:04.958 --> 01:56:05.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's all at PBS.org/NewsHour.

01:56:05.692 --> 01:56:07.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

01:56:07.594 --> 01:56:10.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

01:56:10.063 --> 01:56:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And join us right here for the
"NewsHour" tomorrow night.

01:56:13.033 --> 01:56:19.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you, and good
