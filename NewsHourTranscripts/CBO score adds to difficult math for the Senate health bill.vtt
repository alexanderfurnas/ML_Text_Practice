JUDY WOODRUFF: It was a big day
in the fight over health care
reform in the United States

00:04.766 --> 00:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the Senate's push
to replace Obamacare.

00:08.066 --> 00:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John Yang digs in
to the details.

00:10.600 --> 00:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Late today,
the Congressional Budget
Office issued its analysis
of the Senate health

00:14.333 --> 00:16.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care bill.

00:16.866 --> 00:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It found that, by 2026,
22 million more Americans
would be uninsured
than under current law.

00:22.466 --> 00:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would also reduce the
federal deficit by $321
billion over that period.

00:29.266 --> 00:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that estimate of uninsured
Americans is slightly lower
than the CBO projection

00:34.200 --> 00:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the House version,
which passed in May.

00:36.300 --> 00:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a rising tide of opposition
is adding to the difficult
dynamics of trying to pass

00:41.300 --> 00:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Senate bill this week.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Joining me now to break all
this down, Julie Rovner.

00:45.866 --> 00:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the chief Washington
correspondent for
Kaiser Health Care News.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And our own Lisa Desjardins.

00:51.866 --> 00:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa, Julie, thanks
for joining us.

00:53.833 --> 00:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Julie, let me start with you.

00:56.933 --> 01:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Drill down a little bit for us
in that number of uninsured.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And also what did it say
about the effect on premiums?

01:02.833 --> 01:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER, Kaiser Health
News: Well, basically, what the
CBO said is that even though the

01:05.833 --> 01:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate bill is different in
many, many ways from the House
bill, they end up in roughly

01:10.133 --> 01:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the same place in terms
of number of people
who would be uninsured.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Basically, both of the bills
would double the percentage
of people without insurance

01:16.766 --> 01:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
compared to the
Affordable Care Act.

01:18.833 --> 01:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the sort of remarkable
things that it found is that
it would do it for different

01:22.700 --> 01:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reasons and in different ways.

01:24.733 --> 01:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For example, the Senate bill
would peg its help with people
paying premiums to a less

01:30.900 --> 01:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
valuable plan, a plan
that would pay fewer of
people's medical expenses.

01:33.433 --> 01:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they found is that
for a lot of low-income
people, even if they get
help paying the premium,

01:37.400 --> 01:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they wouldn't buy insurance
because they wouldn't have any
help using their insurance.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The deductibles and
the other cost-sharing
would just be too high.

01:44.066 --> 01:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa, you
were just on a conference
call with the CBO.

01:47.766 --> 01:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you learn?

01:49.300 --> 01:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think that
is the standout point here.

01:50.733 --> 01:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know who these
uninsured people would be.

01:52.900 --> 01:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 22 million that you just
spoke about, John, those are
mostly low-income Americans

01:56.633 --> 01:58.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and some on the edge
of middle class.

01:58.233 --> 02:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're talking about $30,000
in income for an individual.

02:00.833 --> 02:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's not poverty.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's twice the
level of poverty.

02:04.400 --> 02:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The CBO found here that some
of those groups, people making
under $30,000 a year, would

02:08.766 --> 02:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go from about 10 do 15 percent
uninsured, maybe 20 percent,
to maybe 40 percent of the

02:15.300 --> 02:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people making $30,000 or
less would be uninsured
under this plan.

02:18.933 --> 02:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that's a big hit
to that one group.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Lisa, of
course, you're usually up
on Capitol Hill for us.

02:25.366 --> 02:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does this report do to
the calculus of trying to get
50 votes by the end of this

02:31.533 --> 02:33.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
week to pass this
bill in the Senate?

02:33.166 --> 02:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today
started, and it was
already very tough math.

02:35.266 --> 02:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, many of my sources all
day were saying they were not
sure how Senate Leader McConnell

02:38.833 --> 02:40.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could do it.

02:40.066 --> 02:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This makes it even
more difficult.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have had reaction
in just the last hour.

02:43.566 --> 02:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rand Paul has now said that
he's going to vote not just
against the bill, but to even

02:47.766 --> 02:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the idea of bringing it up.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a procedural vote that
we expect maybe Wednesday
called motion to proceed.

02:53.166 --> 02:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they can't get 51 votes
for even starting this debate
on that bill, it's a very bad

02:57.966 --> 02:59.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sign.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're seeing "makes me
concerned" comments from
Senator Cassidy of Louisiana.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John McCain said this is
obviously not good news.

03:05.233 --> 03:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Across the board,
this is definitely not
helping Republicans.

03:07.966 --> 03:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not clear how this
gets across the finish line.

03:10.033 --> 03:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, of course, the
51st vote would likely be the
vice president, who would break

03:13.033 --> 03:15.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a tie.

03:15.100 --> 03:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Julie, it wasn't just the CBO
that came out today, but there
were -- so there was other

03:18.566 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bad news for this
Senate bill today.

03:20.600 --> 03:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well,
there was also a plethora
of interest groups.

03:25.133 --> 03:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of the health care industry
has actually come out and
said they really don't -- they

03:29.566 --> 03:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't like the way this -- the
direction this bill was going.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some of them
vehemently oppose it.

03:34.066 --> 03:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some, including like the
National Governors Association
-- this is the bipartisan group

03:36.866 --> 03:40.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
which is barely agrees
on anything -- at least
came out and said we
don't think it should

03:40.166 --> 03:42.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be done this fast.

03:42.266 --> 03:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The National Association
of Medicaid Directors,
the people who would
be involved in actually

03:45.733 --> 03:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
implementing the change to this
bill, came out with a very,
very strong statement saying

03:50.100 --> 03:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that no amount of flexibility
can make up for the dollar
amount of cuts to the Medicaid

03:54.233 --> 03:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
program in this bill.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
According to the CBO, it's
26 percent over 10 years.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And, Julie,
the Senate made a change
to this bill today.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What did they do and
why did they do it?

04:02.500 --> 04:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: That's right.

04:04.966 --> 04:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Senate -- the original
Senate draft that we
saw last week required
insurers to continue

04:08.033 --> 04:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to sell to people who have
preexisting health conditions,
but there was nothing in it to

04:12.033 --> 04:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
encourage or urge healthy people
to actually buy insurance.

04:16.566 --> 04:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they put in today or at
least what the CBO scored what
they call a six-month lockout.

04:23.566 --> 04:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you had any kind of break
in coverage of more than 60
days in the previous 12 months,

04:29.100 --> 04:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you would have to wait six
months before you could get
coverage under this new bill.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, Lisa, you say
we need 50 votes in the Senate.

04:33.833 --> 04:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got five already
saying they're against it.

04:37.033 --> 04:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have got a lot on the fence.

04:39.033 --> 04:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who should we be watching?

04:41.100 --> 04:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who will tell us in the
next 48 hours whether or
not this is going to pass?

04:43.733 --> 04:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right
now, almost every
Republican senator is key.

04:46.533 --> 04:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the one I'm watching the
most closely is Senator Shelley
Capito of West Virginia.

04:52.266 --> 04:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Think about her state.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Trump, President Trump,
won that state by 42 points.

04:56.866 --> 05:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he cannot get a bill across
the finish line in a state
with that much support, there's

05:01.600 --> 05:03.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a real problem.

05:03.533 --> 05:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has serious health
problems in that state, among
them, the opioid epidemic.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She wants more money
in this bill for that.

05:08.666 --> 05:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will see if she gets it.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that might not be enough.

05:11.466 --> 05:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She has a huge
Medicaid population.

05:13.133 --> 05:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's not the only one, John.

05:14.733 --> 05:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I really ran a lot of
the statistics here.

05:16.933 --> 05:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Think about this.

05:18.933 --> 05:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost half of the Republicans
in the Senate have states
where 20 percent of their whole

05:22.200 --> 05:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
population is on Medicaid.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something they're taking
very seriously with this bill.

05:26.066 --> 05:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Julie, are we likely
to see more changes in this
bill as they try to get to

05:29.600 --> 05:30.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that 50-vote mark?

05:30.600 --> 05:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Oh, absolutely.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One thing that the CBO -- I
guess one piece of good news
for the Republican in the Senate

05:35.700 --> 05:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that the Senate bill
would save considerably more
money than the House bill.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, in theory, they
have money to play with.

05:41.100 --> 05:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We would expect more money
to be devoting towards
helping the opioid epidemic.

05:46.933 --> 05:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They could make more changes.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem, the difficulty
is that any change
that moves towards the
more moderate numbers

05:51.866 --> 05:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will harden the opposition,
the more conservative,
and any change that
make the conservatives

05:55.733 --> 05:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happy will harden the
opposition of the moderates.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, question, they only
have two votes to spare.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Finding 50 votes,
not an easy thing.

06:02.500 --> 06:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, it will be a
drama all week as we get toward
Friday and the self-imposed

06:06.600 --> 06:07.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deadline.

06:07.966 --> 06:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Julie Rovner, Lisa Desjardins,
thank you very much.

06:08.766 --> 06:10.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIE ROVNER: Thank you.

06:10.000 --> 06:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
thank you, John.
