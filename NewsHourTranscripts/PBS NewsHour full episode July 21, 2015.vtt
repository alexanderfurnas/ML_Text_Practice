WEBVTT

00:05.806 --> 00:06.807
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.176
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:09.176 --> 00:14.448
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight on the
"PBS NewsHour": breakthroughs in
the fight against AIDS, millions

00:14.448 --> 00:18.752
now on lifesaving drugs -- how
early treatment is changing what
was once a death sentence.

00:20.721 --> 00:25.525
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday: boots back on the
ground in Iraq. American
civilians

00:25.525 --> 00:29.563
head to the front lines to fight
against Islamic State militants.

00:29.563 --> 00:33.600
SAMANTHA JOHNSTON, Former U.S.
Army Private: Something inside
of me just snapped, and

00:33.600 --> 00:38.338
I couldn't allow myself to sit
down and do nothing, when all of
these children here are

00:38.338 --> 00:43.644
in trouble, and I and me and my
family are just living happily
in America.

00:43.644 --> 00:49.016
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, our
Running series continues with
former Senator Rick Santorum,

00:49.016 --> 00:52.552
who returns to the campaign
trail for a second bid at the
presidency.

00:52.552 --> 00:58.091
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:58.091 --> 01:02.095
(BREAK)

01:02.095 --> 01:12.372
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
invoked the Iraq War today
during a defense of the recent

01:12.372 --> 01:16.443
nuclear deal with Iran. He said
those who oppose the deal are
like the people who rushed

01:16.443 --> 01:19.947
the U.S. into war with Iraq.

01:19.947 --> 01:24.584
He spoke in Pittsburgh at the
Veterans of Foreign Wars
national convention.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.721
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: We're hearing
the echoes some of the same

01:27.721 --> 01:33.226
policies and mind-set that
failed us in the past. Some of
the same politicians and pundits

01:33.226 --> 01:38.732
that are so quick to reject the
possibility of a diplomatic
solution to Iran's nuclear

01:38.732 --> 01:42.302
program are the same folks who
were so quick to go to war in
Iraq and said it would take

01:42.302 --> 01:46.373
a few months.

01:46.373 --> 01:50.177
We know the consequences of that
choice, and what it cost us in
blood and treasure.

01:50.177 --> 01:53.714
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
also pressed Congress today to
help with funding for the

01:53.714 --> 01:58.618
Veterans Affairs Department.
It's been a little over a year
since the VA was rocked

01:58.618 --> 02:03.690
by scandal over excessive wait
times. He said he's still not
satisfied with the changes

02:03.690 --> 02:07.461
hospitals have made in
fixing veterans' care.

02:07.461 --> 02:12.666
GWEN IFILL: An uncle of the man
who opened fire on military
facilities in Chattanooga,

02:12.666 --> 02:18.372
Tennessee, has been in custody
overseas since a day after the
attack. The uncle of Mohammad

02:18.372 --> 02:23.343
Youssuf Abdulazeez lives in
Jordan, where other relatives
have also been questioned

02:23.343 --> 02:28.615
by authorities. Abdulazeez
spent several months in the
kingdom last year.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.551
In Washington, Republican
Senator John McCain asked the
general tapped to be the next
Army

02:31.551 --> 02:34.588
chief about arming recruiters.

02:34.588 --> 02:38.291
GEN. MARK MILLEY, Army Chief of
Staff Nominee: I think that's
complicated legally, and

02:38.291 --> 02:39.292
there's issues involved
throughout the country.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.694
(CROSSTALK)

02:40.694 --> 02:41.862
GEN. MARK MILLEY: But we will
have to come to grips with that.
And it certainly should

02:41.862 --> 02:41.995
be...

02:41.995 --> 02:43.563
(CROSSTALK)

02:43.563 --> 02:45.565
SEN. JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona:
If the legal part of it can be
resolved, do you think that

02:45.565 --> 02:49.603
they should under certain
conditions be armed?

02:49.603 --> 02:56.009
GEN. MARK MILLEY: I think,
under certain conditions, both
on military bails and in

02:56.009 --> 02:58.779
out-stations, recruiting
stations, reserve centers, that
we should seriously consider

02:58.779 --> 03:01.214
it. In some cases, I
think it's appropriate.

03:01.214 --> 03:05.419
GWEN IFILL: President Obama
pledged today the U.S. will do
everything in its power to

03:05.419 --> 03:09.423
protect American military
members from attacks like last
week's.

03:09.423 --> 03:14.061
JUDY WOODRUFF: A prosecutor in
Texas says it's too early to
tell what happened to a

03:14.061 --> 03:19.499
woman who died in police custody
last week. Sandra Bland was
found dead in her jail

03:19.499 --> 03:25.072
cell three days after she was
arrested. Her death was
originally ruled a suicide, but

03:25.072 --> 03:29.509
authorities are now treating the
case as if it were a murder
investigation.

03:29.509 --> 03:34.414
Authorities also released a
surveillance video showing no
movement outside her cell until

03:34.414 --> 03:37.584
medical personnel
arrived on the scene.

03:37.584 --> 03:43.590
GWEN IFILL: Two-term Ohio
Governor John Kasich has become
the 16th Republican to enter

03:43.590 --> 03:49.262
the 2016 presidential race. The
former congressman is known for
his record of fiscal
conservatism.

03:49.262 --> 03:53.800
As chairman of the House Budget
Committee, he helped secure a
balanced budget deal in

03:53.800 --> 03:59.506
1997. Kasich officially
announced his candidacy today at
Ohio State University in
Columbus,

03:59.506 --> 04:01.842
with his family at his side.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.979
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate: I will
promise you that my top priority

04:05.979 --> 04:12.385
will get this country on the
path to fiscal independence,
strength, and we will rebuild

04:12.385 --> 04:16.490
the economy of this country,
because creating jobs is our
highest moral purpose, and we

04:16.490 --> 04:18.592
will move to get that done!

04:18.592 --> 04:21.294
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:21.294 --> 04:26.600
GWEN IFILL: In other campaign
news, Donald Trump lashed out at
fellow Republican presidential

04:26.600 --> 04:30.804
contender Lindsey Graham, who
has been critical of the New
York businessman. Before a
crowd

04:30.804 --> 04:36.543
of about 500 people in South
Carolina, Trump called the
Palmetto State senator a "total

04:36.543 --> 04:40.213
lightweight" -- unquote -- and
read what he said was Graham's
cell phone number aloud

04:40.213 --> 04:43.383
from a piece of paper.

04:43.383 --> 04:46.119
Trump said Graham gave him the
contact information years ago,
when the two were more friendly.

04:48.021 --> 04:52.692
JUDY WOODRUFF: A federal
appeals court in Chicago
overturned some of the most
sensational

04:52.692 --> 04:57.964
corruption convictions of former
Illinois Governor Rod
Blagojevich. He's currently

04:57.964 --> 05:04.771
serving a 14-year sentence after
he was convicted in 2011 of
trying to sell President Obama's

05:04.771 --> 05:09.509
former Senate seat to the
highest bidder. Prosecutors
could appeal the ruling or
decide

05:09.509 --> 05:13.547
to retry Blagojevich
on the dropped counts.

05:13.547 --> 05:18.485
GWEN IFILL: Voters headed to
the polls in small numbers today
in Burundi, where protests

05:18.485 --> 05:23.490
and violence dampened the
turnout. At least two people, a
policeman and a civilian, were

05:23.490 --> 05:28.895
killed in a string of explosions
and gunfire that rocked the
capital overnight. In spite

05:28.895 --> 05:33.700
of that, most polls managed to
open on time. Opposition groups
are boycotting the election

05:33.700 --> 05:38.572
in protest of the current
president's decision to run for
a third term.

05:38.572 --> 05:43.276
JUDY WOODRUFF: A mass funeral
was held in Southeastern Turkey
for victims of yesterday's

05:43.276 --> 05:49.382
suicide bombing in Suruc, near
the border with Syria. Crowds
of mourners wept and

05:49.382 --> 05:55.755
shouted over the flag-draped
coffins as they were laid out;
32 people died and 100 were

05:55.755 --> 06:00.794
injured when the blast ripped
through a rally of young
political activists. Meanwhile,

06:00.794 --> 06:05.131
Turkey's prime minister
announced the suspect had ties
to Islamic State terrorists, but

06:05.131 --> 06:08.435
refrained from identifying
the individual.

06:08.435 --> 06:12.772
GWEN IFILL: Dozens of mayors
and governors from major cities
around the world gathered

06:12.772 --> 06:17.677
at the Vatican today to demand
bold action on climate change.
The summit was designed

06:17.677 --> 06:23.350
to increase pressure on national
leaders ahead of climate
negotiations in Paris later this

06:23.350 --> 06:28.388
year. Last month, Pope Francis
released a landmark
environmental encyclical, urging

06:28.388 --> 06:32.759
the world to do more to fight
human-induced global warming.

06:32.759 --> 06:38.431
JUDY WOODRUFF: New research
suggests older women with mild
memory problems worsen twice

06:38.431 --> 06:43.803
as quickly as men. That was in
a report presented today at an
international conference

06:43.803 --> 06:49.476
on Alzheimer's disease here in
Washington. Women make up
nearly two-thirds of all
Alzheimer's

06:49.476 --> 06:53.947
cases in the U.S., but
scientists say they are still
baffled as to why the disease
disproportionately

06:53.947 --> 06:57.484
affects so many more
women than men.

06:57.484 --> 07:02.656
GWEN IFILL: Stocks fell on Wall
Street today after several
disappointing corporate earnings

07:02.656 --> 07:09.129
reports. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost 181
points to close at 17919. The
Nasdaq

07:09.129 --> 07:13.166
fell more than 10 points and the
S&P 500 slipped nine points.

07:13.166 --> 07:19.139
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour": the power of
early treatment for HIV to halt

07:19.139 --> 07:26.980
the spread of AIDS; American
civilians joining the front
lines to fight back ISIS, and
much

07:26.980 --> 07:31.518
more.

07:31.518 --> 07:42.962
GWEN IFILL: Patients, advocates
and scientists are hailing new
studies that show the value

07:42.962 --> 07:47.701
of getting AIDS drugs to
people early and often.

07:47.701 --> 07:54.374
The three-decade-long fight
against AIDS has seen a series
of breakthroughs in recent
weeks,

07:54.374 --> 08:00.947
showing momentum in the push for
an HIV cure. Yesterday, at the
2015 International AIDS

08:00.947 --> 08:08.288
Society Conference in Vancouver,
researchers detailed some
dramatic findings. They
confirmed

08:08.288 --> 08:13.460
that, for people with HIV,
starting treatments with
antiretroviral drugs early did
prevent

08:13.460 --> 08:17.330
AIDS-related illness and deaths.

08:17.330 --> 08:22.669
Until now, there had been
concern that starting such
therapy too early might increase
patients'

08:22.669 --> 08:28.908
risk of cardiovascular and renal
disease. That news came on top
of another surprising

08:28.908 --> 08:34.948
development, as doctors at the
conference described the case of
a French teenager. The

08:34.948 --> 08:40.920
so-far unidentified girl was
born with HIV, and received
antiretroviral treatment until

08:40.920 --> 08:47.327
she was 6. Twelve years later,
she's still free of the virus.
It appears to be the

08:47.327 --> 08:51.965
first confirmed long-term
remission in a child infected
from birth.

08:51.965 --> 08:55.635
MICHEL SIDIBE, Executive
Director, UNAIDS: People were
saying that we were foolish

08:55.635 --> 08:58.938
dreamers, that we
were even naive.

08:58.938 --> 09:05.812
GWEN IFILL: And that followed
word last week that the U.N.
reached its 2015 goal of

09:05.812 --> 09:10.450
providing access to HIV
treatment for 15 million people
worldwide, nine months ahead of
schedule.

09:12.051 --> 09:16.489
MICHEL SIDIBE: And they said it
was too costly. But we have
been able to demonstrate

09:16.489 --> 09:21.728
that they were wrong. And they
were saying that the costs will
never go down.

09:21.728 --> 09:26.599
GWEN IFILL: The report also
said that a once inconceivable
goal, ending the AIDS epidemic,

09:26.599 --> 09:32.272
is in sight by the year 2030.

09:32.272 --> 09:36.810
So let's look closer at the
growth of treatment, the push to
dramatically expand it to
unheard-of

09:36.810 --> 09:42.382
levels and what these drugs have
meant to people coping with the
still-incurable disease.

09:42.382 --> 09:46.986
Deborah Birx is the point person
for the government as the U.S.
global AIDS coordinator. She

09:46.986 --> 09:51.958
joins us from Vancouver, where
the conference is still under
way. And Justin Goforth is

09:51.958 --> 09:55.795
a nurse and director of outreach
for the Whitman-Walker Health
care clinic here in Washington.
He

09:55.795 --> 09:59.232
was diagnosed with
HIV back in 1992.

09:59.232 --> 10:03.837
Dr. Birx let's talk about these
numbers, which are quite
stunning. We're talking about

10:03.837 --> 10:10.109
a 48 percent decrease in HIV
infections in children just
since 2009. That's in 21
priority

10:10.109 --> 10:13.346
countries. What is the
significance of this?

10:13.346 --> 10:17.016
DR. DEBORAH BIRX, U.S. Global
AIDS Coordinator: It really
shows that when we focus and
work

10:17.016 --> 10:20.620
together, we can
achieve amazing goals.

10:20.620 --> 10:25.425
So, under the global plan that
was launched by PEPFAR and
UNAIDS just a few short years

10:25.425 --> 10:30.997
ago, it really mobilized
governments and communities to
really move forward in an
organized and

10:30.997 --> 10:34.400
focused way to have this
dramatic change in the number of
new infections in pediatrics.

10:36.135 --> 10:41.207
GWEN IFILL: Justin Goforth, you
were hands-on every single day
dealing with this for some

10:41.207 --> 10:44.477
years. How has it played out in
a health clinic like yours,
which serves so many people

10:44.477 --> 10:47.413
in a highly affected community?

10:47.413 --> 10:49.315
JUSTIN GOFORTH, Whitman-Walker
Health: It's been quite an
evolution of course with the

10:49.315 --> 10:52.385
technology and
science around HIV.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.855
We really needed to get to a
point that we didn't just have
effective treatments, but

10:55.855 --> 11:00.159
that we had treatments that
could actually be managed within
a daily life of the people

11:00.159 --> 11:02.695
we take care of. And
that's where we're at.

11:02.695 --> 11:06.933
And that's why things are
changing so quickly and it's so
important to pay attention to

11:06.933 --> 11:09.369
the issue, because if you can
get in care and stay in care on
treatment, it is a manageable

11:09.369 --> 11:10.603
chronic illness.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.238
GWEN IFILL: And that's
what's happened with you?

11:12.238 --> 11:15.141
JUSTIN GOFORTH: That's
correct. It's been since 1992.

11:15.141 --> 11:21.848
In, I think, '96, I was taking
at least 40 pills a day. That
was five times a day,

11:21.848 --> 11:25.618
three times a day, had to be
exactly eight hours apart with a
full meal. Nobody eats

11:25.618 --> 11:29.289
like that. Two times a day had
been to be with a completely
empty stomach.

11:29.289 --> 11:33.726
They were effective, but they
were toxic and not really
manageable in people's lives.
And

11:33.726 --> 11:38.164
that's not where we are. Where
we are today is the majority of
the people we take care

11:38.164 --> 11:42.068
of take one pill a day and
manage their illness very
effectively and plan on living
full lives.

11:43.803 --> 11:48.308
GWEN IFILL: Dr. Birx, many of
the findings that you have been
talking about in Vancouver

11:48.308 --> 11:52.178
have to do with children
worldwide, where there has been
great impact over the years,

11:52.178 --> 11:54.314
especially among the youngest.

11:54.314 --> 11:59.652
Tell me about the significance
of how soon you begin to act and
provide this medication

11:59.652 --> 12:01.921
for children.

12:01.921 --> 12:06.059
DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Well, both
children and adults, so it's
been incredibly exciting to

12:06.059 --> 12:08.328
be back in Vancouver.

12:08.328 --> 12:14.968
As you heard there from Justin,
we had 19 years ago in this very
city the announcement

12:14.968 --> 12:20.073
of highly effective treatment.
And for myself and many
clinicians, that was when we
were

12:20.073 --> 12:25.678
actually able to keep our
patients alive. So the patients
that made to it 1996, if

12:25.678 --> 12:28.648
you were in the developed world,
you were able to actually live
effectively. And that

12:28.648 --> 12:31.050
was so extraordinary.

12:31.050 --> 12:37.523
To be back here 19 years later
and here now, through the really
groundbreaking trial that

12:37.523 --> 12:44.163
was done around the world, the
START trial, it says, if we
start people early, they can

12:44.163 --> 12:49.002
live full and productive lives,
no matter where they are. So
that theme of that conference,

12:49.002 --> 12:54.374
which was one hope, one world,
can finally be realized with
this new trial results.

12:54.374 --> 13:00.546
And we are so excited to
translate that science
immediately into programs
through PEPFAR.

13:00.546 --> 13:07.186
GWEN IFILL: You also were --
part of your role, also, Dr.
Birx, was to provide
antiretrovirals

13:07.186 --> 13:11.624
for 15 million people by the
year 2015, and you got there
early. How did that happen?

13:13.626 --> 13:18.865
DR. DEBORAH BIRX: You know,
that is so extraordinary,
because when UNAIDS said that we
were going

13:18.865 --> 13:25.071
to get to 15 -- by 15 in 2011,
everyone was incredibly
doubtful.

13:25.071 --> 13:30.376
And those of us who could really
see the vision were really
excited about translating that

13:30.376 --> 13:34.747
vision into practice. And I
think, through the funding of
the Global Fund and the funding

13:34.747 --> 13:40.053
through PEPFAR, and it's really
-- it's new collaboration and
partnerships with host
governments

13:40.053 --> 13:43.790
and civil society allowed us all
to really sprint in a way we
didn't know we were capable

13:43.790 --> 13:46.092
of doing.

13:46.092 --> 13:51.230
And so to say now that we have
the last piece of the puzzle and
the last tool that will

13:51.230 --> 13:56.369
really allow us to move and move
back into this sprint mode to
really reach people as

13:56.369 --> 14:01.441
quickly as we can, not only with
effective therapy, which, as --
but as what Justin said,

14:01.441 --> 14:05.845
not only effective, but a
therapy that can be utilized as
a community so that people

14:05.845 --> 14:10.349
can stay on treatment and
thrive. And so this really is a
unique opportunity.

14:10.349 --> 14:16.055
GWEN IFILL: Justin Goforth, in
order to treat, in order provide
this therapy, this

14:16.055 --> 14:21.027
wonderful technology, people
have to be willing to take an
early diagnosis as well. Has

14:21.027 --> 14:25.431
that changed over time? The
numbers are not so positive here
in Washington, D.C.

14:25.431 --> 14:28.634
JUSTIN GOFORTH: If you look
over time, our numbers actually
are getting tremendously

14:28.634 --> 14:30.737
better.

14:30.737 --> 14:34.507
I believe we had about 500 new
infections last year, according
to the new data that

14:34.507 --> 14:40.580
was out, and five to 10 years
ago, that was easily 1,000 to
1,500 or for new infections.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.283
So, we have changed the number
of new infections dramatically.
That's really a lot about

14:44.283 --> 14:50.623
getting a lot of people tested,
those folks that HIV-positive
into care.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.859
We have lots of data to suggest
that it's really difficult to
change people's behaviors.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.161
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

14:55.161 --> 14:58.631
JUSTIN GOFORTH: But getting
them into care and on treatment
actually doesn't just keep

14:58.631 --> 15:01.768
that person healthy and well for
a life span; it also prevents
them from infecting other

15:01.768 --> 15:04.137
individuals.

15:04.137 --> 15:09.842
That's an historic marriage of
two -- public health prevention
and treatment all coming

15:09.842 --> 15:14.380
together at the same time. And
having a manageable treatment
was necessary to get

15:14.380 --> 15:17.383
to the point that we could
use this as prevention.

15:17.383 --> 15:20.953
And so that's what, I think, is
really see -- we're seeing a
turnaround in the numbers

15:20.953 --> 15:26.492
in all of our urban centers in
the United States, but
particularly here in D.C., where

15:26.492 --> 15:29.128
we used to be seen as the worst
of the worst. That's not the
case actually more with our

15:29.128 --> 15:31.597
new numbers.

15:31.597 --> 15:36.435
GWEN IFILL: Dr. Birx, 2030,
you're talking about getting to
zero. What is the possibility

15:36.435 --> 15:39.105
of that and how
do you get there?

15:39.105 --> 15:44.544
DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Well, we're
talking about ending AIDS as a
public health threat, so

15:44.544 --> 15:50.149
we certainly want all of our HIV
positives, the 37 million people
living with HIV right

15:50.149 --> 15:55.855
now, to know their status and to
thrive and to be on medication
so they can thrive.

15:55.855 --> 16:00.459
To get there to the end is that
we're going to require us to
bring all our prevention

16:00.459 --> 16:07.733
tools to the table and expand
them in an appropriate way in
absolute partnership with the
community,

16:07.733 --> 16:12.805
and I think we have been using
the Whitman-Walker example. You
can see what that clinic and

16:12.805 --> 16:16.142
its community outreach
has been able to do.

16:16.142 --> 16:20.246
We want to translate what the
Whitman-Walker clinic and others
have been able to do in

16:20.246 --> 16:25.852
Washington, D.C., to every city,
every village and every
community around the globe. And

16:25.852 --> 16:29.322
you can see from what we just
heard from Justin, it's
possible.

16:29.322 --> 16:34.493
GWEN IFILL: Dr. Deborah Birx,
U.S. global AIDS coordinator,
and Justin Goforth, the

16:34.493 --> 16:36.028
director of outreach at the
Whitman-Walker Clinic here in
Washington, thank you both

16:36.028 --> 16:37.396
very much.

16:37.396 --> 16:41.033
JUSTIN GOFORTH: My pleasure.

16:41.033 --> 16:47.106
DR. DEBORAH BIRX:
Thank you, Gwen.

16:47.106 --> 16:54.247
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight: an
exclusive story from Iraq on
American citizens, civilians,

16:54.247 --> 16:58.117
fighting the Islamic State
group. Many are former U.S.
military, but some have never

16:58.117 --> 17:00.453
seen a battle before.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.656
Special correspondent
Marcia Biggs reports.

17:03.656 --> 17:10.196
MARCIA BIGGS: American boots
are back on the ground in Iraq.
This time, they're volunteers,

17:10.196 --> 17:16.369
U.S. military veterans on the
front lines against the Islamic
State, and among them,

17:16.369 --> 17:21.440
one woman; 25-year-old Samantha
Johnston was a private in the
Army for two years before,

17:21.440 --> 17:25.244
she left to be a stay-at-home
mom to her three children.

17:25.244 --> 17:29.248
When the Islamic State
dominating the news

17:29.248 --> 17:34.287
last year, she says she sat in
her North Carolina home,
watching videos of their
atrocities

17:34.287 --> 17:37.089
and felt compelled
to join the fight.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.492
SAMANTHA JOHNSTON, Former U.S.
Army Private: Something inside
of me just snapped, and

17:39.492 --> 17:48.801
I couldn't allow myself to sit
down and do nothing, when all of
these children here are

17:48.801 --> 17:53.072
in trouble, and I and me and my
family are just living happily
in America.

17:53.072 --> 17:57.610
MARCIA BIGGS: She made contact
with other volunteers through
social media sites. And

17:57.610 --> 18:02.448
three months ago, she packed her
bags and flew to Iraq, where she
volunteered with the

18:02.448 --> 18:07.753
Kurdish army, the Peshmerga, in
the fight against I.S. She says
she's become close

18:07.753 --> 18:10.990
to the Kurdish soldiers in her
unit, even listing herself on
Facebook by a Kurdish name.

18:12.658 --> 18:16.896
SAMANTHA JOHNSTON: They became
my family. And I plan to stay
here for as long as I

18:16.896 --> 18:20.599
can, as long as they
need me to be here.

18:20.599 --> 18:25.738
MARCIA BIGGS: She spends her
days training for battle, but
has not yet seen any combat.

18:25.738 --> 18:30.309
Back in her Army days, her job
was making maps for deployed
units, but she never got

18:30.309 --> 18:32.678
the chance to go overseas.

18:32.678 --> 18:36.315
SAMANTHA JOHNSTON: I really
wanted to be deployed, but my
unit never deployed.

18:36.315 --> 18:39.318
MARCIA BIGGS: Is
that why you're here?

18:39.318 --> 18:44.023
SAMANTHA JOHNSTON: Probably.
It's probably one of the many
reasons I'm here.

18:44.023 --> 18:48.728
MARCIA BIGGS: And she's not the
only one. Officials at the U.S.
State Department believe

18:48.728 --> 18:54.033
that more than 150 Americans
have voluntarily traveled to
Iraq and Syria to fight in the

18:54.033 --> 18:56.469
ongoing conflict.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.839
KEITH BROOMFIELD, U.S. Citizen:
I'm here as Gelhat Rumet. I'm
from the Boston area,

18:59.839 --> 19:01.807
from Lynn.

19:01.807 --> 19:06.445
MARCIA BIGGS: Just last month,
36-year-old Keith Broomfield
became the first American

19:06.445 --> 19:11.450
known to die while fighting I.S.
He was killed near the Syrian
town of Kobani.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.918
JEREMY WOODARD, U.S. Military
Veteran: The next village is
right over there. That is

19:12.918 --> 19:15.254
I.S.' home flag.

19:15.254 --> 19:19.892
MARCIA BIGGS: Many of the
volunteers we met are military
veterans, like 29-year-old

19:19.892 --> 19:23.996
Jeremy Woodard, who spent years
fighting in Iraq and
Afghanistan, but struggled back
home.

19:25.698 --> 19:32.471
JEREMY WOODARD: It was hard to
get a job. You barely can get a
job at McDonald's flipping

19:32.471 --> 19:39.545
a burger. They look at you,
they see your resume for serving
in the U.S. Army honorably,

19:39.545 --> 19:44.750
but they look at you like you're
a hazard, you know, you're going
to hurt somebody.

19:44.750 --> 19:49.955
MARCIA BIGGS: When I.S.
fighters swept through Iraq last
summer, Woodard also left family

19:49.955 --> 19:53.993
behind, jumping at the chance to
get involved in the fight, in
honor of his fellow soldiers

19:53.993 --> 19:57.463
who fought and died in
the U.S. war in Iraq.

19:57.463 --> 20:02.802
JEREMY WOODARD: All those
people who got killed over here
for fighting for a cause,

20:02.802 --> 20:04.537
I didn't want them
to die in vain.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.872
MAN: There's been a lot of
intense fighting going on.

20:06.872 --> 20:11.444
MARCIA BIGGS: Woodard's unit
has seen some combat, fighting
alongside the Peshmerga.

20:11.444 --> 20:16.182
Back in April, they established
this defensive line, after a
fierce battle with I.S.
fighters,

20:16.182 --> 20:20.219
a force these volunteers say
is one to be reckoned with.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.556
MAN: We don't recognize them as
terrorists. We actually
recognize them as an actual

20:23.556 --> 20:29.261
Army. They're well-trained,
sophisticated. Whenever they
get into battle, it's well

20:29.261 --> 20:31.897
-- very disciplined manner.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.567
MARCIA BIGGS: Despite never
serving in the military, Danny
was one of the volunteers

20:34.567 --> 20:37.736
who was wounded in that
battle, shot in the leg.

20:37.736 --> 20:41.674
MAN: Are you ready
to die for this?

20:41.674 --> 20:45.211
MAN: Am I ready to die for
this? Well, I have been out
here for the last seven months

20:45.211 --> 20:49.315
already. I pretty much made up
my mind to go ahead and help out
these people, help out

20:49.315 --> 20:54.987
those people that aren't able to
help themselves. So, if that
will be a matter of fact to

20:54.987 --> 20:58.491
do so, then, hey,
it is what it is.

20:58.491 --> 21:01.927
MARCIA BIGGS: The volunteers
say they're here out of moral
obligation. They're not

21:01.927 --> 21:06.265
even being paid. And while it's
not technically illegal, the
U.S. State Department is adamant

21:06.265 --> 21:10.503
that it doesn't support their
participation in this conflict.

21:10.503 --> 21:14.240
But for these Americans,
it wasn't even a question.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.809
JUSTIN SMITH, U.S. Military
Veteran: I'm having a great
time out here. I feel more

21:16.809 --> 21:19.812
comfortable here than I
ever felt in America.

21:19.812 --> 21:24.150
MARCIA BIGGS: After serving in
Iraq, Justin Smith says he
suffered from post-traumatic

21:24.150 --> 21:29.388
stress disorder. Several
attempts at treatment failed,
and he finally sold everything
he

21:29.388 --> 21:34.426
owned to buy a one-way ticket
back. He says Iraq seems like
paradise compared to the hell

21:34.426 --> 21:36.862
of staying in the U.S.

21:36.862 --> 21:41.767
JUSTIN SMITH: In the States,
there is too much idle time, too
much time just doing nothing

21:41.767 --> 21:53.179
or sitting around and drinking,
or anything like that. It's
better here. Like I have

21:53.179 --> 21:57.983
said countless times, I get
to do my job. I love my job.

21:57.983 --> 22:01.053
MARCIA BIGGS: Do you think you
can ever go back to the U.S.?

22:01.053 --> 22:03.989
JUSTIN SMITH: Probably. I
mean, I won't like it, but I
will have to go back eventually.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.760
MAN: I don't think I
could leave for good.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.864
MARCIA BIGGS: While the
Peshmerga doesn't officially
allow foreigners to volunteer,

22:11.864 --> 22:15.301
local authorities often look the
other way when volunteers
arrive. And they have been

22:15.301 --> 22:20.506
largely embraced, sometimes
simply out of Kurdish
hospitality.

22:20.506 --> 22:25.544
But one Kurdish officer told us
that, while he appreciates the
volunteers, this is not

22:25.544 --> 22:27.947
what they need from
the United States.

22:27.947 --> 22:34.587
MAN: We don't need exactly
people to come fight for us. We
need weapons. We need

22:34.587 --> 22:40.025
equipment, supplies from
American government, from the --
from different countries.

22:40.025 --> 22:44.430
MARCIA BIGGS: We asked Jeremy
why he thinks it's his business
to fight in a war that the

22:44.430 --> 22:47.266
U.S. is not directly waging.

22:47.266 --> 22:50.536
JEREMY WOODARD: It should be
everybody's business. If it
doesn't get stopped over

22:50.536 --> 22:51.837
here, it's going
to keep spreading.

22:51.837 --> 22:56.008
MARCIA BIGGS: Do you think
there are so many ISIS sleeper
cells in the United States?

22:56.008 --> 22:56.875
JEREMY WOODARD: I believe it.
I think there's quite a few.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.377
MARCIA BIGGS: Why
do you believe that?

22:58.377 --> 23:06.218
JEREMY WOODARD: I mean, that's
a good question. I mean, they
keep claiming that they're

23:06.218 --> 23:10.356
there. I mean, who knows. It's
a possibility that they're not.
But, honestly, I believe

23:10.356 --> 23:11.657
that they are.

23:11.657 --> 23:14.727
MARCIA BIGGS: So why not be in
the us searching out sleeper
cells?

23:14.727 --> 23:18.330
JEREMY WOODARD: I mean, this is
where the fight is right now.
It's got to get controlled

23:18.330 --> 23:20.599
here.

23:20.599 --> 23:25.971
MARCIA BIGGS: Johnston faces a
firestorm of controversy over
leaving behind her 5-year-old

23:25.971 --> 23:30.809
and her 3-year-old twins to
volunteer in a war on the other
side of the world, where

23:30.809 --> 23:36.615
we're told I.S. fighters have
put a $300,000 price on her
head.

23:36.615 --> 23:41.487
SAMANTHA JOHNSTON: I see these
refugee children. I see just
the normal poor children here,

23:41.487 --> 23:47.159
and I think of my children. And
my children are happy. They're
safe. They're fed.

23:47.159 --> 23:51.563
They have more than they
need. And they're OK.

23:51.563 --> 23:56.669
MARCIA BIGGS: You said, "My
kids have everything they need,"
but they don't have their mom.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.406
SAMANTHA JOHNSTON: They don't,
but I will spend the rest of my
life making that up to

24:00.406 --> 24:01.407
them.

24:01.407 --> 24:04.977
MARCIA BIGGS: You cried all
the way to the airport?

24:04.977 --> 24:26.498
SAMANTHA JOHNSTON: I don't want
to think about it. That was the
hardest day of my

24:26.498 --> 24:43.048
life. I will never leave them
again when I come back, never.

24:43.048 --> 24:50.122
Every day is a battle not to
come back. Every day, I -- I
look at prices to fly back. But

24:50.122 --> 24:56.095
I have a -- I have a goal here,
and I can't just give up.

24:56.095 --> 25:01.333
MARCIA BIGGS: It's a goal and a
cause they all believe in. But
it's also an escape.

25:02.901 --> 25:09.074
JEREMY WOODARD: It's an escape,
yes. It's like a vacation here.
It's kind of sick

25:09.074 --> 25:13.512
to say. After I graduated, I
went straight to the Army. I
was 17 when I went in. And

25:13.512 --> 25:19.852
I just know war. That's it.

25:19.852 --> 25:28.527
I'm still searching. Searching
for what, I don't know,
searching for a part of myself,

25:28.527 --> 25:34.533
where I belong. I belong
in a place like this.

25:34.533 --> 25:38.504
MARCIA BIGGS: For those still
searching, the fight against
I.S. provides yet another

25:38.504 --> 25:41.106
war.

25:41.106 --> 25:45.677
For the "PBS NewsHour," I am
Marcia Biggs in Northern Iraq.

25:45.677 --> 25:52.251
JUDY WOODRUFF: Since our
interview, Samantha Johnston
left Iraq for Europe and posted
on

25:52.251 --> 25:57.089
her Facebook page that, although
it is -- quote -- "time to start
heading back to my family,"

25:57.089 --> 26:03.162
she indicated that she
will be returning to Iraq.

26:03.162 --> 26:15.374
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead on the
"NewsHour": the increasing
numbers of children living

26:15.374 --> 26:19.812
in poverty since the great
recession; and how one family's
premature baby sparked a

26:19.812 --> 26:26.151
larger debate on
employer-provided insurance and
the right to privacy.

26:26.151 --> 26:31.590
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the next in
our series of interviews with
the candidates running

26:31.590 --> 26:35.027
for president in 2016.

26:35.027 --> 26:39.832
Tonight, we sit down with former
U.S. Senator Rick Santorum of
Pennsylvania, who made a

26:39.832 --> 26:43.469
run for the Republican
nomination in 2012, and he is
trying again.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.103
Welcome, Senator Santorum.

26:45.103 --> 26:45.037
RICK SANTORUM (R), Presidential
Candidate: Thank you, Judy.
Good to be with you.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.440
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we were just
listening to that report about
Americans joining the

26:48.440 --> 26:50.375
fight against ISIS.

26:50.375 --> 26:54.780
To you, what's the greater
threat to this country, ISIS or
Iran?

26:54.780 --> 27:01.487
RICK SANTORUM: I think ISIS is
the more near-term threat,
obviously the jihadis that

27:01.487 --> 27:05.557
they encourage to attack here in
the United States and obviously
the hot war that's going

27:05.557 --> 27:08.794
on in the Middle East.

27:08.794 --> 27:12.197
But, clearly, the long-term
threat is Iran, and I have been
saying that really for the

27:12.197 --> 27:17.836
better part of 12 years. When I
was in the Senate, I authored
bills on sanctioning Iran.

27:17.836 --> 27:21.874
I was talking about their
nuclear program and how an
Iranian nuclear program is
really

27:21.874 --> 27:25.611
the worst possible thing that
can happen to this country.
There really isn't any more

27:25.611 --> 27:32.384
threat that's more dangerous,
that's more existential than
Iran with the ability to

27:32.384 --> 27:36.889
use a nuclear weapon, maybe use
it as an EMP, use it as a dirty
bomb, use it through terrorists,

27:36.889 --> 27:39.224
whatever the case may be.

27:39.224 --> 27:44.263
I have no doubt that, unlike
other nuclear powers, Iran is a
country that is driven by

27:44.263 --> 27:48.433
a theocracy that will use that
nuclear weapon against America.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.402
JUDY WOODRUFF: And all your
Republican opponents agree with
you on that. They don't like

27:50.402 --> 27:53.038
that deal either.

27:53.038 --> 27:57.409
However, Senator Scott -- or
Governor Scott Walker is saying
that, on the first day he

27:57.409 --> 28:01.613
became president, he would be
willing to go to war against
Iran if necessary. Do you

28:01.613 --> 28:04.182
agree with him on that?

28:04.182 --> 28:07.853
RICK SANTORUM: I have very,
very clear from the very
beginning of looking at Iran,
and

28:07.853 --> 28:10.355
looking at their theology,
looking at what their objective,
looking at what they say.

28:12.057 --> 28:14.893
One of the things we should have
learned from history, we should
have learned from history,

28:14.893 --> 28:18.730
is actually pay attention to
what leaders say they're going
to do, because sometimes

28:18.730 --> 28:22.167
and many times, when they're
given the capability, they
actually do it.

28:22.167 --> 28:26.838
And if you listen to what Iran
is saying -- and even just the
other day -- where they talk

28:26.838 --> 28:30.275
about we're going to rule
America, we're going to wipe out
America, we're going to destroy

28:30.275 --> 28:33.845
America, now we're giving them
the capability. I mean, there
is no doubt, with this plan,

28:33.845 --> 28:36.515
we are putting them on a path to
have the capability to do just
that.

28:36.515 --> 28:39.284
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so
what about going to war?

28:39.284 --> 28:42.454
RICK SANTORUM: The answer is,
if I -- when I become president,
from the day after I get

28:42.454 --> 28:46.024
-- I'm elected president, I will
be working with our allies.

28:46.024 --> 28:49.728
I have no doubt, no doubt that
Iran will be in violation of
this agreement multiple times

28:49.728 --> 28:52.264
by the time I'm
elected president.

28:52.264 --> 28:55.767
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, in the
last presidential election --
let's talk about that -- you ran

28:55.767 --> 29:00.339
a strong campaign. You came in
second to Mitt Romney, a distant
second, but you came

29:00.339 --> 29:01.573
in second.

29:01.573 --> 29:04.343
RICK SANTORUM: Won 11 states.
That's pretty respectable.

29:04.343 --> 29:08.013
JUDY WOODRUFF: This year, you
not only are running against
more candidates. You're

29:08.013 --> 29:11.917
running against more people who
are committed conservatives,
people like Mike Huckabee,

29:11.917 --> 29:15.420
like Ted Cruz, Ben
Carson, Scott Walker.

29:15.420 --> 29:18.323
What does Rick Santorum
bring that they don't?

29:18.323 --> 29:20.859
RICK SANTORUM: Well, I would
say several things, number one,
experience on national

29:20.859 --> 29:24.029
security, which is a huge deal.

29:24.029 --> 29:28.533
This is an issue I have been
wrestling with now with eight
years on the Armed Services

29:28.533 --> 29:31.470
Committee, a lot of experience
in this area, someone who has
got a track record and is

29:31.470 --> 29:34.139
prepared to lead.

29:34.139 --> 29:40.712
And, you know, three months ago,
I was in ISIS magazine, on the
American version, under

29:40.712 --> 29:45.317
the title, "In the Words of Our
Enemy," and had a picture of me
and a quote from me. The

29:45.317 --> 29:50.088
enemy knows who I am. I know
who they are. And I think at a
time when our country is

29:50.088 --> 29:53.258
facing this kind of severe
threat, having someone with
experience in this area is
important.

29:55.060 --> 29:58.930
Second, I announced from a
factory floor in Western
Pennsylvania. And I think our
message

29:58.930 --> 30:03.001
of bringing manufacturing back
to this country, helping
blue-collar Americans and lower-
and

30:03.001 --> 30:06.905
middle-income Americans have
good-paying jobs and be able to
rise, it's going to be -- and

30:06.905 --> 30:08.473
our platform of how we're going
to do that is different than
everybody else in the field.

30:10.175 --> 30:12.878
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Senator, at
this point, you know all of
these people I have named

30:12.878 --> 30:17.282
and others are running ahead of
you in the polls. If you don't
make that cut to be

30:17.282 --> 30:20.919
the 10 candidates on the stage
for that first debate that FOX
News is sponsoring in a couple

30:20.919 --> 30:22.988
of weeks, what are
you going to do?

30:22.988 --> 30:28.427
RICK SANTORUM: I will keep
going back to Iowa and keep
hustling and campaigning.

30:28.427 --> 30:32.464
What I found out -- four years
ago, we had a straw poll in
Iowa. I finished fourth,

30:32.464 --> 30:37.202
almost fifth, and it didn't have
very much impact. The person
who won didn't win a

30:37.202 --> 30:41.273
delegate. The person who came
in with tens of millions of
dollars and was at the top

30:41.273 --> 30:44.876
of the polls this time four
years ago didn't win a delegate.

30:44.876 --> 30:48.447
The guy that win a bunch of
delegates, I was the person who
really focused on what the

30:48.447 --> 30:52.818
goal is. And the goal is not
polls in February -- in --
excuse me -- in July, but
results

30:52.818 --> 30:53.719
in February.

30:53.719 --> 30:56.321
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's
talk some issues.

30:56.321 --> 31:00.759
John Kasich, as you know,
announced today. He became the
16th Republican to jump in

31:00.759 --> 31:05.797
the race. He's putting a lot of
emphasis on income inequality.
There's a new report

31:05.797 --> 31:10.535
out by the Annie E. Casey
Foundation that says 22 percent
of American children today

31:10.535 --> 31:13.171
are living in poverty.

31:13.171 --> 31:16.808
First of all, do you accept that
number, and, second, what would
you do about it?

31:16.808 --> 31:19.845
RICK SANTORUM: I would suspect
that the vast majority of those
22 million kids living

31:19.845 --> 31:20.545
in poverty are living in...

31:20.545 --> 31:21.913
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Twenty-two percent.

31:21.913 --> 31:23.815
RICK SANTORUM: Twenty-two
percent -- excuse me -- living
in poverty are living in broken

31:23.815 --> 31:26.618
homes.

31:26.618 --> 31:30.589
If you -- I'm actually one of
the few politicians who walks
around holding up two books at
my

31:30.589 --> 31:35.560
town hall meetings, one, Robert
Putnam, a liberal sociologist
from Harvard, and Charles

31:35.560 --> 31:39.131
Murray, a libertarian with the
American Enterprise Institute,
and talk about those two books

31:39.131 --> 31:41.500
from the far left
and the far right.

31:41.500 --> 31:45.270
I think both come down to the
same conclusion, that the reason
the middle is hollowing out,

31:45.270 --> 31:47.939
the reason people aren't able to
rise is fundamentally a
breakdown in the family
structure in America

31:47.939 --> 31:51.176
and the consequence of that.

31:51.176 --> 31:55.947
And, as you know, I'm someone
who has really focused long and
hard for a lot of years.

31:55.947 --> 32:00.919
I wrote a book 10 years ago
called "It Takes a Family." And
what we need to do as a society,

32:00.919 --> 32:04.523
and to some degree even as a
government, to try to help
reknit the American family.

32:04.523 --> 32:09.561
And so I agree with John Kasich.
That's a big issue. I agree
that there's -- that

32:09.561 --> 32:13.098
children's ability to rise in
America today is not what it
should be and not what we should

32:13.098 --> 32:18.036
expect in America. And we have
got some really solid ideas to
create a stronger economy,

32:18.036 --> 32:22.641
as well as to try to help
stabilize and support stronger
families.

32:22.641 --> 32:26.611
JUDY WOODRUFF: Immigration.
After Donald Trump made his
announcement that he was running

32:26.611 --> 32:33.018
for president and he spoke about
Mexican immigrants bringing
drugs and crime and being
rapists,

32:33.018 --> 32:35.620
you did say later that you
didn't agree with him, but it
took you two weeks to come out

32:35.620 --> 32:37.556
and make a statement.

32:37.556 --> 32:41.426
RICK SANTORUM: No, I made a
statement, actually, whenever I
was asked about it.

32:41.426 --> 32:45.964
I did disagree with what he
said, but I agree that the issue
is an important issue to be

32:45.964 --> 32:50.802
discussed. And, in fact, I was
-- I'm the only person in this
race who's actually put

32:50.802 --> 32:55.740
out a comprehensive plan on
immigration control that deals
with both illegal and legal
immigration.

32:55.740 --> 33:00.745
And there's -- there are a lot
of -- again, to me, it goes
with, how are we going to create

33:00.745 --> 33:04.149
a better opportunity for
lower-skilled workers in
America, many of those poor
children you're

33:04.149 --> 33:06.518
talking about, who are not going
to be able to go to college?
How are we going to create

33:06.518 --> 33:09.221
the opportunity for them
to rise in society?

33:09.221 --> 33:14.125
And so we have put together not
just an economic plan that deals
with a whole host of things,

33:14.125 --> 33:17.195
including, by the way,
increasing the minimum wage,
which I'm one of the few
Republicans

33:17.195 --> 33:22.400
that is in favor of, but also an
immigration plan that says let's
quit bringing over a

33:22.400 --> 33:27.138
million legal immigrants a year,
as well as hundreds of
thousands, if not millions
illegal

33:27.138 --> 33:31.409
immigrants, almost all of whom
are unskilled, into this country
to compete against the workers

33:31.409 --> 33:33.845
right now who see their wages
flatlining and the opportunity
for them to rise decreasing

33:33.845 --> 33:36.147
in America.

33:36.147 --> 33:41.453
And so you can look at the
immigration issue, and we have,
according to the number, 35
million

33:41.453 --> 33:44.389
legal and illegal immigrants
have come into this country in
the last 20 years. That

33:44.389 --> 33:47.425
can be a good thing
or a bad thing.

33:47.425 --> 33:51.329
But the idea that you can't have
a discussion about whether this
-- whether we should limit

33:51.329 --> 33:56.468
immigration because that makes
you xenophobic or jingoistic is
wrong. We need to look

33:56.468 --> 33:57.903
at it from the standpoint of
what's best for the economy and
what's best for the American

33:57.903 --> 33:59.604
worker.

33:59.604 --> 34:01.973
JUDY WOODRUFF: We don't have
time to discuss it now, but we
know more Mexicans are leaving

34:01.973 --> 34:03.808
the country now to go back
to Mexico than are coming.

34:03.808 --> 34:05.543
RICK SANTORUM: Yes.

34:05.543 --> 34:08.280
In fact, the majority of -- the
majority of people that are
coming into this country
illegally

34:08.280 --> 34:10.048
now are visa overstays. They're
not Mexicans coming across the
border. You're right.

34:11.549 --> 34:16.655
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former Senator
Rick Santorum, thank you for
talking with us.

34:16.655 --> 34:22.294
RICK SANTORUM: My pleasure,
Judy. Thank you.

34:22.294 --> 34:26.998
JUDY WOODRUFF: Appreciate it.

34:26.998 --> 34:33.505
GWEN IFILL: The economy may be
recovering from the great
recession, but a new report

34:33.505 --> 34:37.575
finds many have been left
behind, especially children.

34:37.575 --> 34:42.514
The findings from the Annie E.
Casey Foundation show 22 percent
of U.S. children were living

34:42.514 --> 34:49.154
in poverty in 2013. That's
compared to 18 percent in 2008.
Those rates were nearly

34:49.154 --> 34:52.724
double among African-American
and Native American children,
with problems most severe in the

34:52.724 --> 34:56.161
South and the Southwest.

34:56.161 --> 35:00.665
Some of those conclusions also
echo a recent analysis by the
Pew Research Center. It

35:00.665 --> 35:03.735
found black children were almost
four times as likely as white
children to be living in

35:03.735 --> 35:06.705
poverty.

35:06.705 --> 35:11.443
Joining me to discuss the cause
and the effect of these sobering
numbers are Patrick McCarthy,

35:11.443 --> 35:15.680
the president and CEO of the
Annie E. Casey Foundation, and
Mark Hugo Lopez of the Pew

35:15.680 --> 35:18.283
Research Center.

35:18.283 --> 35:22.087
Mark Hugo Lopez, why these
populations in particular, why
are they suffering?

35:22.087 --> 35:23.655
MARK HUGO LOPEZ, Director of
Hispanic Research, Pew Research
Center: Well, when you take

35:23.655 --> 35:27.225
a look at unemployment rates
particularly, you will see that,
for African-Americans in

35:27.225 --> 35:33.064
June, unemployment was 9.6
percent. For whites, it was 4.5
percent.

35:33.064 --> 35:36.735
That almost -- the unemployment
rate for African-Americans is
almost double that of whites.
And that's

35:36.735 --> 35:40.405
an important part of explaining
the story of why many children
live in poverty. Many

35:40.405 --> 35:44.576
of their parents either are not
fully employed, are unemployed
or can't find work.

35:44.576 --> 35:47.679
GWEN IFILL: Now, Patrick
McCarthy, some people might
think this wasn't surprising.

35:47.679 --> 35:53.318
We know in some ways that
minority populations are at a
disadvantage, yet when you look
at

35:53.318 --> 35:58.056
the numbers overall, in fact,
fewer white children are in
poverty.

35:58.056 --> 36:00.625
Why are the numbers heading in
the wrong -- opposite
directions?

36:00.625 --> 36:00.892
PATRICK MCCARTHY, President and
CEO, Annie E. Casey Foundation:
Well, I think there's

36:00.892 --> 36:03.795
a number of reasons that
we have to look at here.

36:03.795 --> 36:07.399
The economy, as it's
recovered, certainly

36:07.399 --> 36:12.837
has produced jobs for some
populations, but we know that
the recession took out a lot

36:12.837 --> 36:20.078
of lower-skilled jobs and
low-wage jobs that had been held
by African-Americans and
Latinos.

36:20.078 --> 36:24.749
And as the economy has
recovered, although a lot of the
jobs that had been restored are

36:24.749 --> 36:32.090
low-wage jobs, the folks who
lost their jobs, who have had
kind of a precarious grasp of

36:32.090 --> 36:36.494
those jobs, are having a much
harder time getting employed
again.

36:36.494 --> 36:39.330
GWEN IFILL: Well, here's one
thing which struck me, which is
that we're not talking

36:39.330 --> 36:42.233
just about percentages. Right?
We're talking absolute numbers.

36:42.233 --> 36:47.038
MARK HUGO LOPEZ: That's right;
14.7 million children live in
poverty.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.408
And when you take a look at the
Hispanic children in poverty,
that number is about five
million.

36:50.408 --> 36:54.379
For black children, those
numbers are about 4.2 million.
So, really, when we're talking

36:54.379 --> 36:57.882
children in poverty, a
significant share, more than
half, are either black or
Hispanic

36:57.882 --> 36:59.584
children.

36:59.584 --> 37:03.822
But we're also seeing some other
big changes. As you noted, the
number of white children

37:03.822 --> 37:07.559
living in poverty has declined.
It looks like it might even be
below the number of

37:07.559 --> 37:12.864
black children in poverty, which
would be a first in at least 30
or 40 years. And

37:12.864 --> 37:14.766
for Hispanics, there are more
Hispanics living in poverty.
And that's been the case since

37:14.766 --> 37:17.001
2007, particularly for children.

37:17.001 --> 37:19.003
GWEN IFILL: Patrick McCarthy,
let's talk about two states.

37:19.003 --> 37:20.472
PATRICK MCCARTHY: Sure.

37:20.472 --> 37:23.007
GWEN IFILL: Mississippi,
Minnesota.

37:23.007 --> 37:25.677
Mississippi is the worst state
by these measures, and Minnesota
is the best. What's the
difference?

37:27.145 --> 37:30.315
PATRICK MCCARTHY: Well, there
are a lot of differences that go
into this.

37:30.315 --> 37:35.687
Obviously, there are kind of
large macroeconomic differences
between the two states. They

37:35.687 --> 37:42.393
have very different economies.
We know that, just as we have
been discussing,
African-American

37:42.393 --> 37:46.731
families in particular are
suffering after the recession.
Mississippi has a much higher

37:46.731 --> 37:51.769
number of African-American
families living in Mississippi
compared to Minnesota.

37:51.769 --> 37:54.906
We actually think also that
there are differences in how
states made policy choices. We
know

37:54.906 --> 37:55.974
not only Minnesota but a number
of states in the Northeast and
Midwest have made their

37:55.974 --> 38:01.212
policy choices. We know that
not only Minnesota, but a number
of the states in the Northeast,

38:01.212 --> 38:06.885
the Midwest, have made choices
around providing health care,
providing early childhood
education,

38:06.885 --> 38:10.555
providing a bridge to jobs,
providing supports for folks who
do become unemployed, and that

38:10.555 --> 38:12.924
makes a difference as well.

38:12.924 --> 38:17.061
So it's partially the economic
forces at play, the kinds of
jobs that are available in those

38:17.061 --> 38:20.565
states, and it's partially the
policy choices that states make.

38:20.565 --> 38:23.434
GWEN IFILL: So, a policy
choice, for instance, might be
prizing deficit reduction over
social

38:23.434 --> 38:25.336
welfare programs.

38:25.336 --> 38:27.071
MARK HUGO LOPEZ: That's right,
and social welfare programs
that, say, might even be

38:27.071 --> 38:30.241
focused on children.

38:30.241 --> 38:35.613
So, some states have done some
policy choices, as Patrick has
noted, that have been
emphasizing

38:35.613 --> 38:38.316
more broadly what's happening in
the state and less so to help
children particularly.

38:40.084 --> 38:44.322
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
the long-term effect of these
kinds of numbers, first of

38:44.322 --> 38:46.958
all, educational attainment.

38:46.958 --> 38:51.663
PATRICK MCCARTHY: So, one of
the things that I think we
sometimes miss when we talk

38:51.663 --> 38:56.401
about the numbers, and they seem
so large, and talk about
percentages, is we lose what

38:56.401 --> 39:00.972
it means to be in poverty, the
day-to-day grind of not being
sure you're going to be

39:00.972 --> 39:06.711
able to take care of your kids,
the inability to find a job that
you can rely on week after

39:06.711 --> 39:10.848
week after week, having to
figure out at the end of the
month do you pay this bill or
that

39:10.848 --> 39:15.520
bill, the kind of stress that
takes on you as not only a
worker and as an individual,

39:15.520 --> 39:18.957
but as a parent, which then
begins to affect the children.

39:18.957 --> 39:22.827
They're living in an environment
where there's a lot of stress.
Put on top of that the

39:22.827 --> 39:27.932
fact that one in seven American
children are living in
neighborhoods of high poverty,
so

39:27.932 --> 39:31.169
they're surrounded by other
people who are struggling with
the same kinds of issues,

39:31.169 --> 39:36.608
often with poor schools, the a
safe place to play, surrounded
by crime.

39:36.608 --> 39:40.845
Then you start to see the
long-term effects of that on
children, trauma, chronic
stress,

39:40.845 --> 39:45.550
et cetera, that literally starts
to narrow their opportunity,
make it tougher for them

39:45.550 --> 39:50.488
to be successful in school,
long-term research showing
impacts even on their health as
they

39:50.488 --> 39:54.259
become adults. So poverty is
the driver of many, many of the
social ills that this

39:54.259 --> 39:55.493
country faces.

39:55.493 --> 39:57.595
GWEN IFILL: What would
you add to that?

39:57.595 --> 40:01.132
MARK HUGO LOPEZ: When we take a
look at the long-running effects
of poverty, particularly

40:01.132 --> 40:05.270
when it comes to, say, labor
market opportunities, what are
these young people going to be
trained

40:05.270 --> 40:09.173
for? What sort of jobs will
they be able to hold? And when
it comes to completing

40:09.173 --> 40:13.011
college, for many of them, they
may end having to try to work to
help to support their parents

40:13.011 --> 40:17.015
or their other siblings who are
still under the age of 18.

40:17.015 --> 40:20.652
So, poverty could put a lot of
stress, particularly when you
think about Hispanic children,
many

40:20.652 --> 40:23.788
of them who go on to college say
that one of the reasons why they
do not stay in college

40:23.788 --> 40:26.324
is because they have got to
return home to help family.

40:26.324 --> 40:28.793
GWEN IFILL: What are the policy
solutions, if there are any, if
this is identified to

40:28.793 --> 40:30.828
be a major problem?

40:30.828 --> 40:34.098
PATRICK MCCARTHY: So, we think
there are three things that we
ought to look at. And

40:34.098 --> 40:38.770
we need to start with thinking
about a two-generation strategy,
by which we mean simultaneously

40:38.770 --> 40:43.074
investing in families and
parents and in the children
themselves.

40:43.074 --> 40:46.778
So the three things that we
think you need to do is, number
one, recognize we're in a

40:46.778 --> 40:51.082
transitional economy, and so
it's tough for especially folks
without a lot of skills to

40:51.082 --> 40:54.952
make enough money to support
their families. So, we have got
to think about things like

40:54.952 --> 40:59.657
expanding the Earned Income Tax
Credit, the child tax credit,
recognizing the importance

40:59.657 --> 41:02.760
of unemployment benefits and
other supports for families, so
they can have the economic

41:02.760 --> 41:05.697
means to take care
of their kids.

41:05.697 --> 41:09.467
Second, we have to recognize
they are both workers and they
are parents, so we have got

41:09.467 --> 41:13.471
to help them have the social and
emotional skills they need to do
right by their kids.

41:13.471 --> 41:17.875
And, third, we need to invest
heavily, in my view, especially
for children who are in

41:17.875 --> 41:22.180
poverty, in early childhood
programs, in quality preschool,
in quality early education, so

41:22.180 --> 41:24.582
they get on that path
towards opportunity.

41:24.582 --> 41:28.052
GWEN IFILL: Patrick McCarthy,
president and CEO of the Annie
E. Casey Foundation,

41:28.052 --> 41:31.356
and Mark Hugo Lopez of Pew
Research Center, thank you both
for the numbers and the story

41:31.356 --> 41:33.458
behind the numbers.

41:33.458 --> 41:37.795
MARK HUGO LOPEZ: Thank you.

41:37.795 --> 41:42.500
PATRICK MCCARTHY: Thank you.

41:42.500 --> 41:49.574
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: when one
family's personal drama sparked
national headlines.

41:49.574 --> 41:54.912
Deanna Fei premature baby girl
had survived a long, arduous
stay in the hospital, when

41:54.912 --> 42:00.818
she and her family were thrust
into controversy. It happened
when the CEO of AOL, where her

42:00.818 --> 42:04.188
husband worked, said he would
cut benefits for all workers
because of high medical costs

42:04.188 --> 42:07.225
for cases like hers.

42:07.225 --> 42:13.197
She describes the experience in
a new memoir called "Girl in
Glass: How My 'Distressed

42:13.197 --> 42:20.238
Baby' Defied the Odds, Shamed a
CEO, and Taught Me the Essence
of Love, Heartbreak, and
Miracles."

42:20.238 --> 42:23.508
William Brangham talked with her
recently in Brooklyn, New York.

42:23.508 --> 42:27.745
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Deanna Fei
was just 25 weeks pregnant, hard
at work on her second

42:27.745 --> 42:32.316
novel and months away from her
delivery date. She'd been
researching translations for

42:32.316 --> 42:36.988
a plot twist where one of her
main characters would have a
miscarriage.

42:36.988 --> 42:41.926
That night, her own contractions
came out of nowhere. Rushing to
the hospital with

42:41.926 --> 42:45.530
shooting pains in her womb, the
translation of the word
"calamity" was still on her
computer

42:45.530 --> 42:47.031
screen.

42:47.031 --> 42:47.932
DEANNA FEI, Author, "Girl in
Glass: How My 'Distressed Baby'
Defied the Odds, Shamed

42:47.932 --> 42:48.666
a CEO, and Taught Me the Essence
of Love, Heartbreak, and
Miracles": The pain just

42:48.666 --> 42:52.303
got worse and worse and worse.
And I found myself desperately
thinking, like, could this

42:52.303 --> 42:56.774
be Braxton Hicks contractions,
you know, the false labor?

42:56.774 --> 43:00.578
But it felt nothing like that.
And by the time I got to the
hospital, I was fully dilated.

43:00.578 --> 43:05.149
And the doctors had to perform
an emergency C-section.

43:05.149 --> 43:10.254
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Nothing in
Fei's own history predicted a
calamity like this. She and

43:10.254 --> 43:13.724
her husband, Peter Goodman, had
always been the lucky types,
traveling the world together,

43:13.724 --> 43:16.661
pursuing careers in
writing and journalism.

43:16.661 --> 43:22.166
During a trip to India in 2010,
they made an offhand prayer to
the Hindu gods to bless

43:22.166 --> 43:27.538
them with their first child, and
nine months later, a chubby boy
named Leo was born, healthy

43:27.538 --> 43:32.643
and right on time. This second
pregnancy, which was a surprise,
came almost a year after

43:32.643 --> 43:37.215
Leo's birth and had been going
just as well, until those pains
started.

43:37.215 --> 43:43.654
DEANNA FEI: All that was in my
head was, I think I lost my
baby. I had a miscarriage.

43:43.654 --> 43:48.092
And when the nurses and doctors
said things like,
congratulations, would you like
to take

43:48.092 --> 43:52.763
a picture of her, I almost felt
like it was a kind of farce.
And both my husband and

43:52.763 --> 43:57.401
I had this feeling of, this
isn't how a baby gets born.

43:57.401 --> 44:01.806
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She was a
baby girl, weighing just one
pound, nine ounces, barely a
quarter

44:01.806 --> 44:04.642
of her brother's birth weight.

44:04.642 --> 44:09.547
One doctor described her skin as
-- quote -- "gelatinous."
Because she'd arrived so

44:09.547 --> 44:14.352
early, she had few of the normal
functions or immunities babies
develop in utero, so

44:14.352 --> 44:19.290
she had to live enclosed in this
glass incubator in a neonatal
intensive care unit. Her
parents

44:19.290 --> 44:22.493
were even reluctant to
give her a name at first.

44:22.493 --> 44:26.731
DEANNA FEI: She was really hard
to look at. I mean, everything
about her to me felt

44:26.731 --> 44:31.335
like, I don't know if she's
supposed to be here. And I
don't know if she's going to

44:31.335 --> 44:34.772
be here, because what we also
heard from the beginning, along
with the congratulations,

44:34.772 --> 44:39.610
was, she might not survive one
month, one week, one day.

44:39.610 --> 44:44.448
There was a part of me that felt
like, it's kind of the mother in
me thinking, like, do

44:44.448 --> 44:50.521
I need to let her go? Is it
selfish to hold onto this idea
of this baby, when maybe she

44:50.521 --> 44:54.025
just isn't meant to survive?

44:54.025 --> 44:57.461
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Even though
the next days only got worse --
there was bleeding in her

44:57.461 --> 45:01.933
brain, and then a collapsed lung
-- they did name her. They
called her Mila. Hope started

45:01.933 --> 45:04.035
setting in.

45:04.035 --> 45:06.871
PETER GOODMAN, Husband of Deanna
Fei: When we realized that we
could put our hand inside

45:06.871 --> 45:15.112
the incubator and give her
access to my pinkie finger, and
she would squeeze it and hold

45:15.112 --> 45:23.154
on, once I got to see her eyes
and realized that she looked a
lot like our boy, and once

45:23.154 --> 45:29.694
I started to see her really
fight for her own life, I mean,
the nurses said day one

45:29.694 --> 45:32.196
-- and I thought, you must be
making this up for my benefit --
she's really feisty,

45:32.196 --> 45:34.165
they said.

45:34.165 --> 45:38.569
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Three weeks
in, Fei was able to hold Mila
for the first time.

45:38.569 --> 45:44.275
At week nine, Mila breathed
without life support. And a
month later, she was going home.
She

45:44.275 --> 45:49.213
was three months old. Once
there, she seemed to thrive,
hitting all her major
milestones,

45:49.213 --> 45:54.385
and showing no signs of the
brain damage some premature
babies experience.

45:54.385 --> 45:57.788
Goodman was back at work. He
was an editor at The Huffington
Post, which is owned by

45:57.788 --> 46:03.060
AOL, when some corporate news
broke that hit very close to
home.

46:03.060 --> 46:08.766
Tim Armstrong, AOL's CEO,
announced he had to trim his
employees' retirement benefits

46:08.766 --> 46:13.771
because of high health insurance
costs, but who he blamed for
those costs sparked a media

46:13.771 --> 46:16.841
frenzy.

46:16.841 --> 46:21.445
Armstrong said quote: "We had
two AOL-ers that had distressed
babies that were born

46:21.445 --> 46:26.350
that we paid a million dollars
each to make sure those babies
were OK in general. So,

46:26.350 --> 46:30.187
when we had the final decision
about what benefits to cut
because of the increased health

46:30.187 --> 46:33.791
care costs, we made the
decision, and I made the
decision, to basically change
the 401(k)

46:33.791 --> 46:35.826
plan."

46:35.826 --> 46:42.166
PETER GOODMAN: It was clear
that he was talking about my
kid. And friends of mine

46:42.166 --> 46:46.470
in the newsroom came through in
the course of the day and they
said, somewhat embarrassed,

46:46.470 --> 46:50.274
he's talking about
your kid, isn't he?

46:50.274 --> 46:55.413
DEANNA FEI: It sounded
extremely dehumanizing, and it
had no relation to the daughter
who

46:55.413 --> 47:00.985
was in front of me. She had
actually started taking her
first steps just that week.

47:00.985 --> 47:05.489
And that was a huge milestone
for us, because, of course,
every milestone brought so many

47:05.489 --> 47:10.361
new worries, where every time
she achieved one milestone, we
should start to worry, is

47:10.361 --> 47:14.398
she ever going to do the next
one? You know, once she crawls,
is she ever going to cruise?

47:14.398 --> 47:18.803
If she cruises, will she ever
walk? And then she took her
first steps and then this

47:18.803 --> 47:23.874
happened, and all of the trauma
just kind of came rushing back
to me.

47:23.874 --> 47:27.945
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The couple
felt shamed, then angry. Fei
channeled her anger into

47:27.945 --> 47:33.484
a blistering piece in Slate
called "My Baby and AOL's Bottom
Line."

47:33.484 --> 47:38.222
She wrote: "Our daughter has
already overcome more setbacks
than most of us have endured

47:38.222 --> 47:42.193
in the span of our lives.
Having her very existence used
as a scapegoat for cutting

47:42.193 --> 47:46.263
corporate benefits was
one indignity too many."

47:46.263 --> 47:51.302
DEANNA FEI: There was the
implication that we had used
more than our fair share of
health

47:51.302 --> 47:58.309
benefits. There was the
implication that somehow her
care was optional, because Tim

47:58.309 --> 48:07.384
Armstrong portrayed her as this
outsized burden on the corporate
balance sheets. And he

48:07.384 --> 48:12.523
also implied that the company
had done more than it needed to
do in paying for her care.

48:14.158 --> 48:18.195
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Armstrong,
who declined to comment for this
story, did call Goodman

48:18.195 --> 48:22.666
and Fei to apologize, and he
eventually reversed the decision
to reduce his employees' 401(k)

48:22.666 --> 48:25.236
plans.

48:25.236 --> 48:29.406
But Goodman was done with the
company. He left AOL for The
International Business Times.

48:29.406 --> 48:34.111
After her piece in Slate went
viral, Fei started hearing from
others who'd been blamed

48:34.111 --> 48:37.414
by their bosses for having
costly medical care, things like
cancer treatment or major

48:37.414 --> 48:38.949
surgeries.

48:38.949 --> 48:42.520
DEANNA FEI: The truth is, until
recently, I was one of those
people whose eyes would

48:42.520 --> 48:45.556
glaze over at a term
like health privacy.

48:45.556 --> 48:49.760
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Deanna's
book, "Girl in Glass," is both a
memoir and an impassioned

48:49.760 --> 48:53.998
plea to not let what happened
to her family happen to others.

48:53.998 --> 48:59.136
DEANNA FEI: These are risks
that are extraordinary for any
individual family, but they are
completely

48:59.136 --> 49:03.607
predictable in the aggregate.
And that's the point of health
insurance.

49:03.607 --> 49:10.648
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lawrence
Gostin is a professor of global
health law at Georgetown
University.

49:10.648 --> 49:14.919
He says employers should never
blame or embarrass employees who
get sick or even be in a
position

49:14.919 --> 49:17.321
to do so.

49:17.321 --> 49:24.361
LAWRENCE GOSTIN, Georgetown Law:
The lesson is that you have no
business knowing the
confidential

49:24.361 --> 49:30.801
health information of your
employees, that you should make
sure that there's a strong

49:30.801 --> 49:36.473
firewall between you, as the
employer making employment
decisions, and health care
decisions

49:36.473 --> 49:39.677
and health insurance decisions.

49:39.677 --> 49:44.448
That needs to be separated, and
that comes to me loud and clear.

49:44.448 --> 49:49.186
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Fei and
Goodman also say employees need
to demand their rights to
privacy,

49:49.186 --> 49:52.456
just as Mila, who is now 2, is
learning to demand what she
wants. And it's chocolate

49:52.456 --> 50:00.264
ice cream.

50:00.264 --> 50:03.834
Mila has continued to grow and
thrive and has so far shown none
of the ill effects Fei

50:03.834 --> 50:07.605
or any parent of a premature
child worry about.

50:07.605 --> 50:14.712
DEANNA FEI: You know, these
days, I think it is hard to
escape this term that I hated

50:14.712 --> 50:20.651
when she was first born, which
is the term miracle child,
because we were just hours

50:20.651 --> 50:26.590
removed from her birth, and
hearing all the odds against
her, when people would come to

50:26.590 --> 50:30.261
us and say, oh, well, she will
be a miracle, she's going to be
your miracle child. Just

50:30.261 --> 50:33.597
wait and see.

50:33.597 --> 50:38.569
And I finally reached a point
where I have to say, you're
right. She is. She's amazing,

50:38.569 --> 50:41.038
and no one can take that away
from her. She's earned that.
If anyone has earned that label,

50:41.038 --> 50:44.475
she has earned it.

50:44.475 --> 50:51.015
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She's still
young, so Mila may face health
challenges in the future.

50:51.015 --> 50:55.686
It's hard to tell at this point.
But for a story that began in
catastrophe, Mila's

50:55.686 --> 50:59.490
parents are glad this chapter
of their lives is a happy one.

50:59.490 --> 51:05.863
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham in Brooklyn,
New York.

51:05.863 --> 51:17.841
GWEN IFILL: Tonight on
"Frontline": a detailed look
inside Mexico's largest drug
cartel.

51:19.610 --> 51:25.649
The drug kingpin Joaquin "El
Chapo" Guzman recently escaped
from a maximum security prison.

51:25.649 --> 51:32.289
He escaped once before in 2001,
and prior to his capture in
2014, two filmmakers explored

51:32.289 --> 51:35.759
his brutal drug empire. In
their quest for an interview,
they met his mother and visited

51:35.759 --> 51:39.029
his home.

51:39.029 --> 51:47.604
MAN: Only one person could have
arranged for us to have lunch
with Mrs. Guzman. Two

51:47.604 --> 51:53.043
hours later, we were being
driven up the mountain to a
place they call heaven on his
direct

51:53.043 --> 51:58.615
instructions.

51:58.615 --> 52:29.279
MAN (through translator):
Where are we?

52:29.279 --> 52:50.434
MAN: Nothing. Basically, they
said that -- basically, they
said that he's not going

52:50.434 --> 52:58.075
to speak with us right now. He
said, yes, but not now. And it
feels funny, because

52:58.075 --> 53:07.418
we can certainly feel that he's
around here, and they called him
on a mobile phone. And,

53:07.418 --> 53:10.320
yes, so he must be around.

53:10.320 --> 53:13.757
MAN: Can't he just have been
politely telling us to go away?

53:13.757 --> 53:18.429
MAN: No, because the style of
these people is, if they say no,
it's, no, thank you very

53:18.429 --> 53:24.435
much. They don't play around
like that. Certainly, it's not
in their interest that

53:24.435 --> 53:29.473
we come up here a lot. We can
bring trouble with us. So, you
know, that's what I believe.

53:30.974 --> 53:34.611
MAN: So he is somewhere between
his birthplace and Culiacan?
That's what...

53:34.611 --> 53:38.048
MAN: Yes, they say that he
spends most of his time around
here and Culiacan.

53:38.048 --> 53:41.318
MAN: That's weird, isn't it?
It's the most obvious place for
him to be.

53:41.318 --> 53:45.255
MAN: Yes, possibly the safest.

53:45.255 --> 53:53.797
MAN: Over the following months,
we were twice more invited up to
La Tuna. Each time,

53:53.797 --> 54:01.572
El Chapo decided not to go on
camera. For all the
disappointment, we had found him
exactly

54:01.572 --> 54:04.408
where we had expected him to be.

54:04.408 --> 54:09.513
JUDY WOODRUFF: "Frontline" airs
tonight on most PBS stations.

54:09.513 --> 54:11.715
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

54:11.715 --> 54:15.619
On Wednesday, we will profile a
Nazi hunter and talk with the
former concentration camp

54:15.619 --> 54:17.321
guard he's trying
to put behind bars.

54:17.321 --> 54:18.522
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:18.522 --> 54:20.991
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

54:20.991 --> 54:24.661
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
here at the "PBS NewsHour,"

54:24.661 --> 54:25.062
thank you, and good night.
