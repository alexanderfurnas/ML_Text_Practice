JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.639 --> 00:07.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.509 --> 00:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
The United States will withdraw
from the Paris

00:16.916 --> 00:18.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
climate accord.

00:18.785 --> 00:22.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Breaking from
nearly all nations
in the world, President Trump
abandons the

00:22.989 --> 00:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
landmark agreement aimed at
combating climate
change.

00:26.826 --> 00:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: the latest unraveling in
the Russia
investigation.

00:31.598 --> 00:36.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vladimir Putin admits that
Russian hackers
may have acted independently to
influence

00:36.936 --> 00:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S. presidential election.

00:40.106 --> 00:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how urban revival is meeting
a crisis
of success -- a look at why
cities are being

00:46.046 --> 00:48.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dragged down by class divides.

00:48.081 --> 00:51.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA, Author, "The
New Urban Crisis":
If the old urban crisis was
about the middle-class

00:51.184 --> 00:56.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flight from the city to the
suburbs, the new
urban crisis is about really the
disappearance

00:56.189 --> 00:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of middle-class neighborhoods
from our society.

00:58.591 --> 01:02.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:02.262 --> 01:06.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:06.466 --> 01:19.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From President
Trump today,
a declaration: The United States
wants out

01:19.212 --> 01:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Paris accord on climate
change, and
wants to negotiate better terms.

01:24.384 --> 01:30.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under the existing agreement,
the U.S. must
cut carbon emissions 26 to 28
percent from

01:30.490 --> 01:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2005 levels by the year 2025.

01:33.760 --> 01:39.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the White House Rose
Garden, Mr. Trump
said the deal gives other
countries an economic

01:39.732 --> 01:42.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
edge and makes America foot the
bill.

01:42.235 --> 01:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
As president, I can put no other
consideration

01:45.972 --> 01:51.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before the well-being of
American citizens.

01:51.511 --> 01:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Paris climate accord is
simply the latest
example of Washington entering
into an agreement

01:56.816 --> 02:04.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that disadvantages the United
States, to the
exclusive benefit of other
countries, leaving

02:04.491 --> 02:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American workers, who I love,
and taxpayers
to absorb the cost in terms of
lost jobs,

02:12.565 --> 02:20.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lower wages, shuttered factories
and vastly
diminished economic production.

02:20.073 --> 02:28.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thus, as of today, the United
States will
cease all implementation of the
nonbinding

02:28.982 --> 02:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paris accord and the draconian
financial and
economic burdens the agreement
imposes on

02:38.024 --> 02:39.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our country.

02:39.192 --> 02:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At what point does America get
demeaned?

02:43.730 --> 02:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At what point do they start
laughing at us
as a country?

02:47.901 --> 02:55.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want fair treatment for its
citizens and
we want fair treatment for our
taxpayers.

02:55.408 --> 03:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't want other leaders and
other countries
laughing at us anymore, and they
won't be.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They won't be.

03:04.784 --> 03:12.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was elected to represent the
citizens of
Pittsburgh, not Paris.

03:12.091 --> 03:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former President
Obama said
today that Mr. Trump is joining
the handful

03:17.030 --> 03:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of nations that reject the
future.

03:19.566 --> 03:24.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, European leaders
voiced regret,
and said the accord cannot be
renegotiated.

03:24.804 --> 03:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China, the world's largest
carbon emitter
right now, reaffirmed its
commitment to the

03:30.043 --> 03:31.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deal.

03:31.444 --> 03:34.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will hear from both sides
of the issue
after the news summary.

03:34.847 --> 03:39.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news,
President Trump decided
against moving the U.S. Embassy
in Israel

03:39.953 --> 03:43.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, at
least for now.

03:43.356 --> 03:48.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He'd campaigned on a promise to
do just that,
but the White House said that
waiting might

03:48.161 --> 03:52.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
improve chances of peace between
Israel and
the Palestinians.

03:52.332 --> 03:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 14 Trump White House
officials have
been granted waivers from ethics
rules.

03:58.972 --> 04:03.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their names were posted last
night, under
pressure from the Office of
Government Ethics.

04:03.943 --> 04:09.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The officials include, among
others, Michael
Catanzaro, a former oil and gas
lobbyist who's

04:09.515 --> 04:13.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now a senior energy policy aide,
and Shahira
Knight.

04:13.386 --> 04:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a former lobbyist for
Fidelity Investments,
now working on tax reform.

04:19.325 --> 04:24.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Russia, President Vladimir
Putin acknowledged
today that what he called
patriotic Russian

04:24.397 --> 04:29.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals may have launched
cyber-attacks
on the U.S., but he insisted
again that his

04:29.969 --> 04:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government had no role in
election meddling.

04:33.006 --> 04:39.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead, speaking to
international journalists,
he blamed Russophobic hysteria
and perhaps

04:39.345 --> 04:41.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a smear campaign.

04:41.147 --> 04:44.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): I can imagine the
situation where

04:44.751 --> 04:48.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody purposely does the
attacks in a way
to make it look like the Russian
Federation

04:48.688 --> 04:50.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is the source of those attacks.

04:50.556 --> 04:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what is most important, I'm
deeply convinced
that any hackers cannot
significantly influence

04:55.261 --> 04:57.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an election campaign in another
country.

04:57.430 --> 05:01.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Putin also called
President
Trump -- quote -- "a
straightforward person,

05:01.701 --> 05:05.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a frank person with a fresh set
of eyes."

05:05.371 --> 05:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afghans buried loved ones today
after Wednesday's
massive truck bombing in Kabul.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The blast killed at least 90
people.

05:13.279 --> 05:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hundreds gathered today for the
funeral of
a security guard.

05:16.916 --> 05:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bombing was one of the worst
attacks since
the 2014 drawdown of foreign
forces in Afghanistan.

05:23.723 --> 05:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A gunman caused a scare today at
a resort
complex in the capital of the
Philippines.

05:30.129 --> 05:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reports of gunshots touched off
panic.

05:32.365 --> 05:36.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in Washington, President
Trump called
it a terrorist attack.

05:36.169 --> 05:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A short time later, Manila
police announced
that it wasn't terrorism, and
that no one

05:41.174 --> 05:42.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was hurt.

05:42.975 --> 05:49.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said gunman fired into the
air, stole gambling
chips and set fire to gaming
tables.

05:49.615 --> 05:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The upcoming election in Britain
is turning
into a free-for-all.

05:53.353 --> 05:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the vote just a week away,
a new survey
shows that the ruling
Conservatives are ahead

05:58.091 --> 06:00.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Labor by just three points.

06:00.226 --> 06:04.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's down sharply since last
week's bombing
in Manchester.

06:04.263 --> 06:08.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prime Minister Theresa May
called the snap
election in order to bolster her
government

06:08.568 --> 06:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as it negotiates Britain's exit
from the European
Union.

06:12.772 --> 06:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street pushed higher today
on signs that
businesses added more jobs in
May.

06:18.177 --> 06:24.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 135
points to close at 21144.

06:24.751 --> 06:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 48, and the S&amp;P
500 added
18.

06:29.422 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All three were record closes.

06:32.525 --> 06:37.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the NBA finals start
tonight, with the
much-anticipated rematch between
the Golden

06:37.530 --> 06:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State Warriors and the Cleveland
Cavaliers,
the reigning champions.

06:41.100 --> 06:47.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it's been partly
overshadowed by a racial
slur spray-painted outside the
Los Angeles

06:47.840 --> 06:50.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
home of LeBron James.

06:50.109 --> 06:54.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Cleveland star said
Wednesday that it
shows racism is very much alive.

06:54.414 --> 06:58.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LEBRON JAMES, Cleveland
Cavaliers: No matter
how much money you got, no
matter how famous

06:58.418 --> 07:03.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you are, no matter how many
people admire
you, at the end of the day,
being a black

07:03.523 --> 07:06.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
man in America is very
frightening.

07:07.026 --> 07:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it lets us know that we have
got so much
farther, so much farther to go
to be equal

07:11.631 --> 07:13.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country.

07:13.332 --> 07:17.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Police are
investigating the
vandalism as a possible hate
crime.

07:17.336 --> 07:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
California's
governor and Utah's junior
senator weigh in

07:23.009 --> 07:28.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Paris climate agreement;
the head of
the U.N. Refugee Agency on the
United States'

07:28.815 --> 07:34.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsibility to help migrants
around the
world; as cities grow,
inequality follows,

07:34.954 --> 07:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
addressing what one author calls
the new urban
crisis; and much more.

07:44.997 --> 07:50.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
addressing what one author calls
the new urban
crisis; and much more.

07:50.603 --> 07:55.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We zero in now on the big story
of this day,
the president's decision to
withdraw from

07:55.374 --> 07:59.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a global accord aimed at slowing
the impact
of climate change.

07:59.946 --> 08:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore the consequences of
all this, and
how it may play out in coming
years in the

08:05.318 --> 08:07.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
United States and around the
world.

08:07.620 --> 08:11.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We begin with California
Governor Jerry Brown,
a Democrat.

08:11.691 --> 08:17.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His state is battling efforts by
the Trump
administration to roll back some
emissions

08:17.063 --> 08:18.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
regulations.

08:18.764 --> 08:23.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he's flying to China
tomorrow to discuss
what more can be done on climate
change.

08:23.035 --> 08:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spoke with him just a short
time ago.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Jerry Brown, thank you
for joining
us.

08:28.875 --> 08:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your office put out a statement
a short time
ago saying, this is an insane
course of action.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you mean that?

08:35.681 --> 08:36.849 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

08:36.883 --> 08:38.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY BROWN (D), California: I
certainly do
mean that.

08:38.117 --> 08:40.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If anything, it's understated.

08:40.586 --> 08:47.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Climate change is an existential
threat to
all of humanity, to the natural
systems on

08:47.593 --> 08:49.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which all life depends.

08:49.829 --> 08:55.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not tomorrow, but starting very
quickly, we're
seeing changes.

08:55.902 --> 08:59.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
California has lost 100 million
trees from
the drought.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sea level is rising.

09:01.307 --> 09:07.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Antarctica is seeing ice
melting at an
ever rapid rate, some say in an
irreversible

09:07.747 --> 09:08.714 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

09:08.748 --> 09:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a profoundly serious
problem.

09:11.384 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Paris agreement was an
agreement of nations
saying what they could do
voluntarily.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the commitment.

09:19.926 --> 09:23.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama made something I
thought was
doable, was reasonable.

09:23.129 --> 09:29.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, California is doing
that very thing
now, and our economy has grown
in terms of

09:29.235 --> 09:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GDP 40 percent faster than the
nation as a
whole.

09:33.005 --> 09:34.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have created over two million
jobs.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

09:35.641 --> 09:36.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

09:36.842 --> 09:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY BROWN: So, climate action
and jobs go
together.

09:39.712 --> 09:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's why I say this move
by Trump makes
no sense, and it's going to hurt
America,

09:45.117 --> 09:47.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it's going to cost jobs, not
the reverse.

09:47.653 --> 09:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
know, he makes
a different argument.

09:50.089 --> 09:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says this -- he said, I'm in
favor of doing
something to help the
environment, but he

09:55.027 --> 10:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said this accord is going to
cost millions
of jobs and cost the American
people trillions

10:00.833 --> 10:02.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in lost economic output.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.235 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

10:03.269 --> 10:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERRY BROWN: That's just --
that's a lie.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's completely unwarranted.

10:09.909 --> 10:15.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, jobs are always declining
all the time,
the creative destruction of
capitalism.

10:15.047 --> 10:17.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But jobs are being created.

10:17.249 --> 10:24.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California has lost jobs, but,
net, we have
added 2.4 million jobs in the
last eight years,

10:24.357 --> 10:26.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
since the recession.

10:26.325 --> 10:32.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a remarkable outcome,
and it's consistent,
in fact, I would say driven by
the clean tech

10:32.898 --> 10:38.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investments and the climate
action strategies
that we have embarked upon.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, President Trump is
completely wrong.

10:40.973 --> 10:44.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's doing this for his own
base, highly ideological.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's wrong on the science.

10:46.879 --> 10:47.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's wrong on the facts.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:49.849 --> 10:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he also --
another argument
he makes, Governor, he says,
this puts restrictions

10:53.319 --> 10:59.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the United States, while the
United States
is reducing its emissions, while
it lets other

10:59.225 --> 11:04.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries like China, that
continue to pollute
more and more, get away with
doing that for

11:04.630 --> 11:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years to come with no penalties.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERRY BROWN: He really distorts
the record.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has a record of that, and
he's doing it
again.

11:12.638 --> 11:19.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
China is exceeding its
commitment, and it's
turning a big machine around, to
the point

11:19.045 --> 11:22.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where it's stopping the growth
of emissions
in a few years.

11:22.715 --> 11:26.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's the leader in wind and
solar power.

11:26.085 --> 11:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, yes, they're building some
coal pants.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have to go faster.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're not perfect.

11:31.090 --> 11:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is an agreement of the
willing that
have said in Paris, here's what
we will do.

11:35.728 --> 11:39.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's reasonable, what China
is doing,
reasonable, what America is
doing.

11:39.632 --> 11:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, I would say both have
to do a lot
more.

11:43.069 --> 11:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Trump is taking this in the
exact wrong
direction, which will cost us
more money.

11:48.007 --> 11:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the New York, the subway is
underwater,
or New Orleans or President
Trump's hotel

11:53.145 --> 11:59.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down there in Florida are
devastated by rising
sea levels, that will cost
hundreds of billions.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aggregate, over decades, we're
talking trillions.

12:02.955 --> 12:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the economics is all to the
opposite of
what President Trump is saying.

12:08.394 --> 12:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor, among
other things,
as you know, the president is
talking to his

12:13.933 --> 12:15.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
base, people who voted for him.

12:15.367 --> 12:18.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's an indication they're
going to like
what he did today.

12:18.804 --> 12:24.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Has your side of this argument
missed an opportunity
to explain to the American
people how protecting

12:24.510 --> 12:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the environment can also be good
for the economy?

12:27.213 --> 12:28.447 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY BROWN: Well, I don't think
that message
is clear enough.

12:31.217 --> 12:33.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And certainly people can be more
articulate.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
California, obviously, it's
clear.

12:35.921 --> 12:41.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Orange County for the first time
in decades
voted against a Republican, Mr.
Trump.

12:41.694 --> 12:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think part of that is our
environmental
policies working, as well as our
job creation

12:47.767 --> 12:49.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
running at full speed.

12:49.535 --> 12:55.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, this is a message that
has to be
made more persuasively, more
simply, and made

12:55.341 --> 12:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more extensively across the
country.

12:57.510 --> 13:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned
California, and
I think you said in your
statement today California

13:01.580 --> 13:08.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can continue to cut its own
deals with other
countries, continue to move
forward with technology.

13:08.821 --> 13:10.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does that work?

13:10.322 --> 13:16.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the president said he's
willing to
renegotiate the Paris accord.

13:16.061 --> 13:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that realistic at the same
time you're
talking about California and
other states

13:20.199 --> 13:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going forward on their own?

13:21.901 --> 13:23.402 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

13:23.435 --> 13:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY BROWN: Already, European
nations have
said Paris is not negotiable.

13:27.072 --> 13:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president of France said
that and others.

13:29.675 --> 13:31.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's he going to renegotiate?

13:31.510 --> 13:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a modest commitment on
the part of
President Obama.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have to do more, not
less.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to China tomorrow.

13:38.417 --> 13:40.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will meet with high officials.

13:40.920 --> 13:48.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will agree on standardizing
various clean
technologies that will make it
possible to

13:48.494 --> 13:50.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
invest and produce even more.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to work, California
and China.

13:53.299 --> 13:56.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're working with New York and
Washington.

13:56.168 --> 14:03.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Canada and Mexico have joined
with over 170
states, provinces and nations
committed to

14:03.275 --> 14:04.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this Paris agreement.

14:04.476 --> 14:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the world is not waiting for
Donald Trump.

14:07.313 --> 14:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has given a body blow to the
cause of environmental
sustainability, but we will take
it and we

14:13.619 --> 14:14.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will respond.

14:14.887 --> 14:17.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're on the field of battle,
and we're going
to overcome.

14:17.456 --> 14:18.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That, I can promise you.

14:18.958 --> 14:22.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Jerry
Brown of California,
thank you very much.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JERRY BROWN: Thank you.

14:25.297 --> 14:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now for an
opposing view, we
turn to Senator Mike Lee of
Utah.

14:29.068 --> 14:34.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was one of 22 Republican
senators who signed
a letter to President Trump last
week urging

14:34.640 --> 14:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him to withdraw from the Paris
agreement.

14:37.076 --> 14:39.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Lee, welcome to the
program.

14:39.178 --> 14:45.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe you just heard the
response of California
Governor Jerry Brown, who argues
this is a

14:45.951 --> 14:48.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fundamentally wrong decision.

14:48.654 --> 14:51.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said it's going to set back
the cause of
fighting climate change.

14:51.624 --> 14:52.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE LEE (R), Utah: Yes, I think
he's wrong.

14:55.094 --> 14:58.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think I disagree with every
word, every
syllable he uttered, including
the words but

14:59.031 --> 14:59.999 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and the.

15:00.032 --> 15:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look, this was a right decision.

15:02.301 --> 15:04.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was the right thing to do.

15:04.203 --> 15:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When President Obama entered
into this agreement
a couple years ago, he didn't
submit it to

15:09.174 --> 15:12.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States Senate for
ratification
as a treaty.

15:12.845 --> 15:17.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't do that because he
knew there was
absolutely no way he could get
the two-thirds

15:17.316 --> 15:21.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supermajority vote necessary in
order to get
this ratified, in order to make
it the law

15:21.253 --> 15:23.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the land as a governing
treaty.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He didn't do that.

15:25.190 --> 15:28.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, consequently, it was
entirely foreseeable
that when a different president
from a different

15:28.861 --> 15:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party with a different point of
view came
along, he wouldn't move forward
with it.

15:33.632 --> 15:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump did that today
because he
decided this wasn't in the
interest of the

15:37.503 --> 15:38.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
United States of America.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did the right thing.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, one of
the arguments
that we heard Governor Brown and
others making

15:42.908 --> 15:48.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today is that President Trump
and those who
are pushing this decision today
don't understand

15:48.347 --> 15:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way the climate and jobs,
the economy
interact, that, in fact, when
you do less

15:54.353 --> 16:00.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fight climate change, as this
-- as what
the president, in effect, is
doing, he's missing

16:00.492 --> 16:06.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a chance for the United States
to move ahead
with clean energy technology,
so, in other

16:06.298 --> 16:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
words, that what he's done is
going to cost
jobs, rather than increase them.

16:09.868 --> 16:10.836 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:10.869 --> 16:12.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE LEE: You know, I would flip
it on them.

16:12.671 --> 16:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would point out, quite to the
contrary,
what has brought down emissions
both from

16:18.143 --> 16:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stationary sources like power
plants and from
mobile sources like automobiles
is innovation,

16:24.450 --> 16:28.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
improvements in technology that
have occurred
as a result of free market
forces, and in

16:28.320 --> 16:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the absence, I would add, of
anything like
a treaty comparing to the Paris
agreement.

16:33.659 --> 16:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this has happened through
innovation,
through free market forces.

16:38.097 --> 16:42.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think quite the opposite of
what Governor
Brown was saying, that when the
government

16:42.067 --> 16:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gets involved, it tends to
squelch innovation.

16:45.437 --> 16:47.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that innovation is needed
for us to control
emissions.

16:47.706 --> 16:52.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me quote
something that
your predecessor, the former EPA
administrator,

16:52.211 --> 16:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gina -- not your predecessor --
I'm sorry
-- the former EPA administrator,
Gina McCarthy,

16:57.549 --> 16:58.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
said today.

16:58.917 --> 17:00.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She said: "This is an
embarrassing day for
the United States."

17:00.786 --> 17:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She went on to say: "Make no
mistake.

17:02.488 --> 17:06.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Because of this reckless
decision, our businesses
will lose investment
opportunities.

17:06.625 --> 17:12.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will cede technology
breakthroughs to countries
that will take over our
leadership role, and

17:12.097 --> 17:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rest of the world will
question whether
the U.S. can be trusted."

17:15.134 --> 17:16.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:16.135 --> 17:17.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE LEE: Yes, that's pretty
apocalyptic.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's apocalyptic
to the point
of straining credulity.

17:20.339 --> 17:25.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, look, these are smart
people, but they
are not omniscient.

17:25.144 --> 17:28.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think their prophesies of
doom and gloom
are entirely unwarranted.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in fact, I think they're
inappropriate.

17:30.649 --> 17:34.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, we have to get back to
the fact that
this power, the power to enter
into binding

17:34.420 --> 17:37.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
international agreements, this
is a shared
power.

17:37.356 --> 17:42.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is something that was
decided, should
be a shared power, at the
Constitutional Convention

17:42.361 --> 17:44.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some 230 years ago.

17:44.496 --> 17:50.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I explain in my new book that
came out
this week called "Written Out Of
History,"

17:50.335 --> 17:55.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these powers that are vested in
the federal
government have to be clearly
enumerated.

17:55.274 --> 17:57.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have to be limited.

17:57.109 --> 18:04.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we can't give excessive,
unfettered power
to a president to act alone, to
bind an entire

18:04.049 --> 18:09.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country to a set of principles,
a set of rules
that the president, him or
herself, makes.

18:09.388 --> 18:12.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what we would be allowing
presidents
to do if we said any time a
president, like

18:12.691 --> 18:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama, wants to
subject an entire
country to a new set of rules,
that president

18:17.963 --> 18:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can do so without submitting
that international
agreement to the Senate for
treaty ratification.

18:22.901 --> 18:26.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator,
maybe this is
alone those lines, but I'm now
reading comments

18:26.805 --> 18:29.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even from some Republicans who
have a problem
with this decision.

18:29.708 --> 18:34.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Republican congressman from
Florida, Carlos
Curbelo, was interviewed, I
heard, just within

18:34.913 --> 18:35.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the hour.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is saying this is a mistake.

18:37.549 --> 18:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: I'm already seeing the
impact of
climate change on my part of the
state.

18:41.553 --> 18:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need to move forward with
technology
to address it.

18:44.857 --> 18:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to quickly quote the
former Republican
Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson, who said

18:50.629 --> 18:52.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he's dismayed and disappointed.

18:52.498 --> 18:57.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: "By moving ourselves to
the sidelines
of an evolving global
conversation," he said,

18:57.269 --> 18:59.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"we have left a void for others
to fill.

18:59.738 --> 19:05.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regrettably, this undermines
U.S. credibility,
weakens our ability to lead in
other areas."

19:05.511 --> 19:06.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE LEE: Yes, look, I
completely disagree.

19:08.814 --> 19:12.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that you can point to
some people
who call themselves Republicans
who disagree

19:12.551 --> 19:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with this decision doesn't
change this analysis.

19:15.454 --> 19:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I notice there wasn't a
corresponding
pushback to the person who
preceded me.

19:19.391 --> 19:21.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You didn't push back like this
to Governor
Brown.

19:21.727 --> 19:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand that you might
disagree personally
with what the president did
today.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator --
Senator...

19:27.399 --> 19:28.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE LEE: But that doesn't make
it -- I'm
sorry.

19:29.401 --> 19:30.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would like to answer your
question.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That doesn't mean that this was
wrong.

19:33.539 --> 19:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was the right thing to do.

19:34.706 --> 19:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president put people before
this Paris
agreement.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He put Pittsburgh before Paris.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did the right thing.

19:43.482 --> 19:46.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, just to
set the record
straight, I quoted President
Trump several

19:46.919 --> 19:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times back to Governor Brown in
my interview
with him, just as I have quoted
some who criticized

19:53.358 --> 19:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's decision in my
interview with
you.

19:56.061 --> 19:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Finally, Senator, let me...

19:57.062 --> 19:58.030 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:58.063 --> 19:59.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MIKE LEE: Yes.

19:59.064 --> 20:00.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I want to be clear.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason I made that point is,
you didn't
try to identify some Democrats
who might have

20:03.368 --> 20:04.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supported this.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You quoted the president
himself.

20:06.305 --> 20:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I'm saying is, you are
pushing back
on me in a way you didn't push
back on him.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's fine.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's your right to do that as
a reporter.

20:14.346 --> 20:18.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
finally ask you,
Senator, the president said he's
open to renegotiation.

20:18.884 --> 20:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're already hearing from
European officials
that it's -- that this is an
accord not open

20:23.589 --> 20:24.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for renegotiation.

20:24.823 --> 20:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how do you foresee moving
ahead in that
direction?

20:28.427 --> 20:30.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE LEE: Well, if they're
saying this is
not open for renegotiation, and
this negotiation

20:34.499 --> 20:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was itself something that
couldn't get through
the United States Senate, and
that's why President

20:38.337 --> 20:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama never submitted it to the
Senate for
treaty ratification, then we're
at an impasse,

20:43.108 --> 20:44.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and we will proceed.

20:45.010 --> 20:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will proceed, by the way, I
should add,
as a global leader in
environmental regulation.

20:49.748 --> 20:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are a global leader in the
rule of law.

20:52.184 --> 20:56.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have brought down emissions
in this country
through our legal system and
through technological

20:56.622 --> 20:57.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
innovation.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can do this on our own.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have to have the
permission of countries
all over the world to do that.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have done it pretty well.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done it much better than
a lot of
our would-be partners in this
agreement.

21:06.832 --> 21:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Mike Lee
of Utah, thank
you very much for talking with
us.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.404 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE LEE: Thank you.

21:15.807 --> 21:30.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brutal wars in
the Middle East,
Africa and Asia have forced the
world's populations

21:30.555 --> 21:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of refugees and displaced
persons to near
record highs.

21:34.259 --> 21:40.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, the Trump
administration has signaled
its intention to substantially
change U.S.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
refugee policy.

21:42.167 --> 21:46.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Filippo Grandi, who is the
United Nations'
top official leading the
response to the refugee

21:46.605 --> 21:51.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crisis, is in Washington this
week for meetings
at the White House and Pentagon.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our William Brangham sat down
with him earlier
this evening.

21:54.513 --> 21:56.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hi,
Commissioner Filippo
Grandi.

21:56.381 --> 21:57.849 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI, United Nations
High Commissioner
for Refugees: Thank you.

21:59.685 --> 22:00.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You're here in
Washington,
D.C., obviously this week to
meet with some

22:00.919 --> 22:02.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
members of the Trump
administration.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm curious, what message are
you here to
convey to them?

22:05.724 --> 22:11.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: A message that I
have already
conveyed in previous visits.

22:11.496 --> 22:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. leadership in humanitarian
matters and
specifically in matters
concerning responses

22:20.605 --> 22:25.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to refugee crisis is very
important, continues
to be very important.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the response I get is quite
good.

22:27.446 --> 22:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What is that
response?

22:28.780 --> 22:30.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you hear back from them?

22:30.649 --> 22:34.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Well, I think we
all watched
Ambassador Haley, the U.S.
ambassador to United

22:34.720 --> 22:35.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nations...

22:35.721 --> 22:37.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Nikki Haley,
yes.

22:37.322 --> 22:43.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: ... visit
recently refugee
programs in Turkey and in
Georgia.

22:43.662 --> 22:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're talking about Syrian
refugees, the biggest
refugee crisis in the world.

22:48.633 --> 22:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And her message was very clear
and very strong.

22:51.903 --> 23:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States' generosity and
United States'
support for refugees continues
to be strong

23:00.445 --> 23:01.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and constant.

23:01.747 --> 23:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I greatly appreciated this
message on
her part.

23:07.119 --> 23:10.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I know
Ambassador Haley
has said that on several
occasions.

23:10.989 --> 23:16.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have also seen President
Trump try
to pass through an executive
order that, in

23:16.461 --> 23:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effect, says, we're not taking
any refugees
in the U.S.

23:20.232 --> 23:25.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president has conflated
refugees with
the fear of terrorism, saying,
we can't know

23:25.504 --> 23:27.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who these people are.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this something that you bring
up with administration
officials?

23:29.941 --> 23:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you talk with them about
those concerns
that they have shared?

23:32.744 --> 23:35.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: A great deal.

23:35.447 --> 23:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I don't think there was
ever any
statement saying that no more
refugees should

23:41.119 --> 23:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
come to the United States.

23:42.921 --> 23:49.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were decisions to increase
the vetting
of those selected to come here
and to limit

23:49.861 --> 23:51.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
certain nationalities.

23:51.296 --> 23:56.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this, as you know, is now
being discussed
in the judicial sphere.

23:56.368 --> 24:02.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have to wait for that
discussion, which
is an American, a U.S.
discussion to finish.

24:02.574 --> 24:07.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our message is, resettlement
programs -- this
is what we're talking about --
are a very

24:07.546 --> 24:12.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important tool to protect the
most vulnerable
refugees.

24:12.517 --> 24:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And vetting is already quite
strong for those
refugees that enter that
program.

24:18.723 --> 24:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, this is a sovereign
decision of
the United States, but I think
and I hope

24:23.195 --> 24:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, after all this is done,
after conclusions
are made, that program will be
preserved.

24:29.668 --> 24:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it may be reduced to
previous higher
levels, but I hope that, with
the passage

24:35.340 --> 24:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of time and once these controls
-- once the
administration confident that
the controls

24:40.645 --> 24:44.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are there, will we continue to
see robust
resettlement to the United
States.

24:44.850 --> 24:48.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The reason I
ask about this
is, this is not just a concern
expressed by

24:48.153 --> 24:52.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump, but even
Chancellor Angela
Merkel in Germany has seen a
good deal of

24:52.858 --> 24:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resistance to her very open
embrace of refugees.

24:55.694 --> 25:03.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There still is a very strong
fear, a conflation
of refugees with the fear of
terrorism.

25:03.068 --> 25:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm just curious what you --
what do you
say to world leaders when they
express this,

25:07.672 --> 25:11.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we don't have the political
appetite
to take refugees onto our
shores?

25:12.010 --> 25:17.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: The fear of
insecurity is
a very understandable one,
especially in a

25:17.182 --> 25:25.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world in which terrorism has
created so much
damage and killed so many
people.

25:25.223 --> 25:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are, of course, with
states in saying
controls, checks, vetting have
to be carried

25:32.831 --> 25:36.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out in the most -- in the
strongest possible
way.

25:36.801 --> 25:38.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is absolutely true.

25:38.303 --> 25:41.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I also pass another message.

25:41.273 --> 25:49.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it's very rare, if
ever, that refuges
coming from situations of war,
of violence,

25:49.581 --> 25:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of violations of human rights
perpetrate crimes
of terrorism.

25:54.019 --> 25:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is not they who do that.

25:55.687 --> 25:56.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is other people.

25:56.988 --> 26:01.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, those people do not
bring terror.

26:01.993 --> 26:03.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Refugees flee from terror.

26:03.695 --> 26:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's very important not
to conflate
refugees and terrorists in this
sense.

26:08.199 --> 26:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very important to control,
it's very
important to check, but it's
also very important

26:11.970 --> 26:16.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make that distinction, and
never forget
where these people come from.

26:16.341 --> 26:19.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly, a
quick question
on funding.

26:19.110 --> 26:22.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know this is obviously an
enormous challenge
for the U.N.

26:22.447 --> 26:25.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you have enough money to do
the work you
need to do?

26:25.784 --> 26:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Certainly not.

26:29.120 --> 26:36.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our budget last year was
calculated at 7 billion
U.S. dollars, 2016.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We got billion U.S. dollars.

26:38.563 --> 26:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So about 55 percent of our needs
the covered.

26:41.833 --> 26:44.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This means that we do a lot of
prioritization.

26:44.736 --> 26:47.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we prioritize, evidently.

26:47.339 --> 26:53.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With so many refugee crises,
with 65 million
refugees and displaced people
around the world,

26:53.612 --> 26:56.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have to prioritize lifesaving
activities.

26:56.581 --> 26:58.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What suffers?

26:58.416 --> 27:03.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What suffers what is not
immediately vital
and necessary, but which is
equally important,

27:03.888 --> 27:06.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like education, livelihoods.

27:06.625 --> 27:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why we're looking at
other ways to
meet those needs with other
sources of funding,

27:11.630 --> 27:17.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
because they're equally
important in the long
run to sustain assistance to
millions of refugees.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Filippo
Grandi, thank you
very much for being here.

27:19.938 --> 27:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILIPPO GRANDI: Thank you.

27:23.742 --> 27:34.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Coming up on the
"NewsHour":
new developments in the Russia
file -- Vladimir

27:35.020 --> 27:41.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin says some patriotic
Russians might have
tried to influence the U.S.
election; from

27:41.393 --> 27:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia to climate change, the
politics that
still divide the nation; and a
Brief But Spectacular

27:48.266 --> 27:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take from two people living with
Alzheimer's.

27:53.171 --> 27:56.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: the double-edged
sword of urban
revival.

27:56.708 --> 28:01.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even as some cities are becoming
ever more
popular and desirable, they're
also becoming

28:01.279 --> 28:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places where the middle-class
and lower-income
residents are getting priced out
of the market.

28:07.752 --> 28:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Economics correspondent Paul
Solman has the
story.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series,
Making Sense.

28:13.591 --> 28:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Looking down on
Manhattan's old
meatpacking district, the High
Line, a mecca

28:20.065 --> 28:25.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for more than seven million
eager tourists
a year, astride a once-derelict
spur of the

28:25.403 --> 28:27.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
New York Central.

28:27.338 --> 28:29.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA, Author, "The
New Urban Crisis":
This was an old, broken-down,
abandoned rail

28:29.374 --> 28:30.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
line, elevated rail line.

28:30.542 --> 28:34.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: A rail line
shrouding the buildings
beneath.

28:34.479 --> 28:38.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a result, rents were cheap
and the cutting-edge
marginalized moved in.

28:38.283 --> 28:41.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: Much of this
area of Chelsea
was historically a gay
neighborhood.

28:41.786 --> 28:47.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were gay men and wanted
to do something
which celebrated the history of
the old gay

28:47.726 --> 28:48.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neighborhood.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Noted urbanologist
Richard Florida:

28:51.496 --> 28:54.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: There's one of
the old buildings
still with the rainbow flag.

28:54.466 --> 28:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A remnant of a past
that proved
a harbinger of gentrification to
come.

28:59.104 --> 29:02.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: Once they built
the park,
it became a draw, not of people,
but for real

29:02.941 --> 29:04.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
estate developers.

29:04.242 --> 29:05.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they never anticipated that.

29:05.977 --> 29:10.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one anticipated the High Line
would be
a place that luxury towers would
grow up around.

29:11.015 --> 29:12.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But have they ever.

29:12.984 --> 29:18.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For nearly a mile-and-a-half,
the elevated
walkway now winds through towers
full of luxury

29:18.690 --> 29:25.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
condos, over-the-top testimony
to the urban
revitalization that Florida
famously championed

29:25.663 --> 29:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in his 2002 book, "The Creative
Class."

29:28.399 --> 29:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: We're going
through, I think,
one of the greatest economic
transformations

29:31.536 --> 29:37.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in history, from an old
industrially, corporate-based
vertical economy to a new
knowledge economy.

29:37.041 --> 29:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the twist I try to add is,
it's also urban.

29:40.378 --> 29:41.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's city-based.

29:41.379 --> 29:42.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's clustered in cities.

29:42.380 --> 29:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Florida's twist
became gospel.

29:45.049 --> 29:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attract members of the creative
class, and
they, in turn, will create jobs,
which will,

29:50.255 --> 29:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in turn, renew and rebuild.

29:52.824 --> 29:53.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it happened.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just look at the High Line.

29:55.827 --> 30:01.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what Florida now sees is the
double edge
of the advice he gave, and that
so many followed.

30:01.332 --> 30:05.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: A bigger,
denser city in
general increases the rate of
innovation,

30:05.904 --> 30:08.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increases the rate of start-up,
increases
the rate of productivity.

30:08.540 --> 30:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, the bigger,
the denser,
the more knowledge-intensive
increases the

30:12.644 --> 30:17.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate of inequality, increases
the rate of
economic segregation, makes
housing less affordable.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it's a two-sided monster.

30:18.850 --> 30:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Those unintended
consequences
of urban revival are the
real-world twist

30:23.421 --> 30:26.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Florida wrestles with in his
latest book,
"The New Urban Crisis."

30:26.991 --> 30:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: People want to
park money
in real estate, artists, the
best art galleries

30:31.095 --> 30:36.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the world, commercial
companies, real estate
development firms, financial
headquarters,

30:36.267 --> 30:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tech companies, start-ups and
companies like
Google.

30:39.103 --> 30:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the second dimension is, I
kind of call
it a crisis of success.

30:43.007 --> 30:48.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These places now become terribly
unaffordable
for anyone who's not either a
knowledge worker

30:49.013 --> 30:51.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or a techie or a member of the
super rich.

30:51.549 --> 30:56.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As a result,
pressure on most
of the city's residents, now
facing apartment

30:56.888 --> 31:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rents and prices soaring as high
as the buildings
that house them, many actually
unoccupied,

31:02.927 --> 31:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're assets for
foreigners, parking
their money, as Florida puts it,
in real estate.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: You used to
have stocks,
you used to have bonds.

31:11.636 --> 31:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now owning real estate in a
superstar city
becomes another class of asset.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Rents in this
building?

31:17.008 --> 31:22.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roughly $3,500 a month for a
one-room studio
apartment, $4,700 for a
one-bedroom, $7,000

31:22.547 --> 31:24.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for two bedrooms.

31:24.449 --> 31:30.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARA HOCHRAD, ®MD-BO /New York: I
could not
live in a decent Manhattan
apartment by myself.

31:30.088 --> 31:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I might be able to live in
Queens or maybe
outer skirts of Brooklyn these
days, because

31:36.060 --> 31:37.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's gotten very expensive
there, too.

31:37.996 --> 31:42.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Sara Hochrad, a
31-year-old speech
therapist who works nearby,
lives across town

31:42.667 --> 31:46.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with roommates, was hoping to
move somewhere
close with her boyfriend.

31:46.471 --> 31:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much would you and he have
to earn, just
a guess, to be able to afford a
$4,700-a-month

31:52.710 --> 31:53.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
apartment?

31:53.711 --> 31:56.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARA HOCHRAD: Maybe $150,000,
$170,000.

31:56.047 --> 32:00.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, and that's to really cut
down into the
bare bones of what -- how you
live.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: At least $150,000 a
year.

32:02.220 --> 32:10.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was testimony like this that
triggered
Florida's aha moment: the
gradual displacement

32:10.194 --> 32:14.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of all but the most successful
types he'd
long urged cities to attract.

32:14.232 --> 32:17.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: We did an
analysis which
looked at the amount of money in
these three

32:17.802 --> 32:22.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups, the knowledge creative
class, the
working blue-collar class, and
the service

32:22.240 --> 32:24.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
workers, had left over after
paying for housing.

32:24.842 --> 32:27.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The creatives had like $80,000
or $90,000
left over.

32:27.312 --> 32:30.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The blue-collars had $30,000,
and the service
workers had like $15,000.

32:30.381 --> 32:36.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I realized that this urbanism,
winner-take-all
urbanism, it was benefiting one
group much

32:36.387 --> 32:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more disproportionately than the
other two.

32:38.423 --> 32:44.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, with
ballooning rents, low-income
workers are being squeezed out
entirely, banished

32:44.562 --> 32:46.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the once-desirable suburbs.

32:46.464 --> 32:50.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: It's a crisis
that's metastasizing
of poverty, concentrated
poverty, economic

32:50.635 --> 32:52.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
distress in our suburbs.

32:52.537 --> 32:57.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's been happening
for decades,
of course: the inexorable
pinching of America's

32:57.175 --> 33:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
middle class, the move towards
what's been
called an hourglass economy,
with the prosperous

33:03.314 --> 33:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the top half, the less
well-off in the
bottom, and fewer and fewer
Americans in between.

33:09.153 --> 33:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: If the old
urban crisis was
about the middle-class flight
from the city

33:13.057 --> 33:18.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the suburbs, the new urban
crisis is about
really the disappearance of
middle-class neighborhoods

33:18.896 --> 33:19.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from our society.

33:19.897 --> 33:21.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes.

33:21.733 --> 33:22.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: What's tragic
about that
is, the middle-class
neighborhoods were really

33:22.967 --> 33:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our launch pads for upward
mobility and the
American dream.

33:25.136 --> 33:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Thus Florida's
first epiphany:
the growing divide within cities
between the

33:30.274 --> 33:35.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rich and rest, who are being
forced out of
town, though he also had a
second insight,

33:35.980 --> 33:42.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the divide between cities,
winner-take-all
urbanism, the winners, San
Francisco, New

33:42.854 --> 33:47.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
York, the losers, cities like
Detroit, Milwaukee,
Memphis.

33:47.458 --> 33:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even in these stressed
cities, creative
class clustering is beginning to
segregate

33:52.730 --> 33:53.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the rich from the rest.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But wait a second.

33:55.767 --> 34:01.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The winning cities simply
followed Florida's
own advice, suggesting a pointed
question

34:01.706 --> 34:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about what he calls the new
urban crisis.

34:04.742 --> 34:06.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did he help cause it?

34:06.511 --> 34:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: I think I
really wanted to
help cities understand that
urban revival,

34:09.380 --> 34:16.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but that urban revival,
according to the data
we now have, it's 2000 to now
where that urban

34:16.087 --> 34:18.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
revival goes into full-bore.

34:18.122 --> 34:25.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think I was not only
surprised, shocked
by the speed of it, and shocked
by the way

34:25.897 --> 34:27.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it put pressure on cities.

34:27.432 --> 34:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But then what, if
anything, can
be done to close the gap?

34:34.672 --> 34:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, one answer, building
public transit
to connect the lagging outskirts
to jobs in

34:43.481 --> 34:45.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the booming urban core.

34:45.183 --> 34:50.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, hey, the 34th Street and
Hudson Yards
subway station just opened in
2015.

34:50.154 --> 34:54.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD FLORIDA: It's
spectacular, but if
you look at most of the subway
stops and transit

34:54.792 --> 34:57.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hubs, Penn Station, they're
falling apart.

34:57.428 --> 35:03.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Penn Station, New
York's key
commuter hub, is ever more
haunted by delays

35:03.234 --> 35:06.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and cancellations, the result of
aging infrastructure.

35:06.037 --> 35:12.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you really modernize a
city's transit
system, you run back into the
double-edged

35:12.276 --> 35:18.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sword of Florida's advice: The
better the
transit, the denser and more
productive the

35:18.483 --> 35:23.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city, the less its lower-end
workers will
be able to able to afford to
live in it, the

35:23.688 --> 35:26.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more of a rich enclave it
becomes.

35:26.424 --> 35:34.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, yes, that may be true,
Florida acknowledges,
and so he says that today's
cities have to

35:34.098 --> 35:35.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
start insisting:

35:35.967 --> 35:38.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: If you want to
build a tower
like that, if you want to get
the rights to

35:38.369 --> 35:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
create height and density, we're
going to
make a trade.

35:42.607 --> 35:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the trade we're going to
make, in order
for you to go up like that,
you're going to

35:45.676 --> 35:47.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make affordable housing.

35:47.445 --> 35:52.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Affordable housing,
the only
real way to try to close the
gap, says Florida.

35:52.383 --> 35:58.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why not muscle developers to
offer workers
in their projects cheap rents,
good wages?

35:58.523 --> 36:02.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: Why not have
your tenants
be the ones that are creating
better, higher-paying

36:02.860 --> 36:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service jobs, that are creating
a family-supporting
job, so we can have an
inclusionary prosperity,

36:07.665 --> 36:12.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cities can say, we will
trade density
for good things that developers
will do?

36:12.537 --> 36:15.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In order to get the density they
want and
the height they want, they have
got to build

36:15.640 --> 36:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affordable housing, and they
have got to build
a more inclusive community.

36:18.776 --> 36:23.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, if they don't,
we're left
with the two faces of Florida's
prescient

36:23.614 --> 36:25.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
creative class advice.

36:25.249 --> 36:28.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD FLORIDA: That's the
great contradiction
of today's urbanized capitalism.

36:28.319 --> 36:32.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, if we want to have a
productive
city, an innovative city, a
country that innovates

36:32.857 --> 36:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and creates good jobs, we need
them, but,
at the same time, that the very
thing that

36:37.061 --> 36:39.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is driving our economy forward
is creating
these divides.

36:39.630 --> 36:44.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," this
is economics correspondent Paul
Solman, reporting

36:44.268 --> 36:50.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from and below the High Line in
New York City.

36:50.908 --> 37:02.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported
earlier, Russian
President Vladimir Putin seemed
to hint today

37:02.787 --> 37:08.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Russian involvement in
hacking during last
year's presidential campaign,
not by government

37:08.492 --> 37:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agents, but by what he called
patriotically-minded
individuals.

37:12.463 --> 37:17.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meantime, the fallout from the
Trump campaign's
alleged contacts with Russia,
and the ongoing

37:17.602 --> 37:22.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tensions between Washington and
Moscow, continue
on several fronts.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has more.

37:24.141 --> 37:28.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Late last year, in
response to
the Russian campaign meddling,
the Obama administration

37:28.713 --> 37:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expelled 35 suspected Russian
intelligence
operatives from the United
States, and seized

37:34.151 --> 37:39.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two long-held Russian diplomatic
compounds,
one on the Eastern Shore of
Maryland, the

37:39.657 --> 37:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other on the North Shore of Long
Island.

37:42.593 --> 37:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the Washington Post
reports that the
Trump White House is now
considering returning

37:47.298 --> 37:52.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those properties, which are
widely considered
intelligence-gathering hubs.

37:52.470 --> 37:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's more, Politico reports
that alleged
Russian spies have been turning
up in odd

37:56.874 --> 38:02.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places around the United States,
often near
parts of the nation's critical
telecommunications

38:02.880 --> 38:04.749 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
network.

38:04.782 --> 38:09.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one part of what U.S.
intelligence officials
see as intensifying Russian
espionage and

38:09.387 --> 38:13.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
counterespionage measures both
here and in
Russia.

38:13.291 --> 38:18.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With me now for more on these
stories are
Karen DeYoung of The Washington
Post and Ali

38:18.596 --> 38:19.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Watkins of Politico.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks to you both.

38:21.499 --> 38:24.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These two stories are different
enough, I
want to handle them one at a
time.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, apologies to you, Ali.

38:26.203 --> 38:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want the turn first to Karen
DeYoung.

38:28.172 --> 38:31.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Karen, walk us through how this
is coming
about.

38:31.942 --> 38:37.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration took
away these compounds
to punish the Russians, and now
the Trump

38:37.748 --> 38:39.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House is talking about
giving them back?

38:39.583 --> 38:42.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN DEYOUNG, The Washington
Post: Well,
they were not -- although the
Russians charged

38:42.620 --> 38:47.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they were expropriated,
they're still
the property of the Russian
government.

38:47.158 --> 38:53.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the Americans did in the
Obama administration
was to ban the Russians from
having access

38:53.064 --> 38:54.732 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

38:54.765 --> 38:57.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They told them they all had to
leave in 24
hours, and they couldn't come
back.

38:57.435 --> 39:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the FBI and other
agencies went in
and proved to their own
satisfaction that

39:02.373 --> 39:05.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what they thought was happening
there was
actually happening.

39:05.776 --> 39:11.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration in a
meeting with
-- between Secretary Tillerson,
Secretary

39:11.982 --> 39:18.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of State Tillerson and the
Russian foreign
minister, Sergei Lavrov, last
month said that

39:18.989 --> 39:24.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they would drop what had been a
linkage between
the two, what the Trump
administration had

39:24.695 --> 39:31.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said was linkage between letting
the Russians
go back into the buildings and
have access

39:31.669 --> 39:37.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to them again and the Russians
giving up a
situation that had been going on
for several

39:37.174 --> 39:44.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years in St. Petersburg, where,
in response
to previous U.S. sanctions
against Russia

39:44.281 --> 39:49.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over Ukraine, the Russians had
refused to
allow the Americans to build a
new consulate

39:49.220 --> 39:51.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in St. Petersburg.

39:51.455 --> 39:56.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the administration had
said, well,
let's -- you give us our
consulate, and we

39:56.360 --> 39:57.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will give you back your
building.

39:57.928 --> 40:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russians said, no, you're in
the wrong
and we're not.

40:02.199 --> 40:05.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This was an illegal
expropriation.

40:05.336 --> 40:10.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a couple days later, when
Foreign Minister
Lavrov was here, the Americans
said, OK, we

40:10.307 --> 40:12.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
won't link them anymore.

40:12.343 --> 40:18.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since then, the Americans
have been working
on specific proposals to give
the Russians

40:18.082 --> 40:22.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the conditions under which
they will
give them back.

40:22.052 --> 40:29.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians said today in
Moscow that -- that
Tillerson had told them that
they would send

40:29.627 --> 40:33.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them specific proposals, but
they haven't
gotten anything yet, but they're
still confident

40:33.631 --> 40:37.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they're going to get their
compounds
back.

40:37.468 --> 40:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Ali, talking
about sort of
Russian activities, let's turn
to you.

40:41.939 --> 40:48.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your reporting found that U.S.
intelligence
officials were finding Russian
diplomats turning

40:48.679 --> 40:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up in odd places around the
country, right?

40:50.614 --> 40:55.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI WATKINS, Politico: This has
been kind
of a growing concern of what my
understanding

40:55.653 --> 41:00.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is the FBI over the last
year-and-a-half of
Russian diplomats within the
U.S. who are

41:00.791 --> 41:03.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supposed to follow pretty
stringent travel
rules.

41:03.327 --> 41:07.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're supposed to notify the
State Department
when they travel anywhere
outside of their

41:07.431 --> 41:09.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
posting.

41:09.266 --> 41:13.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Russian diplomats
effectively disregarding
those travel rules and turning
up in places

41:13.070 --> 41:16.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they shouldn't have been or
that they
never told the State Department
they were

41:16.040 --> 41:17.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going.

41:17.174 --> 41:18.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And what do they
think they were
up to?

41:18.275 --> 41:20.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALI WATKINS: Yes.

41:20.077 --> 41:22.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As U.S. intelligence officials
started kind
of looking at where these guys
were turning

41:22.613 --> 41:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, they would turn up over
where a fiber-optics
cable ran underground, or these
strange locations

41:28.986 --> 41:34.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that when, taken as a whole, it
was -- became
clear that they were on some
kind of mission

41:34.258 --> 41:37.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to kind of map the
infrastructure.

41:37.495 --> 41:41.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The intel part went to this
infrastructure
mapping of some of the
telecommunications

41:41.866 --> 41:43.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
networks in the country.

41:43.300 --> 41:46.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And was this -- is
this a change
from previous behavior?

41:46.604 --> 41:49.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does it seem like the Russians
are emboldened
somehow?

41:49.473 --> 41:53.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI WATKINS: You know, there is
an element
of this that's kind of par for
the course.

41:53.711 --> 41:55.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is natural intelligence
gathering.

41:55.646 --> 41:59.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The whole art of espionage is
trying to do
things that a host country
doesn't want you

41:59.850 --> 42:01.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

42:01.752 --> 42:05.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's different about this
is that there's
been kind of a burgeoning
debate, particularly

42:05.523 --> 42:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the last year with this
election operation,
of the U.S., particularly under
the Obama

42:10.661 --> 42:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration, being unwilling
to fight back
on this, and not cracking down
as much as

42:16.534 --> 42:22.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they could, when they know that
these Russian
diplomats who are presumed
intelligence operatives

42:22.339 --> 42:26.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are doing these things, brazenly
disregarding
these rules that they're
supposed to follow.

42:26.911 --> 42:32.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ali and Karen, let me
ask you both
-- and I will start with you,
Ali -- earlier

42:32.216 --> 42:38.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, Vladimir Putin again
denied that the
Russian state was involved in
the meddling

42:38.389 --> 42:43.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the election, but suggested
it could
be patriots in Russia.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of that
statement, Ali?

42:45.429 --> 42:50.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI WATKINS: I mean, there are
some very -- it's
a lot of kind of wordplay going
on there,

42:50.935 --> 42:51.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I think.

42:51.936 --> 42:53.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Putin is not stupid.

42:53.771 --> 42:57.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He knows what he's saying, in
that Russian
intelligence is fundamentally
different from

42:57.107 --> 43:01.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. intelligence, in that there
are a lot
more gray zones in the world of
Russia.

43:01.478 --> 43:06.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Putin says this could
have been private
sector patriotic actors, but we
didn't know

43:06.617 --> 43:11.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anything about it on a state
level, from a
U.S. perspective, that might
make sense.

43:11.422 --> 43:16.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
An American intelligence
operation isn't necessarily
set up to use private sector
hackers.

43:16.694 --> 43:20.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Putin is kind of exploiting
that gray
zone and that disconnect.

43:20.364 --> 43:24.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's not surprising that he'd
say something
like that, but it no doubt comes
with a bit

43:24.368 --> 43:25.336 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a wink-wink.

43:25.369 --> 43:27.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Karen, what do you
think of it?

43:27.404 --> 43:30.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been watching the
Russians for a
long time.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you take of that?

43:31.976 --> 43:36.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN DEYOUNG: Well, I think
that the allegation
has always been that the
Russians worked through

43:36.814 --> 43:43.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals, non-governmental
individuals,
in order to do this hacking, and
that they

43:43.220 --> 43:48.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were guided by and turned the
information
over to Russian intelligence.

43:48.292 --> 43:57.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think what Putin is doing
is basically
acknowledging that they did it
in a very indirect

43:57.468 --> 43:59.203 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

43:59.236 --> 44:04.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's kind of thumbing his
nose at the
Americans and saying, you know,
you can't

44:04.642 --> 44:09.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pin this on us, even though I
think that he's
not really fooling anybody.

44:09.246 --> 44:10.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Very good.

44:10.814 --> 44:14.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Karen DeYoung, Ali Watkins,
thanks for being
with us.

44:14.184 --> 44:19.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREN DEYOUNG: You're welcome.

44:19.723 --> 44:30.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn our focus
to politics
now, from tensions inside the
White House

44:30.401 --> 44:33.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to pulling out of the Paris
accord.

44:33.270 --> 44:35.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we break it all down with
Matt Schlapp.

44:35.506 --> 44:38.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is chair of the American
Conservative Union.

44:38.642 --> 44:43.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior
adviser to
MoveOn.org.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to both of you.

44:45.082 --> 44:47.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's be crassly political
here.

44:47.251 --> 44:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked earlier, Matt, in the
program about
the substance of the president's
decision.

44:50.921 --> 44:51.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White House
Director
of Political Affairs: Right.

44:52.022 --> 44:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the pushback
on it.

44:53.557 --> 44:56.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was the political calculus
behind this,
do you think?

44:56.427 --> 44:58.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: You look at all
these polls.

44:58.228 --> 45:01.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most polls will tell you that
Americans supported
the idea of fighting climate
change.

45:01.965 --> 45:03.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's really not right the
question.

45:04.001 --> 45:05.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's digging down deeper.

45:05.736 --> 45:09.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real question about climate
change is,
are they willing to pay more to
fill their

45:09.506 --> 45:10.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tank with gas?

45:10.674 --> 45:13.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they willing to pay more for
their utility
bills?

45:13.577 --> 45:17.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are they willing to take some of
this American
energy -- we're now the world's
leading supplier

45:17.915 --> 45:22.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of energy -- and take it
offline, which has
a big impact on U.S. jobs?

45:22.586 --> 45:23.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the real question.

45:23.587 --> 45:25.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By the way, it cuts across party
lines.

45:25.723 --> 45:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most Americans think that what
they're asking
them to pay for, for this
crusade on climate

45:31.228 --> 45:33.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is simply not worth losing jobs
or paying
more for energy.

45:33.997 --> 45:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It makes it sound
like a winning
decision today, Karine.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic
Strategist:
I think what happened today,
what we saw today,

45:38.936 --> 45:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what Donald Trump did was -- it
was a political
play.

45:41.605 --> 45:42.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's all it was.

45:42.606 --> 45:43.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't about the economy.

45:43.607 --> 45:45.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't about the environment.

45:45.609 --> 45:47.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't about businesses.

45:47.344 --> 45:51.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was purely about that small,
shrinking
base that he has that he needs
to placate

45:51.415 --> 45:58.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with -- when it comes to every
tweet, every
action, every message that he
puts out, it's

45:58.288 --> 46:00.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all about them.

46:00.124 --> 46:03.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He continues to give them the
red meat that
he feels that they need, and
that's what we

46:03.827 --> 46:05.496 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
saw.

46:05.529 --> 46:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, if anything, we really saw
Steve Bannon
winning the day with that speech
as well.

46:09.767 --> 46:13.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, is there
any risk, political
risk, in what the president did,
Matt?

46:13.704 --> 46:14.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Sure.

46:14.705 --> 46:16.039 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

46:16.073 --> 46:18.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think, if it is about
politics, people will
see through that.

46:18.142 --> 46:19.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I actually think it's something
deeper.

46:19.943 --> 46:24.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a campaign promise he made
to the working
men and women across this
country who have

46:24.381 --> 46:27.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not seen their economic
prospects improve.

46:27.151 --> 46:28.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You see that in poll after poll.

46:28.919 --> 46:32.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's the number one
reason Donald
Trump is president, and that his
number one

46:32.256 --> 46:38.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gauge of his success is if the
economy can
get chugging and we can make
these folks feel

46:38.362 --> 46:40.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and actually know that their
economic prospects
are improving.

46:40.831 --> 46:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he can't do that, I think
he's going to
have political trouble.

46:43.367 --> 46:45.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Can I just
add, Judy,
there is a poll -- speaking of a
poll, there's

46:45.969 --> 46:51.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a poll that shows 70 percent of
Americans
actually agreed with the Paris
accord; 55

46:51.141 --> 46:52.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
percent were Republicans.

46:52.776 --> 46:54.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there were Americans who
were behind,
behind this.

46:54.912 --> 46:58.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: But if you dig
deeper, the real
political question is, are you
willing to

46:58.682 --> 47:02.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay the higher taxes, the
credits and all
the things that you have to do
to make carbon

47:02.986 --> 47:05.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more expensive to take it off
the grid?

47:05.289 --> 47:07.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's where it gets dicey
for your side.

47:07.090 --> 47:10.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I
think the bigger
question is our planet and what
are we going

47:10.928 --> 47:14.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to leave our children with --
you have five
kids, I have a kid -- and our
grandchildren

47:14.765 --> 47:19.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with, if we don't take actually
responsibility
to what this country, our
country is doing

47:19.570 --> 47:21.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the climate?

47:21.338 --> 47:22.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's also talk
about what
has been happening inside the
White House

47:22.973 --> 47:24.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

47:24.708 --> 47:27.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of suspense built up today
over what
the president was going to this,
at a time

47:27.344 --> 47:34.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when there's been a lot of
reporting about
unsettled -- the unsettled
nature of how things

47:34.051 --> 47:35.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are going now with the staff.

47:35.419 --> 47:37.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I haven't read any
of that.

47:37.754 --> 47:39.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:39.156 --> 47:40.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's been
in a couple
of news organizations.

47:40.557 --> 47:42.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let me put it that way.

47:42.059 --> 47:44.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You talk to people in the White
House.

47:44.127 --> 47:45.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Sure.

47:45.128 --> 47:46.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that
overblown?

47:46.129 --> 47:47.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: No.

47:47.431 --> 47:48.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are people
feeling -- OK, what
is going on?

47:48.866 --> 47:50.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: No, it's not
overblown.

47:50.801 --> 47:55.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my belief is that the
president is impatient
over the fact that there's been
some bungling

47:55.339 --> 47:58.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on some of these rollouts and
some of these
decisions.

47:58.141 --> 47:59.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's been way too much
leaking.

48:00.010 --> 48:04.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is always leaking in White
Houses, but
this is a journalist's dream
come true, because

48:04.181 --> 48:07.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have 18, 20, 22 people
talking for stories.

48:07.484 --> 48:08.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's out of control.

48:08.819 --> 48:10.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think he knows it needs to
tighten up.

48:10.520 --> 48:14.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I believe that he's
communicated internally
that he expects it to tighten
up.

48:14.224 --> 48:17.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if it doesn't get better --
and he has
got to up his game, too.

48:17.294 --> 48:20.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it doesn't get better, I
think he's going
to make a lot more changes.

48:20.297 --> 48:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Karine, what
is -- I mean,
is this just all an upside for
Democrats,

48:25.035 --> 48:30.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if the president continues to
have these kinds
of issues, or are Democrats
basically just

48:30.440 --> 48:31.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
watching from the sideline?

48:31.675 --> 48:33.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I think we
just watch
on the sideline.

48:33.543 --> 48:36.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he's his worst enemy.

48:36.113 --> 48:38.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, look, when it comes to
situations
like this -- and you know.

48:38.982 --> 48:39.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have worked for a president.

48:39.983 --> 48:40.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have worked for the president.

48:40.984 --> 48:42.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The fish really rots at its
head.

48:42.786 --> 48:44.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is Donald Trump's
responsibility.

48:44.354 --> 48:46.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no one else to blame
but himself.

48:46.924 --> 48:49.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's the one that tweets
off-message, not
his staff.

48:49.927 --> 48:54.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the one that says things
that doesn't
make sense that really angers a
lot of people,

48:54.264 --> 48:58.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including, you know, people who
even voted
for him are a little concerned
about what

48:58.068 --> 48:59.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he's doing.

48:59.069 --> 49:00.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we see that in focus groups.

49:00.837 --> 49:03.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When you say he
needs to up
his game, your words, what did
you mean?

49:03.307 --> 49:04.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes.

49:04.308 --> 49:06.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, look, there's an
independent counsel.

49:06.076 --> 49:07.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's an investigation going
on.

49:08.011 --> 49:11.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's got to be careful about how
he talks
about that.

49:11.315 --> 49:15.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My advice is for the White House
is simply
go along with the investigation.

49:15.986 --> 49:18.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do not comment on the
investigation.

49:18.755 --> 49:21.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't do anything that makes it
look like
you're putting any pressure on
the investigation.

49:21.558 --> 49:25.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand the president and
his team are
frustrated because they don't
see any there

49:25.429 --> 49:26.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

49:26.663 --> 49:28.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think they need to do
that.

49:28.532 --> 49:31.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, as far as the staff is
concerned,
I think it was absurd that the
Russian delegation

49:32.002 --> 49:35.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was able to go into the Oval
Office with recording
devices and cameras.

49:35.072 --> 49:37.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't know who was going
to get the
photos.

49:37.174 --> 49:40.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Keystone Cops part of this
must end.

49:40.811 --> 49:45.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With an outsider president and
an investigation
going on, the staff has to be
twice as good,

49:45.882 --> 49:47.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they can't afford to make
these kind of
mistakes.

49:47.684 --> 49:50.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Karine, no
matter what
is going on in the White House,
if Donald

49:50.954 --> 49:55.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's base, the people who
voted for him,
like the basics of what he's
doing, whether

49:55.492 --> 50:01.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's the climate decision or, I
don't know,
his attempts to set up a travel
ban, even

50:01.231 --> 50:06.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though that hasn't happened yet,
does it really
matter politically whether the
White House

50:06.036 --> 50:07.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is -- quote -- "dysfunctional"
or not?

50:07.371 --> 50:09.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I think it
will at some
point.

50:09.740 --> 50:12.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, there's 2018 coming
right around the
corner.

50:12.209 --> 50:16.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's going to hurt
Republicans, what
we see Donald Trump doing,
because it's not

50:16.480 --> 50:17.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just Republicans.

50:17.748 --> 50:21.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not that small base that
got him to the
White House.

50:21.351 --> 50:24.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was also Democrats and
independents that
got him into the White House.

50:24.354 --> 50:25.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: That's true.

50:25.355 --> 50:27.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

50:27.224 --> 50:27.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: And, by the way,
he has a lot
of them on his staff at the
White House, too.

50:27.858 --> 50:28.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Right.

50:28.859 --> 50:30.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But here's the thing.

50:30.594 --> 50:32.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the House in some
of these
suburbs that they have to win,
the Republicans

50:32.929 --> 50:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to win, you need support
outside of your
Republican base.

50:36.633 --> 50:38.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it is going to hurt them
when it comes
to 2018.

50:38.535 --> 50:41.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I have a feeling
this may not
be the last time we have a
chance to talk

50:41.772 --> 50:42.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

50:42.773 --> 50:43.740 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:43.774 --> 50:45.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Let's hope not.

50:45.142 --> 50:47.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine
Jean-Pierre, Matt Schlapp,
thank you both.

50:47.110 --> 50:52.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Thank you.

50:52.349 --> 50:57.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Thanks,
Judy.

50:57.621 --> 51:04.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask people

51:04.261 --> 51:06.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to describe their passions.

51:06.263 --> 51:11.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Five-and-a-half million
Americans are living
with Alzheimer's disease, and
another 15 million

51:11.701 --> 51:14.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
serve as their unpaid
caregivers.

51:14.037 --> 51:20.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, two individuals
diagnosed with Alzheimer's,
Chris Hannafan and Pam Montana,
share their

51:20.677 --> 51:21.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experiences.

51:21.812 --> 51:23.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN, Living With
Alzheimer's: I
am 66.

51:23.413 --> 51:26.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was diagnosed when I was 65.

51:26.049 --> 51:35.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAM MONTANA, Living With
Alzheimer's: I was
diagnosed initially in November
of 2015.

51:35.659 --> 51:37.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think I'm getting the
dates right.

51:37.194 --> 51:39.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Part of my issue is my dates
sometimes mush
together.

51:39.996 --> 51:42.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: Yes, I know
exactly what we're
doing.

51:42.632 --> 51:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know you're Steve.

51:43.767 --> 51:44.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know you're Zack.

51:44.801 --> 51:47.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're here in Pine Street,
finally.

51:47.337 --> 51:49.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:49.306 --> 51:55.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: On July 20 of last
year, I received
the official diagnosis, with 17
research physicians

51:56.012 --> 52:02.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and doctors in the room, myself,
my husband
and my two children, with the
diagnosis of

52:02.519 --> 52:06.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
early-onset, early-stage
Alzheimer's.

52:06.389 --> 52:11.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: You can take a minute
or two.

52:11.094 --> 52:13.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: Every time I say
it.

52:13.930 --> 52:22.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: The way I
explain it to people
is, I am in a new life.

52:22.572 --> 52:26.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My former life no longer exists,
and it's
up to me to create a new life.

52:26.543 --> 52:28.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: I knew something
was wrong.

52:28.612 --> 52:31.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not normal to not be able
to calculate
a tip anymore.

52:31.248 --> 52:35.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not normal to not do math
in your head
and to be able to subtract or
add numbers.

52:35.452 --> 52:40.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not normal to not remember
conversations
or to attend a training class
and not remember

52:41.024 --> 52:42.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what was taught.

52:42.192 --> 52:44.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: More and more
words are going
away.

52:44.828 --> 52:51.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are a number of words
that, no matter
how I remember them, they are
not there.

52:51.835 --> 52:56.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I could say, OK, now I have got
it, and, two
minutes later, I won't have it.

52:56.439 --> 52:59.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: With Alzheimer's,
you don't have
an option.

53:00.010 --> 53:01.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You just -- it's just not there.

53:01.378 --> 53:03.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The information is just gone.

53:03.180 --> 53:07.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: It seems to be
particularly
difficult for those of us with
Alzheimer's

53:07.250 --> 53:14.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
early-onset to have -- sorry --
I got a little
bit.

53:14.991 --> 53:18.428 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
OK, where was I?

53:18.461 --> 53:21.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: Frustrating is the
word that
comes to mind.

53:21.865 --> 53:27.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am frustrated with the fact
that I don't
know what 32 minus seven is
without a pen

53:27.270 --> 53:28.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and paper.

53:28.905 --> 53:32.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It frustrates me that I have no
idea what
today is, but I do know it's
Friday.

53:32.409 --> 53:34.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: The first thing
I lost was
my car.

53:34.778 --> 53:39.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I was no longer able to use
my car for
various reasons.

53:39.649 --> 53:42.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I got a bicycle.

53:42.252 --> 53:43.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have had two crashes with
that.

53:44.020 --> 53:45.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think part of that is
spatial.

53:45.822 --> 53:48.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: Now I have a new
job.

53:48.058 --> 53:53.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that job is to be loud and
proud about
my disease, to share my symptoms
with everyone

53:53.930 --> 53:55.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and anyone who will listen to
me.

53:55.532 --> 53:57.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS HANNAFAN: I'm able to be
useful.

53:57.634 --> 54:05.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm able to have -- to surround
myself with
a lot of people, which is
absolutely the most

54:05.408 --> 54:06.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important thing you can do with
Alzheimer's.

54:07.010 --> 54:09.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAM MONTANA: Everyone always
tells me I look
good.

54:09.746 --> 54:13.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, what does that have to do
with anything?

54:13.083 --> 54:17.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I keep saying to people, I'm
going to walk
around in a bathrobe with a
towel on my head,

54:17.654 --> 54:22.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, no makeup, just an old
hag, and
then maybe then they will think
I have Alzheimer's.

54:22.859 --> 54:25.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is what Alzheimer's
looks like.

54:25.328 --> 54:26.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It looks like me.

54:26.329 --> 54:28.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
