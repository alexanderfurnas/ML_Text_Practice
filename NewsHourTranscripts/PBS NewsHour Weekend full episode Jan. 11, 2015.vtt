07:42.329 --> 07:43.363
FIRST PLACE?

07:43.363 --> 07:44.464
FOR MORE ABOUT THAT, WE ARE

07:44.464 --> 07:45.732
JOINED NOW FROM WASHINGTON BY

07:45.732 --> 07:46.666
HUMERA KHAN.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.268
SHE'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF

07:48.268 --> 07:51.004
MUFLEHUN, A THINK TANK WHOSE

07:51.004 --> 07:51.838
MISSION IS TO THWART TERRORISM.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.006
SHE'S ALSO AN ADVISOR TO SEVERAL

07:53.006 --> 07:54.074
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INCLUDING

07:54.074 --> 07:57.977
THE F.B.I.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.479
SO WHAT CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT

07:59.479 --> 08:01.047
THE RADICALIZATION IN THE FIRST

08:01.047 --> 08:02.482
PLACE?

08:02.482 --> 08:05.018
>> WELL, FOR PREVENTION ONE OF

08:05.018 --> 08:06.019
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS YOU

08:06.019 --> 08:07.454
HAVE TO DEAL WITH IS RAISING

08:07.454 --> 08:08.655
AWARENESS.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.156
PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

08:10.156 --> 08:11.024
UP AGAINST.

08:11.024 --> 08:14.361
AND ACTUALLY, THE BAREST ENTRY

08:14.361 --> 08:16.463
YOU DON'T HAVE YOUTH WANTING TO

08:16.463 --> 08:18.064
ENGAGE IN IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.100
FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT CAUGHT

08:20.100 --> 08:21.868
THROUGH PREVENTION, RIGHT, THEY

08:21.868 --> 08:23.169
HAVE SOMEHOW ALREADY GONE DOWN

08:23.169 --> 08:26.039
THE TRACK YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO

08:26.039 --> 08:27.173
START TALKING ABOUT

08:27.173 --> 08:28.441
INTERVENTION, THAT IS THE CASE

08:28.441 --> 08:30.810
WHERE SOMEBODY EXPOSED TO THE

08:30.810 --> 08:32.912
IDEA HAS NOT COMMITTED ANY

08:32.912 --> 08:34.781
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, NOT MOBILIZED

08:34.781 --> 08:36.516
TO CRIMINAL HE ACTIVITY, THEN

08:36.516 --> 08:39.953
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN INTERVENTION

08:39.953 --> 08:41.654
FOR STOPPING THEM TO GO OFF TO

08:41.654 --> 08:42.122
FIGHT.

08:42.122 --> 08:43.523
WORKING WITH THEM SPECIFICALLY

08:43.523 --> 08:44.958
AND THAT'S AN INDIVIDUAL PROCESS

08:44.958 --> 08:49.396
TO GET THEM TO DISENGAGE FROM

08:49.396 --> 08:51.798
THEIR THOUGHTS PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

08:51.798 --> 08:54.834
>> WHAT KIND OF INTERVENTION ARE

08:54.834 --> 08:57.070
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:57.070 --> 08:58.004
FAMILIES, MEMBERS OF THE

08:58.004 --> 08:59.506
COMMUNITY, WHAT DO THEY DO?

08:59.506 --> 09:04.077
>> THE SPECTRUM.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.111
DIFFERING DEPENDING ON THE

09:05.111 --> 09:06.079
COUNTRY AND ALSO THE

09:06.079 --> 09:07.013
NEIGHBORHOOD YOU'RE TALKING

09:07.013 --> 09:07.781
ABOUT.

09:07.781 --> 09:11.184
IN THE U.S. WE ACTUALLY HAVE ARE

09:11.184 --> 09:13.319
MODELS WHERE WE'RE RUNNING IT

09:13.319 --> 09:15.288
THROUGH THE IMAM.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.556
NOT ONLY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT

09:16.556 --> 09:18.224
ALSO FOR THE FAMILY MEMBERS

09:18.224 --> 09:19.459
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IN SOME CASES

09:19.459 --> 09:21.394
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE FAMILY

09:21.394 --> 09:21.895
DYSFUNCTION.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.363
IN OTHER COUNTRIES YOU ACTUALLY

09:23.363 --> 09:24.297
HAVE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS WHICH

09:24.297 --> 09:27.734
ARE RUN THROUGH THE FAMILY

09:27.734 --> 09:30.537
ITSELF, OTHERS ARE RUN 30

09:30.537 --> 09:32.105
THROUGH DIFFERENT COMMUNITY

09:32.105 --> 09:32.672
CENTERS.

09:32.672 --> 09:33.740
ANYONE WHO CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A

09:33.740 --> 09:34.808
TRUSTED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

09:34.808 --> 09:35.542
PERSON.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.510
THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF TRUST AND

09:37.510 --> 09:41.014
THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF

09:41.014 --> 09:42.115
LEGITIMACY, IN TERMS OF WHAT

09:42.115 --> 09:43.116
THEY'RE SAYING, THAT PERSON

09:43.116 --> 09:45.652
COULD DO IT, THAT COULD BE A

09:45.652 --> 09:47.253
YOUTH DIRECTOR, A MENTOR, THERE

09:47.253 --> 09:50.423
ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.761
>> THIS ISN'T A PROCESS THAT

09:54.761 --> 09:55.962
HAPPENS OVERNIGHT.

09:55.962 --> 09:57.897
YOU HEAR THEM YEAR AFTER YEAR

09:57.897 --> 09:59.799
WALKING DOWN THAT PATH.

09:59.799 --> 10:01.634
HOW DO YOU INTERVENE AT JUST THE

10:01.634 --> 10:02.335
RIGHT TIME?

10:02.335 --> 10:08.208
>> INTERVENTIONS ARE SOMETHING

10:08.208 --> 10:11.077
THAT THE SOONER YOU DO IT --

10:11.077 --> 10:12.412
THE SOONER YOU DO IT THE BETTER

10:12.412 --> 10:13.947
IT IS.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.381
THE HARDER IT IS TO PULL THEM

10:15.381 --> 10:15.915
BACK.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.084
THE FIRST TIME YOU ACTUALLY SEE

10:18.084 --> 10:19.919
SOMETHING SHIFTING, THE BEHAVIOR

10:19.919 --> 10:20.920
CHANGING OPINIONS SHIFTING,

10:20.920 --> 10:22.455
THAT'S THE PLACE, THAT'S IDEAL

10:22.455 --> 10:24.090
PLACE YOU WANT TO DO IT BEFORE

10:24.090 --> 10:25.992
YOU HAVE TO -- BECAUSE ONCE THE

10:25.992 --> 10:29.229
IDEAS ARE SET, IT IS A LOT

10:29.229 --> 10:30.864
HARDER TO DECONSTRUCT THEM.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.899
>> HOW DO YOU FOR EXAMPLE

10:32.899 --> 10:36.803
THE INFLUENCE OF -- COMBAT FOR

10:36.803 --> 10:40.373
EXAMPLE THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL

10:40.373 --> 10:43.943
MEDIA, JOINING A HASHTAG AND

10:43.943 --> 10:45.111
CELEBRATING A SPECIFIC ATTACK?

10:45.111 --> 10:48.982
>> WELL SOCIAL MEDIA IS USED TO

10:48.982 --> 10:50.450
RECRUIT.

10:50.450 --> 10:54.287
SOCIAL MEDIA HAS THE POWER TO

10:54.287 --> 10:56.389
USE FOR PREVENTION.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.958
THAT ITSELF IS NOT ENOUGH.

10:58.958 --> 11:00.627
OOH A HASHTAG IS NOT GOING TO

11:00.627 --> 11:02.762
CHANGE A PERSON'S MIND.

11:02.762 --> 11:06.833
SOCIAL MEDIA IS A VERY

11:06.833 --> 11:07.934
INTERACTIVE PLATFORM.

11:07.934 --> 11:16.409
WE HAVE TO USE THAT ACROSS THE

11:16.409 --> 11:18.211
SPECTRUM OF TOOLS.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.347
>> HUMERA KHAN, THANKS SO MUCH

11:21.347 --> 11:21.948
FOR BEING HERE.

11:21.948 --> 11:30.590
>> IS THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

11:30.590 --> 11:32.125
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW WE WANT

11:32.125 --> 11:33.359
TO RETURN TO A STORY THAT WAS

11:33.359 --> 11:34.460
DOMINATING THE HEADLINES IN THE

11:34.460 --> 11:35.328
MONTHS BEFORE THE FRENCH

11:35.328 --> 11:36.663
ATTACKS.

11:36.663 --> 11:37.630
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OFTEN

11:37.630 --> 11:38.531
FRAUGHT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

11:38.531 --> 11:39.732
POLICE AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES.

11:39.732 --> 11:40.934
LAST WEEK, WE HEARD FROM TWO

11:40.934 --> 11:41.968
AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO WERE

11:41.968 --> 11:43.069
CRITICAL OF THE POLICE.

11:43.069 --> 11:44.237
TONIGHT, WE HEAR FROM TWO

11:44.237 --> 11:46.606
RETIRED NEW YORK CITY POLICE

11:46.606 --> 11:47.473
OFFICERS, WHO BOTH PATROLLED THE

11:47.473 --> 11:50.677
SOUTH BRONX.

11:50.677 --> 11:51.978
>> I'M JOINED NOW BY RETIRED

11:51.978 --> 11:57.283
OFFICERS MIKE BYRD AND RUSSELL

11:57.283 --> 11:59.185
WILLIAMS.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.553
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BEYOND THAT

12:00.553 --> 12:01.554
IN YOUR OPINIONS WHAT IS THE

12:01.554 --> 12:03.356
SOURCE OF THESE TENSIONS?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.558
>> IT'S MOSTLY FRUSTRATION.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.493
YOU KNOW, AND PEOPLE ARE TAKING

12:07.493 --> 12:10.363
THEIR FRUSTRATIONS OUT, AND I

12:10.363 --> 12:13.533
BLAME THE ADMINISTRATIONS.

12:13.533 --> 12:16.269
THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE JUST

12:16.269 --> 12:17.670
DOING WHAT THEY'VE BEEN TAUGHT

12:17.670 --> 12:19.973
TO DID WHICH IS ENFORCE THE LAWS

12:19.973 --> 12:22.442
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE CITY, STATE,

12:22.442 --> 12:25.078
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.913
AND SOMETIMES, YEAH, YOU DO HAVE

12:26.913 --> 12:28.281
CERTAIN OFFICERS THAT GO ABOVE

12:28.281 --> 12:29.816
AND BEYOND THAT.

12:29.816 --> 12:33.620
BUT HOWEVER, IT'S MORE SO,

12:33.620 --> 12:35.288
DEPOSIT IS TURNING THEIR BACKS

12:35.288 --> 12:36.956
ON A LOT OF THE PEOPLE.

12:36.956 --> 12:38.758
>> WHEN YOU SAW THESE

12:38.758 --> 12:39.492
DEMONSTRATIONS AFTER FERGUSON

12:39.492 --> 12:42.395
HERE IN NEW YORK, AFTER ERIC

12:42.395 --> 12:44.097
GARNER HERE IN NEW YORK, WHAT

12:44.097 --> 12:45.365
WENT THROUGH YOUR MINDS?

12:45.365 --> 12:49.035
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE TOOK IT ON AS

12:49.035 --> 12:50.937
BEING ANTI POLICE.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.540
YOU CAN BE -- ANTI-POLICE.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.776
YOU CAN BE BEYOND STOP AND

12:56.776 --> 12:58.878
FRISK, YOU CAN BE AGAINST

12:58.878 --> 12:59.779
BRUTALITY.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.880
WHO WANTS TO BE IN FAVOR

13:00.880 --> 13:01.914
BRUTALITY?

13:01.914 --> 13:05.051
I UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION

13:05.051 --> 13:07.320
THEY FEEL, THEY FEEL LIKE

13:07.320 --> 13:08.521
THEY'RE BEING TARGETED UNFAIRLY.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.623
SO I DIDN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.425
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DO.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.961
THAT THEY FEEL WELL, CONTRIBUTES

13:14.961 --> 13:16.663
TO AN ENVIRONMENT AND A LOT OF

13:16.663 --> 13:19.799
US THAT FEEL IT WAS ANTI-POLICE

13:19.799 --> 13:21.601
IN GENERAL AND THAT'S WHY THAT

13:21.601 --> 13:23.202
GUY CAME ALL THE WAY FROM

13:23.202 --> 13:24.203
BALTIMORE TO KILL TWO POLICE

13:24.203 --> 13:25.138
OFFICERS.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.339
>> THERE IS ALSO THE FEELING

13:26.339 --> 13:27.807
THAT WHEN AN OFFICER DOES TRY

13:27.807 --> 13:29.909
REACH OUT TO TRY BRIDGE THE

13:29.909 --> 13:30.943
DIVIDE, AND IMPROVE RELATIONS

13:30.943 --> 13:33.212
WITH THE COMMUNITY, FOR EXAMPLE,

13:33.212 --> 13:34.681
IN PITTSBURGH AROUND NEW YEAR'S

13:34.681 --> 13:37.884
THERE WAS THE CHIEF OF POLICE

13:37.884 --> 13:40.687
THERE HAD POSED FOR A SIGN IN A

13:40.687 --> 13:41.988
COFFEE SHOP OR SOMETHING THAT

13:41.988 --> 13:48.361
KIND OF WENT VIRAL, I RESOLVE TO

13:48.361 --> 13:51.497
FIGHT RACISM AND WHITE VIOLENCE.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.099
THE UNION LOOKED YOU JUST

13:53.099 --> 13:55.201
LABELED ALL OF US COPS AS A

13:55.201 --> 13:57.303
BUNCH OF RACISTS, AND THAT'S NOT

13:57.303 --> 13:58.304
FAIR.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.807
WHY IS IT IT'S SUCH A HARSH

14:00.807 --> 14:01.974
DICHOTOMY?

14:01.974 --> 14:05.812
>> I CAN'T SPEAK AS FAR AS

14:05.812 --> 14:07.513
PITTSBURGH IS CONCERNED BUT THE

14:07.513 --> 14:13.453
20 YEARS, 20 PLUS YEARS I HAVE

14:13.453 --> 14:14.921
WITH NEW YORK CITY, THE NEW YORK

14:14.921 --> 14:16.489
CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT IS SO

14:16.489 --> 14:17.724
RACIALLY DIVERSE.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.058
YOU HAVE RUSSIAN COPS.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.927
YOU HAVE BLACK OFFICERS.

14:20.927 --> 14:23.563
LATINO OFFICERS.

14:23.563 --> 14:26.466
YOU HAVE GAYS, YOU HAVE -- I

14:26.466 --> 14:29.168
WORK WITH PEOPLE FROM INDIA.

14:29.168 --> 14:32.638
SO TO LABEL US AS RACIST, IT'S

14:32.638 --> 14:34.073
KIND OF HARD.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.142
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE'RE MORE

14:36.142 --> 14:39.178
DIVERSE THAN ANY OTHER INDUSTRY

14:39.178 --> 14:41.614
OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF PROFESSION

14:41.614 --> 14:42.849
IN THE WORLD.

14:42.849 --> 14:47.420
>> YOU GO TO A 9/11 CALL, YOU

14:47.420 --> 14:50.823
DON'T CARE WHO'S CALLING YOU GO

14:50.823 --> 14:51.324
TO ASSIST.

14:51.324 --> 14:55.428
YOU GO TO HELP.

14:55.428 --> 14:56.329
OFFICERS DON'T LIKE TO BE

14:56.329 --> 14:57.363
LABELED AS RACIST.

14:57.363 --> 14:59.132
THAT IS A HARD CONVERSATION,

14:59.132 --> 14:59.999
SOMETHING VERY HARD TO HEAR.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.702
>> THERE WAS A COMMUNITY

15:02.702 --> 15:04.470
ACTIVIST LAST WEEK WHO WAS

15:04.470 --> 15:06.172
TALKING ABOUT HER ORGANIZATION

15:06.172 --> 15:07.840
HAVING TO FIELD PHONE CALLS FROM

15:07.840 --> 15:10.643
PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET

15:10.643 --> 15:11.878
THEMSELVES TO TRUST THE POLICE.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.213
>> TO BE AN EFFECTIVE LAW

15:14.213 --> 15:15.314
ENFORCEMENT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE

15:15.314 --> 15:17.216
TRUST AND THE COMMITMENT AND THE

15:17.216 --> 15:19.051
COOPERATION OF A COMMUNITY.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.520
LISTEN, I'VE HAD INSTANCES JUST

15:20.520 --> 15:22.288
IN THE PAST YEAR WHERE I'VE HAD

15:22.288 --> 15:30.630
A GRANDMOTHER CALL, NAACP OFFICE

15:30.630 --> 15:35.034
WHERE SHE IS A LOCAL MEMBER OF A

15:35.034 --> 15:39.038
GANG IS MAKE HIM KEEP GUNS IN

15:39.038 --> 15:40.039
HER HOUSE.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.608
>> YOU HAVE WALKED THE BEATS

15:42.608 --> 15:44.677
BEFORE, YOU HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW

15:44.677 --> 15:45.812
TO MAKE THINGS WORK.

15:45.812 --> 15:49.382
WHY ASK THERE THIS MISTRUST IN

15:49.382 --> 15:50.149
COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY

15:50.149 --> 15:52.084
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND WHAT DO

15:52.084 --> 15:53.486
YOU DO TO GET OVER THAT?

15:53.486 --> 15:55.388
>> IT HELPS WHEN YOU DO

15:55.388 --> 15:56.656
COMMUNITY POLICING.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.624
TALKING TO PEOPLE 101, WHICH IS

15:58.624 --> 16:01.494
WHAT I DID IN THE SOUTH BRONX.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.362
YOU CAN'T GENERALIZE.

16:03.362 --> 16:07.133
ONE COMMUNITY, YOU WELCOME YOU

16:07.133 --> 16:08.401
THERE -- THEY WELCOME YOU THERE.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.735
THEY'RE GLAD TO SEE ME.

16:09.735 --> 16:11.237
ANOTHER AREA, THEY HAVE

16:11.237 --> 16:11.938
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH AGAINST THE

16:11.938 --> 16:13.272
POLICE.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.875
WHENEVER I CAME, ALL THE DRUG

16:15.875 --> 16:18.244
DEALERS THEY HAD THEIR LOOKOUTS,

16:18.244 --> 16:19.679
EVERYONE WAS WORKING AGAINST ME

16:19.679 --> 16:21.080
BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO MAKE

16:21.080 --> 16:22.381
MONEY.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.784
>> SO WHY DO YOU THINK THAT

16:24.784 --> 16:25.551
DISTRUST EXISTS?

16:25.551 --> 16:28.221
>> GIULIANI MOVED AWAY FROM

16:28.221 --> 16:30.690
COMMUNITY POLICING AND IT MOVED

16:30.690 --> 16:32.258
TOWARDS WE NEED TO CLEAN UP THE

16:32.258 --> 16:32.825
STREETS.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.760
WE NEED MORE PROACTIVE.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.562
WE NEED TO MAKE MORE ARRESTS FOR

16:36.562 --> 16:37.930
QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.966
AND AFTER THAT WAS ALL DONE AND

16:39.966 --> 16:42.969
WE CLEANED UP THE STREETS, THE

16:42.969 --> 16:44.804
MISTAKE IN THE NEW YORK CITY

16:44.804 --> 16:46.339
POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT TO GO

16:46.339 --> 16:48.074
BACK TO COMMUNITY POLICING.

16:48.074 --> 16:48.808
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO

16:48.808 --> 16:53.412
GO BACK TO TEACHING SOCIAL

16:53.412 --> 16:54.947
SCIENCES AND HAVING THE COPS

16:54.947 --> 16:55.748
KNOW TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENTLY

16:55.748 --> 16:57.617
TYPES -- DIFFERENT TYPES OF

16:57.617 --> 17:04.590
PEOPLE, DIFFERENT RACES.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.726
NOWADAYS IT'S ROBOTIC AND THEY

17:06.726 --> 17:08.494
HAVE LOST CONTACT WITH THE

17:08.494 --> 17:09.528
COMMUNITY.

17:09.528 --> 17:14.700
>> THE CONVERSATION THAT MAYOR

17:14.700 --> 17:17.837
BILL De BLASIO MENTIONED A

17:17.837 --> 17:19.705
CONVERSATION HE HAD TO HAVE WITH

17:19.705 --> 17:22.875
HIS BIRACIAL SON.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.377
AN OFFICER SITTING HERE LAST

17:24.377 --> 17:27.280
WEEK HAD THAT SAME DILEMMA, YES

17:27.280 --> 17:28.848
I'M A POLICE OFFICER AND I HAD

17:28.848 --> 17:31.083
TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION TOO.

17:31.083 --> 17:34.921
>> I HAVE A 13-YEAR-OLD, HE IS A

17:34.921 --> 17:35.988
VERY INNOCENT CHILD.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.224
HE WOULDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND AN

17:38.224 --> 17:40.426
INTERACTION WITH THE POLICE.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.128
HE'S TAKING PHOTOS AS A CHILD

17:42.128 --> 17:43.996
IN HIS FATHER'S UNIFORM AND HE

17:43.996 --> 17:45.932
WAS PROUD OF THAT BUT

17:45.932 --> 17:47.700
UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAY THAT

17:47.700 --> 17:49.068
POLICE RESPOND AND INTERACT

17:49.068 --> 17:51.270
WITH OUR YOUNG BLACK YOUTH IS

17:51.270 --> 17:52.204
PROBLEMATIC.

17:52.204 --> 17:53.673
>> JUST A MENTION OF THAT

17:53.673 --> 17:56.642
CONVERSATION AND PERHAPS THE

17:56.642 --> 18:00.212
INCREASED LEGITIMIZATION OF IT,

18:00.212 --> 18:03.082
WAS SUCH A SORE SPOT FOR POLICE

18:03.082 --> 18:04.450
OFFICERS IN NEW YORK AND

18:04.450 --> 18:05.217
ELSEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.

18:05.217 --> 18:05.885
WHY IS THAT?

18:05.885 --> 18:10.456
>> I BLAME A LOT OF THAT ON

18:10.456 --> 18:11.757
MAYOR BLOOMBERG ACTUALLY.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.592
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER, THERE WAS

18:13.592 --> 18:15.528
GREAT INCREASE IN STOP QUESTION

18:15.528 --> 18:15.995
AND FRISK.

18:15.995 --> 18:19.565
A LOT OF BLACKS BEING STOPPED.

18:19.565 --> 18:23.436
AND YOU HAVE 90 -- OUT OF ALL

18:23.436 --> 18:26.339
THOSE STOPS, 90% THEY WEREN'T

18:26.339 --> 18:27.373
EVEN ARRESTED.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.041
90% OF PEOPLE WERE STOPPED FOR

18:29.041 --> 18:31.010
BASICALLY NO REASON.

18:31.010 --> 18:31.911
AND OF COURSE YOU'RE GOING TO

18:31.911 --> 18:32.945
HAVE TENSION THERE.

18:32.945 --> 18:36.916
GOT TO REMEMBER, UNDER GIULIANI,

18:36.916 --> 18:38.050
EVEN THOUGH WE WERE CLEANING UP

18:38.050 --> 18:39.986
THE CITY THE NUMBER OF STOP,

18:39.986 --> 18:42.455
QUESTION AND FRISK TOPPED OUT AT

18:42.455 --> 18:44.256
ABOUT 100,000 A YEAR.

18:44.256 --> 18:47.126
UNDER BLOOMBERG THAT INCREASED

18:47.126 --> 18:48.928
600% TO ALMOST 700,000 A YEAR.

18:48.928 --> 18:49.862
THAT'S A VAST INCREASE.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.430
>> HARI, I GREW UP IN

18:51.430 --> 18:54.800
WASHINGTON HEIGHTS IN HARLEM.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.902
AND I COME FROM A BIRACIAL

18:56.902 --> 18:57.903
MARRIAGE.

18:57.903 --> 18:58.971
MY FATHER'S IRISH, MY MOTHER'S

18:58.971 --> 19:03.075
DOMINICAN.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.443
I WAS TAUGHT TO RESPECT THE

19:04.443 --> 19:04.777
POLICE.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.879
IF A POLICE OFFICER COMES UP TO

19:06.879 --> 19:08.180
YOU, AND ASKS YOU A QUESTION,

19:08.180 --> 19:10.049
YOU ANSWER HIM WITH RESPECT.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.417
I'VE GIVEN THAT SAME PHILOSOPHY

19:11.417 --> 19:12.551
TO MY CHILDREN.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.787
IF THEY GET STOPPED BY THE

19:14.787 --> 19:16.655
POLICE, YES, SIR, WHAT DID I DO

19:16.655 --> 19:18.958
WRONG SIR, NOT SUCKING YOUR

19:18.958 --> 19:20.593
TEETH OR WAVING YOUR HANDS OR

19:20.593 --> 19:22.161
ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT YOU DO

19:22.161 --> 19:23.396
SEE IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES IN

19:23.396 --> 19:25.765
NEW YORK CITY.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.067
WHEN A POLICE OFFICER COME UP TO

19:28.067 --> 19:30.069
A GROUP OF KIDS ON THE CORNER

19:30.069 --> 19:31.637
THEY'LL HAVE AN ATTITUDE.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.672
THAT PART COMES FROM YOUR

19:33.672 --> 19:35.074
UPBRINGING, YOU KNOW.

19:35.074 --> 19:35.708
RESPECT THE POLICE.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.910
>> I MEAN I'VE SEEN IT, I COME

19:37.910 --> 19:39.245
FROM A POLICE FAMILY.

19:39.245 --> 19:40.946
MY BROTHER WAS A POLICE OFFICER

19:40.946 --> 19:42.415
BEFORE ME, MY FATHER WAS A

19:42.415 --> 19:43.249
POLICE OFFICER.

19:43.249 --> 19:44.784
MY FATHER DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND

19:44.784 --> 19:46.285
OF TALK WITH ME.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.254
I MEAN OF COURSE I RESPECT

19:48.254 --> 19:49.455
PEOPLE BUT HE DIDN'T SAY WELL

19:49.455 --> 19:52.758
YOU HAVE TO LOOK OUT, YOU HAVE

19:52.758 --> 19:54.493
TO LOOK OUT FOR THE POLICE, YOU

19:54.493 --> 19:55.394
KNOW?

19:55.394 --> 19:57.029
HE TOLD ME YOU JUST HAVE TO

19:57.029 --> 19:58.297
RESPECT EVERYBODY.

19:58.297 --> 19:59.632
YOU KNOW, RESPECT AUTHORITY.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.333
>> DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT

20:01.333 --> 20:02.468
CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING

20:02.468 --> 20:06.005
PLACES, IN PLACES BEYOND MAYOR

20:06.005 --> 20:06.839
De BLASIO'S HOUSEHOLD?

20:06.839 --> 20:08.207
>> OF COURSE I UNDERSTAND THAT

20:08.207 --> 20:10.843
CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING.

20:10.843 --> 20:14.413
AND THAT'S POLICE ARE THE

20:14.413 --> 20:16.449
ENFORCEMENT ARM.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.251
SING THE WHOLE SYSTEM CANNING

20:19.251 --> 20:22.721
SEEM KIND OF STACKED.

20:22.721 --> 20:27.226
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DISPARITIES

20:27.226 --> 20:29.595
BETWEEN MARIJUANA ARRESTS, USING

20:29.595 --> 20:31.330
MARIJUANA AT THE SAME RATES BUT

20:31.330 --> 20:34.100
AS FAR AS ARRESTS GO, BLACKS ARE

20:34.100 --> 20:35.401
VASTLY OVERREPRESENTED AND

20:35.401 --> 20:37.236
THAT'S BECAUSE THE POLICE IS

20:37.236 --> 20:38.404
FOCUSED ON THE MINORITY

20:38.404 --> 20:39.171
COMMUNITY.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.406
>> HOW COULD YOU HAVE SUCH

20:40.406 --> 20:41.407
DIFFERENT OUTCOMES?

20:41.407 --> 20:45.478
>> WELL, IT'S JUST LIKE RUSSELL

20:45.478 --> 20:46.178
SAID.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.680
WHITES AND BLACKS SMOKE THE SAME

20:47.680 --> 20:50.583
AMOUNT OF MARIJUANA.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.384
I WOULD SAY 90% OF THE WHITES

20:52.384 --> 20:55.321
ARE SMOKING IT IN THE PRIVACY OF

20:55.321 --> 20:56.856
THEIR HOME OR IN THE PRIVACY OF

20:56.856 --> 20:59.325
A CERTAIN PLACE.

20:59.325 --> 21:02.528
WHEREAS, IN THE BLACK

21:02.528 --> 21:03.896
COMMUNITIES, THEY'RE OUT IN

21:03.896 --> 21:04.830
PUBLIC, SMOKING IT.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.299
SO WE SEE IT, YOU KNOW.

21:07.299 --> 21:09.835
IF I SEE A WHITE GUY SMOKING POT

21:09.835 --> 21:13.672
I'M GOING TO STOP HIM AND GYM

21:13.672 --> 21:16.275
HIM HIS SUMMONS OR HIS ARREST.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.810
DOESN'T MATTER WHO'S SMOKING IT,

21:17.810 --> 21:20.179
IT'S BREAKING THE LAW IN MY

21:20.179 --> 21:21.046
PRESENCE.

21:21.046 --> 21:21.680
DOESN'T MATTER.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.482
>> DOWN ON THE STREET LEVEL WHAT

21:23.482 --> 21:26.785
IS THE TIP AS TWO RETIRED

21:26.785 --> 21:29.188
OFFICERS YOU HAVE, THE COMMUNITY

21:29.188 --> 21:30.956
AS WELL AS THE POLICE, TO STOP

21:30.956 --> 21:32.725
IT BEFORE IT GETS WORSE?

21:32.725 --> 21:36.328
>> AS A MATTER OF FACT, AS MIKE

21:36.328 --> 21:38.030
EARLIER, WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO

21:38.030 --> 21:40.166
COMMUNITY POLICING LET THE

21:40.166 --> 21:41.600
OFFICERS FOCUS MORE ON 101.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.102
>> BEYOND NEW YORK WHAT'S YOUR

21:43.102 --> 21:43.869
SUGGESTION?

21:43.869 --> 21:45.471
>> THE POLICE NEED TO GET OUT

21:45.471 --> 21:46.172
INTO THE COMMUNITY.

21:46.172 --> 21:47.673
THEY HAVE TO.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.175
THEY CAN'T JUST STAY IN THE CARS

21:49.175 --> 21:50.809
AND DRIVE THEM AROUND AND WAIT

21:50.809 --> 21:51.744
FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.

21:51.744 --> 21:52.611
THEY NEED TO GO AND JUST WALK

21:52.611 --> 21:53.612
THE BEAT.

21:53.612 --> 21:57.283
>> OKAY, MIKE BYRD, RUSSELL

21:57.283 --> 22:03.889
WILLIAMS, THANK YOU BOTH THANK

22:03.889 --> 22:06.358
YOU BOTH FOR YOUR TIME.

22:06.358 --> 22:11.597

22:12.398 --> 22:13.199

22:20.906 --> 22:22.241
THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND

22:22.241 --> 22:28.581
SUNDAY.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.049
>> Sreenivasan: EVERY YEAR,

22:30.049 --> 22:31.250
MILLIONS OF NORTH AMERICAN

22:31.250 --> 22:32.151
MONARCH BUTTERFLIES HEAD SOUTH

22:32.151 --> 22:32.952
FOR THE WINTER IN ONE OF THE

22:32.952 --> 22:34.720
INSECT WORLD'S MOST FANTASTIC

22:34.720 --> 22:35.654
FEATS.

22:35.654 --> 22:36.755
BUT AS YOU'VE LIKELY HEARD,

22:36.755 --> 22:37.823
THEIR NUMBERS HAVE DECLINED

22:37.823 --> 22:38.958
DRAMATICALLY IN THE PAST TWO

22:38.958 --> 22:39.892
DECADES.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.227
NOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS

22:41.227 --> 22:42.361
CONSIDERING NEW STEPS TO TRY TO

22:42.361 --> 22:44.997
REVERSE THE TREND.

22:44.997 --> 22:46.432
SCIENTISTS ARE STILL TRYING TO

22:46.432 --> 22:47.933
DETERMINE JUST HOW MANY OF THE

22:47.933 --> 22:49.668
BUTTERFLIES MADE THE LONG TRIP

22:49.668 --> 22:50.970
TO MEXICO THIS WINTER, STILL

22:50.970 --> 22:52.271
HOPING THAT THE 90 PERCENT

22:52.271 --> 22:53.038
DECLINE THAT BEGAN IN THE 1990S

22:53.038 --> 22:57.176
HAS FINALLY COME TO AN END.

22:57.176 --> 23:00.446
>> (translated): WELL THIS

23:00.446 --> 23:01.614
2014/2015 SEASON IS A CRITICAL

23:01.614 --> 23:03.148
SEASON FOR US AFTER THE NUMBERS

23:03.148 --> 23:04.383
WE HAD LAST SEASON.

23:04.383 --> 23:08.554
WE HOPE WORK DONE JOINTLY BY THE

23:08.554 --> 23:09.922
UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND

23:09.922 --> 23:11.991
MEXICO WILL HELP TO INCREASE THE

23:11.991 --> 23:12.891
NUMBER OF BUTTERFLIES ARRIVING

23:12.891 --> 23:16.695
IN OUR SANCTUARIES.

23:16.695 --> 23:17.830
>> Sreenivasan: BUT EVEN AS THE

23:17.830 --> 23:21.267
BUTTERFLY COUNT CONTINUES IN

23:21.267 --> 23:22.501
MEXICO, IN WASHINGTON,

23:22.501 --> 23:23.269

23:23.269 --> 23:25.471
SUBMITTED BY CONSERVATION

23:25.471 --> 23:26.705
ORGANIZATIONS, THE U.S. FISH AND

23:26.705 --> 23:27.806
WILDLIFE SERVICE RECENTLY

23:27.806 --> 23:29.041
ANNOUNCED A YEAR-LONG REVIEW

23:29.041 --> 23:30.142
THAT COULD MEAN THE BUTTERFLIES

23:30.142 --> 23:31.277
ARE PLACED ON THE ENDANGERED

23:31.277 --> 23:34.179
SPECIES LIST.

23:34.179 --> 23:35.748
IF THAT HAPPENS, THERE COULD BE

23:35.748 --> 23:37.316
RIPPLE EFFECTS, THE MONARCH'S

23:37.316 --> 23:38.851
HABITATS IN THE U.S. COULD

23:38.851 --> 23:40.552
BECOME PROTECTED UNDER LAW AND

23:40.552 --> 23:41.754
THAT, IN TURN, COULD LEAD TO

23:41.754 --> 23:43.389
RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF

23:43.389 --> 23:45.991
HERBICIDES THAT MANY FARMERS

23:45.991 --> 23:46.925
DEPEND ON TO KILL WEEDS WITHOUT

23:46.925 --> 23:47.660
HARMING THEIR CROPS.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.461
BUT THE TIME IT TAKES TO MAKE

23:49.461 --> 23:50.796
THESE DECISIONS IS

23:50.796 --> 23:51.997
CONSEQUENTIAL.

23:51.997 --> 23:53.165

1974 AND 1994, AT THE VERY TIME

24:04.376 --> 24:06.245
THE GOVERNMENT WAS DELIBERATING

24:06.245 --> 24:08.480
ABOUT WHETHER TO INCLUDE THEM ON

24:08.480 --> 24:13.085
THE ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST.
