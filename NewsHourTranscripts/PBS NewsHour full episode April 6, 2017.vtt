JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.806 --> 00:06.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.807 --> 00:07.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:07.908 --> 00:10.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): You
change the nominee.

00:10.410 --> 00:11.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You do not change the rules.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.513 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: If they
won't confirm
Judge Gorsuch, they will never
confirm to

00:15.749 --> 00:18.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confirm any nominee of this
president.

00:18.118 --> 00:23.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a historic
move, Senate
Republicans invoke the so-called
nuclear option

00:23.757 --> 00:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to clear the way for President
Trump's Supreme
Court nominee.

00:27.461 --> 00:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: As the president hosts
China's leader
in Florida at his Mar-a-Lago
resort, a look

00:33.734 --> 00:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the cost of protecting the
commander in
chief, his family members and
their residences.

00:39.806 --> 00:46.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with Republicans aiming to
loosen or undo
strict Obama-era banking
regulations, we sit

00:46.713 --> 00:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down with an outgoing Federal
Reserve Board
governor to talk about what he
thinks should

00:51.018 --> 00:52.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be changed.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO, Federal Reserve
Governor:
I don't really expect that
there's going to

00:54.254 --> 00:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a dismantling of some of the
major accomplishments
that we have had.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I certainly hope not.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think it would be
something the
American people would want to
see, Democrats

01:05.032 --> 01:06.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or Republicans.

01:06.300 --> 01:13.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:13.373 --> 01:16.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:16.176 --> 01:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is growing
talk tonight
of possible U.S. military action
against the

01:26.420 --> 01:28.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government of Syria.

01:28.188 --> 01:32.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That comes as new evidence has
emerged that
an attack that killed more than
80 people

01:32.759 --> 01:35.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this week involved chemical
weapons.

01:35.562 --> 01:37.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our report.

01:37.364 --> 01:42.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The images
themselves left
little doubt that this was a
chemical weapons

01:42.035 --> 01:43.837 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attack.

01:43.870 --> 01:48.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Turkey says postmortems on
three victims
who were brought across the
border confirm

01:48.342 --> 01:50.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEKIR BOZDAG, Turkish Justice
Minister (through
translator): With this
scientific examination,

01:52.145 --> 01:55.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it has been determined that
Syria's president,
Bashar al-Assad, has used a
chemical weapon.

01:55.115 --> 01:59.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But, in
Damascus, Syria's
foreign minister again denied
responsibility.

01:59.786 --> 02:05.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead, he charged that
militants linked
to al-Qaida had the toxic agents
in a warehouse,

02:05.592 --> 02:07.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which was then hit by a
government airstrike.

02:07.728 --> 02:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID MOALLEM, Syrian Foreign
Minister (through
translator): I confirm to you
once again that

02:13.033 --> 02:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Syrian Arab army has not and
will not
use this type of weapon against
our people

02:17.637 --> 02:22.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and our children, and not even
against the
terrorists.

02:22.142 --> 02:27.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Russia has
been Syria's
main ally, and, today President
Vladimir Putin

02:27.614 --> 02:32.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warned against assigning blame
until there's
a -- quote -- "thorough and
unbiased investigation."

02:33.020 --> 02:38.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Putin's spokesman
seemed to suggest
that Moscow's backing for
Syria's Assad may

02:38.892 --> 02:40.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not be permanent.

02:40.861 --> 02:44.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRY PESKOV, Spokesman for
Vladimir Putin:
I don't think it's correct to
say about unconditional

02:44.297 --> 02:45.532 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
support.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unconditional support is not
possible in the
current world.

02:47.567 --> 02:51.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Earlier this
week, the White
House said removing Assad was no
longer an

02:51.872 --> 02:53.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
option.

02:53.740 --> 02:58.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, Secretary of State
Tillerson said
there is no role for Assad in
governing Syria,

02:58.211 --> 03:01.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Russia should reconsider its
support of
him.

03:01.848 --> 03:06.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And asked if the U.S. was
organizing a coalition
to remove the Syrian leader,
Tillerson said:

03:06.219 --> 03:08.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: Those
steps are under way.

03:08.688 --> 03:12.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And, on Air
Force One today,
President Trump said of Assad:

03:12.592 --> 03:16.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
And he's there, and I guess he's
running things,

03:16.396 --> 03:18.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so I guess something should
happen.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Officials say
Defense Secretary
James Mattis may discuss
military options

03:22.002 --> 03:23.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the president in Florida.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

03:25.872 --> 03:30.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The day's other
major story
came in the United States
Senate, where the

03:30.143 --> 03:35.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stage is now set to confirm
Judge Neil Gorsuch
to the Supreme Court.

03:35.682 --> 03:40.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans swept aside the main
obstacle,
as partisan tensions peaked.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

03:42.189 --> 03:49.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As a dark
downpour hit outside,
inside, a long-brewing manmade
storm burst.

03:49.162 --> 03:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: On the nomination of Neil
M. Gorsuch
of Colorado to be an associate
justice to

03:53.800 --> 03:55.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Supreme Court of the United
States.

03:55.535 --> 03:59.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: First,
Republicans tried,
and failed, to get the 60 votes
needed to

03:59.673 --> 04:01.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
end a filibuster blocking
Gorsuch.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: The motion is not agreed
to.

04:04.478 --> 04:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: With that,
Republican Leader
Mitch McConnell launched a
series of historic

04:08.582 --> 04:12.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parliamentary acrobatics to
remove that 60-vote
requirement altogether.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.588 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I
raise a point of order that the
vote on cloture...

04:16.523 --> 04:21.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Within 90
minutes, Republicans
voted for the so-called nuclear
option, to

04:21.094 --> 04:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reinterpret the rules and change
precedent,
so that a simple majority could
guarantee

04:25.899 --> 04:27.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Supreme Court spot.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McConnell insisted Republicans
were in the
right.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.638 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:31.671 --> 04:34.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: It's
part of a much larger story,
another extreme

04:34.274 --> 04:42.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
escalation in the left's
never-ending drive
to politicize the courts and the
confirmation

04:42.048 --> 04:43.817 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republicans
stressed that
former Democratic Leader Harry
Reid opened

04:46.319 --> 04:51.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the door to this by lowering the
threshold
for all other nominees four
years ago.

04:51.491 --> 04:55.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Current Democratic Leader Chuck
Schumer argued
the Supreme Court is different.

04:55.328 --> 04:57.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: The
nuclear option means the end of
a long history

04:59.933 --> 05:03.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of consensus on Supreme Court
nominations.

05:03.637 --> 05:09.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It weakens the standing of the
Senate as a
whole as a check on the
president's ability

05:09.376 --> 05:11.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to shape the judiciary.

05:11.144 --> 05:16.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The shift today
came after
a constellation of conservative
groups spent

05:16.082 --> 05:18.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
millions on ads supporting
Gorsuch.

05:18.852 --> 05:23.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Opponents ran fewer ads and
instead turned
out calls and e-mails.

05:23.223 --> 05:30.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California Democrat Dianne
Feinstein said
she received 112,000 calls on
Gorsuch, overwhelmingly

05:30.297 --> 05:31.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
against.

05:31.798 --> 05:35.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the end, it exposed a Senate
not just divided,
but bitterly so.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Delaware's Chris Coons:

05:37.037 --> 05:38.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS COONS (D), Delaware: We
simply do not
trust each other anymore.

05:40.740 --> 05:46.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And without trust, we will not
rebuild what's
necessary to sustain this body.

05:46.813 --> 05:51.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, everyone likes to point the
finger at
the other side as the source of
this distress.

05:51.551 --> 05:55.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The reality is, there is
abundant blame to
go around.

05:55.288 --> 06:00.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Even Republican
Johnny Isakson
warned this could lead to
changing the 60-vote

06:00.560 --> 06:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consensus required on most
legislation.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.297 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:04.331 --> 06:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHNNY ISAKSON (R), Georgia: If
we move towards
a body that's a rubber stamp of
the House

06:06.199 --> 06:10.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or unicameral government of
legislation, we
will never be the United States
of America

06:10.904 --> 06:13.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our founding fathers intended us
to be.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrat Coons
and Republican
Susan Collins are gathering
signatures on

06:16.977 --> 06:21.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a letter to protect the 60-vote
threshold
for legislation.

06:21.214 --> 06:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for Judge Gorsuch, the next
vote will be
final confirmation.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is expected tomorrow
evening.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

06:29.055 --> 06:34.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In other news:
China's President
Xi Jinping arrived in Florida
today for a

06:34.294 --> 06:37.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
high-stakes summit with
President Trump.

06:37.163 --> 06:40.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
greeted Xi
and his wife.

06:40.767 --> 06:46.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump arrived later and went
to his Mar-a-Lago
estate, where the meetings will
be held.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea's nuclear weapons
program could
top the agenda.

06:50.377 --> 06:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump said today that he
thinks China
-- quote -- "will want to be
stepping up to

06:54.914 --> 06:56.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deal with that."

06:56.816 --> 07:01.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Intelligence Committee
Chairman Devin
Nunes stepped aside from leading
a probe of

07:01.688 --> 07:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian meddling in last year's
election.

07:04.724 --> 07:08.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now facing ethic complaints
of mishandling
classified information.

07:08.161 --> 07:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, Nunes said: "The
charges are
entirely false and politically
motivated,"

07:14.501 --> 07:18.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but that he's acting in the best
interests
of the committee.

07:18.104 --> 07:22.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan met with
Nunes last
night, and said today he agrees
with the move.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: I
think Chairman Nunes wants to
make sure that

07:26.046 --> 07:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is not a distraction to a
very important
investigation.

07:29.149 --> 07:34.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he wants to go clear himself
while this
investigation continues on
without any kinds

07:34.554 --> 07:36.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of distractions.

07:36.489 --> 07:39.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The committee's
ranking Democrat,
Representative Adam Schiff, had
accused Nunes

07:39.859 --> 07:43.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of placing his loyalty to
President Trump
before the needs of the
investigation.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.699 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:45.732 --> 07:48.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California: I
just want to
express my appreciation for what
the chairman

07:48.468 --> 07:49.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decided to do.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure it was a very difficult
decision
for him.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as he mentioned, I think it
is in the
best interests of the
investigation.

07:57.744 --> 08:03.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Three other
Republicans, Representatives
Mike Conaway, with help from
Trey Gowdy and

08:03.650 --> 08:07.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Rooney, will now see oversee
the Russia
investigation.

08:07.387 --> 08:10.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nunes will remain as chair of
the committee.

08:10.056 --> 08:12.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wall Street managed small gains
today.

08:12.425 --> 08:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
was up 14
points to close near 20662.

08:17.030 --> 08:23.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq also rose 14, and the
S&amp;P 500 added
four.

08:23.370 --> 08:28.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Glenn, the first American
to orbit the
Earth in space, was laid to rest
today at

08:28.341 --> 08:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Arlington National Cemetery.

08:30.443 --> 08:35.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His flag-draped casket was
wrapped in plastic
under a steady rain, as it was
carried on

08:35.949 --> 08:38.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a horse-drawn caisson to the
grave site.

08:38.818 --> 08:43.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The former Ohio senator died in
December at
the age of 95.

08:43.723 --> 08:49.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His wife, Annie, now 97, and
family scheduled
the burial on what would have
been the Glenns'

08:49.996 --> 08:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
74th wedding anniversary.

08:53.366 --> 08:59.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the grandmaster of insult
comedy, Don
Rickles, died today at his Los
Angeles home.

08:59.272 --> 09:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From stand-up stage to late
shows, Rickles
used everything from ethnic
humor to sex jokes

09:04.944 --> 09:11.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on everyone, from presidents to
fellow entertainers,
including Sammy Davis Jr. in
1975.

09:11.317 --> 09:14.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DON RICKLES, Comedian: I love
the Italian
people.

09:14.587 --> 09:17.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will never forget the words of
Carma Indanganazo
(ph), who said to me in Brooklyn
on a Saturday

09:17.290 --> 09:18.224 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night...

09:18.258 --> 09:19.325 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:19.359 --> 09:24.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DON RICKLES: No, you're
Catholic, and I'm
a Jew.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, Sammy, you're black.

09:26.699 --> 09:28.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm sorry.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:29.035 --> 09:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Don Rickles was
90 years old.

09:33.006 --> 09:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I talk with
two senators about the showdown
over Supreme

09:37.110 --> 09:43.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court nominee Neil Gorsuch; the
House Intelligence
Committee chair steps away from
the Russia

09:43.149 --> 09:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation; the cost of
protecting President
Trump, his family and their
residences; and

09:48.822 --> 10:00.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

10:00.633 --> 10:05.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the fight over Neil Gorsuch
continued to
play out in the U.S. Senate
today, I sat down

10:05.839 --> 10:10.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Democrat Patty Murray, the
four-term
senator from Washington State,
who is one

10:10.543 --> 10:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the majority of Democrats
opposed to Gorsuch
taking that vacant seat on the
Supreme Court.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.784 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY (D), Washington:
What concerns
me at the end of the day is a
lifetime appointment

10:20.920 --> 10:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Supreme Court, someone's
judgment and
their beliefs in terms of
protecting people's

10:27.961 --> 10:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rights in this country is
extremely important.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, for me, he didn't pass the
test.

10:33.099 --> 10:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You made a
particular point
of speaking about his position
on reproductive

10:37.203 --> 10:38.738 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rights.

10:38.771 --> 10:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why is that so important to you?

10:40.773 --> 10:42.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:42.709 --> 10:47.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY: This Supreme Court
will consider
cases coming to it that
ultimately could overturn

10:47.814 --> 10:53.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roe v. Wade, which would mean
that women would
-- could possibly lose their
constitutionally

10:53.453 --> 10:56.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protected right to make their
own health care
choices.

10:56.956 --> 11:03.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, that is an issue I have
seen in my
own lifetime that has made a
real impact for

11:03.062 --> 11:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women, personally, their health
and their
economy.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I do not want this country
to go backwards.

11:09.168 --> 11:14.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you have
spoken before
about your own awareness in your
personal

11:14.240 --> 11:15.208 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

11:15.241 --> 11:16.976 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY: When I was in
college, Roe v.
Wade wasn't the law of the land
many years

11:18.811 --> 11:20.513 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

11:20.547 --> 11:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I remember as good today as
I did then
a friend of mine, very close to,
lived with

11:27.120 --> 11:33.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her in the dorm, who went out on
a date, like
many young women did, and was
what we today

11:33.126 --> 11:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call date-raped, but we didn't
have a term
for it then, ended up getting
pregnant.

11:38.965 --> 11:45.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was no place she could go,
nobody -- no
protections of law, ended up
finding what

11:45.605 --> 11:50.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we would now call a back-alley
doctor who
performed an abortion.

11:50.176 --> 11:55.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as a result of a botched
procedure, she,
at a very young age, lost her
ability to ever

11:55.982 --> 11:57.283 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have a family.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't want to go back to that.

11:59.118 --> 12:03.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now have a time when women
can get the
health care they need when they
need it for

12:03.623 --> 12:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whatever reason, and they have
the protection
of law to do that.

12:07.460 --> 12:12.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These are
terrible individual
situations, and you have just
described one

12:13.032 --> 12:14.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of them.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, you know that
there are
many Americans who feel strongly
in the other

12:17.637 --> 12:19.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

12:19.539 --> 12:23.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the latest Pew poll
showed 37 percent
of Americans don't believe in
abortion under

12:24.010 --> 12:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
almost any circumstances.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you respect their point
of view?

12:28.014 --> 12:28.982 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY: Well, I do respect
that.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a deeply religious purpose,
there are
people who do not personally
believe that

12:34.053 --> 12:35.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
abortion is acceptable.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I understand that.

12:37.190 --> 12:42.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is a country where we
don't impose
religious beliefs on the entire
country.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a country where we
accept differences
of opinion.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're not only
opposing Judge
Gorsuch.

12:47.300 --> 12:52.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You and other Democrats are
mounting a filibuster
to do all you can do to prevent
a vote.

12:52.739 --> 12:59.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That, as you know, could lead to
a significant
change in the rules in the
Senate, which will

12:59.078 --> 13:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have an even more long-lasting
effect.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why go that extra step?

13:03.750 --> 13:04.717 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:04.751 --> 13:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY: Well, this is not
our choice.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is the Republicans' choice.

13:08.454 --> 13:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Normally, our Supreme Court
justices do get
over 60 votes.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's important in this
country.

13:15.461 --> 13:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you don't get 60 votes, it
means that you're
not a justice that can really be
a justice

13:20.967 --> 13:22.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the entire land.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's an important hurdle.

13:24.070 --> 13:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are not 60 people in the
Senate today
who believe that we should have
this nomination.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I can't vote just because
Mitch wants
me to.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I -- that's -- my vote is really
important
to me.

13:35.181 --> 13:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is the
argument, Senator,
at the same time, even made by
other Democrats,

13:39.018 --> 13:44.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are saying, Democrats
shouldn't push this
to the wall on this vote, the
argument being

13:44.157 --> 13:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democrats should wait to cut
a deal of
some sort of with the Republican
leadership

13:49.328 --> 13:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say, we are going to go along
with this
one, but the next time, we are
going to preserve

13:53.766 --> 13:54.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the rule as it is now.

13:54.934 --> 13:56.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:56.736 --> 13:59.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY: That's a nice
conversation,
but I think Mitch McConnell
showed his cards

13:59.138 --> 14:00.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over a year ago.

14:00.973 --> 14:05.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he sent a very strong
signal then
that his goal was to put someone
on the Supreme

14:05.712 --> 14:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Court that he felt was much more
conservative.

14:09.015 --> 14:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't expect that, if
somehow a deal
could be made where Democrats
could get over

14:15.088 --> 14:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their feeling that this wasn't
the right person
and give a yes vote, that, in
the next instance,

14:20.893 --> 14:22.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he wouldn't change the
rules anyway.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you stand up for your
principles here.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what we're standing
up for.

14:27.567 --> 14:31.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're learning
this morning
that the chairman of the House
Select Committee

14:31.904 --> 14:39.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Intelligence stepping aside
from his role
running the investigation into
Russian interference

14:39.645 --> 14:42.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the U.S. election last year.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does that say to you?

14:44.784 --> 14:49.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Does that now give you
confidence that this
investigation will be conducted
fairly on

14:49.455 --> 14:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the part of the Congress?

14:50.456 --> 14:52.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY: Well, I think it's
a very important
step in the right direction,
from what I know

14:54.227 --> 15:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at this point, because this is a
very important
topic in this country today.

15:00.800 --> 15:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we have a foreign country,
which it appears
that we do, interfering in an
election in

15:06.606 --> 15:11.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any way, we need to know that,
and we need
to do everything we can to make
sure that

15:11.711 --> 15:13.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
never happens again.

15:14.013 --> 15:20.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the bigger questions of
collusion or whatever
from this administration are
true, this country

15:20.787 --> 15:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
needs to know it and action
needs to be taken.

15:23.923 --> 15:29.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It has to be done in a
bipartisan way for
it to be credible in this
country.

15:29.495 --> 15:32.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Nunes was standing in the
way of that
because of his actions.

15:32.932 --> 15:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, you
have worked
really closely with Speaker Ryan
in the past

15:37.503 --> 15:41.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on a number of difficult
legislative issues.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you think he's doing
right now?

15:42.542 --> 15:43.743 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY: I think he has an
incredibly
difficult job.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't envy him his job.

15:47.680 --> 15:53.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my advice to him would be,
do what you
have done in the past that helps
you be successful.

15:53.386 --> 15:58.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reach out and find Democrats and
find bipartisan
solutions to the challenges that
you have,

15:58.658 --> 16:00.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that's how you can get
things done.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Patty
Murray, thank
you very much.

16:02.895 --> 16:03.863 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PATTY MURRAY: Thank you.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now, for an
opposing view
on the confirmation of Neil
Gorsuch, I spoke

16:08.534 --> 16:14.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Republican Senator John
Thune of South
Dakota, who defended his party's
move to change

16:14.073 --> 16:15.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Senate rules.

16:15.074 --> 16:16.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE (R), South Dakota:
Well, we just
weren't left with any choices,
Judy.

16:19.345 --> 16:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Senate Democrats decided to
filibuster
this nominee, something that
hasn't been successfully

16:24.684 --> 16:30.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done in the 230-year history of
Senate, at
least successfully done by one
party.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They had the votes to block him.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only way we were going to be
able to get
an up-and-down vote on him,
which is the history,

16:35.962 --> 16:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tradition of the Senate, was
to make the
rules change that enabled us to
get to that

16:41.701 --> 16:43.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up-and-down vote, which will
occur sometime
tomorrow.

16:43.970 --> 16:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But had that not happened, we
wouldn't get
this vote, and I'm not sure we
could get any

16:49.141 --> 16:51.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

16:51.043 --> 16:53.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we can't get Neil Gorsuch
across the finish
line, I don't know what Supreme
Court nominee

16:53.479 --> 16:57.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democrats would be willing
to vote on
in the next four years.

16:57.049 --> 17:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as I'm sure
you know,
the Democrats are saying that
he's not a mainstream

17:02.521 --> 17:04.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate.

17:04.390 --> 17:09.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they say that what's really
unprecedented
was the treatment Republicans
gave last year

17:09.061 --> 17:12.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to President Obama's Supreme
Court nominee,
Merrick Garland.

17:12.999 --> 17:18.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they're saying that what
they are doing
is no worse than what
Republicans did last

17:18.371 --> 17:19.338 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.240 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: Well, Garland of
course, you know,
that issue got litigated during
the campaign.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our argument was people were
already voting
last year.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a presidential year.

17:26.812 --> 17:30.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we ought to let people weigh
in, have
their voices heard, and let the
new president

17:30.750 --> 17:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pick the next Supreme Court
nominee, which
happened.

17:33.552 --> 17:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, in terms of him
being mainstream,
it's pretty hard to argue that
he's not mainstream,

17:38.824 --> 17:41.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if you look at his time on the
10th Circuit.

17:41.494 --> 17:46.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been a part of 2,700 cases
that were
heard there; 99 percent of those
times, he

17:47.033 --> 17:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was in the majority; 97 percent
of the time,
the vote was unanimous.

17:51.570 --> 17:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the Democrats were
hard-pressed to
come up with an argument to make
against him.

17:55.975 --> 18:00.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I realize part of it goes
back to Garland,
but I think, at the end of the
day, we have

18:00.346 --> 18:02.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got to move forward, not
backward.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have got a vacancy to
fill.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just felt like this judge
deserved an up-and-down
vote.

18:06.619 --> 18:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Senate has
not been seen,
as you know, as partisan a body
as the House

18:12.024 --> 18:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Representatives up until now.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you think that has changed?

18:15.561 --> 18:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that changing going forward?

18:17.129 --> 18:18.497 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: I'll tell you, my
view on that
is that you're right.

18:20.866 --> 18:24.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of people are sort of
assessing,
what's the impact on the Senate?

18:24.503 --> 18:27.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, by and large, this was
sort of baked
in.

18:27.573 --> 18:33.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats changed the rules
back in 2013
on lower court and appellate
court nominees.

18:33.145 --> 18:37.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they basically had signaled
last fall
during the presidential campaign
that, if

18:37.483 --> 18:40.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they won, if Hillary Clinton had
been elected
president, and they had gotten
the majority

18:40.953 --> 18:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Senate, that they were
going to change
the rules on the Supreme Court.

18:44.190 --> 18:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think, for the most part,
people on both
sides realized this was likely
to happen.

18:48.928 --> 18:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think now it's a question
of getting
this behind us and moving
forward on a legislative

18:53.766 --> 18:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agenda, where I do think we can
find hopefully
some bipartisan cooperation,
because I think,

18:58.771 --> 19:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than anything else, the
American people
want to -- they want to see us
get results.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what we intend to do.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's going to take
cooperation on both
sides in order for that to
happen.

19:07.913 --> 19:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you don't
think that after
this it's going to be harder to
work with

19:11.550 --> 19:14.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats to move forward in the
Senate?

19:14.954 --> 19:15.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: It's not my sense.

19:17.790 --> 19:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the Democrats did what
they had to
do because, obviously, there's a
lot of -- their

19:21.794 --> 19:26.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
activists, their political base
was very energized
on this issue.

19:26.532 --> 19:30.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I talk with Democrats all
the time, I
work with Democrats all the time
on legislation.

19:30.703 --> 19:35.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, like I said, I think, for
the most part,
the assumption has been all
along that, irrespective

19:35.508 --> 19:40.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of who won that presidential
election last
fall, this is where we were
going to end up,

19:40.312 --> 19:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and particularly given the fact
that, in 2013,
they had initiated the first
stage of this

19:44.817 --> 19:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by doing away with the 50 -- or
the 60-vote
threshold with respect to lower
court and

19:50.356 --> 19:52.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
appellate court nods.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Senator,
there's another
story we have been following
today.

19:54.560 --> 20:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the chemical weapons
attack in
Syria the Trump administration
is laying at

20:00.466 --> 20:02.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the feet of the Assad regime.

20:02.835 --> 20:09.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now have President Trump
suggesting that
perhaps there needs to be some
sort of action

20:09.608 --> 20:11.544 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
taken.

20:11.577 --> 20:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are told the Pentagon is
going to be briefing
the president on possible
military moves that

20:16.482 --> 20:18.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could be made.

20:18.284 --> 20:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are Republicans in the Congress
prepared to
get more deeply involved
militarily in Syria,

20:25.124 --> 20:26.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if it comes to that?

20:26.125 --> 20:27.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: I think there's
pretty strong
sentiment on both sides of the
aisle up here

20:29.795 --> 20:32.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that this warrants a response.

20:32.264 --> 20:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, Assad has denied it.

20:34.233 --> 20:38.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, the Russians
have denied it,
but it's clear the intelligence
that he is

20:38.604 --> 20:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
responsible for this attack.

20:40.406 --> 20:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the use of weapons of mass
destruction,
of chemical weapons on your own
children is

20:45.811 --> 20:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just something that's a horrific
act.

20:48.447 --> 20:52.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think that the
international community,
I hope, responds aggressively.

20:52.818 --> 20:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe that the United
States will
be looked to for leadership in
terms of that

20:56.889 --> 20:58.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
response.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm not -- I don't think we
ought to take
any options off the table.

21:00.226 --> 21:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think this warrants a
clear message
from the international community
and the United

21:06.432 --> 21:09.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
States that this kind of
behavior is just
not acceptable.

21:09.468 --> 21:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, ultimately, I believe he
still -- he
has to go, but I think they're
looking at

21:14.406 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their options, and we will see
what they ultimately
decide to do.

21:17.810 --> 21:21.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it
certainly does sound
like they're considering
military steps.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: Well, if they did, I
suspect it
would be something that would be
a limited

21:25.618 --> 21:32.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strike designed probably to
ground the air
force, the Syrian air force, to
take out some

21:32.391 --> 21:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airstrips and that sort of
thing.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of that could be done,
I suppose,
with cruise missiles.

21:36.428 --> 21:38.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not exactly sure what all is
in the discussion.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't want to speculate about
that.

21:40.666 --> 21:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think there are ways
that we can
respond and that we can limit
Assad's ability

21:46.205 --> 21:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do these sorts of things to
his own people
in the future.

21:49.108 --> 21:54.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think there is a
humanitarian reason
to respond that's just pretty
compelling,

21:54.446 --> 21:57.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in light of some of these images
that we have
seen.

21:57.183 --> 22:00.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator John
Thune, we thank
you very much for talking with
us.

22:00.619 --> 22:01.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:01.687 --> 22:02.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: Thanks, Judy.

22:02.688 --> 22:06.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nice to be with you.

22:06.192 --> 22:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
the shakeup
in the investigation into
Russian interference

22:17.770 --> 22:20.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the 2016 presidential
election.

22:20.339 --> 22:25.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on what led House
Intelligence Committee
Chairman Devin Nunes to step
aside, we're

22:25.511 --> 22:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
joined by Robert Costa, national
political
reporter for The Washington
Post.

22:30.316 --> 22:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Robert, thank you very much.

22:32.351 --> 22:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The last we heard, Devin Nunes
wasn't going
to recuse himself.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You talked to him today.

22:37.223 --> 22:38.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What changed?

22:38.724 --> 22:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA, The Washington
Post: I spoke
with the chairman by phone.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he does remain the chairman.

22:42.127 --> 22:44.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He told me he wants to keep that
gavel.

22:44.830 --> 22:49.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he will step away from the
investigation
into Russia.

22:49.068 --> 22:53.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is an ethics complaint
about him that's
rising inside of the House.

22:53.739 --> 22:58.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this has caused some
problems for him
as chairman about how he has
handled classified

22:58.143 --> 22:59.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

22:59.979 --> 23:03.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he's going to hand off
the reins to
some other Republicans on the
committee and

23:03.415 --> 23:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let the Senate Intelligence
Committee do its
work as well.

23:05.851 --> 23:12.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, what is that
Ethics Committee
-- what is the nub of their
concern?

23:12.124 --> 23:13.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do we know?

23:13.926 --> 23:19.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: The focus of it is
on how Chairman
Nunes went to the White House,
associated

23:19.465 --> 23:24.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
himself with different
intelligence officials
and White House employees, as he
looked into

23:24.870 --> 23:30.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only Russian interference,
but the Obama
administration's activities and
efforts on

23:30.743 --> 23:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russian issue during last
year's election.

23:34.046 --> 23:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how he proceeded in dealing
with the White
House in terms of having a quiet
meeting there

23:39.618 --> 23:44.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with certain officials has
raised some eyebrows
on Capitol Hill and it's caused
him some problems

23:44.556 --> 23:47.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in terms of other members
raising questions
about his ethics.

23:47.326 --> 23:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you are
referring to other
Republican members; is that
right?

23:51.030 --> 23:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Democrats are
raising concerns,
and so are Republicans.

23:54.733 --> 23:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans, in general, Judy,
are skittish
about Nunes.

23:58.237 --> 24:03.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they believe that the
Russian matter is
not a political winner, and that
the way Nunes

24:03.108 --> 24:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has handled it has left a lot of
Republicans
vulnerable to mounting questions
as they head

24:08.147 --> 24:09.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
home to recess.

24:09.948 --> 24:13.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
Robert, what
do we know about Representative
Conaway, Mike

24:13.585 --> 24:18.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conaway, of Texas, who is going
to be stepping
in to overseeing the Russia
investigation?

24:18.857 --> 24:22.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: He has looked into
the Russian
matter before.

24:22.594 --> 24:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has worked closely with
Nunes, so you have
a Nunes ally.

24:26.632 --> 24:30.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Democrat Adam Schiff of
California, who
is the ranking member on the
Intelligence

24:30.536 --> 24:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee, there is still
concern on the Democratic
side about the integrity of this
committee

24:35.107 --> 24:36.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moving forward.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even with Nunes gone, he's still
chairman.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's still influencing Conaway
and others
on the committee.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can it be independent?

24:43.849 --> 24:45.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can it be judicious?

24:45.684 --> 24:49.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, separately,
Robert, I want
to ask you about what you're
learning about

24:49.621 --> 24:54.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any -- whether there's been any
progress on
the part of Republicans in
trying to resurrect

24:54.426 --> 24:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a bill, legislation to overturn
and replace
Obamacare?

24:59.665 --> 25:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: As a reporter, I
would refer
to it as incremental progress,
if anything.

25:05.003 --> 25:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had Speaker Paul Ryan head
to the White
House on Thursday night.

25:08.707 --> 25:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He met with Chief of Staff
Reince Priebus
and Vice President Pence.

25:12.177 --> 25:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they talked through the
president's demand
to congressional leaders to do
something on

25:16.315 --> 25:18.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
health care.

25:18.117 --> 25:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, it fell apart, but the
message from the
president to this group of the
speaker and

25:21.887 --> 25:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
top White House officials was,
do something.

25:23.789 --> 25:28.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they're looking into
high-risk insurance
pools, about reforming that
aspect of the

25:28.527 --> 25:33.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Affordable Care Act, moving --
trying to save
some costs, at least from the
Republican view,

25:33.632 --> 25:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they look for different
little tweaks that
could get some kind of GOP
consensus.

25:37.002 --> 25:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're
saying, as they
go into recess, they will
continue to work

25:41.073 --> 25:42.541 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on that?

25:42.574 --> 25:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: It's about talking
about working
on it, more than anything.

25:45.811 --> 25:51.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was only a Rules Committee
hearing on
Friday that looked into making
these kinds

25:51.650 --> 25:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of changes in terms of how
insurance is structured
with pooling.

25:54.953 --> 25:58.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is no legislation
that's headed
to the floor soon.

25:58.590 --> 25:59.558 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why not?

25:59.591 --> 26:01.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The answer is simple.

26:01.293 --> 26:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are just not the votes
there yet among
House Republicans to get much of
anything

26:04.830 --> 26:06.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through on health care.

26:06.665 --> 26:10.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Robert
Costa reporting
from The Washington Post, thank
you, Robert.

26:10.502 --> 26:18.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Thank you.

26:18.143 --> 26:24.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:24.082 --> 26:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
financial
regulations President Trump
could roll back;

26:29.521 --> 26:36.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
singer Valerie June explains her
unique voice;
and a Brief But Spectacular take
on the power

26:36.128 --> 26:39.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a photograph.

26:39.064 --> 26:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: President Trump's
summit with China's
president at his Florida resort
is the president's

26:44.603 --> 26:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sixth trip to Mar-a-Lago since
taking office.

26:47.873 --> 26:52.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some are asking about the
stresses and
strains being placed on the
Secret Service

26:52.845 --> 26:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to protect him and his family at
their multiple
homes.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

26:59.084 --> 27:05.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In the more than a
century that
the U.S. Secret Service has
protected presidents

27:05.390 --> 27:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their families, rarely has
it had so many
places and so many people to
guard than under

27:11.997 --> 27:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump, not just the
White House,
but also Trump Tower in the
heart of Manhattan,

27:18.704 --> 27:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still home for first lady
Melania Trump and
their son, Barron, although the
president

27:23.208 --> 27:25.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has not been there since taking
office.

27:25.410 --> 27:29.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mr. Trump has requested
protection for
his adult children and their
spouses, White

27:30.015 --> 27:35.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House advisers Ivanka Trump and
Jared Kushner,
and the president's eldest sons,
Donald Jr.

27:35.387 --> 27:39.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Eric, who travel the world
on family business.

27:39.091 --> 27:43.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Evy Poumpouras is a former
Secret Service
agent who helped protect four
presidents.

27:43.228 --> 27:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVY POUMPOURAS, Former U.S.
Secret Service
Agent: One of the things here
that is a concern,

27:45.297 --> 27:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have got three sites, three
static sites.

27:48.033 --> 27:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before, with prior presidents,
you really
just had to worry about the
White House itself.

27:52.237 --> 27:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with these three different
sites, you're
almost having to recreate a
permanent protection

27:58.577 --> 27:59.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
residence.

27:59.578 --> 28:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to have to double
your resources.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to have to double
your efforts.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to have to double
your manpower.

28:04.216 --> 28:08.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: While the Secret
Service rarely
details the cost of protecting
presidents

28:08.720 --> 28:13.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their families, media
reports and past
government estimates provide
some clues.

28:13.725 --> 28:20.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A single weekend trip to
Mar-a-Lago costs
taxpayers an estimated $3
million.

28:20.532 --> 28:25.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post, citing
internal documents,
said the Secret Service is
requesting an additional

28:25.737 --> 28:30.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$60 million for next year,
nearly $27 million
to secure Trump Tower.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.544 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), Missouri:
I'm deeply
concerned that the Secret
Service is being

28:34.513 --> 28:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stretched to its breaking point.

28:36.448 --> 28:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senator Claire
McCaskill, who is
the top Democrat on the Senate
Homeland Security

28:40.852 --> 28:41.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAIRE MCCASKILL: I'm concerned
about the
Secret Service and the
unprecedented challenge

28:45.424 --> 28:49.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of protecting the president and
his family
at numerous locations, the White
House, Trump

28:49.628 --> 28:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tower and Mar-a-Lago, as well as
the international
travel by the president's sons.

28:54.700 --> 28:59.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: White House Press
Secretary Sean
Spicer defends President Trump's
trips.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
President Bush traveled to
Crawford.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama went to Hawaii
often.

29:03.542 --> 29:06.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not something that you
can control.

29:06.078 --> 29:10.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a security aspect that
the Secret
Service determines when the
president and

29:10.749 --> 29:11.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the family travels.

29:11.984 --> 29:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not dictated by the
president of the
United States.

29:14.386 --> 29:17.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Evy Poumpouras says
there simply
aren't enough agents.

29:17.189 --> 29:21.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVY POUMPOURAS: To help with
this demand in
manpower, you tend to go outside
of the normal

29:21.893 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
presidential protective detail.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then you pull in agents from
across the country.

29:26.632 --> 29:29.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are, though, in fact,
pulling them away
from other duties.

29:29.267 --> 29:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Florida, local law
enforcement
is feeling the strain,
especially when Mr.

29:34.306 --> 29:38.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump meets foreign leaders like
the Chinese
president at Mar-a-Lago.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric
Bradshaw:

29:40.379 --> 29:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIC BRADSHAW, Palm Beach County
Sheriff: If
we were just doing the president
up at Mar-a-Lago,

29:43.949 --> 29:47.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's around $60,000 to $70,000 a
day.

29:47.352 --> 29:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can double that right now.

29:50.022 --> 29:54.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's not including all the
other security
measures that we're taking with
fencing and

29:54.426 --> 29:56.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some barriers and stuff like
that.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's an additional cost.

29:58.163 --> 30:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Costs that the county
would like
the federal government to help
pay.

30:03.301 --> 30:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on what it costs to
protect the president
and how this commander in chief
compares to

30:07.572 --> 30:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his predecessors, I am joined by
Ken Vogel,
the chief investigative reporter
for Politico,

30:13.278 --> 30:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and presidential historian
Michael Beschloss.

30:15.280 --> 30:17.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, thanks to you both.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ken, let me start with you.

30:18.984 --> 30:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard in the spot the former
Secret Service
agent talking about the
challenges in terms

30:23.889 --> 30:28.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of manpower and planning or
protecting three
residences, essentially.

30:28.994 --> 30:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are some of the other
challenges the
Secret Service has to deal with
in not just

30:33.398 --> 30:35.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the White House, but Trump Tower
and Mar-a-Lago?

30:35.734 --> 30:40.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN VOGEL, Politico: Well, Trump
Tower, obviously,
in the middle of Manhattan, one
of the most

30:40.639 --> 30:45.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
densely populated areas in the
country, a
lot of challenges around there
related to

30:45.877 --> 30:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just the president's own
security, but
interfacing with the community
writ large.

30:50.749 --> 30:54.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They stop traffic fairly
regularly outside
Trump Tower.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Mar-a-Lago is the big one.

30:56.088 --> 31:00.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I talk to law enforcement
and Secret
Service sources, they repeatedly
raise the

31:00.992 --> 31:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
myriad of concerns that stem
from having a
private membership club where
members continue

31:06.865 --> 31:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come in and out and interface
with the
president, including during some
of these

31:11.436 --> 31:16.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incredibly sensitive sort of
forums where
you have foreign leaders coming
in.

31:16.341 --> 31:23.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw the example with the
Japanese prime
minister and the North Korean
sort of mini-crisis

31:23.415 --> 31:29.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, where they were handling
it in the
middle of sort of an outdoor
porch-type setting,

31:29.087 --> 31:32.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because these people took
pictures of it and
tweeted them.

31:32.457 --> 31:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was jokingly referred to as
an open-air
Situation Room.

31:37.095 --> 31:38.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you had people who are coming
and going
there.

31:38.930 --> 31:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't have the normal types
of background
checks that are required to get
into a sort

31:43.869 --> 31:48.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of closed space where you would
potentially
rub shoulders with the president
at Mar-a-Lago.

31:48.907 --> 31:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, additionally, you
have, you know,
the risk of people that you
have, you know,

31:55.113 --> 31:59.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charity functions there where
you have people
who are not even members who are
coming in

31:59.751 --> 32:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and potentially sitting down at
a table right
next to the president to eat
from the same

32:04.823 --> 32:07.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
buffet that the president is
eating from.

32:07.225 --> 32:08.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, that's really unheard
of.

32:08.927 --> 32:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that creates a lot of
potential risks
that the Secret Service cringes
at.

32:14.599 --> 32:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have to work with the
local police,
as well as the private security
at Mar-a-Lago.

32:20.205 --> 32:24.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just an unprecedented
situation that
adds a number of layers of risk
that you don't

32:24.876 --> 32:25.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
typically see.

32:25.977 --> 32:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Michael, help us put
this into
context.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does this compare to other
presidents?

32:30.515 --> 32:35.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have had -- President Nixon
had homes
in California and in Florida.

32:35.053 --> 32:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Presidents Bush and Johnson had
ranches in
Texas.

32:37.856 --> 32:39.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does this compare?

32:39.624 --> 32:41.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
Well, none of them had a private
club of the

32:41.092 --> 32:44.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind that Ken described with the
open-air
Situation Room.

32:45.030 --> 32:49.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, you did have, for
instance,
John Kennedy went to Palm Beach
to his parents'

32:49.434 --> 32:54.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
house or another house in Palm
Beach every
weekend, went up to Hyannis
Port, too.

32:54.906 --> 33:00.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And public has generally had the
feeling it's
important to protect the
president, important

33:00.812 --> 33:05.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to protect his family,
especially against
kidnapping or blackmail.

33:05.250 --> 33:10.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, therefore, people
generally feel that
you have to spend whatever is
necessary, especially

33:10.255 --> 33:12.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a time of terrorism.

33:12.390 --> 33:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the time that there was the
beginning
of the backlash was 1973,
Richard Nixon and

33:19.297 --> 33:21.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Watergate.

33:21.099 --> 33:25.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were revelations that
Nixon had had
the government pay for
improvements to his

33:25.837 --> 33:31.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
house in California, San
Clemente, his swimming
pool, allegedly for security
reasons.

33:31.877 --> 33:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, actually, that really hurt
him, because
a lot of persons who didn't
understand the

33:36.848 --> 33:41.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fine points of obstruction of
justice, they
certainly understood using
government money

33:41.753 --> 33:43.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to improve your pool.

33:43.588 --> 33:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, ever since then, there has
been a lot
of sensitivity.

33:45.657 --> 33:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But also, with
President Trump,
he has grown children who have
business interests

33:51.296 --> 33:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the world, and they're
traveling for
those business interests.

33:54.699 --> 33:55.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does that compare?

33:55.700 --> 33:57.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: That's the
problem.

33:57.469 --> 34:01.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a view, you can
even hear it
on talk radio these days, of
these sons who

34:02.007 --> 34:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going around the world
swaggering with
their big Secret Service detail,
making a

34:07.579 --> 34:09.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lot of money.

34:09.281 --> 34:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem with that is, is,
God forbid,
you know, let's not talk about
them.

34:12.851 --> 34:18.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let's say if you had a
presidential family
member who was kidnapped for
ransom, making

34:18.189 --> 34:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
demands of a president to do
certain things
to get his child out.

34:22.861 --> 34:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a situation you never
want.

34:24.496 --> 34:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why we probably want
presidential
families protected pretty
closely.

34:29.134 --> 34:31.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ken, what about the
staff?

34:31.202 --> 34:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a number of staff
members who have
been assigned details -- or
requested details

34:36.007 --> 34:40.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
by the president, Reince
Priebus, Kellyanne
Conway, people like that.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEN VOGEL: Yes, that's right.

34:42.147 --> 34:46.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while there are those
decisions about
whether to grant the protection
are driven

34:46.618 --> 34:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by very legitimate security
concerns and a
very careful assessment of the
necessity of

34:53.658 --> 35:00.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, nonetheless, there is a
sense, particularly
in Washington, where we're
extremely status-conscious,

35:00.966 --> 35:05.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this is something, a detail
is sort of
the ultimate status symbol.

35:05.704 --> 35:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you have jealousy and
resentment among
other White House staffers, some
very recognizable

35:11.943 --> 35:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
folks in their own right, who do
not have
the Secret Service protection.

35:15.880 --> 35:20.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw Sean Spicer, the White
House press
secretary, at an Apple store
accosted by a

35:20.285 --> 35:24.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
woman who filmed herself kind of
asking antagonistic
questions of Sean Spicer.

35:24.990 --> 35:28.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, does that warrant Secret
Service protection?

35:28.093 --> 35:29.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Spicer evidently didn't think
so.

35:29.594 --> 35:30.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He hasn't requested it.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no indication that he
would have it.

35:32.397 --> 35:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, why do some of these other
folks have
it?

35:34.799 --> 35:40.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tend to agree with Michael
that, in situations
like this, the protection of
having, ensuring

35:40.939 --> 35:45.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the safety of both the
president, his family,
in some cases key staffers who
face threats,

35:45.777 --> 35:47.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are the most important things.

35:47.612 --> 35:52.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, per the Secret Service
agent who you
talked to, the former agent in
the intro piece,

35:52.884 --> 35:55.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
there are concerns about
spreading the Service
too then.

35:55.553 --> 36:01.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's only so many people who
can have protection,
and the protection would stay at
that consistently

36:01.126 --> 36:04.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
excellent level, professional
level that the
Secret Service is known for.

36:04.596 --> 36:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, of course,
Secret Service
asking for more money.

36:07.132 --> 36:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Beschloss, Ken Vogel,
thanks very
much for joining us.

36:11.736 --> 36:19.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEN VOGEL: Thank you.

36:19.978 --> 36:29.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a
conversation with outgoing
Federal Reserve Board Governor
Daniel Tarullo.

36:29.154 --> 36:35.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Republicans set their sights
on major changes
to Obama era financial reforms,
our economics

36:35.360 --> 36:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correspondent, Paul Solman, sat
down with
the Fed's point person on bank
regulation,

36:40.131 --> 36:43.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who played a major role in
putting them in
place.

36:43.501 --> 36:46.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our series Making
Sense, which
airs every Thursday.

36:46.971 --> 36:52.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Federal Reserve
Governor Daniel
Tarullo has been called one of
the most powerful

36:52.510 --> 36:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. banking regulators since
Alexander Hamilton.

36:57.015 --> 37:03.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Appointed by President Obama in
2009, Tarullo
was central to the
implementation of the 2010

37:04.022 --> 37:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dodd-frank Act, which imposed
tougher regulations
on banks in the wake of the
financial crisis.

37:10.261 --> 37:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under his watch, the Fed has
sought to curb
banks' reliance on short-term
loans and to

37:16.101 --> 37:19.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increase the amount of capital
they must keep
on hand.

37:19.938 --> 37:25.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But President Trump is expected
to try to
scale back much of what was put
in place.

37:25.610 --> 37:30.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On our visit to the Fed last
week, Tarullo's
wasn't the only empty office we
found.

37:30.815 --> 37:35.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since Senate Republicans refused
to vote on
two of President Obama's
nominees, there are

37:35.587 --> 37:39.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now three openings on the
seven-member board
of governors.

37:39.357 --> 37:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means President Trump will
have a chance
to put his mark on Fed policy
going forward.

37:45.497 --> 37:46.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Daniel Tarullo, welcome to the
program.

37:46.831 --> 37:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO, Federal Reserve
Governor:
Good to be with you.

37:48.533 --> 37:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Your appointment's
through 2022,
right, so why are you leaving
now?

37:53.838 --> 37:57.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO: Well, you know,
eight years
is a long time.

37:57.509 --> 38:03.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I came here, along with other
people, with
a sense of the need to rebuild
the financial

38:03.715 --> 38:04.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regulatory system.

38:04.983 --> 38:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have made a lot of
progress towards
that end.

38:09.154 --> 38:13.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there comes a time
where everybody
individually wants to do
something else, and

38:13.758 --> 38:19.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where it's time to let other
people try their
hand at the job you have been
occupying.

38:19.164 --> 38:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, in this case,
try their
hand at dismantling what you in
particular

38:23.635 --> 38:25.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have been doing.

38:25.436 --> 38:28.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO: Well, I don't
really expect
that there's going to be a
dismantling of

38:28.606 --> 38:32.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
some of the major
accomplishments that we
have had.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I certainly hope not.

38:34.712 --> 38:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think it would be
something the
American people would want to
see, Democrats

38:37.849 --> 38:43.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or Republicans, particularly
with respect
to the additional requirements
that we and

38:43.321 --> 38:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other banking agencies have
placed on
the largest, most systemically
important financial

38:48.893 --> 38:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
institutions, those that almost
failed during
the crisis.

38:52.730 --> 38:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there's a broad-based
view that stronger
capital requirements and better
oversight

38:58.136 --> 39:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is something that's needed there
indefinitely.

39:00.271 --> 39:07.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But the criticism
has been that
you so regulated the system that
banks and

39:07.545 --> 39:13.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other financial institutions are
not lending
as they would have lent in the
past, and that

39:13.985 --> 39:19.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's made the economy a lot
less vibrant
than it would otherwise have
been and could

39:19.424 --> 39:21.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have been.

39:21.292 --> 39:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO: Sure, we could
go back to
a time in 2004, '5 and '6 when
there was lending

39:25.530 --> 39:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against no collateral, no down
payments for
houses.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sure, that is a lot more
lending, and, in
the short term, it feels good,
but it's not

39:33.571 --> 39:34.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sustainable lending.

39:34.806 --> 39:35.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not sound lending.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, of course, we saw the
results.

39:37.976 --> 39:44.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think you both find today
that they're
-- the problem that banks see is
not that

39:45.016 --> 39:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have too little capital in
order to be
able to make loans.

39:49.554 --> 39:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem they see is still
not enough demand
to make more loans.

39:52.523 --> 39:59.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Were you afraid, as
you put all
these regulations in place, that
there was

39:59.964 --> 40:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be another crash if you
didn't?

40:02.300 --> 40:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO: I don't expect
that in the
near-term, because, of course,
everyone is

40:05.637 --> 40:12.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still adjusting and making their
balance sheets
sounder and more healthy in the
wake of the

40:12.377 --> 40:13.444 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crisis.

40:13.478 --> 40:14.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: They're still
remembering the
crisis.

40:14.545 --> 40:15.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL TARULLO: Yes.

40:15.613 --> 40:18.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you do see memories start to
fade.

40:18.683 --> 40:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do worry that even now,
about a year
or two or three from now, it
will be too easy

40:25.490 --> 40:30.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for people to forget the
situation that some
of our biggest banks were in,
where they needed

40:30.762 --> 40:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taxpayer funds in the fall of
2008 in order
to stay solvent, and then
retreat from the

40:39.404 --> 40:42.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fairly rigorous set of
regulations we have
put in place.

40:42.173 --> 40:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, look, some things will need
to be changed,
reconciled with each other, and
certainly

40:46.244 --> 40:50.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with respect to the smaller
banks, we will
want to ramp back on some of the
regulation.

40:50.848 --> 40:57.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been kind of caught in
the snares
that were set for the banks that
do involve

40:57.689 --> 41:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the integration of capital
markets and traditional
lending.

41:00.391 --> 41:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What would you
change about the
regulation of the financial
system now that

41:08.566 --> 41:12.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you might even have been
instrumental in implementing
when you first came in?

41:12.770 --> 41:14.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL TARULLO: Sure.

41:14.038 --> 41:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we do need it to be
somewhat simpler
than it is now.

41:17.375 --> 41:20.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One very good example is that of
the Volcker
rule.

41:20.345 --> 41:23.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're sitting here in the shadow
of former
Chairman Volcker's portrait.

41:23.614 --> 41:25.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He proposed a very
straightforward idea.

41:25.450 --> 41:30.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The idea: bar
commercial banks
from making certain risky
investments with

41:30.722 --> 41:33.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their own funds, so-called
proprietary trading.

41:33.791 --> 41:37.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Tarullo thinks the rule is
simply too
complicated to apply.

41:37.528 --> 41:44.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO: First off,
Dodd-Frank had
five different federal agencies
involved in

41:44.235 --> 41:45.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
implementing the rule.

41:45.903 --> 41:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we really had four or
five different
Volcker rules, rather than just
one.

41:49.841 --> 41:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, secondly, the way that we
tried to implement
it, by trying to discern the
intentions of

41:57.715 --> 42:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the traders, do they mean to be
engaged in
proprietary trading, I think has
just shown

42:02.153 --> 42:04.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
itself not to be feasible.

42:04.622 --> 42:12.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We, the agencies, could go back
and try to
find simpler ways to enforce the
Volcker rule.

42:12.964 --> 42:17.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And perhaps someday Congress
would reconsider
some of these rule-makings that
have three

42:17.335 --> 42:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or four or five or six agencies
having to
do everything simultaneously.

42:20.805 --> 42:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What do you expect
to happen
now that there are three
vacancies on the

42:25.777 --> 42:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Board of Governors, which
President Trump
will have the opportunity to
appoint, and

42:31.048 --> 42:37.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presumably can redirect, or have
a substantial
influence on redirecting the
Fed, and if he

42:37.688 --> 42:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were to not reappoint Chair
Yellen, even more
of an impact?

42:42.427 --> 42:47.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO: Well, I don't
think I want
to speculate about what
appointments the president

42:47.365 --> 42:49.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
may make.

42:49.200 --> 42:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have got a good
tradition in this
country of people being
appointed to the Fed

42:54.472 --> 42:58.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who take their job seriously and
who try to
work with one another, even when
they have

42:58.743 --> 43:00.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
different views.

43:00.578 --> 43:04.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my hope and expectation
would be that
that's what would continue on
into the future.

43:04.649 --> 43:09.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Are you not worried
about the
pendulum swinging too far in the
other direction

43:10.021 --> 43:12.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
towards deregulation once again?

43:12.390 --> 43:15.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO: I am concerned
about that.

43:15.860 --> 43:21.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is certainly the potential
for making
some changes to regulations,
particularly

43:21.399 --> 43:25.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as they affect smaller banks,
which I think
would be just fine.

43:25.403 --> 43:32.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do have concerns that, with
respect to the
largest, most systemic
institutions, people

43:32.076 --> 43:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not forget the reason why we put
these higher
capital requirements in place in
the first

43:39.550 --> 43:40.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
instance.

43:40.918 --> 43:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, then why didn't
you stay
and fight the good fight?

43:42.520 --> 43:45.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO: You can do the
job you do.

43:45.223 --> 43:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You try to put something in
place.

43:47.525 --> 43:49.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And then one moves on.

43:49.660 --> 43:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think anybody can
ever tell themselves
that they are the most important
cog in a

43:56.434 --> 43:57.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particular position.

43:57.702 --> 43:58.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just not the case.

43:59.003 --> 44:00.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Daniel Tarullo,
thank you very
much.

44:00.605 --> 44:05.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL TARULLO: Thank you.

44:05.109 --> 44:17.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now the
latest in our ongoing
series of conversations with
musicians called

44:17.355 --> 44:18.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
My Music.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from Valerie
June.

44:20.825 --> 44:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a singer/songwriter from
Memphis, Tennessee,
who says inspiration comes to
her in all forms

44:26.297 --> 44:28.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and at all times of the day.

44:28.065 --> 44:33.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour" caught up with
June at her
recent show at Washington,
D.C.'s Sixth &amp; I

44:33.471 --> 44:35.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Synagogue.

44:35.406 --> 44:45.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALERIE JUNE, Singer/Songwriter:
I always
loved my voice.

44:45.850 --> 44:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I always loved singing.

44:49.554 --> 45:04.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I did know that my voice was
different.

45:04.201 --> 45:09.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That didn't stop me from singing
at the top
of my lungs around the house,
and really,

45:09.774 --> 45:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really having fun with songs.

45:13.711 --> 45:16.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Valerie June.

45:16.080 --> 45:25.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I'm an American
singer/songwriter and
multi-instrumentalist.

45:25.556 --> 45:29.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Voices are beautiful things,
because voices
change.

45:29.727 --> 45:34.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just think that is so
beautiful how
voices age, how they make it
through a day,

45:34.532 --> 45:41.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
how it's -- your sleepy
nighttime voice is
different from your sleepy
morning voice.

45:41.739 --> 45:45.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:45.343 --> 45:59.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JUNE: These songs just
come while
I'm cleaning the house or
walking through

45:59.457 --> 46:07.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the grocery store, or while I'm
doing other
things.

46:07.732 --> 46:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the songs come, I can't
tell them what
to do.

46:13.037 --> 46:19.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are what they are.

46:19.110 --> 46:30.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:80% size:62.5%
And
that's what I'm here to do, to
work in the

46:30.521 --> 46:36.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spirit way with music, more than
anything
else, how can the spirit open,
and where -- where

46:36.927 --> 46:44.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does the spirit lie in the
songs?

46:44.869 --> 46:50.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sometimes, it just wants to
dance.

46:50.741 --> 46:57.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other times, it wants to go
inside of itself
in pure, raw emotion.

46:57.081 --> 47:00.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe it's lost, like I lost my
father.

47:00.584 --> 47:07.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Or maybe it's like love.

47:07.358 --> 47:13.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or maybe it's like complete and
total, just
a happy moment.

47:13.531 --> 47:17.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or maybe it's like complete and
total, just
a happy moment.

47:36.220 --> 47:39.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, another
in our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask people

47:39.423 --> 47:41.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to describe their passions.

47:41.258 --> 47:46.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we here from the
photographer Platon,
who has taken photographs or
portraits of

47:46.497 --> 47:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
many world leaders and
well-known figures.

47:49.233 --> 47:54.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His latest book is called
"Service," and he
runs a nonprofit foundation, The
People's

47:54.405 --> 47:56.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Portfolio.

47:56.073 --> 48:01.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PLATON, Photographer: A
portrait, to me, is
about closeness, it's about
truth.

48:01.846 --> 48:07.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, someone's fame, power
and success
actually becomes a prison, and
the person

48:07.084 --> 48:12.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knows better than anybody that
they can't
live up to that ideal.

48:12.056 --> 48:26.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My job is not to be
disrespectful, but to
be authentic, to say, who are
you really?

48:26.403 --> 48:32.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first American president I
ever came into
contact with was Bill Clinton.

48:32.376 --> 48:35.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The magazine said, we want a
nice dignified
head shot.

48:35.746 --> 48:40.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought to myself, look, I'm
never going
to be in front of another
president ever again

48:40.117 --> 48:44.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anyway, so I might as well do
the picture
that I was born to do.

48:44.255 --> 48:48.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I shouted out, "Mr. President,
will you show
me the love?"

48:48.626 --> 48:50.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there was silence in the
room.

48:50.628 --> 48:55.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think his chief of staff
leaned forward
and said, "Mr. President,
whatever you do,

48:55.166 --> 48:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do not show him the love."

48:56.433 --> 48:58.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Clinton then says: "Shut up.

48:58.235 --> 48:59.203 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Shut up.

48:59.236 --> 49:00.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know what he means."

49:00.671 --> 49:05.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He puts his hands on his knees,
and gives
me that Clinton charisma.

49:05.943 --> 49:11.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It became an icon of
controversy, dubbing
it as the crotch shot, that it's
all about

49:11.315 --> 49:16.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sex, that the tie is actually an
arrow, that
the face is smiling, saying, I
got away with

49:16.754 --> 49:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the biggest sex scandal ever.

49:18.589 --> 49:20.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't about any of those
things.

49:20.491 --> 49:22.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was about charisma.

49:22.326 --> 49:23.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a rock 'n' roll president.

49:23.928 --> 49:27.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was led into Mark Zuckerberg's
office where
we were going to do the picture.

49:27.998 --> 49:29.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His neck was tense.

49:29.900 --> 49:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His eyes were wide open, and he
almost resisted
every opportunity I made to
connect with him.

49:35.973 --> 49:41.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I said to him, you
know, you have
succeeded more than any other
person I have

49:41.946 --> 49:47.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever met on the planet, but you
must have
failed along the way.

49:47.051 --> 49:49.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when you fail, how do you
cope with failure?

49:49.954 --> 49:53.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He looked at me, and he said:
"There is no
failure.

49:53.524 --> 49:54.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just love what I do."

49:54.992 --> 49:59.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, I said, "Show me," and
everything
changed.

49:59.663 --> 50:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's extraordinary what a simple
question
can do that connects with his
value system.

50:07.271 --> 50:15.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Putin, I think that was the
first moment
I ever had to deal with this
sense of intimidation.

50:15.045 --> 50:19.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He walks in with this giant
entourage that
makes P. Diddy look like Mickey
Mouse.

50:19.884 --> 50:24.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I nervously said: "Mr.
President, it's a great
honor to be in your fine
country.

50:24.955 --> 50:26.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have a question for you.

50:26.891 --> 50:32.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before we take the picture, I
want you to
know that I'm an Englishman, and
I love the

50:32.062 --> 50:33.097 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Beatles.

50:33.130 --> 50:35.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I would like to know if you
like the Beatles."

50:35.165 --> 50:37.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He says, "I love the Beatles."

50:37.368 --> 50:41.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said, "Oh, my God, I didn't
know you spoke
English."

50:41.505 --> 50:43.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, "I speak perfect
English."

50:43.107 --> 50:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I said, "Well, who's your
favorite Beatle?"

50:45.409 --> 50:47.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he said, "Paul."

50:47.278 --> 50:48.245 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
"Wow.

50:48.279 --> 50:49.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your favorite song.

50:49.280 --> 50:50.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is it 'Back in the USSR'?"

50:50.681 --> 50:54.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said, "No, it's 'Yesterday.'

50:54.752 --> 50:55.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Think about it."

50:55.920 --> 51:00.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ended up an inch-and-a-half
away from his
nose.

51:00.691 --> 51:02.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's how I got the truth.

51:02.927 --> 51:08.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the cold face of power
in Russia.

51:08.399 --> 51:14.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I worked with Donald Trump quite
a while ago,
but even back then, there was
this chaos and

51:14.738 --> 51:16.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
madness that surrounded him.

51:16.840 --> 51:21.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember saying to him:
"Donald, how do
you weather the storm?

51:21.045 --> 51:24.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's madness around you wherever
you go, whatever
you do, whatever you say.

51:24.848 --> 51:26.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's this sort of frenetic
energy."

51:26.817 --> 51:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Suddenly, this quiet calm came
over him, and
he said, "I am the storm."

51:32.656 --> 51:38.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this sort of frenetic, crazy
energy and
sense of chaos is very easy for
Donald to

51:38.629 --> 51:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
navigate through that, because
he created
it.

51:42.199 --> 51:44.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's actually us that can't
cope with
it.

51:44.702 --> 51:51.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Platon, and this is
my Brief But
Spectacular take on speaking
truth to power.

51:51.942 --> 51:54.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

51:54.478 --> 52:03.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can find additional
Brief But Spectacular
episodes on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

52:03.354 --> 52:09.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One hundred years ago today, the
United States
entered World War I by declaring
war on Germany.

52:09.960 --> 52:15.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Starting Monday on PBS,
"American Experience"
presents a three-night series
about the war

52:15.332 --> 52:22.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that claimed more than 100,000
American lives,
a fraction of the 1.5 million of
lives lost

52:22.673 --> 52:24.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the globe.

52:24.475 --> 52:29.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The Great War" explores the
experiences of
African-American and Latino
soldiers, the

52:29.913 --> 52:35.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crackdown on suspected German
supporters in
the U.S., the reluctance of
President Wilson

52:35.052 --> 52:40.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to join the war effort, and how
it led to
transforming the United States
into a dominant

52:40.624 --> 52:43.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
player on the world stage.

52:44.028 --> 52:54.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: World War I showed
Americans the best
and worst that the country is
capable of.

52:54.238 --> 52:57.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We're still ironing out
everything that
war unleashed.

52:57.708 --> 53:02.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: This was a period of deep
paranoia.

53:02.179 --> 53:05.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: You became a public enemy
if you refused
to support the war.

53:05.416 --> 53:10.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It's probably the greatest
suppression
of free speech the country has
ever seen.

53:10.187 --> 53:15.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: For Wilson, it's
embarrassing that these
protests were happening.

53:15.225 --> 53:18.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: These are women who are
resilient,
who will not give up.

53:18.362 --> 53:20.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're the radical voice.

53:20.998 --> 53:26.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I said 1.5
million lives lost.

53:26.270 --> 53:29.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, 15 million lives lost
around the
world.

53:29.706 --> 53:33.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And "The Great War" begins
Monday night on
most PBS stations.

53:33.610 --> 53:38.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: We visit
a Baltimore artist's home which
is more a

53:38.882 --> 53:44.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
museum than a residence, crammed
with a collection
of thousands of works of what's
known as outsider

53:45.022 --> 53:46.090 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
art.

53:46.123 --> 53:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

tonight.

53:51.662 --> 53:57.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
