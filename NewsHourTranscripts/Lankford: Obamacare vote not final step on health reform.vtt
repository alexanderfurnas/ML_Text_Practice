00:01.233 --> 00:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back
to health care now.

00:02.433 --> 00:05.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
At this hour, its fate
remains uncertain.

00:05.366 --> 00:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans have not been
able to muster enough support
among their own ranks.

00:09.133 --> 00:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke to one of them, Senator
James Lankford of Oklahoma,
just shortly before four of his

00:16.100 --> 00:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colleagues said that they'd
vote no without assurances from
the House of Representatives.

00:21.700 --> 00:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began by asking the senator
if he thinks any version of
the health care bill will pass.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:26.366 --> 00:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD (R), Oklahoma:
I do actually, but I don't
think it's the final version.

00:28.366 --> 00:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we have is the House
will have version, the
Senate will have a version.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Neither of us want it to be the
final version at this point.

00:33.500 --> 00:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will go to a conference
committee, and we will work
out the differences, and there

00:37.000 --> 00:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be significant differences
between the House and Senate,
and then bring a final version

00:40.466 --> 00:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out after CBO can score
it sometime in September.

00:43.566 --> 00:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, CBO has taken about
four weeks to score
just about everything
we put out, so we have

00:48.433 --> 00:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got to be able to give them a
lot more time again to be able
to run through scoring, and

00:52.566 --> 00:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then we will be able to
have that final vote.

00:54.666 --> 00:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this week and the next
24 hours is a step again, but
definitely not the final step.

00:58.700 --> 01:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, in terms
that voters, that a layman
could understand, what is mainly

01:05.700 --> 01:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this legislation going to
consist of as it comes out
of the Senate, do you think?

01:08.966 --> 01:10.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:10.966 --> 01:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: So, this
version that will come out, as I
mentioned, is just a step that's

01:12.400 --> 01:14.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming out.

01:14.466 --> 01:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will deal with some basic
things, like the individual
mandate, the employer mandate,

01:17.133 --> 01:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state flexibility in allowing
states to have greater options.

01:20.700 --> 01:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the Affordable Care Act was
passed, it took all the control
of health care to Washington,

01:24.133 --> 01:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
D.C., away from all the states.

01:26.233 --> 01:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so we want to be
able to return some of
that control back, when
prices were much cheaper

01:30.100 --> 01:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the time before, when the
Affordable Care Act was passed.

01:33.266 --> 01:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So those will be
the basic elements.

01:34.466 --> 01:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There will be some other
smaller parts to it.

01:36.900 --> 01:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's basically the employer
mandate, individual
mandate, and state control
vs. federal control.

01:40.500 --> 01:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
know, Senator, Democrats and
even a number of Republicans

01:47.533 --> 01:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are saying what's being called
skinny repeal, which is, I
gather, what you're referring

01:50.300 --> 01:51.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to...

01:51.300 --> 01:52.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:52.300 --> 01:54.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: Right.

01:54.300 --> 01:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... would leave,
what, more than 15 million
Americans without coverage.

01:57.066 --> 02:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Other versions would leave many
more millions without coverage.

02:00.533 --> 02:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any one of these versions,
we're told, would raise
the cost of premiums.

02:04.066 --> 02:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you explain a
vote to support that?

02:06.233 --> 02:07.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: So,
again, today's vote
is not the final vote.

02:09.333 --> 02:10.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I understand that.

02:10.966 --> 02:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're trying to score
something that's not
finished by any means.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's one big piece of it.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The other one is to be able to
look at how CBO scores this.

02:17.200 --> 02:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CBO scores -- they basically
assume that if there is not a
mandate to buy it, most people

02:22.000 --> 02:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
won't buy the insurance products
that are put out there under
the Affordable Care Act.

02:25.466 --> 02:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, literally, there's
nine million people right
now on the exchanges.

02:29.033 --> 02:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They assume 22 million
people won't have insurance
in the days ahead based
on them changing this.

02:36.033 --> 02:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this may seem odd, and it
only works in an economist's
mind, that only nine million

02:38.333 --> 02:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people have it, 22 million
people lose it in that sense.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But here's what's
really going on.

02:43.366 --> 02:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of the mine million people
that are having it, CBO says,
if they're given the choice

02:46.166 --> 02:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able to buy it, many of
the individuals don't want to
buy that product, and they only

02:50.133 --> 02:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
buy it because they're
forced to buy that product.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's the number
that's sitting out there.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would also say, in my state,
CBO never saw in their original
estimates when the Affordable

02:59.533 --> 03:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Care Act passed that in my
state the insurance rates would
go up over 200 percent for the

03:05.700 --> 03:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
individuals that were
buying their insurance.

03:07.733 --> 03:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So CBO is making their best
guess, but I can assure you they
don't always guess correctly.

03:10.366 --> 03:12.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No one can really see
into the future on that.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they're laying out an
economist's view vs. practically
what's actually happening

03:15.700 --> 03:17.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the ground.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know
that hospital officials in
Oklahoma have said if one of

03:20.166 --> 03:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the versions of this were to
pass, that they thought it would
be devastating on their ability

03:25.100 --> 03:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take care of low-income
individuals, whether on
Medicaid or otherwise.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you say to them,
the folks in your own state?

03:32.366 --> 03:33.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: Yes,
same thing, Judy.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, they're looking
at just part of a plan.

03:37.166 --> 03:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know that my Democratic
colleagues have been very good
for distributing bits and pieces

03:39.633 --> 03:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of plans and saying here is the
whole plan, without actually
putting the full picture

03:43.066 --> 03:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out there for individuals to be
able to see how the stability
works, how aspects of it

03:48.533 --> 03:50.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

03:50.533 --> 03:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will just put out and
say, this is going to be a cut
that happens to this particular

03:51.833 --> 03:52.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
area.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What will happen?

03:54.333 --> 03:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Immediately, they respond back,
well, that will be dramatic.

03:55.633 --> 03:57.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let me give you a for
instance on Medicaid.

03:57.666 --> 04:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hear a lot of talk about
how Medicaid goes down in
one of the earlier proposals.

04:00.866 --> 04:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid actually increases
every year for the next eight
years in that proposal by twice

04:05.166 --> 04:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rate of inflation, and
then nine years from now it
increases at only the rate of

04:09.833 --> 04:11.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inflation.

04:11.800 --> 04:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's put out by my Democratic
colleagues as a big cut in
Medicaid because nine years

04:15.233 --> 04:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from now it doesn't increase
as fast, but every single
year it's increasing, and for

04:19.766 --> 04:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the next eight years
it increases twice
as fast as inflation.

04:22.300 --> 04:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, I want
to change the subject and ask
you about the attorney general,

04:26.066 --> 04:28.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jeff Sessions.

04:28.166 --> 04:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, President Trump
has been publicly criticizing
him for the last several days,

04:34.100 --> 04:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mainly because the attorney
general recused himself from
the Russia investigation.

04:37.566 --> 04:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What do you make of
the president's public
campaign against him?

04:41.500 --> 04:43.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, it's
something I would never do.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obviously, the president
is the president.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He can lead his staff
however he chooses.

04:47.433 --> 04:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I would never say to my
staff in a public setting
that there is a problem.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I have a problem with a
staff member, they will sit
down with me in my office and we

04:52.833 --> 04:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will sit down and work it out.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if we can't work it
out, then they will leave.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's something we are
going to work out in private,
not in a public setting.

04:58.933 --> 05:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, quite frankly, Jeff
Sessions had to recuse himself.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something all the legal
counsel in the Department
of Justice, once he joined

05:05.033 --> 05:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the attorney general,
sat down with him, laid
out the law of the statute.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everyone looked at it's.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone read it exactly
the same way, that Jeff
needed to recuse himself.

05:12.566 --> 05:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, did Jeff understand
that before he got there?

05:14.700 --> 05:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No, I don't think he
did, but once he was in
that spot, sitting down
with all the attorneys,

05:18.333 --> 05:20.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he understand full well
that he had to do that.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand that frustrates
the president, but it was
the right thing to do.

05:23.533 --> 05:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would
it mean if the president
were to fire the attorney
general or if Jeff

05:30.500 --> 05:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions were to step down
because of this pressure
from the president?

05:34.066 --> 05:36.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:36.566 --> 05:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Well, there
would be -- obviously,
the president -- doesn't
have to be just pressure

05:37.366 --> 05:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the president.

05:39.433 --> 05:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president chooses who his
staff is, and they all serve at
the pleasure of the president.

05:41.433 --> 05:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if any point the president
is uncomfortable with Jeff
Sessions and his leadership, he

05:44.766 --> 05:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can choose to remove him.

05:45.933 --> 05:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what the
president does for that.

05:47.766 --> 05:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's not the issue.

05:49.733 --> 05:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The issue is then going
through the process, going
through all of the nomination.

05:52.466 --> 05:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Getting through all that aspect
again starting all over again
and getting someone in will

05:57.400 --> 05:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take months and months.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, the attorney general
is getting a good stride and
dealing with U.S. attorneys

06:02.433 --> 06:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the country, getting
with his staff, getting on board
with different investigations

06:05.833 --> 06:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that need to be done.

06:07.566 --> 06:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, I hate to be able to
lose that progress that
is happening right now.

06:09.833 --> 06:13.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
would it mean for the
Russia investigation
if that were to happen?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:14.933 --> 06:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: It
wouldn't change the Russia
investigation at all.

06:16.866 --> 06:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff is completely disconnected
from what is happening in
the Russia investigation.

06:19.933 --> 06:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's recused himself.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have had numerous
interactions with
people in the DOJ.

06:23.266 --> 06:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not tried to interfere
in that in any way.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's already in the special
counsel's responsibility.

06:27.833 --> 06:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it doesn't change
that investigation at all.

06:30.333 --> 06:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And,
finally, Senator, the
president's announcement
by Twitter yesterday

06:34.266 --> 06:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he wants to ban individuals
who are transgender from
serving in the military?

06:38.533 --> 06:41.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Yes, we're
trying to get additional
details on what he means by
that, the implementation.

06:42.766 --> 06:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Obviously, the Pentagon
was unaware of an
announcement like that.

06:45.133 --> 06:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon was already in a
six-month review dealing with
transgenders in the military,

06:49.733 --> 06:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what that means as far as
costs, unit cohesion, deployment
capabilities, what that means.

06:53.866 --> 06:55.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Would
you support the ban?

06:55.366 --> 06:57.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:57.433 --> 06:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LANKFORD: Well, again,
I'm waiting for that six-month
review to come back from the

06:59.133 --> 07:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
military officials.

07:01.233 --> 07:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We open up our military to
all aspects for any individual
that comes into the military

07:04.700 --> 07:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that wants to be able to serve.

07:06.733 --> 07:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are unique issues, not
just with a gay soldier or
member of the military, but of

07:10.266 --> 07:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
someone who is in transition.

07:11.700 --> 07:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You deal with medical issues.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You deal with a lot of
additional costs and
implementation, what
happens in a unit based

07:16.833 --> 07:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on that, because that's
-- as you know, that's
not a single surgery.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's a series of
surgeries that happens.

07:20.966 --> 07:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a long time for them
to be away from their unit.

07:23.066 --> 07:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there are additional
questions that are there that
are unique to that, whether that

07:26.533 --> 07:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individual should go through
transition before they come
into the military or after.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of those things are still
up in the air, and the military
is walking through that right

07:33.400 --> 07:35.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator
James Lankford of
Oklahoma, we thank you.

07:37.266 --> 07:38.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:38.266 --> 07:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LANKFORD: Great.

07:39.266 --> 07:41.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

07:41.300 --> 07:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can
continue watching the Senate
as it votes on the health care

07:42.800 --> 07:44.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
measures.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will be live-streaming
throughout this night
on our Web site.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's PBS.org/NewsHour.
