12:19.867 --> 12:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOMENT OF DONALD'S CHILDHOOD WAS

12:22.133 --> 12:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HE WAS SENT OFF TO MILITARY

12:23.933 --> 12:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL AT AGE 13.

12:26.233 --> 12:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HERE'S A KID WHO'S BEEN

12:28.200 --> 12:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAISED IN LUXURY, ATTENDED BY

12:30.067 --> 12:31.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVANTS.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE EVEN HAD A CHAUFFEUR TAKE HIM

12:33.400 --> 12:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON HIS PAPER ROUTE WHEN IT

12:34.600 --> 12:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAINED.

12:35.533 --> 12:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE WAS A KIND OF WILD LITTLE

12:37.433 --> 12:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOY AND HIS FATHER GOT TIRED OF

12:39.100 --> 12:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANSWERING CALLS FROM THE SCHOOL.

12:42.433 --> 12:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IN AUGUST OF HIS 13th YEAR,

DONALD IS PACKED UP, AND HIS

12:48.867 --> 12:51.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUR SIBLINGS GET TO STAY HOME.

12:51.067 --> 12:52.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS PLACE, NEW YORK

12:52.867 --> 12:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY ACADEMY, WAS A PRETTY

12:54.633 --> 12:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROUGH PLACE FOR A LITTLE BOY TO

12:56.333 --> 12:58.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE ENSCONCED.

12:58.467 --> 13:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THIS MOMENT OF BEING

13:02.200 --> 13:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESSENTIALLY BANISHED AND THEN

13:04.533 --> 13:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACED IN THIS VERY DISCIPLINED,

13:07.533 --> 13:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY HIERARCHICAL ENVIRONMENT

13:10.067 --> 13:11.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:11.667 --> 13:12.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOUGH.

13:12.867 --> 13:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ALWAYS A FIGHT, AND YOU'RE

13:14.400 --> 13:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPOSED TO WIN AT EVERYTHING.

13:16.267 --> 13:18.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE DID THRIVE THERE.

13:18.367 --> 13:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN IN HIS POSTURE, WHEN YOU

13:20.333 --> 13:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE HOW SORT OF STRAIGHT HE

13:22.533 --> 13:24.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANDS, THAT'S NEW YORK MILITARY

13:24.367 --> 13:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:27.200 --> 13:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW 70 YEARS OLD.

13:28.533 --> 13:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:30.167 --> 13:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BUSINESS.

13:33.067 --> 13:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY WOULD SWEEP OUT

REPAIRS.

13:42.233 --> 13:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN THEY GOT A LITTLE

13:43.567 --> 13:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OLDER, DAD WOULD HAVE THEM

13:44.900 --> 13:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLECT RENTS, BECAUSE HE

13:46.400 --> 13:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECTED THEM TO ALL GO INTO THE

13:47.367 --> 13:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:51.567 --> 13:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THAT INITIAL BUSINESS.

13:56.633 --> 13:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW MUCH OF A ROLE DID HE HAVE

13:57.500 --> 13:58.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THIS IDEA DONALD TRUMP HAS

13:58.567 --> 13:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE MUST WIN AT ALL COSTS?

13:59.833 --> 14:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT HE MUST HAVE AN

14:01.100 --> 14:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREDIBLE DRIVE, A WORK ETHIC?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK WHAT'S REALLY

14:04.733 --> 14:06.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FASCINATING IS TO SEE THE DRIVE

14:06.267 --> 14:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FRED IMPLANTED IN DONALD,

14:08.733 --> 14:10.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN PART, BY REJECTING HIM.

14:10.967 --> 14:12.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY THINK A LOT

14:12.567 --> 14:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WHAT DONALD IS DOING TODAY IS

14:14.267 --> 14:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL SEEKING HIS FATHER'S LOVE.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: HOW MUCH OF A

14:17.567 --> 14:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROLE DID HIS FATHER PLAY IN

14:19.033 --> 14:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUNDING TRUMP'S BUSINESS AND IN

14:20.000 --> 14:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESTABLISHING HIM?

14:21.467 --> 14:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO, WHEN DONALD WAS STILL IN

14:22.733 --> 14:24.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIAPERS, HE HAD AN ANNUAL TRUST

14:24.267 --> 14:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUND INCOME OF $12,000, WHICH

14:26.133 --> 14:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS ABOUT FOUR TIMES WHAT THE

14:28.233 --> 14:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY WITH A

14:29.833 --> 14:33.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FULL-TIME WORKER MADE BACK THEN.

14:33.067 --> 14:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HE STARTED OUT, HIS FATHER

14:34.433 --> 14:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUT HIM INTO DEALS.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS FATHER'S LIFELONG FRIEND ABE

14:37.033 --> 14:38.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEAME BECAME MAYOR OF NEW YORK.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO DONALD GOT ALL SORTS OF DEALS

14:40.933 --> 14:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE CITY, INCLUDING

14:43.167 --> 14:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
40 YEARS OF NO PROPERTY TAXES

14:45.200 --> 14:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE GRAND HYATT HOTEL THAT--

14:47.300 --> 14:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD HAD REBUILT FROM THE

14:48.633 --> 14:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRECK OF THE OLD COMMODORE.

14:49.533 --> 14:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: SORT OF HOW HE

14:50.233 --> 14:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE HIS FIRST MARK WAS THAT--

14:50.967 --> 14:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: GRAND HYATT

14:52.400 --> 14:53.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROJECT.

14:53.367 --> 14:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT'S REALLY KIND OF

14:54.367 --> 14:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAUGHABLE IS HE SAYS, "I

14:55.633 --> 14:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BORROWED $1 MILLION FROM MY

14:56.567 --> 14:57.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FATHER."

14:57.867 --> 14:59.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, HE GOT ACCESS TO $40

14:59.567 --> 15:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILLION IN FINANCING FOR THAT

15:01.400 --> 15:04.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMODORE HOTEL RENOVATION.

15:04.267 --> 15:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF YOU CAN WALK INTO A BANK,

15:07.667 --> 15:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY'LL SAY, "YOU'RE FRED

15:08.867 --> 15:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP'S SON.

15:10.033 --> 15:11.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE'S $40 MILLION IN

15:11.567 --> 15:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTRUCTION FUNDS."--

15:12.733 --> 15:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG ADVANTAGE.

15:14.433 --> 15:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: NO QUESTION.

15:15.300 --> 15:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHAT WAS HE ABLE TO DO?

15:16.400 --> 15:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW CREATIVE WAS HE, AND HOW

15:17.400 --> 15:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOOD OF A DEAL MAKER WAS THE

15:18.800 --> 15:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUNG- AND MIDDLE-AGED DONALD

15:20.133 --> 15:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE TRUMP TOWER DEAL WAS

15:22.100 --> 15:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPRESSIVE.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD WENT TO TIFFANY'S AND

15:24.700 --> 15:26.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH THEM

15:26.167 --> 15:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE HE GOT THEIR AIR RIGHTS.

15:27.867 --> 15:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN HE GOT THE BONWIT TELLER

15:28.733 --> 15:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILDING.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT DEAL AWAY

15:30.633 --> 15:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM HIM.

15:32.267 --> 15:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, IT WAS AIDED BY HIS DAD AND

15:34.400 --> 15:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT STANDS AS, I THINK, THE

15:36.733 --> 15:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINGULAR ACHIEVEMENT OF HIS

15:37.833 --> 15:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAREER.

15:40.733 --> 15:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE OWNS THE CHICAGO TRUMP

15:41.733 --> 15:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOWER.

15:43.267 --> 15:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE OWNS AN APARTMENT BUILDING A

15:44.133 --> 15:45.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUPLE BLOCKS FROM TRUMP TOWER

15:45.067 --> 15:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW YORK.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE OWNS 19 GOLF COURSES, WHICH

15:47.400 --> 15:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE HIS.

15:48.667 --> 15:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE HE'S GOTTEN INTO TROUBLE

15:51.600 --> 15:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS, HE HAS ISSUED THINGS SAYING,

15:52.733 --> 15:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"A DONALD TRUMP DEVELOPMENT,"

15:53.767 --> 15:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR "I'M A BUILDER.

15:54.700 --> 15:55.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE FOLLOW ME."

15:55.967 --> 15:57.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN, WHEN YOU FIND OUT

15:57.467 --> 16:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATER THAT A, HE'S ONLY LICENSED

16:00.267 --> 16:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE USE OF HIS NAME, AND HERE'S

16:01.267 --> 16:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REALLY BAD PART, LISA, YOU

16:02.433 --> 16:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECIDE TO PUT YOUR MONEY INTO A

16:03.700 --> 16:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILDING BECAUSE THE TRUMP NAME,

16:04.500 --> 16:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'LL BE A MORE VALUABLE

16:05.500 --> 16:06.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APARTMENT.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS THAT,

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, HE'S NOT ONLY, ONLY

16:09.400 --> 16:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LICENSED HIS NAME.

16:11.633 --> 16:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S RENEWAL CLAUSES AND HE

16:13.233 --> 16:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN TAKE HIS NAME OFF THE

16:14.067 --> 16:14.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILDING.

16:14.767 --> 16:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE COULD BUILD ONE RIGHT NEXT

16:15.833 --> 16:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOOR AND NOBODY TOLD YOU THAT.

16:16.967 --> 16:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S WHAT'S LED TO A LOT

16:18.233 --> 16:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF LITIGATION AGAINST DONALD

16:19.633 --> 16:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCUSING HIM OF CIVIL FRAUD.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: MR. TRUMP HAS

16:22.233 --> 16:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO SAID THAT THE TRUMP NAME,

16:24.433 --> 16:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS BRAND ITSELF IS WORTH A

16:25.600 --> 16:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILLION DOLLARS.

16:26.533 --> 16:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW BIG OF AN ASSET IS THAT FOR

16:27.300 --> 16:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM?

16:27.967 --> 16:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL

16:28.900 --> 16:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF HIS WEALTH.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE IS A PIONEER OF SELF-

16:31.033 --> 16:33.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROMOTION.

16:33.067 --> 16:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, AND OUR CULTURE HAS CHANGED

16:35.167 --> 16:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RADICALLY IN HIS LIFETIME.

16:37.633 --> 16:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WRITE ABOUT HOW IN THE '60s

16:41.033 --> 16:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN KIDS WERE ASKED WHAT THEY

16:42.400 --> 16:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANTED WHEN THEY GREW UP, THEY

16:43.733 --> 16:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID, "I'D LIKE TO HAVE A NICE

16:45.400 --> 16:46.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARRIAGE AND SOME KIDS AND BE

16:46.567 --> 16:48.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL-KNOWN IN MY COMMUNITY."

16:48.567 --> 16:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THE '70s, IT WAS, "I WANT TO

16:50.200 --> 16:52.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE RICH AND FAMOUS."

16:52.567 --> 16:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT RICH AND FAMOUS

16:53.667 --> 16:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSE HAS BECOME MORE INTENSE

16:54.600 --> 16:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS TIME HAS PASSED.

16:56.733 --> 16:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD LED THE WAY IN THIS.

16:58.533 --> 16:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS DOING SELFIES BEFORE

16:59.967 --> 17:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYBODY ELSE KNEW WHAT A SELFIE

17:01.233 --> 17:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS.

17:02.567 --> 17:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: WHAT IN HIS PAST

17:03.433 --> 17:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO YOU THINK INFORMS HIS

17:04.633 --> 17:05.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECISION TO MAKE STATEMENTS ON

17:05.867 --> 17:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT ARE VERY

17:06.700 --> 17:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROVERSIAL?

17:08.500 --> 17:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATEMENTS ABOUT MUSLIMS, FOR

17:09.600 --> 17:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLE, OR ABOUT MEXICANS?

17:11.133 --> 17:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK HE UNDERSTANDS WHO

17:12.400 --> 17:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARCHIE BUNKER IS.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD'S FROM QUEENS.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE KNOWS THE ANXIETIES OF PEOPLE

17:18.000 --> 17:19.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACING CHANGE AND HOW THEY

17:19.867 --> 17:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESENT THAT CHANGE.

17:21.967 --> 17:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T THINK THAT HE IS IN HIS

17:24.600 --> 17:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEART-- A SUPERFICIALLY RACIST

17:26.533 --> 17:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUY.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK HE KNOWS WHAT WILL

17:30.300 --> 17:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REVERBERATE WITH PEOPLE.

17:31.000 --> 17:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S WHERE I WOULD DISAGREE

17:31.833 --> 17:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH YOU, MICHAEL.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THE-- THE-- THE TRUMP

17:33.533 --> 17:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMILY HAS A LONG HISTORY OF

17:34.433 --> 17:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINDINGS OF RACIAL

17:35.400 --> 17:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCRIMINATION IN THE RENTAL OF

17:36.233 --> 17:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOUSING.

17:37.233 --> 17:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GOT AN

17:38.400 --> 17:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREEMENT WITH THEM.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS SOON AS THE SUPERVISION WAS

17:41.067 --> 17:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER, THEY WENT RIGHT BACK TO

17:42.400 --> 17:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CODING SO THAT BLACKS WERE NOT

17:43.600 --> 17:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE BUILDINGS.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DONALD TRIED TO DESCRIBE

WELFARE, WHEN THESE WERE PEOPLE

17:50.400 --> 17:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO HAD JOBS AND INCOMES.

17:51.100 --> 17:51.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY WERE BLACK.

17:51.767 --> 17:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DIDN'T WANT THEM IN THE

17:52.600 --> 17:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUILDINGS.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> DAVID IS RIGHT THAT IN THE

17:54.467 --> 17:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARLY '70s, THE FIRST THING, THE

17:55.600 --> 17:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST CHANCE HE GOT, HE-- HE

17:57.100 --> 17:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIED REVERSE RACISM WHEN THE

17:58.700 --> 18:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP ORGANIZATION WAS ACCUSED

18:00.400 --> 18:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF NOT RENTING TO MINORITIES.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HIS LAWYER CALLED THE FEDS

18:04.533 --> 18:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"GESTAPO" AND "STORM TROOPERS."

18:07.000 --> 18:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: THE TRUMP

18:07.833 --> 18:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN, OF COURSE, HAS SAID,

18:08.733 --> 18:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS

18:09.833 --> 18:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSISTED THAT HE'S NOT RACISM;

18:11.733 --> 18:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S JUST FIGHTING A CULTURE OF

18:12.633 --> 18:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I WANT TO TALK TO SOMETHING

18:15.167 --> 18:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELSE THAT GETS A LOT OF

18:16.267 --> 18:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTENTION IN DONALD TRUMP'S

18:17.400 --> 18:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESS CAREER.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S TALK ABOUT ATLANTIC CITY.

18:20.500 --> 18:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> DONALD NEVER HAD A DOLLAR

18:21.433 --> 18:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTED IN ATLANTIC CITY.

18:23.033 --> 18:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE BORROWED EVERY DOLLAR HE HAD.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN HIS OWN BOOK, "THE ART OF

18:25.767 --> 18:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEAL," HE BOASTS ABOUT HOW

18:27.933 --> 18:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE DECEIVED HIS PARTNERS, THE

18:29.667 --> 18:31.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARRAH'S COMPANY, HOLIDAY INNS,

18:31.767 --> 18:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE BUILDING OF THE FIRST

18:32.700 --> 18:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASINO.

18:33.900 --> 18:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: SOME OF HIS

18:34.633 --> 18:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASINOS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN

18:35.900 --> 18:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATLANTIC CITY... MOST OF THEM.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHO LOST IN THAT DEAL,

18:38.467 --> 18:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL?

18:40.133 --> 18:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OH, BOND HOLDERS.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT TRUMP STOCK.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS A TRUMP STOCK.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE, PEOPLE WHO WORKED IN

18:46.833 --> 18:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE FACILITIES, CONTRACTORS

18:47.667 --> 18:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO DIDN'T GET PAID.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE A LOT OF VICTIMS IN

18:49.333 --> 18:50.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS.

18:50.367 --> 18:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I DON'T THINK HE LOST A

18:51.133 --> 18:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENNY.

18:52.033 --> 18:53.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OH, HE MADE MONEY.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WITH DONALD, THERE HAVE BEEN

18:54.233 --> 18:55.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REAL VICTIMS.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, THIS TRUMP UNIVERSITY

18:57.467 --> 18:59.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING IS A TERRIBLE SCANDAL.

18:59.767 --> 19:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, I INTERVIEWED THE

19:01.400 --> 19:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO INVESTED UP TO

19:02.900 --> 19:04.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$35,000 TO BE EDUCATED BY DONALD

19:04.767 --> 19:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP, AND MANY OF THEM WERE

19:07.133 --> 19:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESSURED TO PUT THE MONEY ON

19:08.500 --> 19:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR CREDIT CARD.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S A REALLY SLIPPERY SLOPE,

19:12.733 --> 19:15.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK, FROM-- BEING TRICKY AND

19:15.267 --> 19:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRAFTY AND SUCKING MONEY OUT OF

19:19.233 --> 19:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATLANTIC CITY AND PROFITING ON

19:22.833 --> 19:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAMBLING; AND TRULY EXPLOITING

19:24.700 --> 19:27.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: ONE OVERALL THEME

19:29.000 --> 19:30.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT I CANNOT MISS IN THIS WHOLE

19:30.267 --> 19:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVERSATION IS DONALD TRUMP'S

19:32.033 --> 19:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABILITY TO ADAPT.

19:33.567 --> 19:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK TRUMP AND SOME OF HIS

19:34.833 --> 19:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTERS SAY, "MAYBE WE DON'T

19:36.467 --> 19:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE'S

19:38.233 --> 19:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO DO, BECAUSE WE KNOW

19:39.833 --> 19:42.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE'S ABLE TO ADAPT.

19:42.167 --> 19:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE IT'S OKAY THAT HE'S

19:43.400 --> 19:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGED HIS POSITION ON

19:44.500 --> 19:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABORTION, BECAUSE HE'S ADAPTED

19:45.933 --> 19:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WHAT THE VOTERS WANTED."

19:48.100 --> 19:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE IS SO ADAPTABLE THAT

19:49.867 --> 19:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S NOT REALLY A CORE THERE.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: BUT HE'S MAKING

19:53.100 --> 19:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ARGUMENT THAT IT IS NOT

19:54.433 --> 19:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT PROPOSALS BUT INSTEAD

19:55.533 --> 19:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT HIS OWN SKILLS AND

19:56.200 --> 19:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABILITIES.

19:57.067 --> 19:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, HE THINKS THAT HE IS

19:59.700 --> 20:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPREMELY GIFTED AT DECISION

20:01.233 --> 20:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKING AND LEADERSHIP.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK PEOPLE DO ADMIRE HIS

20:05.467 --> 20:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLEXIBILITY, HIS ADAPTIVE

20:06.833 --> 20:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUALITIES.

20:09.733 --> 20:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S GONE THROUGH THE TABLOID

20:12.000 --> 20:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESS ERA, THE TELEVISION ERA,

20:13.633 --> 20:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INTERNET ERA, THE SOCIAL

20:14.800 --> 20:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDIA ERA.

20:16.733 --> 20:18.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S MASTERED ALL OF THIS.

20:18.767 --> 20:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS BRAND BUILDING PROMOTIONAL

20:20.633 --> 20:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SKILL IS BREATHTAKING TO BEHOLD.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHETHER THAT REALLY TELLS US

20:25.200 --> 20:26.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT HOW HE'D

20:26.767 --> 20:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACT AS PRESIDENT, I THINK, IS

20:28.467 --> 20:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNCERTAIN.

20:29.467 --> 20:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, LISA, AS A BUSINESSMAN

20:31.133 --> 20:32.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS A TV HOST, HE CAN SAY,

20:32.767 --> 20:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"YOU'RE FIRED," AND GET RID OF

20:34.200 --> 20:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU, AND SAY, "I DON'T WANT TO

20:35.067 --> 20:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL WITH YOU."

20:36.400 --> 20:37.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

20:37.167 --> 20:38.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES DOESN'T HAVE THAT LUXURY.

20:38.267 --> 20:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS TO DEAL WITH FOREIGN

20:39.833 --> 20:42.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DICTATORS, WITH DEMOCRATICALLY

20:42.167 --> 20:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTED FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT

20:43.733 --> 20:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS NO CONTROL OVER.

20:44.900 --> 20:45.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS TO DEAL WITH CONGRESS,

20:45.967 --> 20:46.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH MAY NOT WANT TO DO WHAT HE

20:46.867 --> 20:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANTS TO DO.

20:48.133 --> 20:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE UNILATERAL

20:50.067 --> 20:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWER TO IMPOSE TARIFFS, WHICH

20:51.600 --> 20:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE A KIND OF TAX, TO BUILD A

20:53.633 --> 20:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALL, TO DO ALMOST ANY OF THE

20:55.500 --> 20:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DO,

20:57.800 --> 20:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE OUR CONSTITUTION DOESN'T

20:58.800 --> 21:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDE FOR THAT.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Desjardins: WHAT IN HIS PAST

21:01.400 --> 21:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS

21:02.767 --> 21:04.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLICATED MOMENT IN WORLD AND

21:04.067 --> 21:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL POLITICS?

21:06.033 --> 21:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE IS PRETTY RESILIENT.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S A VERY BUOYANT PERSON.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK HE'S LEARNED THAT THE

21:11.700 --> 21:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOMENT OF DEFEAT IS NOT

21:13.200 --> 21:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARILY PERMANENT.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN FACT, HE'S VERY GOOD AT

21:17.033 --> 21:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURNING WHAT THE REST OF US

21:19.233 --> 21:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD SEE AS A DEFEAT INTO A

21:20.400 --> 21:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VICTORY.

21:21.267 --> 21:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> DONALD'S VERY GOOD AT

21:22.133 --> 21:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOUNCING BACK.

21:23.233 --> 21:24.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN THINGS DON'T WORK OUT

21:24.767 --> 21:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY HE WANTED, MOVING

21:25.833 --> 21:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

21:26.933 --> 21:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU'VE GOT GIVE HIM CREDIT

21:27.700 --> 21:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THAT.

21:28.233 --> 21:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HE'S MADE HIMSELF A HOUSEHOLD

21:29.167 --> 21:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAME.

21:30.167 --> 21:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT HELPS YOU

21:31.133 --> 21:33.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS PRESIDENT, BUT BOUNCING BACK

21:33.067 --> 21:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, AND SHIFTING WHEN IT'S
