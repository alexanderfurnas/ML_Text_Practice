08:04.651 --> 08:12.384
EVERYTHING IT CAN AT THE

08:12.384 --> 08:13.289
PROBLEM.

08:13.289 --> 08:14.360
IT'S SPENT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS

08:14.360 --> 08:15.229
ON ACTUALLY BUYING SHARES TO

08:15.229 --> 08:16.068
KEEP THE PRICE UP.

08:16.068 --> 08:16.937
IT'S DEVALUED ITS CURRENCY,

08:16.937 --> 08:17.675
AND YESTERDAY'S QUARTER-PERCENT

08:17.675 --> 08:19.718
INTEREST RATE CUT WAS THE FIFTH

08:19.718 --> 08:20.251
THIS YEAR.

08:20.251 --> 08:21.291
NOTHING IS WORKING.

08:21.291 --> 08:27.048
>> IN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO

08:27.048 --> 08:27.384
IN THIS CASE, TRYING TO UP THE

08:27.384 --> 08:30.330
MARKET.

08:30.330 --> 08:31.971
THAT'S CHUCKING $485 BILLION

08:31.971 --> 08:34.481
INTO DIRECTLY BUYING SHARES AND

08:34.481 --> 08:35.419
TRYING TO PERSUADE PEOPLE

08:35.419 --> 08:42.349
THEY'LL STAND BEHIND THE MARKET

08:42.349 --> 08:44.559
AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

08:44.559 --> 08:47.840
CHEAP LOANS USED TO FUNDAMENTAL

08:47.840 --> 08:48.477
BUILDINGS, PUBLIC MONEY, MASSIVE

08:48.477 --> 08:53.129
INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING.

08:53.129 --> 08:54.469
THE PLAN WAS THE MIDDLE CLASS

08:54.469 --> 08:56.980
PROFIT FROM STOCK MARKET GAINS

08:56.980 --> 08:59.323
AND TAKE OVER FROM DRIVING

08:59.323 --> 09:00.663
GROWTH.

09:00.663 --> 09:01.700
BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

09:01.700 --> 09:02.504
NOW, CHINESE PEOPLE FACE THE

09:02.504 --> 09:05.450
DOUBLE NIGHTMARE OF SLOWING REAL

09:05.450 --> 09:06.421
ECONOMY AND FINANCIAL MELTDOWN.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.526
>> Woodruff: WE TURN NOW TO TWO

09:07.526 --> 09:09.334
PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW EVENTS IN

09:09.334 --> 09:10.371
CHINA CLOSELY: NICHOLAS LARDY IS

09:10.371 --> 09:14.323
AN ECONOMIST AND A SENIOR FELLOW

09:14.323 --> 09:15.260
AT THE PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR

09:15.260 --> 09:16.297
INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS.

09:16.297 --> 09:17.503
HE HAS WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS

09:17.503 --> 09:18.641
ON CHINA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH,

09:18.641 --> 09:19.947
INCLUDING, MOST RECENTLY,

09:19.947 --> 09:21.587
"MARKETS OVER MAO: THE RISE OF

09:21.587 --> 09:22.927
PRIVATE BUSINESS IN CHINA."

09:22.927 --> 09:24.835
AND EVAN OSNOS, AUTHOR OF THE

09:24.835 --> 09:27.245
BOOK "AGE OF AMBITION: CHASING

09:27.245 --> 09:27.915
FORTUNE, TRUTH AND FAITH IN THE

09:27.915 --> 09:28.652
NEW CHINA."

09:28.652 --> 09:34.109
HE'S ALSO A WRITER FOR "THE NEW

09:34.109 --> 09:34.712
YORKER" MAGAZINE.

09:34.712 --> 09:35.147
WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU.

09:35.147 --> 09:35.783
>> THANK YOU.

09:35.783 --> 09:36.753
>> Woodruff: NICK, LET ME

09:36.753 --> 09:37.692
START WITH YOU.

09:37.692 --> 09:39.398
YOU WROTE IN THE "NEW YORK

09:39.398 --> 09:41.240
TIMES" TODAY ALL THIS TALK ABOUT

09:41.240 --> 09:43.516
CHINA BEING IN AN ECONOMIC AND

09:43.516 --> 09:43.851
FINANCIAL MELTDOWN IS JUST

09:43.851 --> 09:47.266
WRONG.

09:47.266 --> 09:48.170
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT?

09:48.170 --> 09:48.639
>> THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T SUPPORT

09:48.639 --> 09:50.113
IT YET.

09:50.113 --> 09:51.250
THEY COULD BE HEADING IN THAT

09:51.250 --> 09:52.556
DIRECTION IHE

09:52.556 --> 09:54.766
MONTHS OR QUARTERS, BUT THE

09:54.766 --> 09:57.980
ECONOMY IS ACTUALLY GROWING

09:57.980 --> 09:59.821
REASONABLY WELL, ABOUT 7%,

09:59.821 --> 10:01.529
CONSUMPTION DEMAND IS FAIRLY

10:01.529 --> 10:03.872
STRONG, INCOMES AND WAGES ARE

10:03.872 --> 10:05.815
GROWING ABOUT 10% PER YEAR.

10:05.815 --> 10:08.057
THE SERVICE SECTOR IS THE BIG

10:08.057 --> 10:10.702
DRIVER OF ITS GROWTH, SO IT

10:10.702 --> 10:12.342
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE AN ECONOMY

10:12.342 --> 10:13.380
THAT'S GOING OVER THE CLIFF AS

10:13.380 --> 10:14.184
SOME HAVE ANTICIPATED.

10:14.184 --> 10:15.724
>> Woodruff: WHAT DO YOU THINK

10:15.724 --> 10:17.565
IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

10:17.565 --> 10:19.273
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT'S

10:19.273 --> 10:20.713
HAPPENING IS MOSTLY A MAJOR

10:20.713 --> 10:23.090
CORRECTION IN EQUITY PRICES.

10:23.090 --> 10:23.894
THE PRICES GOT WAY AHEAD IN THE

10:23.894 --> 10:25.634
YEAR TO THE PEAK.

10:25.634 --> 10:27.643
THE PEAK WAS IN JUNE SIX WEEKS

10:27.643 --> 10:33.770
OR SO AGO, AND IN SHANGHAI,

10:33.770 --> 10:35.310
PRICES WERE UP 150%, IN THE SHUN

10:35.310 --> 10:37.117
JUNG MARKETS, THEY WERE UP BY

10:37.117 --> 10:40.198
EVEN MORE.

10:40.198 --> 10:41.302
PRICES WERE IN THE STRATOSPHERE.

10:41.302 --> 10:44.450
A LOT OF LEVERAGE.

10:44.450 --> 10:44.784
PEOPLE BORROWED MONEY TO BUY

10:44.784 --> 10:46.090
STOCKS.

10:46.090 --> 10:48.132
PEOPLE WERE REQUIRED TO SHARE

10:48.132 --> 10:50.376
THE SELLS OR THE BROKERS SOLD

10:50.376 --> 10:51.681
THEM FOR THEM, SO YOU HAD A BIG

10:51.681 --> 10:53.154
DOWNWARD, SHARP DECLINE IN

10:53.154 --> 10:56.201
EQUITY PRICES.

10:56.201 --> 10:57.205
BUT THE EQUITY -- YOU KNOW,

10:57.205 --> 10:58.845
PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO WHICH IS A

10:58.845 --> 11:01.189
VERY COMMON MEASURE IS STILL WAY

11:01.189 --> 11:01.457
AHEAD OF WHAT IT WOULD BE IN THE

11:01.457 --> 11:03.131
U.S.

11:03.131 --> 11:05.274
IN THE CHINA MARKET IT'S ABOUT

11:05.274 --> 11:08.287
39, FOR EXAMPLE.

11:08.287 --> 11:09.660
SO THIS WAS AN OVERHEATED MARKET

11:09.660 --> 11:10.530
THAT WAS GOING TO CORRECT SOONER

11:10.530 --> 11:12.405
OR LATER.

11:12.405 --> 11:12.673
>> Woodruff: IT'S STILL GOING

11:12.673 --> 11:14.950
ON.

11:14.950 --> 11:17.695
EVAN OSNOS, YOU WERE BASED THERE

11:17.695 --> 11:18.933
FOR YEARS AND STILL STAY CLOSE

11:18.933 --> 11:21.678
WITH THOSE IN CHINA.

11:21.678 --> 11:23.922
HOW DO THEY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:23.922 --> 11:25.328
>> WE'RE SO USED TO ECONOMIC

11:25.328 --> 11:26.968
GROWTH, BOTH THOSE OF US HERE

11:26.968 --> 11:28.743
AND PEOPLE IN CHINA, THAT WHEN

11:28.743 --> 11:31.254
WE SEE THIS KIND OF TURMOIL AS

11:31.254 --> 11:31.589
IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, IT FEELS

11:31.589 --> 11:32.694
RADICAL.

11:32.694 --> 11:34.234
WE HAVE TO SEPARATE IN SOME

11:34.234 --> 11:35.807
SENSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE

11:35.807 --> 11:36.978
STOCK MARKET AND WHAT'S GOING ON

11:36.978 --> 11:38.853
IN THE BROADER ECONOMY.

11:38.853 --> 11:40.964
IN THE BROADER ECONOMY, WE'RE IN

11:40.964 --> 11:41.901
THE MIDST OF A MAJOR

11:41.901 --> 11:42.670
TRANSFORMATION AND IT'S A LIKELY

11:42.670 --> 11:44.043
HARD THING TO DO.

11:44.043 --> 11:46.822
I THINK THE REPORT MENTIONED IN

11:46.822 --> 11:48.429
THE LEAD-IN, CHINA FOR 30 YEARS,

11:48.429 --> 11:50.271
THEY SUCCEEDED ON A CERTAIN

11:50.271 --> 11:51.810
RECIPE, WHICH WAS EXPORTS,

11:51.810 --> 11:53.652
SENDING THINGS TO US HERE AND

11:53.652 --> 11:54.121
BUILDING THINGS AT HOME,

11:54.121 --> 11:56.196
INFRASTRUCTURE.

11:56.196 --> 11:59.645
THAT RECIPE RUN ITS COURSE.

11:59.645 --> 12:01.285
THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE TO AN

12:01.285 --> 12:01.686
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ECONOMIC

12:01.686 --> 12:03.830
CHAPTER.

12:03.830 --> 12:06.039
CHINESE APPLE OR GOOGLE,

12:06.039 --> 12:08.015
SOMETHING THAT CAN UNLEASH POWER

12:08.015 --> 12:08.617
AND PUT MONEY IN THE HANDS OF

12:08.617 --> 12:10.124
ORDINARY PEOPLE.

12:10.124 --> 12:11.564
DOING THAT IS DIFFICULT AND

12:11.564 --> 12:11.865
WE'RE SEEING THE TURMOIL OVER

12:11.865 --> 12:12.801
THAT.

12:12.801 --> 12:13.941
>> Woodruff: WHY HAS IT BEEN

12:13.941 --> 12:14.610
SO HARD FOR THE LEADERSHIP TO

12:14.610 --> 12:15.849
GET IT RIGHT?

12:15.849 --> 12:17.087
>> THERE ARE SHORT-TERM REASONS

12:17.087 --> 12:18.828
TO WANT TO GO SLOWLY.

12:18.828 --> 12:21.072
FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU'RE ONE OF

12:21.072 --> 12:23.114
THE PEOPLE WHO SUCCEEDS UNDER

12:23.114 --> 12:24.453
THE CURRENT SYSTEM, A

12:24.453 --> 12:25.558
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE OR

12:25.558 --> 12:26.797
PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT THAT

12:26.797 --> 12:29.240
BUILDS BRIDGES, YOU HAVE A LOT

12:29.240 --> 12:30.580
OF REASONS TO WANT TO PUT THE

12:30.580 --> 12:32.187
BRAKES ON REFORM.

12:32.187 --> 12:33.560
WE ASSUME THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP

12:33.560 --> 12:34.832
IS ONE MONOLITHIC GROUP.

12:34.832 --> 12:37.711
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

12:37.711 --> 12:39.619
VOICE IN THERE AND A LOT OF

12:39.619 --> 12:41.360
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, WELL, LET'S

12:41.360 --> 12:44.407
TRY TO SLOW DOWN AND KEEP THE

12:44.407 --> 12:46.047
MARKET FROM COLLAPSING.

12:46.047 --> 12:47.487
>> Woodruff: TO WHAT EXTENT

12:47.487 --> 12:50.835
HAVE THEY MADE A DECISION TO TRY

12:50.835 --> 12:52.174
TO TURN THIS MONOLITHIC ECONOMY

12:52.174 --> 12:55.121
WHICH IS IN TRANSITION AROUND

12:55.121 --> 12:56.895
AND MOVE TOWARD SOME REFORMS

12:56.895 --> 12:58.703
THAT YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT?

12:58.703 --> 13:00.544
>> WELL, IN PRINCIPLE, THEY'VE

13:00.544 --> 13:04.328
MADE DECISIONS TO CHANGE TO A

13:04.328 --> 13:04.629
NEW GROWTH MODEL, AS EVAN HAS

13:04.629 --> 13:05.533
SAID.

13:05.533 --> 13:06.437
IN PRACTICE, IT'S DIFFICULT TO

13:06.437 --> 13:07.675
CARRY OUT.

13:07.675 --> 13:09.015
THEY'VE MADE PROGRESS.

13:09.015 --> 13:10.152
CONSUMPTION HAS BECOME A MORE

13:10.152 --> 13:11.157
IMPORTANT DRIVER OF ECONOMIC

13:11.157 --> 13:12.363
GROWTH, AS OPPOSED TO BUILDING

13:12.363 --> 13:14.304
MORE PROPERTY AND

13:14.304 --> 13:16.547
INFRASTRUCTURE.

13:16.547 --> 13:17.586
AND MORE MONEY IS FILTERING INTO

13:17.586 --> 13:19.627
THE HANDS OF PEOPLE AND YOU SEE

13:19.627 --> 13:21.536
A HUGE INCREASE IN EXPENDITURES

13:21.536 --> 13:24.114
ON SERVICES, PEOPLE ARE SPENDING

13:24.114 --> 13:26.424
A LOT OF MONEY ON EDUCATION,

13:26.424 --> 13:28.266
HEALTHCARE, ENTERTAINMENT,

13:28.266 --> 13:29.604
TRAVEL HAS BECOME A BIG PART OF

13:29.604 --> 13:32.852
THE ECONOMY, SO WE'RE MOVING

13:32.852 --> 13:34.794
AWAY FROM THE INDUSTRIAL BASED

13:34.794 --> 13:37.673
GROWTH THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR

13:37.673 --> 13:38.778
SO LONG TOWARDS THIS MORE

13:38.778 --> 13:40.519
CONSUMPTION-DRIVEN MODEL.

13:40.519 --> 13:41.959
BUT IT'S CHALLENGING AND THEY'VE

13:41.959 --> 13:43.900
MADE SOME PROGRESS OVER THE LAST

13:43.900 --> 13:46.646
FEW YEARS, BUT THERE IS STILL A

13:46.646 --> 13:48.253
SUBSTANTIAL WAY TO GO.

13:48.253 --> 13:49.994
>> Woodruff: WHAT IS IT

13:49.994 --> 13:50.663
THOUGHT, EVAN OSNOS, THAT THE

13:50.663 --> 13:52.839
LEADERSHIP WANTS?

13:52.839 --> 13:54.580
HOW OFTEN ARE THEY WILLING TO GO

13:54.580 --> 13:55.450
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR A FACT

13:55.450 --> 13:56.723
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT BECAUSE

13:56.723 --> 13:58.062
THERE WAS A LOT OF SPECULATION

13:58.062 --> 14:01.041
LAST WEEK THAT THIS WAS AN

14:01.041 --> 14:02.951
EFFORT TO SHORE THINGS UP IN

14:02.951 --> 14:05.595
SHORT-TERM AND NOT AT ALL

14:05.595 --> 14:06.834
EVIDENT THEY'RE COMMITTED TO

14:06.834 --> 14:07.838
REFORM.

14:07.838 --> 14:09.579
>> XI JINPING, HEAD OF THE

14:09.579 --> 14:11.822
CHINESE PARTY AND MILITARY, HAS

14:11.822 --> 14:13.161
STAKED HIS NAME AND REPUTATION

14:13.161 --> 14:15.806
INTERNALLY AND ABROAD SAYING I'M

14:15.806 --> 14:16.140
GOING TO TRANSFORM THE ECONOMIC

14:16.140 --> 14:18.551
ELD.

14:18.551 --> 14:22.235
YOU KNOW HE'S ENCOUNTERING

14:22.235 --> 14:23.640
RESISTANCE BECAUSE HE SAYS I AM

14:23.640 --> 14:25.582
ENCOUNTERING FIERCE RESISTANCE,

14:25.582 --> 14:27.524
TO SAY WE ARE IN A FIGHT.

14:27.524 --> 14:28.863
THAT TELLS US THERE ARE SERIOUS

14:28.863 --> 14:30.370
CONFLICTS GOING ON INSIDE

14:30.370 --> 14:32.814
CHINESE POLITICS.

14:32.814 --> 14:34.588
PEOPLE WHO SAY LET'S NOT MOVE

14:34.588 --> 14:35.392
TOO FAST OR WE'LL UNDERMINE ALL

14:35.392 --> 14:36.999
WE HAVE.

14:36.999 --> 14:39.040
SO I THINK YOU'RE SEEING LESS

14:39.040 --> 14:40.682
SECOND THOUGHTS AMONG THE

14:40.682 --> 14:42.021
LEADERSHIP THAN IT IS A REAL WAR

14:42.021 --> 14:43.360
WITHIN TO FIGURE OUT HOW FAST

14:43.360 --> 14:44.063
AND FAR YOU CAN GO.

14:44.063 --> 14:44.867
>> Woodruff: HOW DOES THAT

14:44.867 --> 14:46.608
PLAY OUT?

14:46.608 --> 14:47.780
IF THIS IS AN INTERNAL DEBATE,

14:47.780 --> 14:51.295
AND THERE IS EVERY EVIDENCE THAT

14:51.295 --> 14:53.236
IT IS, NICK LARDY, HOW DO YOU

14:53.236 --> 14:56.384
SEE THIS MOVING FORWARD?

14:56.384 --> 14:59.262
>> I AGREE WITH EVAN, IT'S A

14:59.262 --> 15:00.469
CONFLICT BETWEEN THOSE WHO WANT

15:00.469 --> 15:02.209
TO MAINTAIN CONTROL AND THOSE

15:02.209 --> 15:02.544
WHO WANT TO RELY MORE ON THE

15:02.544 --> 15:04.151
MARKET.

15:04.151 --> 15:06.293
SO THAT'S THE TUSSLE.

15:06.293 --> 15:07.800
THE EVIDENCE IS AS THEY'VE

15:07.800 --> 15:09.206
RELIED MORE ON THE MARKET OVER

15:09.206 --> 15:10.345
THE LAST DECADES, THEIR ECONOMY

15:10.345 --> 15:12.655
HAS BEEN GROWING STRONGLY.

15:12.655 --> 15:14.362
I THINK AS THEY DEBASEMENT THIS,

15:14.362 --> 15:15.969
THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO GO

15:15.969 --> 15:17.609
FOR CONTROL OVER THE MARKET.

15:17.609 --> 15:19.150
ATTEND OF THE DAY, THE PARTY

15:19.150 --> 15:21.459
NEEDS TO HAVE REASONABLY STRONG

15:21.459 --> 15:23.302
GROWTH TO REMAIN IN POWER, AND

15:23.302 --> 15:25.745
THEY RECOGNIZE ULTIMATELY THAT

15:25.745 --> 15:28.692
THE MARKET IS WHAT'S GOING TO

15:28.692 --> 15:29.629
DELIVER THAT GROWTH, NOT

15:29.629 --> 15:32.174
TRADITIONAL STATE ENTERPRISES

15:32.174 --> 15:33.478
AND A HEAVY-HANDED GOVERNMENT

15:33.478 --> 15:35.455
INTERVENTION IN THE MARKETS.

15:35.455 --> 15:36.759
>> Woodruff: SO EVAN OSNOS,

15:36.759 --> 15:39.404
WHAT'S GOING TO BE DRIVING THE

15:39.404 --> 15:41.681
THINKING OF THE LEADERSHIP OF

15:41.681 --> 15:43.087
CHINA IN THE COMING MONTHS?

15:43.087 --> 15:44.427
>> XI JINPING IS COMING NEXT

15:44.427 --> 15:46.569
MONTH, THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE

15:46.569 --> 15:47.574
THINGS ARE AS STABLE AS THEY CAN

15:47.574 --> 15:48.612
WHEN HE COMES.

15:48.612 --> 15:51.658
WE SOMETIMES THINK THE CHINESE

15:51.658 --> 15:53.266
GOVERNMENT IS IMPERVIOUS TO ITS

15:53.266 --> 15:55.107
OWN PUBLIC OPINION.

15:55.107 --> 15:57.049
IT'S AN AUTHORITARIAN GOVERNMENT

15:57.049 --> 15:57.351
AND DON'T HAVE ELECTIONS LIKE WE

15:57.351 --> 15:58.789
HAVE.

15:58.789 --> 16:00.329
THE TRUTH IS THEY'RE VERY

16:00.329 --> 16:01.234
SENSITIVE AND SOMETIMES VERY

16:01.234 --> 16:03.578
AFRAID PUBLIC OPINION.

16:03.578 --> 16:05.118
THEY KNOW A DISSATISFIED PUBLIC

16:05.118 --> 16:06.557
IS PRECURSOR TO POLITICAL AND

16:06.557 --> 16:08.096
SOCIAL UNREST.

16:08.096 --> 16:09.403
SO THEY CAN LOOK OVER THE

16:09.403 --> 16:11.946
HORIZON AND SAY, IF WE CONTINUE

16:11.946 --> 16:13.586
ON THIS ECONOMY PATH, WE'LL

16:13.586 --> 16:15.128
STALL ECONOMICALLY AND GET

16:15.128 --> 16:16.534
TRAPPED IN THE MIDDLE INCOME

16:16.534 --> 16:18.676
TRAP, MEANING WE WON'T BE ABLE

16:18.676 --> 16:20.217
TO MAKE THE FINAL LEAP TO BEING

16:20.217 --> 16:21.890
A FULLY ADVANCED COUNTRY, AND

16:21.890 --> 16:23.999
THAT IS THE REAL RISK FOR THEM

16:23.999 --> 16:27.448
OVER THE LONG TERM POLITICALLY.

16:27.448 --> 16:29.925
THERTHERE'S THE SHORT TERM POLIL

16:29.925 --> 16:32.537
INSTABILITY THEY'RE TRYING TO

16:32.537 --> 16:34.479
AVOID BY A STOCK MARKET CRASH.

16:34.479 --> 16:37.425
THEY KNOW THEY'RE FALLING SHORT

16:37.425 --> 16:38.095
OF MAKING THE REFORMS THEY'RE

16:38.095 --> 16:39.769
TRYING TO MAKE.

16:39.769 --> 16:41.811
>> Woodruff: THANK YOU FOR

16:41.811 --> 16:46.030
HELPING US UNDERSTAND BETTER,

16:46.030 --> 16:46.298
EVAN OSNOS, NICK LARDY, THANK

16:46.298 --> 16:56.676
YOU.

16:56.676 --> 16:58.283
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16:58.283 --> 16:59.455
>> Ifill: NOW, WE TURN TO OUR

16:59.455 --> 17:00.693
WEEKLONG SERIES ON HOW NEW

17:00.693 --> 17:02.166
ORLEANS IS FARING AFTER KATRINA,

17:02.166 --> 17:03.807
TEN YEARS LATER.

17:03.807 --> 17:04.845
THE FLOODWATERS THAT ROSE AFTER

17:04.845 --> 17:05.883
THE STORM TRAPPED HUNDREDS OF

17:05.883 --> 17:07.858
PATIENTS IN THE CITY'S

17:07.858 --> 17:09.833
HOSPITALS.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.305
MORE THAN 140 OF THEM DIED IN A

17:11.305 --> 17:13.147
SLOW MOTION EVACUATION THAT TOOK

17:13.147 --> 17:14.487
DAYS.

17:14.487 --> 17:16.429
THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE

17:16.429 --> 17:16.496
WHEN OFFICIALS DECLARED THE

17:16.496 --> 17:20.881
MUCH-LOVED STATE-RUN CHARITY

17:20.881 --> 17:23.290
HOSPITAL UNFIT TO RE-OPEN.

17:23.290 --> 17:25.101
A MAJOR NEW HOSPITAL WAS

17:25.101 --> 17:26.573
DEDICATED IN NEW ORLEANS TODAY--

17:26.573 --> 17:27.945
A CRUCIAL PART OF A REIMAGINED

17:27.945 --> 17:29.352
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

17:29.352 --> 17:30.792
BUT WORRIES REMAIN THAT SOME

17:30.792 --> 17:32.365
WILL STILL BE LEFT BEHIND.

17:32.365 --> 17:39.496
SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT JACKIE

17:39.496 --> 17:40.132
JUDD HAS OUR REPORT.

17:40.132 --> 17:40.869
HURRICANE KATRINA AND ALL

17:40.869 --> 17:43.212
THAT THE WIND, THE RAIN, THE

17:43.212 --> 17:45.054
FLOODING DESTROYED OR DISABLED

17:45.054 --> 17:47.296
ALLOWED FOR A REIMAGINING OF

17:47.296 --> 17:49.306
WHAT A MODERN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

17:49.306 --> 17:51.984
IN NEW ORLEANS WOULD LOOK LIKE.

17:51.984 --> 17:55.265
THIS IS THE CENTERPIECE OF THAT

17:55.265 --> 17:56.134
REIMAGINING.

17:56.134 --> 17:58.379
>> UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

17:58.379 --> 18:00.421
NEW ORLEANS IS A PLACE TO HEAL,

18:00.421 --> 18:03.165
TEACH AND DISCOVER FOR

18:03.165 --> 18:03.903
GENERATIONS TO COME.

18:03.903 --> 18:07.050
U.N.C. NEW ORLEANS, THE FUTURE

18:07.050 --> 18:08.055
OF HEALTHCARE IS HERE.

18:08.055 --> 18:11.134
>> UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER WAS

18:11.134 --> 18:11.837
A DECADE IN THE MAKING AT A COST

18:11.837 --> 18:13.980
EXCEEDING $1 BILLION.

18:13.980 --> 18:14.917
MOST OF THAT FROM THE FEDERAL

18:14.917 --> 18:18.166
GOVERNMENT.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.007
THE DOORS RECENTLY OPENED TO A

18:20.007 --> 18:26.937
HIGH-TECH TRAUMA CENTER,

18:26.937 --> 18:28.778
EXPENSIVE ARTWORK AND WHAT'S HUF

18:28.778 --> 18:33.465
WINDOWS AND INTERNAL SYSTEMS.

18:33.465 --> 18:36.378
EARLY REVIEWS ARE IN.

18:36.378 --> 18:38.320
>> NEW INNERSIDE, CLEAN.

18:38.320 --> 18:38.688
ORLEANS NEEDS A GOOD

18:38.688 --> 18:39.960
HOSPITAL.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.300
>> CHARITY WAS A GOOD HOSPITAL.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.839
IN THE DAY WHEN I WAS GROWING

18:42.839 --> 18:44.380
UP, IT WAS A GOOD HOSPITAL, BUT

18:44.380 --> 18:46.823
THIS IS WAY BETTER.

18:46.823 --> 18:50.673
>> ACTUALLY BUILT OUT FOR

18:50.673 --> 18:51.076
REDUNDANCY FOR ONE PATIENT INTO

18:51.076 --> 18:53.453
SOMETHING --

18:53.453 --> 18:54.993
>> IN CASE OF A STORM?

18:54.993 --> 18:56.600
.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.306
DR. PETER W. WHO WORKED AT

18:58.306 --> 19:00.048
CHARITY HOSPITAL THEN IN

19:00.048 --> 19:01.588
MAKESHIFT TENTS, A CONVERTED

19:01.588 --> 19:02.826
DEPARTMENT FOR AND FINALLY THE

19:02.826 --> 19:06.175
INTERIM HOSPITAL IS PROUD OF

19:06.175 --> 19:08.719
WHAT THE CITY HAS BUILT.

19:08.719 --> 19:10.761
THIS HOSPITAL'S AIM, HE SAYS, IS

19:10.761 --> 19:15.314
TWOFOLD -- SERVE THE POOR AS

19:15.314 --> 19:15.716
CHARITY DID, AND THOSE WHO PAY

19:15.716 --> 19:17.056
FULL PRICE.

19:17.056 --> 19:20.035
>> THE VISION OF THIS HOSPITAL

19:20.035 --> 19:21.542
IS NOT TO BE SOLELY AN INDIGENT

19:21.542 --> 19:22.614
CARE OR SAFETY NET HOSPITAL.

19:22.614 --> 19:24.923
THAT'S A VITAL PORTION OF WHAT

19:24.923 --> 19:26.464
WE DO, BUT SUSTAINABILITY OF

19:26.464 --> 19:26.530
THIS HOSPITAL WILL BE DIRECTLY

19:26.530 --> 19:30.214
LINKED IN OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT

19:30.214 --> 19:32.155
ALL PAYERS.

19:32.155 --> 19:33.695
WHAT'S NEW AND EXCITING IS

19:33.695 --> 19:35.838
BUILDING DESTINATION SERVICES.

19:35.838 --> 19:39.085
SO SERVICES THAT ALLOW US TO

19:39.085 --> 19:40.424
COMPETE WITH THE HOUSTON OR

19:40.424 --> 19:43.371
BIRMINGHAM, TO KEEP REGIONAL

19:43.371 --> 19:44.576
PATIENTS HERE AT HOME.

19:44.576 --> 19:47.154
>> FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE NEW

19:47.154 --> 19:48.426
HOSPITAL, WHAT CAME BEFORE IS IN

19:48.426 --> 19:52.812
CLEAR SIGHT.

19:52.812 --> 19:54.753
CHARITY HOSPITAL HOLDS A STORIED

19:54.753 --> 19:55.891
PLACE IN THE CITY'S HISTORY

19:55.891 --> 19:57.833
BECAUSE IT'S WHERE GENERATIONS

19:57.833 --> 19:59.073
OF RESIDENTS CAME FOR CARE

19:59.073 --> 20:00.278
REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO

20:00.278 --> 20:01.618
PAY AND, FOR MANY, THE MEASURE

20:01.618 --> 20:04.764
OF SUCCESS AT THE NEW HOSPITAL

20:04.764 --> 20:05.133
IS WHETHER THAT TRADITION WILL

20:05.133 --> 20:08.749
CONTINUE.

20:08.749 --> 20:09.083
>> AND WE PUT THAT TOGETHER LONG

20:09.083 --> 20:11.728
BEFORE.

20:11.728 --> 20:15.612
>> THIS WAS IN CHARITY?

20:15.612 --> 20:18.290
YES.

20:18.290 --> 20:19.730
SYLVIANA HISTORY WORKED AS A

20:19.730 --> 20:20.667
NURSE'S AID AND HEALED THERE AS

20:20.667 --> 20:21.772
A PATIENT.

20:21.772 --> 20:23.714
>> EVERY TIME I PASS THERE I

20:23.714 --> 20:26.860
THINK ABOUT CHARITY BECAUSE

20:26.860 --> 20:27.596
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IN

20:27.596 --> 20:30.544
NEW ORLEANS IS CHARITY.

20:30.544 --> 20:32.486
>> THIS HOSPITAL WAS RUN BY A

20:32.486 --> 20:36.035
NONPROFIT PRIVATE COMPANY ADDING

20:36.035 --> 20:37.339
THAT CHARITY'S SERVING THE

20:37.339 --> 20:38.177
PUBLIC NO MATTER THE COST WILL

20:38.177 --> 20:39.482
BE LOST.

20:39.482 --> 20:44.504
UNIVERSITY IS REQUIRED TO HAVE

20:44.504 --> 20:46.513
20% OF UNINSURED IN ITS PATIENT

20:46.513 --> 20:46.848
MIX, CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN

20:46.848 --> 20:47.953
CHARITY.

20:47.953 --> 20:49.628
BUT OFFICIALS PROMISE TO GIVE

20:49.628 --> 20:57.729
CARE TO THOSE WHO NEED IT.

20:57.729 --> 21:00.473
(SINGING)

21:00.473 --> 21:02.282
>> COMMUNITY ACTIVIST JACQUES

21:02.282 --> 21:04.056
ORGANIZED A LAWSUIT TO GET

21:04.056 --> 21:05.261
CHARITY BACK UP AND RUNNING.

21:05.261 --> 21:06.869
>> WORKING FOR PEOPLE WHO

21:06.869 --> 21:14.000
TRUSTED CHARITY TO TAKE GOOD

21:14.000 --> 21:16.242
CARE OF THEM AND REASSEMBLING

21:16.242 --> 21:17.884
THE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL FOR

21:17.884 --> 21:20.930
PATIENTS WITH THE TEAMWORK AND

21:20.930 --> 21:21.533
KNOW HOW IS NOT LIKE ASSEMBLING

21:21.533 --> 21:25.316
LEGGOS.

21:25.316 --> 21:26.154
IT TAKES LOTS OF TIME, WORK AND

21:26.154 --> 21:27.660
MONEY.

21:27.660 --> 21:29.368
>> DR. W. WHO ONCE ARGUED FOR

21:29.368 --> 21:31.609
THE OLD HOSPITAL TO REOPEN NOW

21:31.609 --> 21:33.685
SAYS THE QUALITY OF CARE AT

21:33.685 --> 21:34.691
CHARITY HAS BEEN ROMANTICIZED

21:34.691 --> 21:37.235
AND CONCERNS ABOUT THE NEW

21:37.235 --> 21:39.780
HOSPITAL ARE UNFOUNDED.

21:39.780 --> 21:44.266
IF YOU ARE SO CONVINCED OF THE

21:44.266 --> 21:45.806
SUCCESS OF THIS MODEL, WHAT DID

21:45.806 --> 21:46.944
YOU FIGHT HARD TO TRY TO KEEP

21:46.944 --> 21:49.990
CHARITY OPEN?

21:49.990 --> 21:52.535
>> SO WHAT I TRIED HARD TO DO

21:52.535 --> 21:54.042
WAS TO KEEP OPEN A FACILITY THAT

21:54.042 --> 21:56.620
WOULD MEET ON THE SAFETY CARE

21:56.620 --> 21:58.763
NEEDS OF OUR POPULATION, AND I

21:58.763 --> 22:02.412
WOU CONLDTINUE THAT FIGHT TODAY

22:02.412 --> 22:02.779
IF WE WALKED AWAY FROM THAT

22:02.779 --> 22:05.357
MISSION.

22:05.357 --> 22:05.659
THAT'S AS STRONG AS ITS EVER

22:05.659 --> 22:07.334
BEEN.

22:07.334 --> 22:09.140
>> WHAT WE HOPE FOR YOU TO DO

22:09.140 --> 22:09.776
BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT

22:09.776 --> 22:11.083
VISIT --

22:11.083 --> 22:12.724
>> THE OTHER HALF OF THE

22:12.724 --> 22:14.262
REIMAGINING IS AN EXTENSIVE

22:14.262 --> 22:14.631
NETWORK OF COMMUNITY HEALTH

22:14.631 --> 22:19.452
CENTERS.

22:19.452 --> 22:20.357
THE CLINICS DOT POOR AND WORKING

22:20.357 --> 22:24.442
NEIGHBORHOODS THROUGHOUT THE

22:24.442 --> 22:27.488
CITY AND PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE.

22:27.488 --> 22:30.133
DR. KAREN DESALVO WORKED AT A

22:30.133 --> 22:30.468
POP-UP CLINIC NEAR THE FRENCH

22:30.468 --> 22:32.309
QUARTER.

22:32.309 --> 22:33.113
LEADER AS THE CITY'S HEALTH

22:33.113 --> 22:34.552
COMMISSIONER, SHE DROVE THE

22:34.552 --> 22:35.891
EFFORT TO BUILD PERMANENT

22:35.891 --> 22:37.298
CLINICS WHERE PEOPLE LIVE.

22:37.298 --> 22:38.034
>> BECAUSE THE HEALTHCARE

22:38.034 --> 22:39.841
INFRASTRUCTURE WENT DOWN, IT

22:39.841 --> 22:41.081
CAUSED MANY OF US TO LITERALLY

22:41.081 --> 22:43.022
STAND ON THE STREET AND SAY WE

22:43.022 --> 22:45.465
CAN DO BETTER, WE CAN COME UP

22:45.465 --> 22:46.404
OFF OUR KNEES AND BUILD A SYSTEM

22:46.404 --> 22:47.508
THAT'S GOING TO MEET THE NEEDS

22:47.508 --> 22:48.915
OF THIS COMMUNITY.

22:48.915 --> 22:50.288
LOOKING AT THE EVIDENCE AND

22:50.288 --> 22:52.296
LISTENING TO PEOPLE THAT WHAT

22:52.296 --> 22:54.138
THEY WANTED WAS FRONT LINE

22:54.138 --> 22:55.777
ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE AND

22:55.777 --> 22:56.548
PRIMARY CARE IN NEIGHBORHOODS.

22:56.548 --> 22:59.327
>> CHARITY'S EMERGENCY ROOM HAD

22:59.327 --> 23:01.703
BEEN A PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF

23:01.703 --> 23:02.709
PRIMARY CARE BUT HABITS AND

23:02.709 --> 23:06.726
SERVICES ARE SLOWLY CHANGING.

23:06.726 --> 23:08.199
>> I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

23:08.199 --> 23:12.384
SYLVIA'S PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR

23:12.384 --> 23:14.326
KEITH WINFREY IS PRIMARY CARE

23:14.326 --> 23:16.636
DOCTOR IN A COMMUNITY OF

23:16.636 --> 23:17.005
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND VIETNAMESE

23:17.005 --> 23:19.515
RESIDENTS.

23:19.515 --> 23:21.122
>> PRIOR TO KATRINA, IT WAS MORE

23:21.122 --> 23:21.925
THE TRADITIONAL

23:21.925 --> 23:25.408
PHYSICIAN-PATIENT INTERACTION

23:25.408 --> 23:25.810
AND THE POPULATION WASN'T

23:25.810 --> 23:29.091
DIFFERENT.

23:29.091 --> 23:30.698
SINCE KATRINA, THERE IS BEEN A

23:30.698 --> 23:34.380
TOTAL TRANSFORMATION IN PRIMARY

23:34.380 --> 23:37.225
CARE, MORE OF A TEAM MODEL AND

23:37.225 --> 23:40.675
THE PATIENTS ARE HE.OM

SHE RETURNED TO ELECTRONIC

23:56.645 --> 23:57.682
MEDICAL RECORDS THAT WILL

23:57.682 --> 24:00.126
SURVIVE A STORM.

24:00.126 --> 24:01.767
>> EVERY TIME I GO, THEY GET ON

24:01.767 --> 24:03.909
THE COMPUTER AND THEY CAN TELL

24:03.909 --> 24:05.649
ME EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON.

24:05.649 --> 24:06.856
WHEN I GO TO SEE THE DOCTOR IN

24:06.856 --> 24:08.798
THE ROOM, THE DOCTOR HAS A

24:08.798 --> 24:10.036
RECORD THAT THEY CAN OPEN, A

24:10.036 --> 24:11.878
PAPER RECORD THEY CAN TELL ME

24:11.878 --> 24:12.680
WHAT IS GOING ON.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.225
>> NOW, IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

24:15.225 --> 24:19.611
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN SENT TO BE

24:19.611 --> 24:19.945
SEEN BY YOUR PRIMARY CARE

24:19.945 --> 24:21.352
DOCTOR.

24:21.352 --> 24:23.293
>> MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE

24:23.293 --> 24:25.404
WOVEN IN TO CLINIC SERVICES AND

24:25.404 --> 24:26.642
MOBILE VANS OFFER ON THE SPOT

24:26.642 --> 24:27.780
SUPPORT, BUT IT IS WIDELY

24:27.780 --> 24:31.330
ACKNOWLEDGED HERE THAT FAR MORE

24:31.330 --> 24:33.571
IS NEEDED.

24:33.571 --> 24:36.317
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS LONG

24:36.317 --> 24:38.561
WORKED WITH THE MENTALLY ILL WHO

24:38.561 --> 24:41.807
HAVE HAD RUN INS WITH THE LAW.

24:41.807 --> 24:43.751
SHE IS INCENSED THE NEW HOPPED

24:43.751 --> 24:44.755
HAS CURRENTLY A THIRD

24:44.755 --> 24:46.429
PSYCHIATRIC BEDS THAT CHARITY

24:46.429 --> 24:48.839
ONCE HELD.

24:48.839 --> 24:50.145
>> WE'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF

24:50.145 --> 24:52.522
ORLEANS PARISH PRISON TODAY.

24:52.522 --> 24:55.567
THIS IS OUR LARGEST MENTAL

24:55.567 --> 24:57.376
HEALTH HOSPITAL IN OUR

24:57.376 --> 24:58.916
COMMUNITY, WHICH IS SO SAD,

24:58.916 --> 25:01.562
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT WHERE

25:01.562 --> 25:03.603
TREATMENT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.440
>> THE GREAT UNCERTAINTY IN

25:04.440 --> 25:09.362
SUSTAINING THE NEW HOSPITAL AND

25:09.362 --> 25:11.270
THE CLINICS IS MONEY.

25:11.270 --> 25:13.948
GOVERNOR BOBBY JINDAL DID NOT

25:13.948 --> 25:16.627
EXPAND MEDICAID UNDER THE

25:16.627 --> 25:18.602
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND SO MANY

25:18.602 --> 25:18.903
UNINSURED PATIENTS NEED FREE

25:18.903 --> 25:19.808
CARE.

25:19.808 --> 25:21.247
AS PART OF THE LAW, THE FEDERAL

25:21.247 --> 25:22.988
GOVERNMENT IS REDUCING THE

25:22.988 --> 25:23.290
DOLLARS IT SENDS STATES FOR THAT

25:23.290 --> 25:24.930
CARE.

25:24.930 --> 25:26.269
>> I THINK WE STILL MOSTLY HAVE

25:26.269 --> 25:29.014
QUESTIONS IN THE AREA OF HOW

25:29.014 --> 25:30.119
WE'RE GOING TO FINANCE THIS

25:30.119 --> 25:31.156
SYSTEM LONG TERM THAT WILL BE

25:31.156 --> 25:32.630
AFFORDABLE FOR EVERYONE.

25:32.630 --> 25:35.343
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE A

25:35.343 --> 25:37.685
LOT OF VIGILANCE, A LOT OF

25:37.685 --> 25:38.991
ADVOCACY AND A LOT OF DEMAND FOR

25:38.991 --> 25:42.774
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALL OF THIS

25:42.774 --> 25:45.119
TO WORK.

25:45.119 --> 25:45.620
>> AND HE GOT MY MEDICINES FOR

25:45.620 --> 25:50.810
ME.

25:50.810 --> 25:53.689
>> STILL, FOR PEOPLE LIKE

25:53.689 --> 25:54.995
SYLVIANA HENRY, A FAR MORE

25:54.995 --> 25:56.935
ROBUST SYSTEM IS IN PLACE TO

25:56.935 --> 25:58.477
CARE FOR PEOPLE THAN THE FRAGILE

25:58.477 --> 26:00.084
SYSTEM THAT KATRINA WASHED AWAY.

26:00.084 --> 26:02.158
FOR THE PBS "NewsHour", JACKIE

26:02.158 --> 26:05.675
JUDD IN NEW ORLEANS.

26:05.675 --> 26:07.348
>> Ifill: THE FUTURE OF PATIENT

26:07.348 --> 26:08.553
CARE IS ONLY ONE OF THE CONCERNS

26:08.553 --> 26:09.760
CASTING A SHADOW OVER THE

26:09.760 --> 26:11.165
CRESCENT CITY TEN YEARS LATER.

26:11.165 --> 26:12.706
A NEW REPORT OUT TODAY HAS A

26:12.706 --> 26:13.977
SOBERING ASSESSMENT OF OTHER

26:13.977 --> 26:16.288
PROBLEMS PLAGUING ITS MAJORITY

26:16.288 --> 26:18.163
AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.

26:18.163 --> 26:19.769
AMONG ITS FINDINGS: IN 2005, 44%

26:19.769 --> 26:21.845
OF BLACK CHILDREN IN NEW ORLEANS

26:21.845 --> 26:24.723
WERE LIVING IN POVERTY.

26:24.723 --> 26:26.297
THAT NUMBER HAS GONE UP TO 51%.

26:26.297 --> 26:27.704
AND THE EARNINGS GAP BETWEEN

26:27.704 --> 26:29.211
BLACK AND WHITE FAMILIES HAS

26:29.211 --> 26:30.952
INCREASED BY 18%.

26:30.952 --> 26:34.566
AFRICAN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS

26:34.566 --> 26:36.643
BRING IN ROUGHLY $25,000 A YEAR.

26:36.643 --> 26:38.316
WHITE HOUSEHOLDS, $60,000.

26:38.316 --> 26:40.092
THE NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUE STUDY

26:40.092 --> 26:41.397
ON THESE AND OTHER DISPARITIES

26:41.397 --> 26:42.670
WAS RELEASED TODAY IN NEW

26:42.670 --> 26:43.975
ORLEANS.

26:43.975 --> 26:45.181
I SAT DOWN WITH C.E.O. MARC

26:45.181 --> 26:46.285
MORIAL TO TALK ABOUT IT WHEN I

26:46.285 --> 26:51.040
WAS IN THE CITY EARLIER THIS

26:51.040 --> 26:51.909
WEEK.

26:51.909 --> 26:53.317
>> Ifill: MARC MORIAL, THANK YOU

26:53.317 --> 26:55.225
FOR JOINING US.

26:55.225 --> 26:56.598
YOU ARE THE SON OF A MAYOR,

26:56.598 --> 26:57.803
FORMER STATE SENATOR, FORMER

26:57.803 --> 26:59.209
MAYOR OF NEW ORLEANS.

26:59.209 --> 27:00.448
AND NOW AS HEAD OF THE URBAN

27:00.448 --> 27:01.954
LEAGUE, YOU'VE COME OUT WITH A

27:01.954 --> 27:03.159
REPORT IN WHICH YOU TAKE STOCK

27:03.159 --> 27:04.265
OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE 10

27:04.265 --> 27:05.302
YEARS SINCE KATRINA.

27:05.302 --> 27:06.675
IT READS LIKE A TALE OF TWO

27:06.675 --> 27:08.348
CITIES.

27:08.348 --> 27:09.688
>> IT IS A TALE OF TWO CITIES.

27:09.688 --> 27:10.859
NEW ORLEANS HAS LONG BEEN, LIKE

27:10.859 --> 27:12.366
MANY AMERICAN CITIES, A TALE OF

27:12.366 --> 27:13.705
TWO CITIES.

27:13.705 --> 27:15.914
AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR AS YOU

27:15.914 --> 27:18.024
TAKE THIS SNAPSHOT TEN YEARS

27:18.024 --> 27:19.195
LATER AFTER THIS TRAGEDY OF

27:19.195 --> 27:22.444
KATRINA THAT IT'S STILL A TALE

27:22.444 --> 27:24.050
OF TWO CITIES.

27:24.050 --> 27:25.757
YES, WITH GREAT PHYSICAL

27:25.757 --> 27:28.838
REBUILDING, YES A CITY THAT

27:28.838 --> 27:31.014
SURVIVED A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE.

27:31.014 --> 27:32.688
BUT THAT'S WHY I THINK WE HAVE

27:32.688 --> 27:34.262
TO LOOK AT THIS AS A

27:34.262 --> 27:36.136
COMMEMORATION AS A CONTINUATION,

27:36.136 --> 27:37.476
AND NOT A CELEBRATION.

27:37.476 --> 27:38.915
>> Ifill: THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH

27:38.915 --> 27:40.456
CONVERSATION OVER THE YEARS

27:40.456 --> 27:43.301
ABOUT BOUNCING BACK.

27:43.301 --> 27:46.382
WE TALKED ABOUT RESILIENCE,

27:46.382 --> 27:50.900
ABOUT THE ABILITY OF NEW

27:50.900 --> 27:51.973
ORLEANIANS TO RECREATE WHAT HAD

27:51.973 --> 27:53.412
BEEN WASHED AWAY.

27:53.412 --> 27:54.383
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES

27:54.383 --> 27:55.622
ONE BY ONE.

27:55.622 --> 27:57.362
EDUCATION.

27:57.362 --> 27:58.667
WHAT DOES YOUR REPORT FIND?

27:58.667 --> 28:00.108
>> SO OUR REPORT FINDS CERTAINLY

28:00.108 --> 28:01.848
THAT YOU'VE GOT A HIGHER HIGH

28:01.848 --> 28:03.355
SCHOOL GRADUATION RATE.

28:03.355 --> 28:04.929
BUT OUR REPORT ALSO FINDS THAT

28:04.929 --> 28:06.134
WHEN IT COMES TO CHILDREN, THERE

28:06.134 --> 28:07.172
ARE MORE CHILDREN IN POVERTY

28:07.172 --> 28:08.880
TODAY THAN THERE WERE BEFORE

28:08.880 --> 28:10.553
KATRINA.

28:10.553 --> 28:12.060
AND THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

28:12.060 --> 28:13.768
EDUCATION, WHILE YOU SEE SIGNS

28:13.768 --> 28:16.647
OF PROGRESS.

28:16.647 --> 28:17.752
THERE ARE NEW SCHOOLS, THERE'S,

28:17.752 --> 28:20.698
IF YOU WILL, IMPROVEMENTS IN

28:20.698 --> 28:22.137
SCHOOLS.

28:22.137 --> 28:24.146
THE TRUTH IS THAT IT'S A SCHOOL

28:24.146 --> 28:27.192
DISTRICT WITH FEWER STUDENTS.

28:27.192 --> 28:29.235
IT'S TRUE THAT THESE REFORMS

28:29.235 --> 28:31.646
HAVE COME AT A TREMENDOUS COST

28:31.646 --> 28:33.286
TO THE CITY, AND THAT COST WAS

28:33.286 --> 28:35.094
THE LAYOFF OF SOME 7,000 MOSTLY

28:35.094 --> 28:38.643
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNIONIZED

28:38.643 --> 28:42.091
TEACHERS ALMOST TEN YEARS D THAA

28:42.091 --> 28:43.264
SCAR.

28:43.264 --> 28:45.372
AND PAIN ON THE EFFORT TO REFORM

28:45.372 --> 28:46.745
THE SCHOOLS.

28:46.745 --> 28:49.154
NOW, IT'S ALL ABOUT WHAT'S DOING

28:49.154 --> 28:50.260
BEST FOR KIDS.

28:50.260 --> 28:52.604
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

28:52.604 --> 28:53.540
PEOPLE TO BE MEASURED.

28:53.540 --> 28:56.487
AT THIS POINT, IT'S LIKE

28:56.487 --> 28:57.994
HALFTIME.

28:57.994 --> 28:59.735
>> Ifill: AS I DRIVE THROUGH THE

28:59.735 --> 29:01.108
CITY, I SEE NEW CONSTRUCTION,

29:01.108 --> 29:03.284
HOUSES WITH SOLAR PANELS, ALONG

29:03.284 --> 29:06.632
THE RIVERFRONT, NEW LEVEES.

29:06.632 --> 29:08.506
THIS ALL SPEAKS TO AN INCREDIBLE

29:08.506 --> 29:10.013
REBIRTH IN THE HOUSING MARKET.

29:10.013 --> 29:12.490
YET A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THEY

29:12.490 --> 29:16.340
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

29:16.340 --> 29:17.914
>> WHAT HAPPENED IS THAERALLY, ,

29:17.914 --> 29:19.621
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF UNITS

29:19.621 --> 29:21.230
WERE EITHER SUBSTANTIALLY

29:21.230 --> 29:23.104
DAMAGED OR DESTROYED, AND THAT

29:23.104 --> 29:25.280
THERE'S BEEN A GREAT REBUILDING

29:25.280 --> 29:27.657
THAT WE NEED TO APPLAUD.

29:27.657 --> 29:29.398
HOWEVER, THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

29:29.398 --> 29:31.340
HOUSING IN THE CITY, QUALITY

29:31.340 --> 29:32.344
HOUSING IN THE CITY, TO

29:32.344 --> 29:34.018
ACCOMMODATE WHAT IS NOW A

29:34.018 --> 29:35.760
GROWING POPULATION.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.997
AND THAT IS INDEED THE CASE.

29:36.997 --> 29:39.743
SO THE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL REBIRTH

29:39.743 --> 29:41.719
ARE EVERYWHERE.

29:41.719 --> 29:43.225
AND I ABSOLUTELY APPLAUD THAT.

29:43.225 --> 29:44.699
BUT WHAT NEW ORLEANS NEEDS TODAY

29:44.699 --> 29:46.840
IS AN EFFORT TO BUILD MORE

29:46.840 --> 29:48.381
WORKFORCE HOUSING.

29:48.381 --> 29:50.290
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

29:50.290 --> 29:51.895
MORE HOUSING THAT PEOPLE CAN

29:51.895 --> 29:53.804
BOTH RENT AND OWN IN TERMS OF

29:53.804 --> 29:56.048
WHERE WE ARE.

29:56.048 --> 29:58.993
SO THAT SPEAKS, GWEN, REALLY TO

29:58.993 --> 30:00.534
THIS POINT THAT THIS, IN THIS

30:00.534 --> 30:02.409
10TH YEAR, THE FOCUS SHOULD BE

30:02.409 --> 30:05.389
ON WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE

30:05.389 --> 30:07.432
NEXT TEN TO 15 YEARS.

30:07.432 --> 30:08.702
AND BUILDING MORE WORKFORCE AND

30:08.702 --> 30:11.817
AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK IS A

30:11.817 --> 30:13.022
MUST.

30:13.022 --> 30:14.428
OR, OR, THE RECOVERY AND THE

30:14.428 --> 30:15.835
REBUILDING WILL STALL BECAUSE

30:15.835 --> 30:17.509
IT'LL SIMPLY BE JUST TOO

30:17.509 --> 30:19.417
EXPENSIVE FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE

30:19.417 --> 30:20.989
TO AFFORD A DECENT HOME.

30:20.989 --> 30:22.530
>> Ifill: SO APPLY THAT FUTURE-

30:22.530 --> 30:24.171
LOOKING ORIENTATION TO SOMETHING

30:24.171 --> 30:25.408
LIKE UNEMPLOYMENT, WHERE

30:25.408 --> 30:27.786
ESPECIALLY BLACK TEEN

30:27.786 --> 30:28.824
UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGH EVERYWHERE.

30:28.824 --> 30:30.398
BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY GRIEVOUS

30:30.398 --> 30:31.838
HERE.

30:31.838 --> 30:34.348
HOW CAN THAT BE, HOW HAS THAT

30:34.348 --> 30:35.588
BEEN OVERLOOKED, OR HAS IT?

30:35.588 --> 30:36.893
>> I THINK IT HAS NOT HAD THE

30:36.893 --> 30:39.638
EMPHASIS.

30:39.638 --> 30:40.710
I THINK THE ISSUES OF EQUITY

30:40.710 --> 30:43.722
HAVE NOT BEEN CENTER STAGE IN

30:43.722 --> 30:44.727
THE RECOVERY.

30:44.727 --> 30:46.100
LET'S JUST GO BACK JUST FOR A

30:46.100 --> 30:47.372
MINUTE.

30:47.372 --> 30:48.844
AT THE VERY BEGINNING AFTER THE

30:48.844 --> 30:50.284
HURRICANE, THERE WAS A DALLAS

30:50.284 --> 30:51.556
PLAN.

30:51.556 --> 30:52.761
I CALL IT A DALLAS PLAN, BECAUSE

30:52.761 --> 30:54.002
IT WAS ACTUALLY WRITTEN IN

30:54.002 --> 30:55.675
DALLAS BY CERTAIN BUSINESS

30:55.675 --> 30:57.751
LEADERS FOR NEW ORLEANS, THAT

30:57.751 --> 31:00.094
WOULD HAVE DECOMMISSIONED,

31:00.094 --> 31:01.801
TURNED CERTAIN HISTORIC

31:01.801 --> 31:02.839
NEIGHBORHOODS, MIDDLE-CLASS AND

31:02.839 --> 31:03.778
WORKING-CLASS AND POOR AFRICAN-

31:03.778 --> 31:05.384
AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS INTO

31:05.384 --> 31:06.856
LAGOONS.

31:06.856 --> 31:08.229
AND NOT ONLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN

31:08.229 --> 31:10.439
NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT NEIGHBORHOODS

31:10.439 --> 31:12.146
LIKE ST. BERNARD PARISH.

31:12.146 --> 31:13.787
WHICH WERE COMPLETELY

31:13.787 --> 31:15.295
DEVASTATED, AND WHICH HAPPENS TO

31:15.295 --> 31:16.399
BE A NEIGHBORHOOD MADE UP OF

31:16.399 --> 31:20.350
MOSTLY WORKING-CLASS WHITE

31:20.350 --> 31:23.363
PEOPLE.

31:23.363 --> 31:25.572
SO THESE DECISIONS THAT WERE

31:25.572 --> 31:27.380
MADE STALLED THE RECOVERY.

31:27.380 --> 31:29.121
>> Ifill: YOU MENTIONED ST.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.694
BERNARD'S PARISH, WHERE RECENTLY

31:30.694 --> 31:32.001
THEY VOTED AGAINST RAISING TAXES

31:32.001 --> 31:33.474
TO PAY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF

31:33.474 --> 31:35.047
THE NEW LEVEES.

31:35.047 --> 31:36.285
EVERY HOUSE IN ST. BERNARD

31:36.285 --> 31:37.659
PARISH FLOODED.

31:37.659 --> 31:39.399
ISN'T THERE SOME PERSONAL

31:39.399 --> 31:40.370
RESPONSIBILITY THAT THE

31:40.370 --> 31:41.677
RESIDENTS NEED TO TAKE IN THE

31:41.677 --> 31:43.082
RECOVERY?

31:43.082 --> 31:44.187
>> ABSOLUTELY.

31:44.187 --> 31:45.727
I THINK ABSOLUTELY.

31:45.727 --> 31:47.267
I THINK WHEN PEOPLE VOTE AGAINST

31:47.267 --> 31:48.673
TAXES, IN THIS PART OF THE

31:48.673 --> 31:49.878
COUNTRY, IT SOMETIMES IS ALSO A

31:49.878 --> 31:51.150
REFLECTION OF THE REALITY OF

31:51.150 --> 31:53.863
PEOPLE BELIEVING THEY CAN'T

31:53.863 --> 31:56.240
AFFORD TO PAY.

31:56.240 --> 31:58.483
BUT NO DOUBT, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

31:58.483 --> 32:00.290
IN NEW ORLEANS TAXES HAVE RISEN,

32:00.290 --> 32:02.266
A NUMBER OF TIMES OVER THE LAST

32:02.266 --> 32:04.409
TEN YEARS, TO PAY FOR MANY, MANY

32:04.409 --> 32:06.652
THINGS.

32:06.652 --> 32:07.957
REMEMBER YOU'VE GOT A SMALLER

32:07.957 --> 32:11.104
POPULATION BASE IN THE CITY

32:11.104 --> 32:13.046
TODAY THAN YOU HAD PRE-KATRINA.

32:13.046 --> 32:16.361
>> Ifill: AS YOU PUT OUT THE

32:16.361 --> 32:18.135
RESULTS OF THIS REPORT AND AS A

32:18.135 --> 32:19.910
SON OF NEW ORLEANS, DO YOU, 10

32:19.910 --> 32:21.483
YEARS LATER, FEEL MORE

32:21.483 --> 32:22.788
OPTIMISTIC OR LESS OPTIMISTIC

32:22.788 --> 32:23.993
ABOUT WHERE THE CITY IS HEADED

32:23.993 --> 32:25.802
IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS?

32:25.802 --> 32:27.042
>> I'M OPTIMISTIC.

32:27.042 --> 32:28.782
LET ME TELL YOU WHY I'M

32:28.782 --> 32:30.757
OPTIMISTIC.

32:30.757 --> 32:33.637
I STOOD ON THE NINTH WARD LEVEE

32:33.637 --> 32:34.775
A WEEK AFTER THIS HURRICANE, AND

32:34.775 --> 32:36.282
I QUESTIONED IN MY, IN THE

32:36.282 --> 32:38.056
DEPTHS OF MY HEART AND MY SOUL,

32:38.056 --> 32:38.992
WHETHER THE CITY WOULD EVER BE

32:38.992 --> 32:41.304
ABLE TO STAND ON ITS TWO FEET

32:41.304 --> 32:42.609
AGAIN.

32:42.609 --> 32:44.316
NEW ORLEANS COULD HAVE BEEN,

32:44.316 --> 32:46.726
BECOME A MODERN POMPEII.

32:46.726 --> 32:47.698
A MODERN HERCULANEUM.

32:47.698 --> 32:49.640
A CITY LOST TO HURRICANE

32:49.640 --> 32:51.112
KATRINA.

32:51.112 --> 32:53.891
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT

32:53.891 --> 32:56.135
THE CITY'S UNIQUENESS, IT'S

32:56.135 --> 32:59.114
MUSIC, IT'S CULTURE, IT'S

32:59.114 --> 33:00.151
STANDING, IT'S PEOPLE SAID

33:00.151 --> 33:02.328
ABSOLUTELY, THIS CITY MUST BE

33:02.328 --> 33:03.600
REBUILT.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.374
SO AGAINST THAT BACKDROP, I'M

33:05.374 --> 33:07.250
OPTIMISTIC.

33:07.250 --> 33:10.464
BUT I REALIZE IT'S A VERY LONG

33:10.464 --> 33:13.745
JOURNEY, AND WHAT OUR REPORT

33:13.745 --> 33:17.026
SEEKS TO SAY IS LOOK, WE'RE ALL

33:17.026 --> 33:19.002
HAPPY TO BE HERE AT YEAR NUMBER

33:19.002 --> 33:20.608
TEN AS NEW ORLEANIANS AND AS

33:20.608 --> 33:22.216
CERTAINLY CHAMPIONS OF URBAN

33:22.216 --> 33:24.993
COMMUNITIES AND CHAMPIONS OF

33:24.993 --> 33:28.543
FAIRNESS AND EQUITY IN AMERICA.

33:28.543 --> 33:30.250
HOWEVER, THE WORK THAT HAS TO BE

33:30.250 --> 33:31.690
DONE IN THE FUTURE, AND THE

33:31.690 --> 33:33.196
EMPHASIS THAT NEEDS TO BE PLACED

33:33.196 --> 33:35.137
ON THESE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE,

33:35.137 --> 33:36.879
HAS TO BE GREATER THAN IT'S BEEN

33:36.879 --> 33:38.955
IN THE FIRST TEN YEARS IF, IN

33:38.955 --> 33:40.763
FACT, THIS REBUILDING AND THIS

33:40.763 --> 33:42.036
RECOVERY IS NOT ONLY GOING TO BE

33:42.036 --> 33:42.739
COMPLETE BUT IS GOING TO BE

33:42.739 --> 33:44.646
SOMETHING WE CAN ALL BE PROUD

33:44.646 --> 33:45.650
OF.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.191

34:24.219 --> 34:25.859
BUT FIRST, THE BATTLE OVER

34:25.859 --> 34:27.132
PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS HEATING UP

MEANTIME, PLANNED PARENTHOOD

34:34.196 --> 34:35.534
ITSELF LAUNCHED A LAWSUIT

34:35.534 --> 34:36.875
AGAINST THE STATE OF LOUISIANA'S

34:36.875 --> 34:38.716
ATTEMPT TO CUT ITS FUNDING.

34:38.716 --> 34:40.690
ALL OF THIS IS HAVING AN EFFECT

34:40.690 --> 34:41.929
IN THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE.

35:19.493 --> 35:21.335
TENS OF THOUSANDS TURNED OUT,

35:21.335 --> 35:22.976
MOTIVATED BY RECENT

35:22.976 --> 35:25.119
CONTROVERSIAL VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE.

35:25.119 --> 35:25.621
>> THESE VIDEOS WERE NOT MADE

35:25.621 --> 35:30.375
UP.

35:30.375 --> 35:33.153
THESE VIDEOS ARE SO POWERFUL!

35:33.153 --> 35:36.100
>> Reporter: PLANNED

35:36.100 --> 35:39.683
PARENTHOOD OPPONENTS MEAN VIDEOS

35:39.683 --> 35:42.395
BY ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVIST POSING

35:42.395 --> 35:42.929
AS BUSINESSMEN TRYING TO BUY

35:42.929 --> 35:45.274
TISSUE.

35:45.274 --> 35:46.881
THEY SAY PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS

35:46.881 --> 35:48.589
HEARTLESS, MOTIVATED BY MONEY.

35:48.589 --> 35:50.329
PLANNED PARENTHOOD DENIED THAT,

35:50.329 --> 35:50.865
SAYING IT CARES FOR MILLIONS OF

35:50.865 --> 35:53.142
PATIENCE.

35:53.142 --> 35:54.883
THE ORGANIZATION POINTS TO EDITS

35:54.883 --> 35:56.657
IN THE UNDERCOVER VIDEOS THAT

35:56.657 --> 35:59.001
LEFT OUT THE WORKER CLEARLY

35:59.001 --> 35:59.336
SAYING THEY DO NOT SELL FETAL

35:59.336 --> 36:03.186
TISSUE.

36:03.186 --> 36:05.027
WHATEVER YOU MAKE OF THEM, THE

36:05.027 --> 36:08.072
VIDEOS ARE A MATCH IN A HEATED

36:08.072 --> 36:08.977
CAMPAIGN YEAR.

36:08.977 --> 36:10.450
>> THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO NEED

36:10.450 --> 36:11.020
FOR ANY PUBLIC FUNDING OF

36:11.020 --> 36:12.326
PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

36:12.326 --> 36:15.774
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR IT.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.748
>> THERE IS NO EXCUSE.

36:17.748 --> 36:18.117
PLANNED PARENTHOOD MUST BE

36:18.117 --> 36:19.389
DEFUNDED.

36:19.389 --> 36:21.331
>> JEB BUSH CAUSED A STIR

HALL WHEN HE TURNED TO SAY

36:24.010 --> 36:25.215
THIS --

36:25.215 --> 36:26.855
>> I FOR ONE DON'T THINK PLANNED

36:26.855 --> 36:28.060
PARENTHOOD OUGHT TO GET A PENNY,

36:28.060 --> 36:29.902
THOUGH, AND THAT'S THE

36:29.902 --> 36:32.646
DIFFERENCE, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

36:32.646 --> 36:32.982
ACTUALLY DOING WOMEN'S HEALTH

36:32.982 --> 36:33.551
ISSUES.

36:33.551 --> 36:35.091
>> Reporter: PLANNED

36:35.091 --> 36:36.530
PARENTHOOD SHOWS THE BULK OF

36:36.530 --> 36:38.573
THEIR SERVICES ARE WOMEN'S

36:38.573 --> 36:41.017
HEALTH, STD TESTING, CARNES

36:41.017 --> 36:42.958
SCREENING AND THAT ABORTIONS ARE

36:42.958 --> 36:46.340
ONLY 3% OF THEIR SERVICES.

36:46.340 --> 36:50.994
MOCRDEATS ARE JUMPING TO THE PRO

36:50.994 --> 36:53.941
PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

36:53.941 --> 36:57.691
>> I THINK IT IS REGRETTABLE

36:57.691 --> 37:02.177
THAT REPUBLICANS ARE, ONCE

37:02.177 --> 37:04.018
AGAIN, TRYING TOUNDE RMINE EVEN

37:04.018 --> 37:06.563
AND THOSE SERVICES SO MANY WOMEN

37:06.563 --> 37:06.831
HAVE NEEDED AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE

37:06.831 --> 37:07.567
OF.

37:07.567 --> 37:09.810
>> Reporter: IN OTHER WORDS,

37:09.810 --> 37:12.053
BOTH SIDES ARE WINNING, BY

37:12.053 --> 37:14.698
FIRING UP THEIR BASES.

37:14.698 --> 37:16.238
DAVID IS THE ANTI-ABORTION

SIDE.

ABORTION POLITICS AND PROTESTS

37:23.402 --> 37:25.278
ARE NOT NEW, BUT HE BELIEVES HIS

37:25.278 --> 37:26.482
VIDEOS HAVE STARTED A NEW SHIFT

37:26.482 --> 37:27.454
IN THE DEBATE.

37:27.454 --> 37:28.892
>> IT'S COMPLETELY CHANGING THE

37:28.892 --> 37:30.800
WAY WE TALK ABOUT ABORTION AND

37:30.800 --> 37:33.982
UNBORN CHILDREN IN AMERICA.

37:33.982 --> 37:35.322
I THINK IT'S REALLY CAUSING A

37:35.322 --> 37:36.527
CHANGE IN HOW THAT CONVERSATION

37:36.527 --> 37:37.564
HAPPENS, AND THAT'S A GOOD

37:37.564 --> 37:38.769
THING, BECAUSE IT'S A

37:38.769 --> 37:39.775
CONVERSATION THAT'S NEEDED TO

37:39.775 --> 37:41.013
HAPPEN FOR A LONG TIME.

37:57.318 --> 37:58.255
EVERY DAY.

37:58.255 --> 38:03.042
THAT'S WHAT WE SEE.

38:03.042 --> 38:04.884
THE IRONY OF THESE ATTACKS ON US

38:04.884 --> 38:07.495
IS THEY TEND TO GET MORE PEOPLE

38:07.495 --> 38:09.471
SAYING, OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THIS

38:09.471 --> 38:10.107
IS AT RISK, I'M GOING TO STAND

38:24.804 --> 38:30.295
THESE VIDEOS, THERE'S ANOTHER

38:30.295 --> 38:31.801
FACTOR AT WORK, THE VIDEOS TOUCH

38:31.801 --> 38:33.409
THE AMERICAN MIDDLE GROUND.

38:33.409 --> 38:37.693
>> YOU'VE HAD PEOPLE WHO WERE

38:37.693 --> 38:39.335
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF AIORIGHTS, OE

38:39.335 --> 38:40.640
VERY ANTI-ABORTION, AND IN THE

RIGHT OF ABORTION BUT, YOU KNOW,

38:51.655 --> 38:53.296
HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH ABORTION.

38:53.296 --> 38:54.399

CRUZ WHO ARE HARD CHARGING

38:58.016 --> 38:59.288

CONGRESS RIGHT NOW TODAY TO

39:03.942 --> 39:05.148
STAND UP AND PLEAD AND TO DEFUND

39:26.959 --> 39:27.395
POTENTIALLY CRIPPLE PLANNED

39:27.395 --> 39:28.198
PARENTHOOD.

39:28.198 --> 39:28.633
THAT'S NO PROBLEM FOR

39:28.633 --> 39:29.035
REPUBLICANS.

39:29.035 --> 39:30.877
WHAT IS?

39:30.877 --> 39:33.923
OTHER NUMBERS.

39:33.923 --> 39:36.266
A RECENT REUTERS POLL SHOWED 54%

39:36.266 --> 39:37.070
OF AMERICANS OVERALL SUPPORT

39:37.070 --> 39:39.112
FUNDING PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

39:39.112 --> 39:40.552
BUT NOWLO

39:40.552 --> 39:43.899
STATE, FLORIDA, WHICH COULD

39:43.899 --> 39:44.269
DECIDE THE PRIMARY AND THE

39:44.269 --> 39:46.779
ELECTION.

39:46.779 --> 39:48.387
IN A QUINNIPIAC FOUL THIS WEEK,

39:48.387 --> 39:51.064
FLORIDA REPUBLICAN VOTERS

39:51.064 --> 39:51.767
OVERWHELMINGLY SAID THEY WANT TO

DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD.

39:54.814 --> 39:56.421
BUT ASKLL T AHE VOTERS IN THE

39:56.421 --> 39:57.861
STATE, THE MAJORITY SWITCHES,

39:57.861 --> 39:59.601
MOST WANT TO KEEP THE FUNDING.

39:59.601 --> 40:01.778
POLLS IN OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA

40:01.778 --> 40:03.987
SHOW SAME POTENTIAL RISK,

40:03.987 --> 40:05.628
REPUBLICANS GO ONE WAY, GENERAL

40:05.628 --> 40:07.068
ELECTION VOTERS THE OTHER.

40:07.068 --> 40:08.172
>> I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO

40:08.172 --> 40:10.280
WATCH THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES

40:10.280 --> 40:12.925
TRY TO OUTDO EACH OTHER.

40:12.925 --> 40:14.701
THAT MAY PROVIDE LEVERAGE FOR

40:14.701 --> 40:19.791
SENATOR CRUZ, FOR EXAMPLE, WHO'S

40:19.791 --> 40:20.393
REALLY THE MOST RADICAL ON THIS

40:20.393 --> 40:22.132
ISSUE.

40:22.132 --> 40:24.377
IN TERMS OF THE GENERAL

40:24.377 --> 40:32.278
ELECTION, YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS

40:32.278 --> 40:33.550
COULD ADVANTAGE HILLARY CLINTON.

40:33.550 --> 40:38.639
>> Reporter: BACK AT THAT

40:38.639 --> 40:40.144
MORNING, PROSTSTE IN WASHINGTON,

40:43.193 --> 40:44.330
IF REPUBLICANS PUSH TOO HARD TO

40:44.330 --> 40:45.737
CLOSE PLANNED PARENTHOOD?

40:45.737 --> 40:46.574
>> IF THAT COSTS THE ELECTION,

40:46.574 --> 40:50.424
THEN IT DOES.

40:50.424 --> 40:52.633
SOMETIMES WE DO HAVE TO TAKE THE

40:52.633 --> 40:53.804
CONSEQUENCES THAT FOLLOW.

OH, COME ON!

48:21.361 --> 48:23.704
>> Brown: SHE WAS A BELOVED

48:23.704 --> 48:25.379
FIGURE WHO TAUGHT THE BASICS OF

48:25.379 --> 48:26.383
READING AND MATH --

48:26.383 --> 48:27.989
>> O TOOTHPASTE!

48:27.989 --> 48:31.572
>> Brown: BUT ALSO COMPLICATED

48:31.572 --> 48:32.510
LIFE LESSONS ABOUT LOVE,

48:32.510 --> 48:33.715
MARRIAGE, SICKNESS --

48:33.715 --> 48:37.164
>> DON'T YOU REMEMBER WE TOLD

48:37.164 --> 48:38.837
YOU, MR. HOOPER DIED.

48:38.837 --> 48:39.273
HE WAS SICK.

48:39.273 --> 48:40.713
>> OH, YEAH.

48:40.713 --> 48:42.788
>> Brown: FOR MANY VIEWERS,

48:42.788 --> 48:46.370
SHE WAS ALSO THE FIRST LATINA

48:46.370 --> 48:46.772
THEY SAW ON TELEVISION.

48:46.772 --> 48:46.839
TELEVISION.

48:46.839 --> 48:51.459
HOW MUCH OF MARIA IS YOU?

48:51.459 --> 48:53.602
>> SHE'S A BETTER, KINDER SONIA,

48:53.602 --> 48:56.782
SHE'S A MORE PATIENT SONIA, BUT

48:56.782 --> 48:57.116
IT'S ALL -- I WENT EXACTLY FROM

48:57.116 --> 48:59.226
MYSELF.

48:59.226 --> 49:00.666
>> Brown: AND YET THE SAFE,

49:00.666 --> 49:02.173
COMFORTING WORLD WHERE MARIA

49:02.173 --> 49:04.516
LIVED AND WORKED WAS VERY

49:04.516 --> 49:06.256
DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE MANZANO

49:06.256 --> 49:10.442
GREW UP IN, A STORY SHE'S NOW

49:10.442 --> 49:11.212
TELLING IN A NEW MEMOIR,

49:11.212 --> 49:12.753
BECOMING MARIE YANCHTS WHEN I

49:12.753 --> 49:14.828
STARTED THINKING ABOUT LEAVING

49:14.828 --> 49:16.603
SESAME STREET, I STARTED TO

49:16.603 --> 49:18.611
THINK ABOUT MY JOURNEY THERE AND

49:18.611 --> 49:21.255
I WANTED TO EXAMINE WHERE I WENT

49:21.255 --> 49:23.098
RIGHT AND WRONG AND HOW IS IT

49:23.098 --> 49:25.038
POSSIBLE A GIRL FROM MY

49:25.038 --> 49:26.512
BACKGROUND COULD END UP ON THIS

49:26.512 --> 49:28.688
ICONIC TELEVISION SHOW.

49:28.688 --> 49:35.016
>> Brown: MONZANO GREW UP IN

49:35.016 --> 49:37.159
THE WORKING CLASS TENMENTS OF

49:37.159 --> 49:39.636
SOUTH BROKES AND DESCRIBES HER

49:39.636 --> 49:41.444
FATHER SERENADING HER WITH

49:41.444 --> 49:41.778
PUERTO RICAN BALLADS ON THE

49:41.778 --> 49:43.786
GUITAR.

49:43.786 --> 49:46.331
BUT HE WAS ALSO AN ALCOHOLIC

49:46.331 --> 49:48.375
WITH A VIOLENT TEMPER WHO PETE

49:48.375 --> 49:49.178
BOO HER MOTHER, DESTROYED

49:49.178 --> 49:51.321
OBJECTS AROUND THE HOUSE AND

49:51.321 --> 49:53.262
GENERALLY TERRIFIED MONZANO AND

49:53.262 --> 49:55.907
HER SIBLINGS.

49:55.907 --> 49:57.548
>> IN ORDER TO ESCAPE WHAT'S

49:57.548 --> 50:00.393
GOING ON INSIDE THE APARTMENT, I

50:00.393 --> 50:03.072
USED TO LOOK OUTSIDE THE WINDOW,

50:03.072 --> 50:05.415
COMB MY HAIR, DO MY NAILS, READ

50:05.415 --> 50:07.055
BY STREET LIGHT, FINDING THE

50:07.055 --> 50:08.896
FURTHER PLACE, LIKE BEING ON THE

50:08.896 --> 50:10.538
END OF THE BOAT.

50:10.538 --> 50:15.091
>> BEAVER, DON'T EAT SO FAST.

50:15.091 --> 50:16.898
>> Brown: SHE SOUGHT REFUGE IN

50:16.898 --> 50:19.042
TELEVISION THAT DEPICTED SERENE

50:19.042 --> 50:21.821
FAMILY LIFE AS LEAVE IT TO

50:21.821 --> 50:22.925
BEAVER AND FATHER KNOWS BEST.

50:22.925 --> 50:25.169
>> LOST MY HUSBAND --

50:25.169 --> 50:27.712
>> Brown: AND IN QUEEN FOR A

50:27.712 --> 50:31.095
DAY, INVITED DOWN AND OUT WOMEN

50:31.095 --> 50:32.200
TO SHARE STORIES.

50:32.200 --> 50:34.108
>> I THOUGHT MY MOTHER COULD

50:34.108 --> 50:35.680
HAVE A BIG SPOT ON THAT, QUEEN

50:35.680 --> 50:37.120
FOR A DAY, AND WE WOULD GET

50:37.120 --> 50:38.728
SOMETHING OUT OF BEING

50:38.728 --> 50:40.268
MISERABLE, BUT THE OTHER SHOWS

50:40.268 --> 50:42.712
WERE IN SUBURBAN ENVIRONMENTS,

50:42.712 --> 50:44.353
SO I DIDN'T SEE THE NEIGHBORHOOD

50:44.353 --> 50:45.591
I LIVED IN RESPECTED ON

50:45.591 --> 50:47.499
TELEVISION OR PEOPLE, AND I HAVE

50:47.499 --> 50:48.637
TO SAY THAT, ON SOME LEVEL, I

50:48.637 --> 50:51.183
WONDERED WHERE I WAS GOING TO

50:51.183 --> 50:53.225
FIT INTO THIS SOCIETY THAT

50:53.225 --> 50:54.429
DIDN'T SEE ME, WHAT MY

50:54.429 --> 50:56.238
CONTRIBUTION WAS GOING TO BE.

50:56.238 --> 50:57.878
I DECIDED, NO, THAT'S IT, I'M

50:57.878 --> 51:00.456
GOING TO STAND UP FOR MYSELF.

51:00.456 --> 51:02.498
>> Brown: AT SCHOOL, MANZANO

51:02.498 --> 51:04.976
FOUND LIT REEL LEAF FROM HER

51:04.976 --> 51:06.180
CHAOTIC HOME LIFE AT THIS JUNIOR

51:06.180 --> 51:08.424
HIGH SCHOOL GETTING INTO AN

51:08.424 --> 51:10.868
EARLY FIGHT TO PROVE HERSELF.

51:10.868 --> 51:11.437
SHE SAID MERELY SHOWING UP WAS

51:11.437 --> 51:13.748
ENOUGH TO PASS.

51:13.748 --> 51:15.856
>> I THINK I LOST MYSELF IN

51:15.856 --> 51:18.033
WHATEVER BOOKS I COULD FIND.

51:18.033 --> 51:19.238
I HAD A FEELING THAT THERE WAS

51:19.238 --> 51:20.511
SOMETHING BETTER THAN THIS.

51:20.511 --> 51:23.156
I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT

51:23.156 --> 51:24.494
THIS WAS LIFE.

51:24.494 --> 51:26.669
(SINGING)

51:26.669 --> 51:30.989
>> Brown: AND THEN CAME A

51:30.989 --> 51:32.663
REVELATION -- WHEN MANZANO WAS

51:32.663 --> 51:35.944
11 YEARS OLD, A TEACHER TOOK HER

51:35.944 --> 51:37.585
TO SEE THE FILM "WESTSIDE

51:37.585 --> 51:39.259
STORY," SET IN A PLACE SHE KNEW

51:39.259 --> 51:41.871
ALL TOO WELL BUT SUDDENLY CAST

51:41.871 --> 51:46.457
IN A WHOLE NEW LIGHT.

51:46.457 --> 51:47.897
>> I SAW THINGS I SAW IN MY

51:47.897 --> 51:48.264
EVERYDAY NEIGHBORHOOD BEAUTIFUL,

51:48.264 --> 51:50.140
EXALTED.

51:50.140 --> 51:52.383
ALL OF A SUDDEN THE SCHOOL YARD

51:52.383 --> 51:53.789
FENCE I WANTED TO CLIMB OVER WAS

51:53.789 --> 51:55.329
LIKE A PAINTING.

51:55.329 --> 51:56.133
THE GRAFFITI WAS LIKE SOMETHING

51:56.133 --> 51:57.472
IN A MUSEUM.

51:57.472 --> 51:58.978
I COULDN'T ARTICULATE THIS BUT I

51:58.978 --> 52:01.188
THINK THAT GAVE ME STRENGTH.

52:01.188 --> 52:03.833
>> Brown: A DRAMA TEACHER

52:03.833 --> 52:04.769
ENCOURAGED HERE TO AUDITION FOR

52:04.769 --> 52:06.276
MANHATTAN'S HIGH SCHOOL FOR THE

52:06.276 --> 52:06.645
PERFORMING ARTS AND SHE WAS

52:06.645 --> 52:08.921
ACCEPTED.

52:08.921 --> 52:09.624
SHE STRUGGLED IN A SUDDENLY

52:09.624 --> 52:11.700
RIGOROUS ACADEMIC ENVIRONMENT

52:11.700 --> 52:13.207
BUT HER ACTING HELPED HER GAIN

52:13.207 --> 52:15.149
ENTRY TO CARNEGIE MELLON

52:15.149 --> 52:17.593
UNIVERSITY IN 1968.

52:17.593 --> 52:20.038
ONE YEAR LATER, THE TELLING

52:20.038 --> 52:22.883
VISION SHOW DESIGNED TO REACH

52:22.883 --> 52:25.528
INNER CITY CHILDREN DEBUTED ON

52:25.528 --> 52:28.106
PUBLIC TELEVISION

52:28.106 --> 52:30.315
(SINGING)

52:30.315 --> 52:32.592
>> I NEVER SAW THESE CHEERFUL

52:32.592 --> 52:34.031
ATTRACTIVE, BLACK, FRIENDLY

52:34.031 --> 52:35.437
PEOPLE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT

52:35.437 --> 52:40.526
WAS RECOGNIZABLE TO ME WITH THE

52:40.526 --> 52:42.200
STOOP AND THE TENEMENT DOORS.

52:42.200 --> 52:43.272
I THOUGHT, WHAT'S MY STOOP DOING

52:43.272 --> 52:46.217
ON THE TELEVISION?

52:46.217 --> 52:48.060
>> Brown: IN 1971, MANZANO

52:48.060 --> 52:50.336
AUDITIONED AND AT AGE 22 LANDED

52:50.336 --> 52:53.283
THE PART OF MARIA, A WORLD SHE

52:53.283 --> 52:55.224
WOULD INHABIT FOR THE NEXT 44

52:55.224 --> 52:56.329
YEARS.

52:56.329 --> 52:58.271
SO HAVING WRITTEN THE BOOK TO

52:58.271 --> 52:58.338
FIGURE OUT HOW YOU GOT FROM HERE

52:58.338 --> 53:00.849
TO THERE, DID YOU FIGURE IT OUT?

53:00.849 --> 53:02.589
>> NO.

53:02.589 --> 53:02.858
>> Brown: NO?

53:02.858 --> 53:04.096
NO.

53:04.096 --> 53:06.741
I THINK THERE IS A CONNECTION

53:06.741 --> 53:09.586
THAT I FOUND COMFORT IN

53:09.586 --> 53:11.729
TELEVISION AND THAT I ENDED UP

53:11.729 --> 53:13.872
PROVIDING COMFORT OR WANTING TO

53:13.872 --> 53:16.215
PROVIDE COMFORT FOR CHILDREN WHO

53:16.215 --> 53:19.062
WERE WATCHING TELEVISION THAT I

53:19.062 --> 53:21.205
LOVE THEATER AND I LOVE STORIES.

53:21.205 --> 53:22.644
PEOPLE SAY, OH, SHE OVERCAME A

53:22.644 --> 53:24.887
TERRIBLE CHILDHOOD.

53:24.887 --> 53:25.591
I SAID I DIDN'T OVERCOME MY

53:25.591 --> 53:27.934
DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD.

53:27.934 --> 53:29.775
I SAY THAT I USED IT.

53:29.775 --> 53:31.013
I MADE SOMETHING OF IT.

53:31.013 --> 53:34.663
I NEVER FORGOT IT.

53:34.663 --> 53:36.203
I REMEMBERED MYSELF WATCHING

53:36.203 --> 53:36.939
FATHER KNOWS BEST AND LEAVE IT

53:36.939 --> 53:38.245
TO BEAVER.

53:38.245 --> 53:40.288
I REMEMBERED MYSELF DOING THAT

53:40.288 --> 53:42.397
AND I KEPT THAT SENSIBILITY IN

53:42.397 --> 53:43.670
MY HEART WHILE I WAS DOING

53:43.670 --> 53:44.673
SESAME STREET, WITH THE

53:44.673 --> 53:48.323
KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER

53:48.323 --> 53:48.692
KID OUT THERE LOOKING FOR THAT

53:48.692 --> 53:50.165
SANCTUARY.

53:50.165 --> 53:52.542
>> Brown: IN RETIREMENT, SONIA

53:52.542 --> 53:53.847
MANZANO WILL CONTINUE THAT

53:53.847 --> 53:55.587
PURSUIT, AMONG OTHER THINGS

53:55.587 --> 53:58.032
SHE'S NOW WORKING TO ESTABLISH A

53:58.032 --> 53:59.806
CHILDREN'S MUSEUM IN THE BRONX.

53:59.806 --> 54:01.313
FROM THE SOUTH BRONX, I'M
