00:21.588 --> 00:24.124
UNTESTED IN THE UNITED STATES;

00:24.124 --> 00:25.525
AND HOW PREVENTING MONEY FROM

00:25.525 --> 00:27.094
REACHING THE AL SHABAAB TERROR

00:27.094 --> 00:29.229
GROUP MAY ALSO PREVENT SOMALIS

00:29.229 --> 00:30.497
IN THE UNITED STATES FROM

00:30.497 --> 00:32.032
SENDING MONEY TO RELATIVES BACK

00:32.032 --> 00:32.566
HOME.

00:32.566 --> 00:33.567
>> ANY FUNDS TRANSFER CAN BE

00:33.567 --> 00:35.235
EXPLOITED BY BAD ACTORS,

00:35.235 --> 00:36.503
INCLUDING TERRORIST GROUPS.

00:36.503 --> 00:37.537

00:45.212 --> 00:45.879
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:45.879 --> 00:46.580
AND THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.214
THE MASS SHOOTING IN

00:47.214 --> 00:48.181
CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE, HAS

00:48.181 --> 00:49.616
CLAIMED THE LIFE OF A FIFTH

00:49.616 --> 00:50.083
VICTIM.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.752
RANDALL SMITH, A 26-YEAR-OLD

00:51.752 --> 00:52.786
NAVY PETTY OFFICER, DIED THIS

00:52.786 --> 00:55.088
MORNING, TWO DAYS AFTER BEING

00:55.088 --> 00:56.590
SHOT AT A FENCED-IN NAVY AND

00:56.590 --> 00:58.158
MARINE RESERVE CENTER.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.927
SMITH WAS MARRIED WITH THREE

00:59.927 --> 01:00.661
DAUGHTERS.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.362
FOUR UNARMED MARINES DIED

01:02.362 --> 01:03.897
THURSDAY AT THE RESERVE CENTER

01:03.897 --> 01:05.232
WHEN GUNMAN MUHAMMAD YOUSSEF

01:05.232 --> 01:07.134
ABDULAZEEZ OPENED FIRE WITH

01:07.134 --> 01:08.402
MULTIPLE WEAPONS.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.903
POLICE KILLED THE 24-YEAR-OLD

01:09.903 --> 01:12.005
ABDULAZEEZ AT THE SCENE.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.707
ABDULAZEEZ WAS A NATURALIZED

01:13.707 --> 01:15.842
AMERICAN CITIZEN FROM KUWAIT WHO

01:15.842 --> 01:17.144
GREW UP IN TENNESSEE.

01:17.144 --> 01:18.845
HE SPENT SEVEN MONTHS IN JORDAN

01:18.845 --> 01:19.947
LAST YEAR.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.682
REUTERS IS REPORTING A FRIEND OF

01:21.682 --> 01:23.517
ABDULAZEEZ SAYS THE GUNMAN

01:23.517 --> 01:25.719
RETURNED FROM JORDAN "CONCERNED"

01:25.719 --> 01:26.820
OVER THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE

01:26.820 --> 01:28.355
EAST AND THAT SHORTLY BEFORE THE

01:28.355 --> 01:30.791
ATTACK, HE TEXTED HIM AN ISLAMIC

01:30.791 --> 01:31.725
VERSE:

01:31.725 --> 01:32.926
"WHOSOEVER SHOWS ENMITY TO A

01:32.926 --> 01:34.461
FRIEND OF MINE, THEN I HAVE

01:34.461 --> 01:36.563
DECLARED WAR AGAINST HIM."

01:36.563 --> 01:37.497
INVESTIGATORS HAVE NOT OFFERED

01:37.497 --> 01:38.765
ANY EVIDENCE THAT ABDULAZEEZ

01:38.765 --> 01:39.967
MIGHT BE CONNECTED TO ANY

01:39.967 --> 01:41.835
ISLAMIC EXTREMIST GROUP LIKE

01:41.835 --> 01:42.703
ISIS.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.104
SAUDI ARABIA ANNOUNCED TODAY IT

01:44.104 --> 01:45.806
HAS THWARTED ISIS FROM CARRYING

01:45.806 --> 01:47.274
OUT SEVERAL ATTACKS BY ARRESTING

01:47.274 --> 01:49.910
431 PEOPLE IN THE PAST FEW

01:49.910 --> 01:50.477
WEEKS.

01:50.477 --> 01:51.712
THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT SAYS SOME

01:51.712 --> 01:53.714
SUSPECTS PLANNED TO BOMB MOSQUES

01:53.714 --> 01:55.349
IN THE SAUDI KINGDOM, AS WELL AS

01:55.349 --> 01:56.717
DIPLOMATIC AND SECURITY

01:56.717 --> 01:58.385
FACILITIES, WHILE OTHER SUSPECTS

01:58.385 --> 01:59.720
WERE RECRUITING MILITANTS

01:59.720 --> 02:00.988
THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA.

02:00.988 --> 02:01.855
THE GOVERNMENT SAID IT ALSO

02:01.855 --> 02:03.190
ARRESTED SUSPECTS WHO CARRIED

02:03.190 --> 02:04.891
OUT SEVERAL ATTACKS, INCLUDING A

02:04.891 --> 02:06.593
SUICIDE BOMBING IN MAY THAT

02:06.593 --> 02:08.228
KILLED 22 PEOPLE.

02:08.228 --> 02:09.629
AND THERE ARE NEW REPORTS THAT

02:09.629 --> 02:11.865
ISIS MAY HAVE USED CHEMICAL

02:11.865 --> 02:13.367
WEAPONS TO ATTACK KURDISH

02:13.367 --> 02:15.402
FIGHTERS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.137
FIELD INVESTIGATORS AND KURDISH

02:17.137 --> 02:18.805
OFFICIALS SAY ISIS LAUNCHED

02:18.805 --> 02:21.208
SHELLS LOADED WITH TOXIC

02:21.208 --> 02:23.043
INDUSTRIAL OR AGRICULTURAL

02:23.043 --> 02:24.845
CHEMICALS SEVERAL TIMES IN

02:24.845 --> 02:25.812
RECENT WEEKS.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.147
KURDISH FORCES ACCUSED ISIS OF

02:27.147 --> 02:29.016
USING A CHLORINE-BASED CHEMICAL

02:29.016 --> 02:30.851
IN AT LEAST ONE SUICIDE TRUCK

02:30.851 --> 02:32.819
BOMBING EARLIER THIS YEAR, BUT

02:32.819 --> 02:34.821
FIRING CHEMICAL MORTAR SHELLS

02:34.821 --> 02:36.223
FROM A DISTANCE WOULD BE A NEW

02:36.223 --> 02:38.258
TACTIC FOR THE EXTREMISTS.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.526
IN IRAN, SUPREME LEADER

02:39.526 --> 02:40.961
AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI IS

02:40.961 --> 02:42.329
VOICING HIS SUPPORT FOR HIS

02:42.329 --> 02:44.598
COUNTRY'S NUCLEAR DEAL WITH U.S.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.233
AND OTHER WORLD POWERS, BUT

02:46.233 --> 02:48.368
KHAMENEI SAYS THAT DOES NOT

02:48.368 --> 02:50.170
SIGNAL AN END TO HOSTILITIES

02:50.170 --> 02:53.106
WITH THE U.S. OR ISRAEL.

02:53.106 --> 02:53.807
>> (translated): WHETHER THE

02:53.807 --> 02:55.142
DEAL IS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED,

02:55.142 --> 02:56.343
WE WILL NEVER STOP SUPPORTING

02:56.343 --> 02:57.811
OUR FRIENDS IN THE REGION AND

02:57.811 --> 02:59.413
THE PEOPLE OF PALESTINE, YEMEN,

02:59.413 --> 03:01.415
SYRIA, IRAQ, BAHRAIN AND

03:01.415 --> 03:02.382
LEBANON.

03:02.382 --> 03:04.418
EVEN AFTER THIS DEAL, OUR POLICY

03:04.418 --> 03:05.986
TOWARDS THE ARROGANT U.S. WILL

03:05.986 --> 03:07.287
NOT CHANGE.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.188
>> Sreenivasan: IN HIS FIRST

03:08.188 --> 03:09.322
PUBLIC SPEECH SINCE THE DEAL,

03:09.322 --> 03:10.690
KHAMENEI CALLED AMERICA

03:10.690 --> 03:12.392
"AGGRESSIVE AND ATROCIOUS" AND

03:12.392 --> 03:14.928
TOLD HIS AUDIENCE IRAN DID NOT

03:14.928 --> 03:16.029
NEED TO BE STOPPED FROM

03:16.029 --> 03:17.230
DEVELOPING A NUCLEAR WEAPON

03:17.230 --> 03:18.999
SINCE SUCH A WEAPON WOULD

03:18.999 --> 03:21.001
SUPPOSEDLY BE FORBIDDEN UNDER

03:21.001 --> 03:22.569
ISLAMIC LAW.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.271
THE KU KLUX KLAN AND AN AFRICAN-

03:24.271 --> 03:25.772
AMERICAN GROUP HELD OPPOSING

03:25.772 --> 03:27.140
RALLIES TODAY AT THE SOUTH

03:27.140 --> 03:28.675
CAROLINA STATE HOUSE.

03:28.675 --> 03:30.010
BOTH SIDES ARE DEMONSTRATING

03:30.010 --> 03:31.211
OVER THE STATE'S DECISION TO

03:31.211 --> 03:32.746
REMOVE THE CONFEDERATE BATTLE

03:32.746 --> 03:34.181
FLAG LAST WEEK.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.715
THE K.K.K. SAYS REMOVING THE

03:35.715 --> 03:37.350
FLAG IS THE GOVERNMENT'S ATTEMPT

03:37.350 --> 03:39.286
TO "ERASE WHITE CULTURE" FROM

03:39.286 --> 03:40.187
HISTORY.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.421
THE GROUP "BLACK EDUCATORS FOR

03:41.421 --> 03:43.256
JUSTICE" WERE PROTESTING FOR A

03:43.256 --> 03:44.357
DIFFERENT REASON, SAYING THE

03:44.357 --> 03:45.926
FLAG'S REMOVAL IS AN "ILLUSION

03:45.926 --> 03:48.562
OF PROGRESS" IN RACE RELATIONS.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.239
>> Sreenivasan: WHEN A WOMAN

03:59.239 --> 04:00.674
REPORTS A RAPE SOON AFTER IT

04:00.674 --> 04:02.209
OCCURS, AUTHORITIES ARE ABLE TO

04:02.209 --> 04:03.910
GET A RAPE KIT, PHYSICAL

04:03.910 --> 04:04.911
EVIDENCE EXTRACTED FROM THE

04:04.911 --> 04:06.780
VICTIM'S BODY WHICH MAY CONTAIN

04:06.780 --> 04:08.715
THE VALUABLE D.N.A. OF THE

04:08.715 --> 04:09.916
PERPETRATOR.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.451
BUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTERWARD?

04:11.451 --> 04:12.552
THERE HAVE BEEN STORIES OVER THE

04:12.552 --> 04:13.720
YEARS OF CITIES LIKE NEW YORK,

04:13.720 --> 04:15.088
LOS ANGELES AND DETROIT FACING

04:15.088 --> 04:17.290
MASSIVE BACKLOGS OF UNTESTED

04:17.290 --> 04:19.192
RAPE KITS, BUT THIS WEEK WE

04:19.192 --> 04:20.961
LEARNED THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER

04:20.961 --> 04:22.762
PROBLEM AROUND THE COUNTRY.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.830
A NEW INVESTIGATION BY THE

04:23.830 --> 04:25.098
"U.S.A. TODAY" MEDIA NETWORK

04:25.098 --> 04:27.834
FINDS AT LEAST 70,000 RAPE KITS

04:27.834 --> 04:29.703
REMAIN UNTESTED IN MORE THAN

04:29.703 --> 04:31.538
1,000 DIFFERENT POLICE

04:31.538 --> 04:32.272
DEPARTMENTS.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.373
KEEP IN MIND THERE ARE MORE THAN

04:33.373 --> 04:34.608
18,000 DIFFERENT POLICE

04:34.608 --> 04:36.176
DEPARTMENTS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

04:36.176 --> 04:38.678
POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN 34 STATES

04:38.678 --> 04:40.080
HAVE NEVER EVEN TAKEN AN

04:40.080 --> 04:42.082
INVENTORY OF THE EVIDENCE STILL

04:42.082 --> 04:44.718
SITTING ON THE SHELVES UNTESTED,

04:44.718 --> 04:47.020
AND POLICE IN 44 STATES HAVE NO

04:47.020 --> 04:49.422
GUIDELINES OF WHEN TO TEST RAPE

04:49.422 --> 04:49.990
KITS.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.591
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY,

04:51.591 --> 04:52.792
AND TO HELP US UNDERSTAND IS

04:52.792 --> 04:53.894
REPORTER STEVE REILLY FROM

04:53.894 --> 04:54.494
"U.S.A. TODAY."

04:54.494 --> 04:56.363
SO, IT'S NOT JUST ONE NEWSPAPER.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.298
TELL US ABOUT HOW YOU PULLED OFF

04:58.298 --> 05:00.433
THIS LARGE-SCALE INVESTIGATION.

05:00.433 --> 05:00.967
>> EXACTLY.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.636
WELL WE SURVEYED LAW ENFORCEMENT

05:02.636 --> 05:04.070
AGENCIES AS YOU SAID ACROSS THE

05:04.070 --> 05:06.173
COUNTRY AND FOUND FIGURES AT

05:06.173 --> 05:07.140
MORE THAN A THOUSAND LAW

05:07.140 --> 05:09.442
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHERE WE

05:09.442 --> 05:12.045
IDENTIFIED UNTESTED SEXUAL

05:12.045 --> 05:13.079
ASSAULT KITS.

05:13.079 --> 05:15.448
EACH OF OUR BROADCAST AND

05:15.448 --> 05:16.983
CURRENT PARTNERS INVESTIGATED

05:16.983 --> 05:18.518
THE ISSUE IN THEIR OWN

05:18.518 --> 05:19.753
COMMUNITIES AND WE LOOKED AT THE

05:19.753 --> 05:21.988
SCOPE AND BREADTH OF THIS ISSUE

05:21.988 --> 05:22.989
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

05:22.989 --> 05:23.690
>> Sreenivasan: AREN'T ALL THESE

05:23.690 --> 05:25.225
ENTERED INTO A STATE OR

05:25.225 --> 05:26.993
NATIONAL DATABASE SO YOU CAN

05:26.993 --> 05:28.695
FIND, SAY, SERIAL RAPISTS ACROSS

05:28.695 --> 05:29.529
STATE LINES?

05:29.529 --> 05:30.197
>> EXACTLY.

05:30.197 --> 05:33.200
THAT'S WHAT MANY ADVOCATES ARE

05:33.200 --> 05:35.635
MAKING THE POINT ABOUT THESE

05:35.635 --> 05:38.338
DAYS IS THE USEFULNESS OF STATE

05:38.338 --> 05:41.074
AND FEDERAL D.N.A. DATABASES HAS

05:41.074 --> 05:42.375
GROWN DRASTICALLY OVER JUST

05:42.375 --> 05:44.244
ABOUT SEVERAL DECADES.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.246
AND THIS EVIDENCE IS MUCH MORE

05:46.246 --> 05:49.049
VALUABLE AND MUCH MORE ABLE TO

05:49.049 --> 05:51.985
HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT IDENTIFY

05:51.985 --> 05:54.321
SUSPECTS THAN IT EVER HAS BEEN.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.021
>> Sreenivasan: AND IT'S

05:55.021 --> 05:56.122
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT EVEN

05:56.122 --> 05:59.025
BEHIND THIS 70,000 NUMBER,

05:59.025 --> 06:00.260
THERE'S A STORY, THERE'S A

06:00.260 --> 06:01.895
PERSON BEHIND EACH ONE OF THEM.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.029
THIS ISN'T EVEN THE COMPLETE

06:03.029 --> 06:04.030
NUMBER, IT COULD BE MUCH BIGGER

06:04.030 --> 06:04.664
THAN THIS.

06:04.664 --> 06:05.699
>> ABSOLUTELY.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.568
LIKE YOU SAID, WE OBTAINED DATA

06:08.568 --> 06:10.103
FOR ABOUT A THOUSAND LAW

06:10.103 --> 06:11.371
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND THAT'S

06:11.371 --> 06:12.305
A SMALL PORTION OF THE NATION'S

06:12.305 --> 06:15.375
18,000 LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.244
NO GOVERNMENT ENTITY HAS GONE

06:17.244 --> 06:18.778
AND COMPREHENSIVELY LOOKED AT

06:18.778 --> 06:19.613
THAT.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.214
BUT LIKE YOU SAID, BEHIND THE

06:21.214 --> 06:24.351
FIGURES, EACH KIT IS SOMEONE'S

06:24.351 --> 06:29.522
STORY AND, YOU KNOW, TESTING

06:29.522 --> 06:32.926
INDIVIDUAL KITS, YOU KNOW, CAN

06:32.926 --> 06:35.495
MEAN A LOT TO A SURVIVOR OF ONE

06:35.495 --> 06:36.563
OF THESE INCIDENTS.

06:36.563 --> 06:37.964
>> Sreenivasan: YOU DOCUMENT HOW

06:37.964 --> 06:39.366
SOME OF THESE SURVIVORS, UNTIL

06:39.366 --> 06:42.535
THIS TESTS WENT THROUGH, WAS IN

06:42.535 --> 06:44.137
FEAR, NOT KNOWING WHETHER THEIR

06:44.137 --> 06:45.739
PREDATOR WAS OUT THERE.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.773
>> WHEN THESE KITS AREN'T

06:46.773 --> 06:48.808
TESTED, SOMEONE HAS GONE THROUGH

06:48.808 --> 06:51.811
THE TERRIBLE PROCESS OF HAVING

06:51.811 --> 06:53.580
THESE KITS COLLECTED, AS THE

06:53.580 --> 06:55.181
PROCESS CAN TAKE UP TO FOUR TO

06:55.181 --> 06:58.351
SIX HOURS AFTER WE'VE COLLECTED

06:58.351 --> 06:59.586
THIS EVIDENCE.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.555
AND SO, IT'S A VERY SENSITIVE

07:02.555 --> 07:06.226
PROCESS, AND IT CAN BE DIFFICULT

07:06.226 --> 07:08.094
FOR SOME TO HEAR THAT THESE KITS

07:08.094 --> 07:09.162
AREN'T BEING TESTED IN SOME

07:09.162 --> 07:12.565
CASES, AND IT CAN MEAN... IT'S

07:12.565 --> 07:14.534
TREMENDOUSLY MEANINGFUL TO HAVE

07:14.534 --> 07:16.536
THESE CASES RESOLVED.

07:16.536 --> 07:17.671
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF THE

07:17.671 --> 07:18.772
THINGS THE POLICE DEPARTMENTS

BECOMES 18, HE WON'T HAVE TO GO,

21:27.219 --> 21:30.089
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE.

21:30.089 --> 21:30.623
>> Reporter: THAT'S BEEN EVERY

21:30.623 --> 21:31.891
GENERATION'S DREAM HERE?

21:31.891 --> 21:32.925
>> EXACTLY.

21:32.925 --> 21:33.759
>> Reporter: KARATE ISN'T ONLY

21:33.759 --> 21:35.194
ABOUT THE BODY, BUT THE MIND,

21:35.194 --> 21:36.128
TOO.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.897
AND IN JERUSALEM'S ALYN

21:37.897 --> 21:38.931
HOSPITAL, THE KARATE COLLEAGUES

21:38.931 --> 21:41.467
BROUGHT THEIR MESSAGE OF HOPE TO

21:41.467 --> 21:44.036
CHILDREN WHO CAN REALLY USE IT.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.237
>> THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO DO A FULL

21:45.237 --> 21:46.338
PUNCH.

21:46.338 --> 21:47.406
THEY JUST DO THIS.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.375
BUT FOR THEM INSIDE, IT'S A HUGE

21:49.375 --> 21:50.376
ACHIEVEMENT.

21:50.376 --> 21:51.177
>> Reporter: KHALIL DOES SIMILAR

21:51.177 --> 21:53.012
WORK IN JORDAN, BRINGING MARTIAL

21:53.012 --> 21:54.813
ARTS TO CHILDREN WHO BENEFIT IN

21:54.813 --> 21:57.449
THE BODY AND MAYBE THE MIND.

21:57.449 --> 21:58.551
>> ALL THE PARENTS, ALL THE

21:58.551 --> 22:00.486
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE IN THE

22:00.486 --> 22:02.988
HOSPITAL, THEY TOLD ME, "THE

22:02.988 --> 22:05.224
CHILDREN ARE GETTING BETTER

22:05.224 --> 22:06.992
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY."

22:06.992 --> 22:08.127
WELL, I SAID, "OH, MAKE ME HAPPY

22:08.127 --> 22:09.228
THIS."

22:09.228 --> 22:10.429
>> Reporter: FIGHTING FOR PEACE,

22:10.429 --> 22:11.997
FOR YOUNG AND OLD.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.571

22:28.814 --> 22:30.249
WE RETURN TO LAST WEEK'S SEGMENT

22:30.249 --> 22:31.850
ABOUT HARPER LEE'S NEW NOVEL,

22:31.850 --> 22:33.686
"GO SET A WATCHMAN," AND THE

22:33.686 --> 22:35.187
REVELATION THAT LEE'S BELOVED

22:35.187 --> 22:36.622
CHARACTER FROM "TO KILL A

22:36.622 --> 22:38.023
MOCKINGBIRD," ATTICUS FINCH,

22:38.023 --> 22:39.892
HOLDS RACIST VIEWS.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.327
>> ATTICUS FINCH IS REVEALED TO

22:41.327 --> 22:43.996
BE A SEGREGATIONIST, SOMEONE WHO

22:43.996 --> 22:46.031
JOINS AN ORGANIZATION TO RESIST

22:46.031 --> 22:48.033
THE INTEGRATION MOVEMENT THAT

22:48.033 --> 22:49.235
HAPPENED AFTER BROWN VERSUS

22:49.235 --> 22:50.502
BOARD OF EDUCATION.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.437
>> Sreenivasan: WRITERFROMTEXAS

22:51.437 --> 22:52.204
SAID:

22:52.204 --> 22:53.138
"IT WAS CLEAR IN 'TO KILL A

22:53.138 --> 22:54.373
MOCKINGBIRD' THAT ATTICUS

22:54.373 --> 22:56.508
DEFENDED HIS CLIENT BECAUSE THAT

22:56.508 --> 22:58.143
IS HOW THE LAW IN THIS COUNTRY

22:58.143 --> 22:59.845
IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.

22:59.845 --> 23:01.113
KUDOS TO HIM FOR THAT.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.115
THE BOOK HINTED THAT THIS WAS

23:03.115 --> 23:05.150
DESPITE ATTICUS' BELIEFS.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.585
WOULD THAT ALL PERSONS TODAY

23:06.585 --> 23:07.620
RECEIVED ADEQUATE

23:07.620 --> 23:08.954
REPRESENTATION."

23:08.954 --> 23:10.389
CALIPENGUIN HOPED SCHOOLS WOULD

23:10.389 --> 23:11.957
USE THE CHANGE IN ATTICUS

23:11.957 --> 23:12.725
FINCH:

23:12.725 --> 23:13.959
"WILL SCHOOL DISTRICTS BAN THAT

23:13.959 --> 23:15.761
NOVEL NOW THAT ATTICUS TURNS OUT

23:15.761 --> 23:17.096
TO BE A SEGREGATIONIST IN THE

23:17.096 --> 23:17.896
SEQUEL?

23:17.896 --> 23:18.964
I HOPE NOT.

23:18.964 --> 23:19.832
TEACHERS SHOULD USE THIS

23:19.832 --> 23:21.066
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE

23:21.066 --> 23:22.635
SPECTRUM OF CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES

23:22.635 --> 23:24.103
IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY."

23:24.103 --> 23:25.604
PHOEBE GAVIN DEFENDED HARPER

23:25.604 --> 23:26.538
LEE:

23:26.538 --> 23:27.406
"I'M VERY ANNOYED BY THE

23:27.406 --> 23:28.474
REACTIONS.

23:28.474 --> 23:29.775
NO MATTER HOW INVESTED YOU ARE

23:29.775 --> 23:31.143
IN A CHARACTER, YOU DON'T OWN

23:31.143 --> 23:33.078
THEM-- THE AUTHOR DOES.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.780
ONLY THE AUTHOR KNOWS WHO ANY

23:34.780 --> 23:37.149
PARTICULAR CHARACTER TRULY IS."

23:37.149 --> 23:38.684
MICHAEL McLELLAN ADDED:

23:38.684 --> 23:40.819
"BOTH ARE FICTION, BOTH ARE

23:40.819 --> 23:42.087
SEPARATE ENTITIES.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.355
READING THIS NEW NOVEL SHOULD

23:43.355 --> 23:45.224
HAVE NO EFFECT ON HOW YOU VIEW

23:45.224 --> 23:46.392
'MOCKINGBIRD.'"

23:46.392 --> 23:47.993
DAVID UFFER LAMENTED:

23:47.993 --> 23:49.895
"ARE THERE TO BE NO HEROES LEFT

23:49.895 --> 23:51.330
STANDING IN THIS CRAZED

23:51.330 --> 23:52.765
TORMENTED WORLD!?"

23:52.765 --> 23:55.034
KATHI DUGINSKI WANTED NO PART OF

23:55.034 --> 23:56.168
THE NEW BOOK:

23:56.168 --> 23:57.703
"IF THAT IS TRUE, I WON'T READ

23:57.703 --> 23:58.370
IT.

23:58.370 --> 23:59.738
I LOVE THE ATTICUS FINCH I HAVE

23:59.738 --> 24:01.373
KNOWN SINCE I WAS A CHILD."

24:01.373 --> 24:02.841
AND JOHN HERGT TOOK A MORE

24:02.841 --> 24:04.310
CYNICAL APPROACH:

24:04.310 --> 24:06.111
"IT'S SIMPLY AN INFERIOR EARLIER

24:06.111 --> 24:07.846
EFFORT THAT WAS SCRAPPED AND NOW

24:07.846 --> 24:09.214
RESURRECTED FOR MONEY."

PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL "NATURE

24:27.900 --> 24:29.702
CLIMATE CHANGE" FINDS GLOBAL

STREAM OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN,

24:33.005 --> 24:35.441
ADDING A MINUTE PER ROUND TRIP

24:35.441 --> 24:37.009
TO AIRLINE FLIGHT TIMES.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.344
RESEARCHERS SAY THAT EXTRA

24:38.344 --> 24:39.878
MINUTE, APPLIED TO EVERY

24:39.878 --> 24:41.580
COMMERCIAL U.S. FLIGHT, COULD

24:41.580 --> 24:43.949
COST 300,000 HOURS OF FLIGHT

24:43.949 --> 24:45.884
TIME AND A BILLION GALLONS OF

24:45.884 --> 24:47.286
JET FUEL PER YEAR.

THAT'S ALL FOR TONIGHT.
