BIASED IN THE SENSE THAT        
THEY GAVE A LOT MORE WEIGHT     

10:27.815 --> 10:29.440
BIASED IN THE SENSE THAT        
THEY GAVE A LOT MORE WEIGHT     
TO STUDIES THAT MIGHT HAVE A    

10:29.441 --> 10:31.132
THEY GAVE A LOT MORE WEIGHT     
TO STUDIES THAT MIGHT HAVE A    
NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT IMPACT.

TO STUDIES THAT MIGHT HAVE A    
NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT IMPACT.     
AND LESS WEIGHT TO A VAST

BEEN WORKING HARD, PEOPLE       
WHO ARE PLAYING BY THE RULES,   
WHO ARE PRODUCTIVE WHO ARE      

13:05.217 --> 13:06.942
WHO ARE PLAYING BY THE RULES,   
WHO ARE PRODUCTIVE WHO ARE      
GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY AN      

13:06.944 --> 13:07.672
WHO ARE PRODUCTIVE WHO ARE      
GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY AN      
CAN'T LIFT THEIR FAMILIES       

13:07.673 --> 13:08.633
GOING TO WORK EVERY DAY AN      
CAN'T LIFT THEIR FAMILIES       
OUT OF POVERTY.                 

13:08.635 --> 13:09.727
CAN'T LIFT THEIR FAMILIES       
OUT OF POVERTY.                 
SO I THINK THIS STUDY GOES      

13:09.730 --> 13:10.658
OUT OF POVERTY.                 
SO I THINK THIS STUDY GOES      
TO SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.    

13:10.660 --> 13:12.084
SO I THINK THIS STUDY GOES      
TO SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.    
THIS IS THE HOT TOPIC RIGHT     

13:12.086 --> 13:12.548
TO SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.    
THIS IS THE HOT TOPIC RIGHT     
NOW.                            

13:12.551 --> 13:13.875
THIS IS THE HOT TOPIC RIGHT     
NOW.                            
THE MINIMUM WAGE, RAISING       

13:13.876 --> 13:15.136
NOW.                            
THE MINIMUM WAGE, RAISING       
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS             

13:15.138 --> 13:16.065
THE MINIMUM WAGE, RAISING       
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS             
INCREDIBLY POPULAR.             

13:16.066 --> 13:17.127
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS             
INCREDIBLY POPULAR.             
IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE        

13:17.128 --> 13:17.459
INCREDIBLY POPULAR.             
IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE        
ECONOMY.                        

13:17.461 --> 13:18.820
IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE        
ECONOMY.                        
AND IN FACT IT'S GOOD FOR A     

13:18.821 --> 13:19.450
ECONOMY.                        
AND IN FACT IT'S GOOD FOR A     
LOT OF BUSINESSES.              

13:19.451 --> 13:20.843
AND IN FACT IT'S GOOD FOR A     
LOT OF BUSINESSES.              
AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE       

13:20.845 --> 13:22.900
LOT OF BUSINESSES.              
AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE       
THAT EVEN BUSINESSES, THE       

13:22.902 --> 13:24.294
AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE       
THAT EVEN BUSINESSES, THE       
GAP JUST ANNOUNCED TODAY IT     

13:24.296 --> 13:25.588
THAT EVEN BUSINESSES, THE       
GAP JUST ANNOUNCED TODAY IT     
IS GOING TO VOLUNTARILY         

13:25.589 --> 13:27.014
GAP JUST ANNOUNCED TODAY IT     
IS GOING TO VOLUNTARILY         
RAISE WAGES FOR ITS WORKERS.    

13:27.015 --> 13:27.977
IS GOING TO VOLUNTARILY         
RAISE WAGES FOR ITS WORKERS.    
HAVE FOUND THAT SOME SO OF      

13:27.979 --> 13:30.331
RAISE WAGES FOR ITS WORKERS.    
HAVE FOUND THAT SOME SO OF      
THE BENEFITS OF A HIGHER        

13:30.333 --> 13:31.361
HAVE FOUND THAT SOME SO OF      
THE BENEFITS OF A HIGHER        
MINIMUM WAGE THAT THERE IS      

13:31.363 --> 13:31.891
THE BENEFITS OF A HIGHER        
MINIMUM WAGE THAT THERE IS      
HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY.            

13:31.894 --> 13:33.551
MINIMUM WAGE THAT THERE IS      
HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY.            
THERE IS LOWER TURNOVER,        

13:33.553 --> 13:35.873
HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY.            
THERE IS LOWER TURNOVER,        
LOWER ADD SENTEEISM, WORKERS    

13:35.875 --> 13:37.499
THERE IS LOWER TURNOVER,        
LOWER ADD SENTEEISM, WORKERS    
ARE HEALTHIER, HAPPIER, THEY    

13:37.501 --> 13:38.129
LOWER ADD SENTEEISM, WORKERS    
ARE HEALTHIER, HAPPIER, THEY    
STAY IN THE JOB LONGER.         

13:38.131 --> 13:39.523
ARE HEALTHIER, HAPPIER, THEY    
STAY IN THE JOB LONGER.         
THOSE ARE ALLOLOGICAL           

13:39.525 --> 13:40.618
STAY IN THE JOB LONGER.         
THOSE ARE ALLOLOGICAL           
IMPORTANT OFFSETTING IMPACTS    

13:40.619 --> 13:41.580
THOSE ARE ALLOLOGICAL           
IMPORTANT OFFSETTING IMPACTS    
THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO

THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO      
ACCOUNT.                        
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE NEW

THAT'S WHY I THINK THE NEW      
ECONOMIC RESEARCH WHICH         

13:44.469 --> 13:46.392
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE NEW      
ECONOMIC RESEARCH WHICH         
ISN'T ABOUT THEORIES, IT'S      

13:46.394 --> 13:48.083

NOT ABOUT DRAWING A SUPPLY

FIND THAT THERE IS A            
NEGATIVE JOB IMPACT FROM        

14:06.465 --> 14:08.124
FIND THAT THERE IS A            
NEGATIVE JOB IMPACT FROM        
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE.       

14:08.126 --> 14:09.185
NEGATIVE JOB IMPACT FROM        
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE.       
>> DAVID NEUMARK, YOU CAN       

14:09.187 --> 14:10.313
RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE.       
>> DAVID NEUMARK, YOU CAN       
RESPOND TO THAT.                

14:10.315 --> 14:12.171
>> DAVID NEUMARK, YOU CAN       
RESPOND TO THAT.                
BUT EVEN SETTING THAT ASIDE,    

14:12.172 --> 14:14.394
RESPOND TO THAT.                
BUT EVEN SETTING THAT ASIDE,    
WHAT ABOUT THE POSITIVE THAT    

14:14.396 --> 14:17.646
BUT EVEN SETTING THAT ASIDE,    
WHAT ABOUT THE POSITIVE THAT    
THE CBO FOUND, THAT POVERTY     

14:17.648 --> 14:19.969
WHAT ABOUT THE POSITIVE THAT    
THE CBO FOUND, THAT POVERTY     
WOULD BE REDUCED, THAT          

14:19.971 --> 14:21.694
THE CBO FOUND, THAT POVERTY     
WOULD BE REDUCED, THAT          
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD END    

14:21.695 --> 14:23.320
WOULD BE REDUCED, THAT          
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD END    
UP WITH HIGHER INCOME.          

14:23.321 --> 14:26.041
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD END    
UP WITH HIGHER INCOME.          
THE POINT THAT MS. LEE JUST     

14:26.043 --> 14:27.235
UP WITH HIGHER INCOME.          
THE POINT THAT MS. LEE JUST     
MADE THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE     

14:27.237 --> 14:28.761
THE POINT THAT MS. LEE JUST     
MADE THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE     
MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME.         

14:28.762 --> 14:30.120
MADE THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE     
MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME.         
>> RIGHT, SO VERY BRIEFLY,      

14:30.123 --> 14:31.448
MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME.         
>> RIGHT, SO VERY BRIEFLY,      
THE STUDIES I WAS REFERRING     

14:31.449 --> 14:33.473
>> RIGHT, SO VERY BRIEFLY,      
THE STUDIES I WAS REFERRING     
TO ARE NOT THEORY, THEY ARE     

14:33.475 --> 14:35.263
THE STUDIES I WAS REFERRING     
TO ARE NOT THEORY, THEY ARE     
STUDIES OF                      

14:35.266 --> 14:35.794
TO ARE NOT THEORY, THEY ARE     
STUDIES OF                      
IMPERIAL-- EMPIRICAL            

14:35.796 --> 14:36.160
STUDIES OF                      
IMPERIAL-- EMPIRICAL            
EVIDENCE.

IMPERIAL-- EMPIRICAL            
EVIDENCE.                       
SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE        

14:37.290 --> 14:38.051
EVIDENCE.                       
SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE        
RESEARCH AND WHAT IS GOOD       

14:38.053 --> 14:40.075
SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE        
RESEARCH AND WHAT IS GOOD       
AND BAD BUT LET'S NOT           

14:40.077 --> 14:40.738
RESEARCH AND WHAT IS GOOD       
AND BAD BUT LET'S NOT           
MISCHARACTERIZE THE RESEARCH    

14:40.740 --> 14:41.071
AND BAD BUT LET'S NOT           
MISCHARACTERIZE THE RESEARCH    
RECORD.                         

14:41.073 --> 14:42.165
MISCHARACTERIZE THE RESEARCH    
RECORD.                         
WHY ARE WE HAVING THIS          

14:42.166 --> 14:43.194
RECORD.                         
WHY ARE WE HAVING THIS          
DEFWHAT FIRST PLACE.            

14:43.196 --> 14:44.189
WHY ARE WE HAVING THIS          
DEFWHAT FIRST PLACE.            
WE'RE HAVING THIS DEBATE IN     

14:44.191 --> 14:45.549
DEFWHAT FIRST PLACE.            
WE'RE HAVING THIS DEBATE IN     
THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE         

14:45.550 --> 14:46.909
WE'RE HAVING THIS DEBATE IN     
THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE         
INEQUALITY HAS WIDENED A LOT    

14:46.912 --> 14:48.668
THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE         
INEQUALITY HAS WIDENED A LOT    
AND MANY PEOPLE FEEL AND I      

14:48.671 --> 14:49.995
INEQUALITY HAS WIDENED A LOT    
AND MANY PEOPLE FEEL AND I      
RANK MYSELF AMONG THEM, THAT    

14:49.997 --> 14:51.719
AND MANY PEOPLE FEEL AND I      
RANK MYSELF AMONG THEM, THAT    
IN A COUNTRY AS RICH AS OURS    

14:51.722 --> 14:53.778
RANK MYSELF AMONG THEM, THAT    
IN A COUNTRY AS RICH AS OURS    
THE MINIMALLY EXPANDED,         

14:53.780 --> 14:54.840
IN A COUNTRY AS RICH AS OURS    
THE MINIMALLY EXPANDED,         
SHOULD PROBABLY BE HIGHER       

14:54.842 --> 14:55.470
THE MINIMALLY EXPANDED,         
SHOULD PROBABLY BE HIGHER       
THAN IT IS.                     

14:55.472 --> 14:56.466
SHOULD PROBABLY BE HIGHER       
THAN IT IS.                     
SO THAT'S THE GOAL.             

14:56.468 --> 14:57.528
THAN IT IS.                     
SO THAT'S THE GOAL.             
HOW DO WE RAISE INCOMES OF      

14:57.530 --> 14:58.555
SO THAT'S THE GOAL.             
HOW DO WE RAISE INCOMES OF      
LOW INCOME FAMILIES.            

14:58.558 --> 14:59.584
HOW DO WE RAISE INCOMES OF      
LOW INCOME FAMILIES.            
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE     

14:59.586 --> 15:01.077
LOW INCOME FAMILIES.            
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE     
BEST WAY TO DO IT.              

15:01.078 --> 15:03.300
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE     
BEST WAY TO DO IT.              
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS             

15:03.302 --> 15:04.660
BEST WAY TO DO IT.              
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS             
GENERALLY VIEWED AS NOT A       

15:04.662 --> 15:05.755
THE MINIMUM WAGE IS             
GENERALLY VIEWED AS NOT A       
VERY GOOD WAY TO ACHIEVE        

15:05.758 --> 15:07.381
GENERALLY VIEWED AS NOT A       
VERY GOOD WAY TO ACHIEVE        
THAT GOAL FOR ONE SIMPLE        

15:07.384 --> 15:08.410
VERY GOOD WAY TO ACHIEVE        
THAT GOAL FOR ONE SIMPLE        
REASON.                         

15:08.412 --> 15:10.434
THAT GOAL FOR ONE SIMPLE        
REASON.                         
MINIMUM WAGES DON'T TARGET      

15:10.436 --> 15:11.760
REASON.                         
MINIMUM WAGES DON'T TARGET      
POOR AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES    

15:11.763 --> 15:12.424
MINIMUM WAGES DON'T TARGET      
POOR AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES    
VERY WELL.                      

15:12.426 --> 15:13.785
POOR AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES    
VERY WELL.                      
MANY, MANY FAMILIES THAT ARE    

15:13.786 --> 15:15.510
VERY WELL.                      
MANY, MANY FAMILIES THAT ARE    
PORE HAVE NO WORKERS, OKAY.     

15:15.512 --> 15:17.269
MANY, MANY FAMILIES THAT ARE    
PORE HAVE NO WORKERS, OKAY.     
SO THE MINIMUM WAGE DOES        

15:17.271 --> 15:18.594
PORE HAVE NO WORKERS, OKAY.     
SO THE MINIMUM WAGE DOES        
LITTLE OR NOTHING FOR THEM.     

15:18.596 --> 15:20.918
SO THE MINIMUM WAGE DOES        
LITTLE OR NOTHING FOR THEM.     
AN MANY MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS    

15:20.919 --> 15:22.246
LITTLE OR NOTHING FOR THEM.     
AN MANY MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS    
ARE NONPOOR FAMILIES.           

15:22.247 --> 15:23.938
AN MANY MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS    
ARE NONPOOR FAMILIES.           
WE HAVE AN EARNED INCOME TAX    

15:23.939 --> 15:24.336
ARE NONPOOR FAMILIES.           
WE HAVE AN EARNED INCOME TAX    
CREDIT.                         

15:24.338 --> 15:25.298
WE HAVE AN EARNED INCOME TAX    
CREDIT.                         
PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE MORE       

15:25.301 --> 15:25.995
CREDIT.                         
PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE MORE       
GENEROUS THAN IT IS.            

15:25.996 --> 15:28.019
PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE MORE       
GENEROUS THAN IT IS.            
THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT    

15:28.021 --> 15:29.246
GENEROUS THAN IT IS.            
THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT    
ESSENTIALLY ADDS ON TO YOUR     

15:29.247 --> 15:30.474
THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT    
ESSENTIALLY ADDS ON TO YOUR     
LABOR MARKET EARNINGS IF YOU    

15:30.476 --> 15:31.800
ESSENTIALLY ADDS ON TO YOUR     
LABOR MARKET EARNINGS IF YOU    
ARE IN A LOW INCOME FAMILY.
