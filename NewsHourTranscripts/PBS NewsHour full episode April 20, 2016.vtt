JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
the road ahead after Donald
Trump and Hillary

00:11.812 --> 00:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's big wins in the New
York primaries.
Are the party nominations
further out of reach

00:17.517 --> 00:19.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the rest of the candidates?

00:19.419 --> 00:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday:
a makeover for American money.
Treasury Secretary

00:23.824 --> 00:29.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jack Lew talks about putting
women on U.S.
currency for the first time in
over 100 years.

00:29.296 --> 00:34.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how community
leaders in
Memphis, Tennessee, are working
to break the

00:34.468 --> 00:39.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cycle of childhood trauma which
can lead to
serious health consequences in
adults.

00:39.473 --> 00:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALICIA NORMAN, Principal, Perea
Preschool:
They are out of control, 3- and
4-year-olds.

00:44.578 --> 00:48.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it breaks my heart to see
that a child
has been broken so early in
life.

00:48.282 --> 00:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.355 --> 00:58.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.058 --> 01:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The top two
candidates in the
presidential race are feeling
pretty good

01:07.234 --> 01:11.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, after they cleaned up in
the New York
state primaries.

01:11.104 --> 01:18.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now they're looking to hold
their challengers
at bay in the contests yet to
come.

01:18.111 --> 01:23.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, fresh off winning
big in his
home state, moved on to the
Midwest and the

01:23.216 --> 01:30.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indiana primary on May 3. Unlike
last night,
when he took a more restrained
tone, today,

01:30.057 --> 01:31.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he was on the attack.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I'm a million of votes ahead,
millions, million

01:35.696 --> 01:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of votes ahead of lyin' Ted
Cruz, right?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:41.601 --> 01:46.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm about 300
delegates ahead
of lyin' Ted.

01:46.440 --> 01:52.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But in
Pennsylvania today,
Texas Senator Ted Cruz insisted
the race for

01:52.079 --> 01:54.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the GOP nomination is far from
over.

01:54.715 --> 01:59.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
And there's a reason Donald
wants all of the

01:59.486 --> 02:05.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lapdogs in the media to say that
the race
is over, because the three weeks
that preceded

02:05.892 --> 02:13.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday, there were a total of
five states
that voted, Utah, Wisconsin,
North Dakota,

02:13.700 --> 02:18.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Colorado, Wyoming. In all five,
we won a landslide.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:20.640 --> 02:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cruz predicted a
contested
convention is inevitable,
telling a Philadelphia

02:25.579 --> 02:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radio station nobody is getting
1,237 delegates
to clinch the nomination before
then.

02:32.686 --> 02:38.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But on the Democratic side,
Hillary Clinton's
double-digit victory last night
puts her on

02:38.992 --> 02:42.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
track to wrap things up before
convention
time.

02:42.295 --> 02:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
The race for the nomination is
in the home

02:46.733 --> 02:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stretch, and victory is in
sight.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:49.736 --> 02:53.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton
campaigned in Philadelphia
today.

02:53.473 --> 02:59.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were mixed messages coming
out of the
Bernie Sanders campaign after
his 16-point

02:59.112 --> 03:05.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loss in New York. Last night,
senior adviser
Tad Devine said they will --
quote -- "assess

03:05.185 --> 03:07.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where we are after next week's
primaries."

03:07.788 --> 03:09.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Today, he took a different tack.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAD DEVINE, Senior Bernie
Sanders Campaign
Strategist: I think we have a
lot of time.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got over 1,400 delegates
still to
be picked. We have got huge
states like California

03:14.861 --> 03:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still in play. Only Bernie
Sanders can do
something that we need to do to
win the general

03:19.733 --> 03:21.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
election, bring in young people.

03:21.501 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sanders himself
took the day
off from campaigning, and
returned home to

03:25.639 --> 03:27.474 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Vermont.

03:27.507 --> 03:30.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The strongest aftershock yet
rattled earthquake

03:30.544 --> 03:36.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survivors in Ecuador, as the
confirmed death
toll reached 553. The latest
tremor struck

03:36.249 --> 03:41.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some 15 miles offshore, before
dawn, but there
were no reports of new damage.

03:41.121 --> 03:45.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, aid continued to pour
into the
ravaged country. The Peruvian
military also

03:45.425 --> 03:49.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
joined in to help transfer
victims from the
quake zones to hospitals.

03:49.663 --> 03:55.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's evidence
today of an
apparent migrant disaster at sea
in the Mediterranean.

03:55.335 --> 04:01.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Refugee Agency and the
International
Organization for Migration say
survivors report

04:01.675 --> 04:05.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up to 500 people drowned off
Libya last week.

04:05.879 --> 04:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva today, U.N. officials
said smugglers
tried to put too many people
into a crowded

04:11.585 --> 04:13.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ship bound for Italy.

04:13.420 --> 04:17.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM SPINDLER, United
Nations: We understand
that about 100 to 200 people
left Tobruk in

04:17.958 --> 04:23.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Libya on the way to Italy. And
they were being
transferred by the smugglers who
were in command

04:23.530 --> 04:29.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of their boat to a larger vessel
that was
already carrying hundreds of
people. And while

04:29.970 --> 04:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were doing this in the
middle of the
sea at night, the bigger vessel
went down.

04:35.342 --> 04:41.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The flow of
migrants from Africa
to Italy is increasing as the
weather warms.

04:41.448 --> 04:47.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Greek Prime Minister Alexis
Tsipras said
today the European Union's deal
with Turkey

04:47.154 --> 04:49.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has sharply reduced the flow to
his country.

04:49.389 --> 04:53.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In
Afghanistan, the death
toll from a Taliban attack in
Kabul more than

04:53.793 --> 04:58.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doubled overnight to 64. A
suicide bomber
and gunmen assaulted a
government security

04:58.131 --> 05:03.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agency yesterday nearby the
presidential palace.
Officials now say most of the
victims were

05:03.403 --> 05:05.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
civilians, including women and
children.

05:05.672 --> 05:11.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
arrived in
Saudi Arabia today, hoping to
reassure a skeptical

05:11.311 --> 05:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ally. Tensions were evident as
the president
arrived, and was greeted by the
local governor

05:16.483 --> 05:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not King Salman. The two
leaders did meet
later, and offered smiles and
gracious words.

05:22.822 --> 05:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Saudis have opposed the
president's outreach
to Iran and his approach to
Syria.

05:27.761 --> 05:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The U.S.
Supreme Court has
upheld a judgment that forces
Iran to compensate

05:32.832 --> 05:39.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victims of terror attacks. They
include relatives
of 241 U.S. Marines killed in a
Beirut bombing

05:39.239 --> 05:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 1983. Their families will
collect from
nearly $2 billion in frozen
Iranian funds

05:44.711 --> 05:46.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
held in the U.S.

05:46.513 --> 05:51.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The European
Union widened
its antitrust battle with Google
today. E.U.

05:51.451 --> 05:56.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials accused the tech giant
of rigging
the mobile applications market
to benefit

05:56.356 --> 06:02.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its own products. In Brussels,
an E.U. commissioner
said Google uses the Android
operating system

06:02.929 --> 06:04.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to freeze out competing apps.

06:04.864 --> 06:10.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGRETHE VESTAGER, European
Union: As a result
of Google's behavior, rival
search engines,

06:10.437 --> 06:18.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mobile operating systems and Web
browsers
have not been able to compete on
their merits,

06:19.012 --> 06:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but rather been artificially
excluded from
certain business opportunities.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Google strongly
denied the
charges.

06:27.787 --> 06:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country, the
tainted water crisis in Flint,
Michigan, is

06:30.991 --> 06:35.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now a criminal case. Two state
regulators
and a city employee were charged
and arraigned

06:35.495 --> 06:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, accused of official
misconduct, tampering
with evidence and other
offenses. In Flint,

06:41.001 --> 06:46.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state attorney general said
they manipulated
records to make lead levels in
the water appear

06:46.673 --> 06:48.475 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lower.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL SCHUETTE, Michigan Attorney
General:
They failed. They failed in
their responsibilities

06:50.977 --> 06:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to protect the health and safety
of families
of Flint. They failed Michigan
families. Indeed,

06:59.719 --> 07:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they failed us all, and I don't
care where
you live.

07:02.022 --> 07:05.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The attorney
general also
warned more charges are coming,
and he said

07:05.892 --> 07:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- quote -- "No one is off the
table."

07:07.827 --> 07:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Five former
police officers
in New Orleans pleaded guilty
today in deadly

07:12.632 --> 07:18.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shootings during Hurricane
Katrina. The case
involved the killing of two men
and wounding

07:18.071 --> 07:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of four others. The officers
were convicted
in 2011, but the verdict was set
aside because

07:23.743 --> 07:29.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of misconduct by prosecutors.
This plea deal
means that they will serve far
less prison

07:29.582 --> 07:31.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time than they originally faced.

07:31.484 --> 07:36.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Volkswagen
will spend just
over $1 billion to compensate
U.S. customers

07:36.456 --> 07:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for emissions cheating. It was
widely reported
today that V.W. reached an
agreement in principle

07:41.628 --> 07:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with federal regulators. The
deal involves
diesel vehicles. It's to be
presented to a

07:45.699 --> 07:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
federal judge in San Francisco
tomorrow.

07:47.701 --> 07:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wall Street
today, a rally
fizzled and stocks finished with
only modest

07:53.006 --> 07:59.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gains. The Dow Jones industrial
average was
up 42 points to close at 18096.
The Nasdaq

07:59.746 --> 08:03.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rose more than seven, and the
S&amp;P 500 rose
one point.

08:03.783 --> 08:07.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, in South
Carolina,
a state lawmaker has come up
with a tongue-in-cheek

08:07.420 --> 08:13.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill on Viagra to highlight her
opposition
to curbs on abortion.
Representative Mia McLeod

08:13.326 --> 08:19.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says men should have to wait 24
hours before
buying Viagra for a sexual
encounter. She'd

08:19.065 --> 08:23.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also require counseling on the
benefits of
remaining celibate.

08:23.770 --> 08:28.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump
changes his tone after a big win
in New York;

08:28.808 --> 08:35.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a major redesign of American
currency to include
women; can you be charged with a
crime for

08:35.115 --> 08:42.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refusing a Breathalyzer test? --
the Supreme
Court will decide; and much
more.

08:42.489 --> 08:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As you heard in
our lead story,
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton
celebrated

08:55.769 --> 09:01.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wins in New York lasted night,
but the campaign
is far from over, with plenty of
important

09:01.508 --> 09:03.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
battles ahead.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on the race for the
White House,
we turn again to Susan Page,
Washington bureau

09:06.913 --> 09:13.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief for USA Today, and Reid
Wilson, chief
political correspondent for The
Morning Consult.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

09:15.588 --> 09:20.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So let's start with the
Democrats, Susan.
Where is this Democratic race
after Hillary

09:20.727 --> 09:22.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton's big win last night?

09:22.662 --> 09:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
A 16-point victory, even though
Bernie Sanders

09:24.431 --> 09:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had spent $2 million more than
she did on
ads in New York state. It was
really home,

09:29.335 --> 09:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sweet home, for Hillary Clinton
last night.

09:31.805 --> 09:36.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it puts her on a much
steadier track.
She lost in Wisconsin. I think
that -- she

09:36.443 --> 09:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had lost in a series, seven of
the last eight
contests in states. So, this was
a big victory.

09:41.614 --> 09:46.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She heads now to states that
should also be
pretty friendly territory next
Tuesday in

09:46.419 --> 09:51.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Mid-Atlantic. She now could
win the nomination
even if he doesn't win another
primary by

09:51.691 --> 09:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keeping it close because of the
proportional
allocation of delegates in the
Democratic

09:55.195 --> 09:57.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

09:57.096 --> 10:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, she said last night she
could see victory
in her sights. I think that's
pretty accurate.

10:00.099 --> 10:04.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Reid, what
does Sanders,
what do his people see in these
results last

10:04.237 --> 10:06.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
night that give them hope?

10:06.072 --> 10:08.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON, Morning Consult:
Well, they see
that both candidates are going
to struggle

10:08.708 --> 10:15.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get the 2,383 delegates that
they need
to actually win the Democratic
nomination.

10:15.915 --> 10:20.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton has a
significant lead, and
she's got a much better path.
She only needs

10:20.253 --> 10:26.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to win about a quarter of the
remaining delegates
to be allocated to get to that
level with

10:26.593 --> 10:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the superdelegate support.
However, the Sanders
folks, and we heard Jeff Weaver
talk about

10:30.330 --> 10:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this a little bit last night,
believe that
they can convince Democratic
superdelegates

10:34.801 --> 10:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to switch their allegiances to
Bernie Sanders.

10:37.136 --> 10:41.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a real long shot. These
superdelegates
are party leaders and elected
officials who

10:41.541 --> 10:45.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have spent a long time in the
Democratic Party
and they know the work that
Clintons have

10:45.278 --> 10:47.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
done for the Democratic Party.

10:47.080 --> 10:51.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders has
not done the
same kind of legwork to try to
elect fellow

10:51.284 --> 10:53.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrats.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And isn't it,
Susan, just getting
-- it has been and it's even
more mathematically

10:55.889 --> 10:58.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difficult now for Bernie Sanders
to get to
that number.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SUSAN PAGE: Yes.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's done a remarkable job.
He's posed
a much more serious challenge
than I think

11:02.962 --> 11:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyone, including himself,
expected at the
beginning. But at this point,
the debate is,

11:08.067 --> 11:09.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what does Bernie Sanders want?

11:09.903 --> 11:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I expect Bernie Sanders to stay
in the race.
Usually, candidates don't get
out of the race

11:14.140 --> 11:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until they run out of money.
He's not going
to run out of money. But the
debate is, what

11:17.443 --> 11:21.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the role that he sees for
himself going
forward, and will he do
everything he can

11:21.514 --> 11:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to unite the party if and when
Hillary Clinton
is the nominee?

11:25.051 --> 11:29.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the exit polls last night in
New York,
25 percent of Sanders supporters
said they

11:29.289 --> 11:33.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't vote for Hillary
Clinton in the fall.
She really needs his help to
bring the party

11:33.893 --> 11:35.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together if and when she's the
nominee.

11:35.695 --> 11:39.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You ask what he
wants. It sounds
like he's still saying he wants
to be the

11:39.465 --> 11:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nominee. He's not ready to give
that dream
up.

11:41.968 --> 11:46.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: And the irony is
that if Hillary
Clinton becomes president, if
the Democrats

11:46.806 --> 11:50.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take back the U.S. Senate,
Bernie Sanders
is in line to chair a major
committee.

11:50.843 --> 11:55.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Remember, he is still
technically an independent.
He hasn't been elected to the
Senate as a

11:55.148 --> 12:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrat. And once again, this
is a party
that remembers the work that its
members,

12:02.589 --> 12:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that its politicians have done
to help the
rest of the party as well.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bernie Sanders doesn't
necessarily have to
chair this committee if his
fellow senators

12:10.964 --> 12:12.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
don't think that he...

12:12.799 --> 12:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Although it was
interesting Jeff
Weaver said this afternoon that
Bernie Sanders

12:15.201 --> 12:17.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would remain a Democrat after
this contest.

12:17.470 --> 12:22.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That answers a question that we
had had. There's
one problem for the Clinton
people. There

12:22.241 --> 12:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are two things that opponents
often want that
he doesn't want. He doesn't need
help retiring

12:25.845 --> 12:29.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his debt. He is more successful
than she is
in raising money. He also
doesn't want to

12:29.816 --> 12:30.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be on the ticket.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:31.618 --> 12:32.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He doesn't want
to be her running
mate.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: He doesn't want to
be her running
mate.

12:34.621 --> 12:37.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that makes it a little bit
more complicated
to figure out how you bring him
in the fold.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about the
Republicans.

12:39.926 --> 12:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump -- Reid, does the
trajectory
of the Republican race change
because of New

12:46.499 --> 12:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York? Because contest after
contest before
this, Ted Cruz was feeling his
oats, but after

12:52.338 --> 12:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
last night, what do we see?

12:54.307 --> 12:59.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: And Donald Trump
won a substantial
victory. He won 26 of the 27
congressional

12:59.112 --> 13:03.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
districts within New York.
Ironically, the
only one he lost is the one he
actually lives

13:03.249 --> 13:04.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in, in Manhattan.

13:04.951 --> 13:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his path gets a lot easier.
He won 90
delegates. That's a bigger prize
than any

13:09.489 --> 13:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other state is going to offer
until we get
to California in June. And he's
got some -- he's

13:16.663 --> 13:21.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leading in polls in the five
states that will
vote next week, in states like
Pennsylvania

13:21.167 --> 13:26.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Delaware and Rhode Island
and Connecticut
-- and what's the fifth? I'm --
Maryland.

13:26.239 --> 13:26.773 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sorry.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maryland.

13:28.708 --> 13:32.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: All of which he's
leading in.
So, if he's able to win all of
the 118 delegates

13:32.745 --> 13:35.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are up next Tuesday, his
path gets even
more clear.

13:35.948 --> 13:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, he still has to win 52
percent of
the remaining delegates after
that. I'm saying

13:40.353 --> 13:43.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his chances are plausible, but
precarious.

13:43.322 --> 13:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It just sounds
like, Susan,
up until now, so much of the
talk was about

13:47.694 --> 13:51.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what happens at the convention
for Donald
Trump. But now people are -- you
hear more

13:51.330 --> 13:56.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversation about how he could
actually get
to the number he needs before
Cleveland.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: It's clear he's
going to get pretty
close. I think it's pretty clear
he's going

13:59.639 --> 14:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get close to the number.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For one thing, what can they
throw at him
that they haven't thrown at him
so far? It's

14:04.043 --> 14:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not like his controversial views
are a mystery
to voters. They have heard him
talk about

14:08.681 --> 14:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. His temperament, people have
seen it,
and they continue to vote for
him.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there's an argument
he's made
that's been pretty effective,
which is the

14:15.488 --> 14:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fair play argument. Americans
really believe
in fair play, and you see a
majority -- a

14:20.359 --> 14:25.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
significant majority of
Republican voters
saying if somebody has most
delegates, but

14:25.264 --> 14:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
isn't quite up to a majority,
they still should
be the nominee.

14:29.035 --> 14:32.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think that is a pretty
effective argument.
He's not there yet. But after
last night and

14:33.005 --> 14:37.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a 35-point victory, you
definitely see a path
for him to avoid a contested
convention.

14:37.977 --> 14:42.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was
interesting, Reid, last
night, a lot of conversation
about, well,

14:42.715 --> 14:46.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump seems to be
moderating his tone.
He's not calling him lyin' --
Senator Cruz

14:46.452 --> 14:47.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lyin' Ted.

14:47.954 --> 14:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, campaigning in
Indiana, he was
right back to the same language.

14:51.290 --> 14:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON: And this is sort of
the dichotomy
of Donald Trump. Right?

14:55.661 --> 15:00.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every candidate moderates after
a primary
election. Trump doesn't have to
necessarily

15:00.433 --> 15:05.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moderate on ideological issues.
He has to
moderate on his personality. He
has to appear

15:05.972 --> 15:09.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential. And we have seen
little flashes
of this, his press conference in
Mar-a-Lago

15:09.675 --> 15:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after winning primaries back in
March, and
then last night a much more
subdued, much

15:15.014 --> 15:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more staid conversation, press
conference,
as well as the fact that he has
actually stayed

15:20.820 --> 15:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off the Sunday television shows
for a couple
of weeks in a row after the
longest stretch

15:25.091 --> 15:27.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I can remember of being
consistently
there.

15:27.226 --> 15:30.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, what is
Ted Cruz's -- or
John Kasich, who we haven't even
mentioned

15:30.997 --> 15:32.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yet?

15:32.865 --> 15:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I think John Kasich
has a very
tough path ahead. I mean, it's
not mathematically

15:35.568 --> 15:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible for him to come into
the convention
with a majority of delegates.

15:39.205 --> 15:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a little out of synch with
his party.
I think he's kind of moderate
for a very conservative

15:42.875 --> 15:46.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party. And for Ted Cruz, he is
now out of
his elements when we go to these
states, to

15:46.679 --> 15:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New York, to the Mid-Atlantic
states that
vote next Tuesday.

15:49.682 --> 15:53.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These are not friendly
territories for Ted
Cruz. He has run a very
effective campaign.

15:53.820 --> 15:59.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is very shrewd in terms of
the delegate
selection process, but he has a
really -- he

15:59.625 --> 16:04.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really needs something bad to
happen to Trump's
path for there to be an opening
for him, I

16:04.363 --> 16:06.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
think.

16:06.165 --> 16:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're going
to be watching.
Next week, it's Pennsylvania and
then on to

16:09.268 --> 16:10.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these other states.

16:10.269 --> 16:11.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you both.

16:11.571 --> 16:15.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

16:15.842 --> 16:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reid Wilson,
Susan Page, thank
you.

16:24.383 --> 16:31.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been a much anticipated
decision, but
the United States' currency is
in for the

16:31.123 --> 16:36.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first changes in a long time,
giving new prominence
to civil rights and women's
history in this

16:36.829 --> 16:39.599 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

16:39.632 --> 16:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The familiar greenbacks haven't
seen a new
face in almost 90 years. And
when the Treasury

16:45.238 --> 16:51.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department announced last year a
woman might
grace a bill for the first time
in history,

16:51.143 --> 16:57.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was jubilation from
American women,
but a backlash from Alexander
Hamilton fans,

16:57.416 --> 17:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who were upset over anyone
replacing him on
the $10 bill.

17:02.121 --> 17:07.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first secretary of the
treasury, Hamilton
has become a darling of popular
culture with

17:07.560 --> 17:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the runaway success of the
Broadway musical
named after him. There was
plenty of feedback

17:16.135 --> 17:20.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and even some indignation at the
suggestion
Hamilton might be replaced.

17:20.740 --> 17:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, after much speculation,
Treasury Secretary
Jack Lew announced it's the
seventh president

17:26.712 --> 17:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States, Andrew
Jackson, who
loses his spot on the front of
the $20 bill.

17:32.852 --> 17:38.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will be replaced by Harriet
Tubman, the
Civil War anti-slavery activist
and a leader

17:38.891 --> 17:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Underground Railroad.

17:41.127 --> 17:46.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hamilton stays put on the $10
bill, but the
reverse side will now include
leaders of the

17:47.033 --> 17:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women's suffrage movement,
including Susan
B. Anthony, and another
abolitionist, Sojourner

17:53.873 --> 17:55.574 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Truth.

17:55.608 --> 18:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The $5 bill also gets an update
to include
civil rights leaders such Marian
Anderson,

18:00.713 --> 18:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eleanor Roosevelt, and Martin
Luther King
Jr.

18:03.683 --> 18:08.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I caught up with Treasury
Secretary Lew earlier
today.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Jack Lew, thank you
for joining
us.

18:10.289 --> 18:12.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JACK LEW, U.S. Treasury
Secretary: Great to
be with you, Judy.

18:12.058 --> 18:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, big decision,
the first
time a woman is going on the
face of a piece

18:15.962 --> 18:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of U.S. currency that's in wide
circulation.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why Harriet Tubman?

18:21.600 --> 18:26.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK LEW: You know, when we
started the public
discussion of this almost a year
ago, I said

18:26.138 --> 18:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's been almost 100 years since
we have had
a woman on our currency, and
that had to change,

18:30.276 --> 18:33.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it had to change as soon as
possible.

18:33.212 --> 18:37.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We went through a process of
listening. And
I kind of did it the
old-fashioned way. We

18:37.183 --> 18:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually listened. Heard from
well over a
million people in one way or
another, responses

18:42.521 --> 18:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through handwritten notes and
e-mails and
tweets and retweets.

18:47.393 --> 18:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the amount of support and
interest in
Harriet Tubman was quite
impressive. It showed

18:54.200 --> 18:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the story of Harriet Tubman
means a lot
to people of all ages in this
country, and

18:59.605 --> 19:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it speaks to something very
important about
American democracy.

19:03.409 --> 19:08.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, a woman born a slave,
illiterate her
whole life, can, after spending
countless

19:08.848 --> 19:13.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trips going back and forth
freeing people
on an individual basis, worked
for the Army

19:13.152 --> 19:18.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help -- as a spy, help them
find their
way into battle in the Civil
War, and then

19:18.224 --> 19:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a founder of the women's
suffrage movement,
how that can change our country.
And I think

19:23.262 --> 19:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's -- it's a tremendous
American story.

19:25.097 --> 19:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, by all
accounts, you changed
your thinking here at Treasury.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.236 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JACK LEW: I did.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There were
reports it was going
to be a woman to replace
Alexander Hamilton.

19:32.104 --> 19:35.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was reliable reports it
was going to
be Susan B. Anthony, the leader
of the women's

19:35.875 --> 19:38.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suffrage movement in this
country. Why change?

19:38.911 --> 19:42.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK LEW: What we did was, we
widened the
lens.

19:42.882 --> 19:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It became very clear, listening
to the amount
of interest and response, first
of all, that

19:48.354 --> 19:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the $20 bill had a special
resonance, because
we all use it so much, because
we get it in

19:52.992 --> 19:57.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money machines, that it's the
bill where,
if we wanted to put a woman on a
bill that

19:57.229 --> 20:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people were going to feel was
the bill that
they use, the $20 bill had a
special meaning.

20:03.369 --> 20:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we also -- I came to the
conclusion fairly
quickly as we were listening
that there's

20:08.707 --> 20:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot more here than just one
square inch
of one bill. We ought to be
looking at the

20:12.411 --> 20:15.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whole series $5, $10, and $20.

20:15.815 --> 20:20.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once you start doing more
things, it gives
you the ability to tell more
stories. So,

20:20.519 --> 20:24.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, on the back of the
$10 bill,
we're going to tell the story of
women's suffrage.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have images of the
leading suffragists,
five incredible women.

20:27.893 --> 20:32.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are going to have a depiction
of a demonstration,
a rally on the steps of the
Treasury Building

20:32.932 --> 20:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demanding in 1913 that women get
-- be given
the right to vote. And on the
back of the

20:37.203 --> 20:41.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$5 bill, we are going to have a
image of Marian
Anderson and Eleanor Roosevelt,
when Marian

20:41.907 --> 20:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anderson couldn't sing in a
concert hall in
Washington because of
segregation, and the

20:46.479 --> 20:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
steps of the Lincoln Memorial
were open to
her to sing to 75,000 people.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it tells a lot of stories,
this series
of decisions.

20:52.885 --> 20:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is it fair to
say it's
more of a focus on civil rights
than it is

20:56.122 --> 20:57.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on gender?

20:57.990 --> 20:59.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK LEW: At the beginning, we
said it's going
to be a focus on democracy. I
would call it

20:59.925 --> 21:01.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a focus on democracy.

21:01.694 --> 21:06.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's how you use your voice in a
democracy
to effect change. See, you look
at a series

21:07.032 --> 21:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of individuals and the stories
that are going
to be depicted. What it says is
that change

21:12.438 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country doesn't just
come by what
we do in the halls of
Washington. It's what

21:17.810 --> 21:19.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
individuals do in their actions.

21:19.879 --> 21:24.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It looks as if
you were influenced
by the success of this Broadway
musical "Hamilton."

21:24.717 --> 21:26.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Were you?

21:26.585 --> 21:30.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK LEW: You know, candidly, we
decided pretty
early on as we were listening to
have a broader

21:30.356 --> 21:32.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
approach.

21:32.892 --> 21:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that it would be an
overstatement
to say that it's a response to
that. I heard

21:41.033 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost immediately when I made
my announcement
in June from people who said,
don't take Alexander

21:46.372 --> 21:50.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hamilton off of our money. And I
said, don't
worry. He's always going to be
on our money.

21:50.376 --> 21:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't work in this building
without feeling
that you stand on his shoulders.

21:54.914 --> 22:00.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what we came to was
a much bigger
approach, and one that is
powerful in telling

22:00.419 --> 22:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a series of stories, and it
involves the $20,
the $10, and the $5, not just
one bill.

22:05.524 --> 22:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I ask about
Alexander Hamilton
because, clearly, there's
another side of

22:08.894 --> 22:15.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Hamilton story, the
philandering, leaving
his family penniless, and the
rest of it.

22:15.167 --> 22:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK LEW: I think that the
contributions that
Alexander Hamilton made to
building our economy

22:21.006 --> 22:22.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and our system of government are
legendary.

22:22.508 --> 22:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the loyalty of his wife to
preserving
his memory is also legendary.

22:30.950 --> 22:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why do you think
it's taken
so long to get a woman on the
currency?

22:34.853 --> 22:36.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK LEW: You know, it's a good
question,
Judy.

22:36.755 --> 22:40.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure I can answer it.
Obviously, from
my perspective, it took too
long. That's why,

22:40.759 --> 22:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in June, when we announced we
were doing it,
we had to do it, and we had to
do it on the

22:43.829 --> 22:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next bill that comes out. And
we're doing
that.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been working on this,
literally, since
I started here at Treasury. The
work began

22:52.137 --> 22:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before I got here. But it's not
something
that we wasted any time on. And
I think it's

22:57.543 --> 22:59.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long overdue.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And when will we
actually see
this? I mean, you know, women's
groups are

23:01.981 --> 23:06.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already saying it's taken so
long already.
Now we have to wait years more
for this to

23:06.852 --> 23:08.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be in circulation.

23:08.654 --> 23:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK LEW: So, the plan is that,
in 2020, the
100th anniversary of women's
suffrage, all

23:12.625 --> 23:18.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three images, all three designs
will be revealed
in their final detail.

23:18.163 --> 23:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after that, the production
process will
begin. I have already instructed
the Bureau

23:22.668 --> 23:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Engraving and Printing to
work as quickly
as possible to make that process
go as quickly

23:27.306 --> 23:32.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as possible. And I have talked
-- the two
offices in government that have
authority

23:32.678 --> 23:35.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over this are the Treasury and
the Federal
Reserve board.

23:35.147 --> 23:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have talked to the chair of
the Federal
Reserve, and we agree on two
things. One,

23:39.285 --> 23:42.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to make sure our money is
safe, and we
should move this process as
quickly as we

23:42.554 --> 23:44.023 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can.

23:44.056 --> 23:47.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of the
Treasury Jack
Lew, thank you very much.

23:47.059 --> 23:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK LEW: Great to be with you,
Judy.

23:56.635 --> 23:59.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

23:59.672 --> 24:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
reducing childhood
trauma to minimize serious
health consequences

24:04.977 --> 24:11.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in adults; the Pulitzer
Prize-winning investigation
that traced seafood to slave
labor; and NPR

24:11.950 --> 24:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
correspondent Barbara Bradley
Hagerty on coping
with a midlife crisis.

24:16.655 --> 24:22.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, a dispute over some
laws in states
to curb drunk driving.

24:22.928 --> 24:27.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the years, at least a dozen
states have
made it a crime for suspected
drunk drivers

24:27.232 --> 24:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to refuse to take alcohol tests.
But does
a police officer have to get a
search warrant

24:32.738 --> 24:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before performing such a test?
And do these
laws violate the Fourth
Amendment?

24:37.710 --> 24:41.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Supreme Court grappled with
these questions
today, as it considered three
cases challenging

24:41.680 --> 24:45.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
laws of this sort in North
Dakota and Minnesota.

24:45.284 --> 24:49.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia Coyle of "The National
Law Journal"
was in the courtroom, as always,
and she joins

24:49.355 --> 24:50.923 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me now.

24:50.956 --> 24:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what's the hassle in getting
a warrant
before you do one of these
tests?

24:54.360 --> 24:59.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Well, if you are asking the
states of North

24:59.765 --> 25:06.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dakota and Minnesota, who are
involved in
this, they say that, one, you
don't have magistrates

25:06.038 --> 25:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
available 24/7 to answer a
police officer's
call for a warrant.

25:12.311 --> 25:19.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can take a while. There are
concerns about,
you know, evidence being lost.
But, basically,

25:19.184 --> 25:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the states are saying here,
look, states have
a bargain with drivers. Driving
is not a right.

25:27.159 --> 25:32.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a privilege. And when you
get your license,
you're agreeing -- you're
impliedly consenting

25:32.498 --> 25:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to certain requirements.

25:34.666 --> 25:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the states feel these states
-- there
are 12 of them now and the
federal government

25:39.671 --> 25:43.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- impose criminal penalties if
you refuse
to take these tests.

25:43.842 --> 25:49.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, if you --
is there a
distinction between the type of
test that

25:49.148 --> 25:53.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can be taken, a Breathalyzer
that we're familiar
with, a field sobriety test if
you're just

25:53.051 --> 25:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
walking a line, vs. a blood
test?

25:54.820 --> 25:58.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: During the
arguments today,
that really did come out in some
of the justices'

25:58.690 --> 26:02.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questioning, Justice Breyer, for
example.

26:02.461 --> 26:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the way, Hari, this was a
great example
of how they play devil's
advocate with each

26:06.832 --> 26:10.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side. Justice Breyer, for
example, said to
the lawyer who was representing
the three

26:10.969 --> 26:17.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men challenging these laws, you
know, what's
the big deal about a breath
test, for example?

26:17.409 --> 26:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You blow into a straw that's
connected to
a little machine that's about
the size of

26:21.980 --> 26:26.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a cell phone. You're giving up
carbon dioxide
that's going to go into the
environment anyway.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not all that invasive, not
all that intrusive.

26:29.788 --> 26:35.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, then, when
the states'
lawyers came up, he said --
would say to them,

26:35.661 --> 26:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, look, how long does it
take to get a
search warrant for these breath
tests? Wyoming

26:41.533 --> 26:46.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says it takes five minutes.
Montana says it
takes 15 minutes. How long does
it take in

26:46.238 --> 26:48.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
North Dakota?

26:48.106 --> 26:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if they're transporting
these people after
they have been arrested to a
police station,

26:52.244 --> 26:56.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why can't the police officer
just make the
call on the way, maybe on a cell
phone that

26:56.682 --> 26:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has a big W for warrant on it,
press the button?

26:59.885 --> 27:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was -- the argument was a lot
of fun in
some respects. So, at the very
end, though,

27:07.159 --> 27:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Kennedy asked the Obama
administration's
lawyer, who was supporting the
states, can

27:12.831 --> 27:18.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we distinguish between the
breath test and
the blood alcohol test?

27:18.537 --> 27:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Obama administration's
lawyer said,
well, yes, you can, because a
breath test

27:23.475 --> 27:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not as invasive as a blood
alcohol test.
It's faster. You can do it as
part of the

27:29.548 --> 27:34.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
booking process at the station,
whereas a
blood alcohol test has to be
done at a hospital.

27:34.753 --> 27:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also said he didn't think
a warrant
was a good fit for a breath
test. And here's

27:38.423 --> 27:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the reason why, he said. Police
officers use
warrants to force compliance,
and you can't

27:45.030 --> 27:51.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force somebody to blow into a
straw. But he
said, if you do impose a warrant
requirement

27:51.770 --> 27:56.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on breath tests, police officers
are going
to start doing blood draws,
because you can

27:57.009 --> 28:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force somebody to give blood in
the hospital
under restraint. You can take
their blood.

28:04.182 --> 28:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the justices are
wrestling with
the difference between the two.
And three

28:09.221 --> 28:14.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years ago, the court actually
dealt with warrants
and blood alcohol draws. The
decision was

28:14.726 --> 28:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of fractured. Police then
argued they
didn't need warrants because
this was what

28:21.533 --> 28:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they -- an exception to the
Fourth Amendment,
an exigency circumstance. Blood
alcohol dissipates

28:27.406 --> 28:29.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quickly. You don't have time to
get a warrant.

28:29.308 --> 28:34.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the court didn't buy that
entirely.
It said, basically, not every
time you need

28:34.980 --> 28:40.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a blood alcohol draw is it an
emergency situation.
Courts have to look at the
totality of the

28:40.552 --> 28:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circumstances. But because it
was a fractured
decision, nothing really was
clear.

28:46.091 --> 28:52.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the court took these
three cases,
two involving blood alcohol
draws, one involving

28:52.397 --> 28:59.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the breath test, in order to try
to resolve
this or clarify the law in terms
of the warrant

28:59.671 --> 29:01.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
requirement.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Marcia Coyle
of "The National Law Journal,"
thanks so much.

29:04.543 --> 29:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Hari.

29:12.918 --> 29:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is more and
more evidence
that traumatic events
experienced in childhood,

29:21.059 --> 29:26.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
like abuse, neighborhood
violence or the death
of a parent, can contribute to
health consequences

29:26.531 --> 29:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in adulthood, from heart disease
to diabetes.

29:30.102 --> 29:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now communities throughout the
U.S. are beginning
to intervene to try to prevent
this.

29:34.940 --> 29:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Sarah
Varney begins
our report from Los Angeles,
which was done

29:39.578 --> 29:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in partnership with Kaiser
Health News, and
with support from the Solutions

29:46.485 --> 29:50.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Kimberly Cervantes
has spent
much of her young life learning
to outwit

29:50.822 --> 29:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the perils of Compton. Although
she had adults
she could trust in high school,
like teacher

29:56.495 --> 30:00.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Armando Castro, they couldn't
shield her from
an assault on a public bus.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIMBERLY CERVANTES, Compton
Resident: He tried
to grab me.

30:01.933 --> 30:05.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: And frequent
gunshots outside
the school. In middle school,
she witnessed

30:06.004 --> 30:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the deaths of two students. That
steady exposure
to violence has led Cervantes to
some dark

30:11.943 --> 30:18.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places, at times a crippling
anxiety that
forced her to miss school and
thoughts of

30:18.216 --> 30:19.985 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suicide.

30:20.018 --> 30:24.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY CERVANTES: There's so
many people
out there acting out and just
drug abusers

30:24.256 --> 30:30.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on almost every corner. It's
hard to maintain
the whole happy-go-lifestyle,
you know? It's

30:30.729 --> 30:32.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not easy.

30:32.731 --> 30:36.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: In an
unprecedented move, Cervantes
and four other students are
suing the Compton

30:36.768 --> 30:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unified School District, arguing
that the
trauma they have faced makes it
difficult

30:41.173 --> 30:46.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to learn. They're asking the
federal court
to force the district to provide
additional

30:46.411 --> 30:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support, in the same way schools
accommodate
students with autism, dyslexia
and other learning

30:51.049 --> 30:55.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
differences under the Americans
With Disabilities
Act.

At home in Compton, Arthur,
whose identity
has to be protected because of
the pending

31:00.559 --> 31:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lawsuit, has struggled with
homework. He was
rescued by his father from a
drug-addicted

31:05.363 --> 31:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mother, but because of his
outbursts and defiance,
he's bounced from school to
school.

31:10.135 --> 31:15.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Students who've suffered
multiple traumatic
incidents are six times more
likely to have

31:15.173 --> 31:20.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behavioral problems, five times
more likely
to skip school, and
two-and-a-half times more

31:20.345 --> 31:26.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
likely to repeat a grade.

Public Counsel staff attorney
Kathryn Eidmann,
who is on the legal team
representing the

31:30.455 --> 31:35.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students, says research shows
that sustained
stress alters brain development
and, if ignored,

31:35.627 --> 31:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can derail academic achievement.

31:37.429 --> 31:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHRYN EIDMANN, Staff Attorney,
Public Counsel:
The children who have been
injured, through

31:39.531 --> 31:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no fault of their own, by these
types of adverse
experiences need intervention
and support

31:46.104 --> 31:48.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the schools in order to be
able to learn.

31:48.240 --> 31:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The lawsuit is
currently pending
in federal court.

31:52.377 --> 31:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With each passing year, new
research validates
a pioneering large-scale study
from the 1990s

31:57.783 --> 32:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that found one in four had grown
up in households
with substance abuse, one in
four had been

32:03.054 --> 32:08.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
physically abused, and one in
five sexually
abused. These so-called adverse
childhood

32:08.360 --> 32:14.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experiences, or ACEs, were found
to predict
a raft of health and social
problems, from

32:14.065 --> 32:18.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
adolescent pregnancy to
depression and heart
disease in adulthood.

32:18.136 --> 32:22.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the long term implications of
childhood
trauma become increasingly
clear, cities across

32:22.674 --> 32:26.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country are trying to
understand the kind
of violence happening in their
own communities

32:26.745 --> 32:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
along city streets and behind
closed doors.
Local leaders say the next step
is to stop

32:31.616 --> 32:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those traumatic events from
happening in the
first place.

32:34.853 --> 32:40.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Memphis, Tennessee, a city
rich in music
and culture, but marked by
violence and racial

32:40.992 --> 32:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strife, local leaders who
commissioned a survey
to measure childhood trauma were
stunned at

32:45.831 --> 32:51.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the results; 37 percent of
adults in the county
during their youth had witnessed
someone being

32:51.803 --> 32:56.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot or stabbed; 22 percent
witnessed violence
between adults.

32:56.808 --> 33:01.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what could local leaders do
to spare the
next generation similar anguish?

of Shelby County: We know that
children are

33:03.648 --> 33:08.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

33:17.896 --> 33:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders to focus primarily on

BARBARA HOLDEN NIXON: There's
not a transition
place until a person gets to
juvenile justice,

33:27.038 --> 33:31.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, all kinds of things
before they really
see another professional,
because we don't

33:31.076 --> 33:32.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have this preventative network.

33:32.978 --> 33:39.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Nixon turned to
Robin Karr-Morse,
a well-known expert on childhood
trauma. She

33:39.050 --> 33:44.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says parents who themselves
suffered wrenching
childhoods need help learning
better ways

33:44.055 --> 33:45.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to raise their children.

33:45.824 --> 33:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN KARR-MORSE, The Parenting
Institute:
We're putting no blame on the
parents. The

33:49.594 --> 33:56.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole idea is just the opposite.
It's to recognize
that those things have happened
to them. It's

33:56.968 --> 34:03.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not, what's wrong with you?
It's, what happened
to you? And then giving them
tools to help

34:03.909 --> 34:05.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offset whatever that is.

34:05.777 --> 34:12.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

started by opening
Universal Parenting Places, free

that offer art therapy that help

But the counseling sessions led
Lawston to
reflect on her own childhood.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY LAWSTON, Mother: My
mother was a
hollerer, you know, and I didn't
want to be

34:50.722 --> 34:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that way, where you were afraid
to come to
me.

34:53.558 --> 34:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Now she's learning
new approaches
to parenting, although she's
faced resistance

34:58.463 --> 35:00.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from her family.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY LAWSTON: At first, it
was a struggle.
It was like a fight, like
pulling teeth, like,

35:02.968 --> 35:07.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no, that's not how we do it. We
do it this
way. There's nothing wrong with
us, the way

35:07.339 --> 35:09.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we raised you. You have to do
what I say.

35:09.607 --> 35:13.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was like, well, it's not
your world
anymore. It's mine. And I have
to do what's

35:13.812 --> 35:17.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
best for me, in order for my --
me and my
children to heal.

35:17.148 --> 35:21.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: One of the
Parenting Places
has opened at Baptist Memorial
Hospital for

35:21.486 --> 35:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women, where doctors can refer
parents directly
upstairs for classes and
counseling. The next

35:28.593 --> 35:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will open in Perea Preschool.

35:31.096 --> 35:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Principal Alicia Norman says
interventions
are urgently needed, as the
number of preschoolers

35:35.900 --> 35:37.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being expelled grows.

35:37.669 --> 35:41.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALICIA NORMAN, Principal, Perea
Preschool:
They're angry. They are out of
control, 3-

35:41.339 --> 35:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and 4-year-olds. And it breaks
my heart to
see that a child has been broken
so early

35:45.643 --> 35:47.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in life.

35:47.445 --> 35:51.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: In school surveys,
Norman says
parents report spanking their
children, in

35:51.116 --> 35:54.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some cases with belts and
electrical cords,
up to five days a week.

35:54.953 --> 35:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALICIA NORMAN: For a lot of our
families,
their first option, sometimes
their only option

35:58.056 --> 36:02.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to spank their children,
where research
shows now the adverse effects of
spanking,

36:02.560 --> 36:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
especially spanking gone wrong.

36:04.362 --> 36:07.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want their children to be
the best that
they can be, but these are the
only tools

36:07.465 --> 36:09.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that they have.

36:09.234 --> 36:12.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: In terms of law
enforcement, we're
seeing more and more of the
effects that it

36:12.337 --> 36:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has on children, just violence
in the home.

36:14.572 --> 36:18.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: Local law
enforcement officers
say children living in turbulent
homes, whether

36:18.943 --> 36:23.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're wealthy or poor, are
more likely to
end up in the criminal justice
system.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BUSH, Shelby County
Chief Public Defender:
What if we could right-size our
criminal justice

36:25.917 --> 36:27.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system?

36:27.752 --> 36:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But Stephen Bush,
Shelby County
chief public defender and a
fervent member

36:30.488 --> 36:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the task force, says the ACE
research is
changing how cases are
prosecuted here.

36:35.460 --> 36:40.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN BUSH: The use of adverse
childhood
experiences and the language
around that has

36:40.165 --> 36:44.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given us a new common language
when we're
advocating on behalf of kids in
front of the

36:44.602 --> 36:50.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courts that helps explain some
of the behaviors
that might not seem
understandable if you're

36:50.041 --> 36:55.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just looking at it without
understanding the
history of this child's life.

36:55.947 --> 37:00.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Support for this
new awareness
reaches to the top of county
government.

37:00.151 --> 37:05.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Shelby County Mayor Mark
Luttrell, also a
task force member, calls the ACE
research

37:05.323 --> 37:07.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a basic philosophy of county
government.

37:07.125 --> 37:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK LUTTRELL, Shelby County
Mayor: We have
tried to make it the common
thread that runs

37:10.428 --> 37:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through our public safety
agenda, through
our public health agenda,
through our community

37:15.333 --> 37:20.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
services agenda, through our
education agenda.

37:20.271 --> 37:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every portfolio that we have
within county
government has a component in
there for, how

37:26.711 --> 37:32.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you address the younger
generations at
that formative stage?

37:32.050 --> 37:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: No one expects
change to come
quickly to Memphis. It could
take decades

37:36.821 --> 37:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to figure out if this approach
reduces violence
in the community. But leaders
here say doing

37:44.529 --> 37:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away with the stigma of getting
parenting
help and even making it fun and
joyful is

37:49.367 --> 37:51.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a good start.

37:51.736 --> 37:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Kaiser Health News,
I'm Sarah Varney in Memphis.

37:59.844 --> 38:13.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now a
startling expose about
slave labor in the world of
seafood.

38:13.057 --> 38:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, we're looking at some
of the Pulitzer
Prize winners. And the
Associated Press' 18-month-long

38:17.795 --> 38:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation won the prize for
public service.
It tracked the widespread use of
slave labor

38:23.535 --> 38:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Southeast Asia and how it's
part in a supply
chain bringing seafood to
American restaurants

38:29.407 --> 38:31.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and supermarkets.

38:31.242 --> 38:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fishermen were beaten and caged,
and reporters
even hid in the back of trucks
for days to

38:36.014 --> 38:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pursue the story. Since then,
more than 2,000
slaves have been freed.

38:40.585 --> 38:43.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Martha Mendoza was part of that
reporting
team, and joins me now.

38:43.888 --> 38:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Martha, what was the catalyst
for the investigation
in the first place?
Unfortunately, we have

38:48.893 --> 38:53.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heard of slave-like conditions
in different
parts of the world before. What
made you want

38:53.865 --> 38:55.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to follow this?

38:55.733 --> 38:59.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTHA MENDOZA, Associated
Press: Well, Slavery
at sea wasn't a secret, but the
stories that

38:59.404 --> 39:02.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were being told came from
rescued slaves.

39:02.106 --> 39:07.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, there was no
traction because
the response was, these guys are
safe. There

39:07.412 --> 39:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not really a problem anymore.
So, we set
out to do what some people
warned us was going

39:11.583 --> 39:16.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be impossible. We wanted to
find captive
slaves, and then we wanted to
track their

39:16.788 --> 39:21.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
catch with detailed accuracy all
the way back
to the dinner table to get
people who were

39:21.492 --> 39:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the other end of this supply
chain engaged.

39:24.028 --> 39:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how do you
find the
captive slaves in the first
place?

39:28.366 --> 39:34.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTHA MENDOZA: My colleagues
spoke at length
and for many months with people
who had escaped,

39:34.439 --> 39:37.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as well as human rights
activists who worked
with people who had escaped.

39:37.842 --> 39:43.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they had some miss, going to
places where
this wasn't happening or false
leads. But

39:44.015 --> 39:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they heard about this
island in Indonesia
called Benjina, they had a
pretty good idea

39:48.319 --> 39:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there might be labor abuse going
on there.
And it was a plane trip to a
boat ride to

39:53.891 --> 39:57.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a second boat ride to an island
that can only
be reached at certain times of
the year.

39:57.862 --> 40:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where my colleagues
did, indeed,
find a slave island.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, when they
get to this
island, obviously, it's not the
red carpet.

40:04.969 --> 40:08.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, are you hiding
throughout this process
when you're trying to document
what is on

40:08.906 --> 40:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the island, who lives here, what
the conditions
are?

40:11.342 --> 40:15.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTHA MENDOZA: Well, actually,
the AP reporters,
the AP team split up.

40:15.480 --> 40:20.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, some were ostensibly
interested in the
fishing operations, and others
were at the

40:20.652 --> 40:24.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same time kind of checking out
other parts
of what was happening on the
island. When

40:24.689 --> 40:29.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robin McDowell, who was there,
realized that
a number of the men were from
Burma, she asked

40:29.527 --> 40:35.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Esther Htusan to fly and boat,
make the trip
there to Burma.

40:35.133 --> 40:39.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Esther arrived, that's
when the story
really broke open for her,
because these men

40:39.037 --> 40:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to tell her their story.
They were
shoving pieces of papers in
their hands with

40:43.841 --> 40:47.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their parents' names and phone
numbers and
their villages begging them to
tell their

40:47.412 --> 40:49.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
families back home that they
were alive.

40:49.881 --> 40:54.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they asked to see more
of these men,
they actually were taken to a
graveyard with

40:54.619 --> 40:58.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than 70 bodies and false
names on the
signs above them.

40:58.923 --> 41:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So what's the
trail? What's
the paper trail between how that
seafood that

41:03.361 --> 41:07.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
these slaves are fishing
actually gets to
a grocery store in the United
States?

41:07.765 --> 41:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTHA MENDOZA: Well, we videoed
and documented
the seafood being loaded on to
one refrigerated

41:12.970 --> 41:14.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cargo ship.

41:14.806 --> 41:20.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That boat had a satellite
tracker in it, and
that tracker was pinging to a
locator, and

41:20.845 --> 41:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we watched the boat via the
Internet. And
for two weeks, we tracked it
into port. When

41:25.483 --> 41:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it arrived in port, AP met it
and watched
the seafood being unloaded into
pickup trucks,

41:32.090 --> 41:34.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and followed those trucks to
factories.

41:34.325 --> 41:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were able to search and find
the companies
in Thailand that were then
shipping to the

41:39.430 --> 41:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States, and go to these
American seafood
distributors to figure out where
their fish

41:44.736 --> 41:46.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ends up.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of time, when you're in a
supermarket,
you're going to see a piece of
fish under

41:48.506 --> 41:53.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some clear plastic wrap with a
label on it.
It's not even going to say which
distributor

41:53.177 --> 41:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it came from. So, there was a
lot of steps
in between. But, eventually, we
were able

41:58.082 --> 42:05.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to track it to Wal-Mart,
Safeway, Sysco, Albertsons,
and products like Fancy Feasts
and Iams as

42:05.323 --> 42:07.091 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

42:07.125 --> 42:10.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
since story,
more than 2000 men have been
freed. And you

42:10.161 --> 42:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were able to document some of
those stories
of them reuniting with their
families.

42:13.398 --> 42:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARTHA MENDOZA: Yes.

42:15.166 --> 42:19.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So about a week after we
finished our story,
authorities went to the island
of Benjina

42:19.437 --> 42:24.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and began interviewing men. They
talked to
a couple who described their
horrific, desperate

42:24.542 --> 42:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation and also told the
authorities that
they would be beaten and hurt
for telling

42:29.213 --> 42:33.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their story. And they were told,
no, we're
going to rescue you.

42:33.217 --> 42:36.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Word got out on the island, and
pretty soon
they just went ahead and made
the announcement,

42:36.687 --> 42:40.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anyone who wants to come with us
can come.
And hundreds of people began
pouring down

42:40.491 --> 42:44.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the docks, jumping out of
boat windows,
running out of the jungle.

42:44.562 --> 42:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on that day alone, 400 --
close to 400
men were rescued. And, yes, it
grew to 2,000.

42:50.802 --> 42:57.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One man we followed home, Myint
Naing, had
been gone for 22 years. His
sister saw him

42:57.308 --> 43:01.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
walking into the village, and
screamed and
cried and held him. And then,
when his mother

43:01.245 --> 43:07.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw him, she was actually
overwhelmed and
had to -- she lost her breath
for a while.

43:07.718 --> 43:10.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a very sweet and moving
moment.

43:10.488 --> 43:13.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's the
Thai government
said that they would do or what
have they

43:13.724 --> 43:15.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
done since this has been
published?

43:15.460 --> 43:20.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTHA MENDOZA: The Thai
government, prior
to us publishing and as we
published story

43:20.731 --> 43:28.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
after story, kept making
commitments to do
better. They have made it so
that, if you

43:28.072 --> 43:31.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are a victim of human
trafficking, they say
are you no longer treated as an
illegal immigrant

43:32.009 --> 43:34.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and simply deported as a
criminal.

43:34.712 --> 43:43.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have vowed to make
prosecutions more
of a priority, and one of the
pieces of this

43:43.087 --> 43:49.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we did involved shrimp
processing. And the
shrimp sector there in Thailand
has -- says

43:49.193 --> 43:52.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're moving all shrimp
processing in house.
So they're not going to
outsource any shrimp

43:52.930 --> 43:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
processing in sheds, where there
is much less
oversight.

43:55.366 --> 43:58.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Martha Mendoza
of the Associated Press, thanks
so much.

43:58.669 --> 44:05.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARTHA MENDOZA: Thank you, Hari.

44:05.910 --> 44:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a new take on
coping with
the anxieties of middle age.
It's the newest

44:17.021 --> 44:19.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
addition to the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

44:19.390 --> 44:21.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

44:21.259 --> 44:26.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Personal
disappointment, a
stagnating career, feelings of
physical decline,

44:26.564 --> 44:31.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the classic descriptions of a
midlife crisis.
But do we have that all wrong?

44:31.269 --> 44:36.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Life Reimagined: The Science,
Art, and Opportunity
of Midlife" takes the challenge
of answering

44:36.941 --> 44:38.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

44:38.743 --> 44:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Author Barbara Bradley Hagerty
spent nearly
20 years with NPR covering law
and religion

44:42.446 --> 44:45.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before, well, she changed her
own midlife.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

44:47.285 --> 44:48.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY, Author,
"Life Reimagined:
The Science, Art, and
Opportunity of Midlife":

44:48.119 --> 44:49.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you. It's great to be
here.

44:49.921 --> 44:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, the first
main finding
seems to be that the so-called
midlife crisis

44:51.422 --> 44:53.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is really a kind of made-up
construct.

44:53.724 --> 44:55.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: It is.

44:55.560 --> 44:58.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had this kind of cultural
transformation,
when everyone thought we had to
have a midlife

44:58.262 --> 45:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis. Everyone had to buy a
sports car or
dump their spouse or something
like that.

45:02.500 --> 45:07.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then what happened is, in
the mid-1990s,
U.S. psychologists started to
say, is there

45:07.505 --> 45:11.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really such a thing as a midlife
crisis? Is
it common? How common is it?

45:11.509 --> 45:15.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they began to look at
this, what
they found is that only about 10
percent of

45:15.279 --> 45:20.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people have a classic midlife
crisis, which
is this kind of existential
angst about dying

45:20.585 --> 45:22.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before you can achieve your
dreams, only about
10 point.

45:22.954 --> 45:26.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Short of that,
though, everyone
does go through stages, right?
Everyone has

45:26.424 --> 45:27.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
turning points.

45:27.258 --> 45:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: You do.

45:28.459 --> 45:29.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You yourself had
-- it got
you writing.

45:29.860 --> 45:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: I also
had one. That's
right. That's right.

45:31.629 --> 45:36.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, while midlife crisis is
not all that
common, midlife ennui, that kind
of malaise

45:36.767 --> 45:41.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that people have, that's
actually very, very
common. People generally are
happy in their

45:41.772 --> 45:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20s and 30s, and then they kind
of get discontented
in their 40s and 50s. And then
they swoop

45:46.777 --> 45:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back up and they're very happy
in their late
kind of 50s, 60s, 70s.

45:50.381 --> 45:55.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there's this nadir at
midlife, generally
around 45 in America.

45:55.119 --> 46:00.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You approach this
as the reporter
you are. You talked to lots of
people. Right?

46:00.157 --> 46:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What struck you most about the
kinds of crises,
or let's call it a slump, that
you would find

46:06.330 --> 46:08.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from people? What kind of
things?

46:08.165 --> 46:11.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: This
was done shortly
after the 2008 recession. That
was the most

46:11.535 --> 46:14.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
common trigger to this midlife
slump that
people had.

46:15.006 --> 46:20.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, basically, if you're 50 and
you lose
your job, it is really hard to
find another

46:20.277 --> 46:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one. So, what I kind of found
was, 55 is the
new 65. That's what people were
finding. It

46:25.149 --> 46:26.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was very difficult.

46:26.917 --> 46:32.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But almost without exception,
the people I
talked to who were in that slump
eventually

46:32.323 --> 46:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did find another job, and they
were much happier.
And the point here that was
really interesting

46:36.460 --> 46:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, people generally return to
their happiness
set point.

46:39.897 --> 46:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Happiness set --
what does
that mean?

46:41.799 --> 46:44.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: It just
means that
people have a certain set point.

46:44.602 --> 46:49.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a little bit happier than my
husband.
If something happens to me, I
will return

46:49.640 --> 46:53.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to my happiness set point, kind
of my average
happiness level. His might be
different from

46:53.844 --> 46:57.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mine. Everyone has a little bit
of a different
one, but you return to your
norm.

46:57.615 --> 47:01.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell me about key
findings
that places like the wonderfully
named Happiness

47:01.318 --> 47:04.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Research Center in Copenhagen
are coming to.

47:04.288 --> 47:06.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Well,
what they did
is, they looked at job
satisfaction.

47:06.957 --> 47:12.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they found is that the
key thing
to job satisfaction, the most
important thing

47:12.063 --> 47:17.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is having a purpose, feeling
like your job
has a purpose. And so it could
be either that

47:17.068 --> 47:21.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you feel your job personally has
a purpose
or that you're part of an
organization with

47:21.072 --> 47:23.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a greater mission.

47:23.374 --> 47:26.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Purpose turns out to be like the
magic bullet
for happiness.

47:26.911 --> 47:28.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Across the board?

47:28.646 --> 47:30.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Across
the board,
not just at work, but having a
purpose in

47:30.514 --> 47:35.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
life tends to makes you
healthier. It means
that you stave off dementia
better than other

47:35.720 --> 47:37.588 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

47:37.621 --> 47:40.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It means that you're much less
likely to have
a stroke or be sick. It is a
wonderful quality

47:40.925 --> 47:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have, this idea that you have
purpose in
life, you have a reason to get
out of bed

47:44.528 --> 47:46.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the morning.

47:46.430 --> 47:48.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You also are
looking at people
who have made changes in their
lives, right?

47:48.666 --> 47:53.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you make those changes?
How do you
decide big things, like changing
a job, for

47:53.537 --> 47:59.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
example? When is it time to --
if I'm not
happy at the job, what do I do
next? Because

47:59.944 --> 48:00.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's not easy either.

48:00.811 --> 48:02.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Right.
Right.

48:02.580 --> 48:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, one thing that career
experts say you
shouldn't do is just kind of
leave your job

48:06.083 --> 48:10.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and follow your muse. You're an
accountant,
and you want to be a Hollywood
star. That

48:10.221 --> 48:11.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
usually doesn't work out so
well.

48:12.022 --> 48:16.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what you need to do is really
think about,
what is -- what am I really good
at? What

48:16.327 --> 48:21.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do I love doing? Is there a way
to pivot on
that so that even within the
company I work

48:21.065 --> 48:26.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for, or the organization I work,
I can do
more of that than less of things
I'm really

48:26.070 --> 48:28.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bad at?

48:28.038 --> 48:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, if you're an editor
who has been
put up in management, and you
don't like management,

48:31.542 --> 48:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go back to being an editor. So,
that's one
thing.

48:33.744 --> 48:37.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing that people can
do is, while
they're exploring what they want
to do next,

48:37.782 --> 48:41.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they should dip a toe in the
water. And by
that, I mean, they should
volunteer at an

48:41.685 --> 48:45.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organization that they think
they might like.
They should take classes.

48:45.523 --> 48:49.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to one man who was an
investment
banker who went to divinity
school at night,

48:49.293 --> 48:54.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and now he's a minister. So
that's the other
thing. You should be careful
about it. Look

48:54.365 --> 48:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deep inside yourself and then
take the leap.

48:56.433 --> 49:00.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I have to ask you
this, because
the baby boom generation, and,
to some degree,

49:00.938 --> 49:08.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gen-Xers, are famously derided
for being self-absorbed,
right, full of ourselves. Right?

49:08.145 --> 49:15.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this a discussion just for
those who can
either, A, afford it, those who
are a little

49:15.319 --> 49:17.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bit more absorbed with
themselves than perhaps
we should be?

49:17.655 --> 49:19.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: Right.

49:19.456 --> 49:23.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I must say that midlife
crisis is a
privileged problem to have.
People who are

49:23.460 --> 49:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working two jobs, both partners
working two
jobs, and they have kids, and
they don't have

49:29.934 --> 49:35.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really a lot of time to look
deep into themselves
and wonder if they're
existentially happy.

49:35.039 --> 49:36.874 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

49:36.907 --> 49:41.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it is really something for
the privileged,
people in the middle class or
even a little

49:41.312 --> 49:43.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wealthier, who can afford to
have a midlife
crisis.

49:43.414 --> 49:47.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And this is, in
part, a memoir,
right?

49:47.184 --> 49:48.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: It is.

49:48.652 --> 49:49.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, is in part...

49:49.520 --> 49:50.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: It is.
It is.

49:50.054 --> 49:51.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

49:51.755 --> 49:52.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: And the
reason I
did it that way is because I
think I wanted

49:52.857 --> 49:54.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people to know that I was going
through this
too.

49:54.725 --> 49:58.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I looked at all the parts that I
think are
important in life. I looked at
midlife marriage,

49:58.229 --> 50:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
midlife brain, midlife
friendships, midlife
career, that kind of thing. When
bad things

50:02.566 --> 50:06.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen, what does resilience
research say?
So I looked at kind of all of
these parts

50:06.837 --> 50:11.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of my life that I thought were
really, really
important. And then I said, how
do you thrive?

50:11.342 --> 50:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you thrive at midlife
marriage?

50:13.210 --> 50:17.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you thrive? How do you
make your midlife
brain be sharper? That's how I
approached

50:17.381 --> 50:18.182 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

50:18.215 --> 50:19.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you're doing
OK?

50:19.149 --> 50:20.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: I'm
doing great.

50:20.117 --> 50:21.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:21.986 --> 50:25.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is -- good,
because you want people to buy
the book, right?

50:25.089 --> 50:28.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Life Reimagined" is the book,
"The Science,
Art, and Opportunity of
Midlife."

50:28.692 --> 50:30.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Barbara Bradley Hagerty, thanks
so much.

50:30.995 --> 50:39.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBARA BRADLEY HAGERTY: It's
been a pleasure.
Thank you.

50:39.203 --> 50:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay tuned.

50:42.873 --> 50:48.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Later tonight on "NOVA":
National parks are
key to protecting wildlife, but
even the largest

50:48.112 --> 50:53.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
preserves are often too small to
maintain
diversity and healthy
populations. Researchers

50:53.550 --> 50:56.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
set out to find a solution.

50:56.820 --> 51:03.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Another major barrier
to wildlife
is the four-lane highway. With
several lanes

51:04.028 --> 51:14.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of traffic and speeding cars and
trucks, these
roads can be death traps.

51:15.005 --> 51:23.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many animals are not as lucky as
this cub.
Millions are killed every year.
Woodley and

51:23.814 --> 51:29.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other scientists at Parks Canada
helped design
a road that would protect both
humans and

51:29.453 --> 51:35.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
animals. Forty-four crossing
structures now
allow wildlife to move safely
though Banff

51:35.459 --> 51:37.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
National Park.

51:37.494 --> 51:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: There's two basic kinds of
crossing structures;
there's the underpasses, which
are dark tunnels,

51:43.634 --> 51:47.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then there's the overpasses.
When you're
on top of them, even though you
have a four-lane

51:48.005 --> 51:53.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highway running underneath you,
it seems like
you're in the forest, trees
growing on them.

51:53.711 --> 51:58.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems like certain kinds
of animals
like grizzly bears and wolves
like to use

51:58.983 --> 52:00.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those kind of crossing
structures.

52:00.651 --> 52:03.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The baby bear was
not threatening.

52:03.487 --> 52:05.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

HARI SREENIVASAN: "NOVA" airs
tonight at 9:00
p.m. Eastern on most PBS
stations.

52:08.225 --> 52:12.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tonight on "Charlie Rose": a
conversation
with and performance by
singer-songwriter

52:12.363 --> 52:14.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ben Harper.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: There's
less than a week-and-a-half left
to take advantage

52:17.801 --> 52:23.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a Social Security strategy
that can net
retirees thousands of dollars.
It is called

52:23.574 --> 52:29.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
file and suspend. Our Making
Sense columnist
Larry Kotlikoff explains how it
works.

52:29.813 --> 52:36.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And superhero Faith Herbert, AKA
Zephyr, may
get noticed for her plus-size
physique, but

52:36.653 --> 52:41.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's her mind, and not her body,
that gives
her the most power. We talked to
the writer

52:41.525 --> 52:46.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and editor of the new comic book
series, and
you can read that interview on
our home page.

52:46.730 --> 52:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:49.633 --> 52:52.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that's the
"NewsHour"
for tonight.

52:52.369 --> 52:57.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Thursday, a devastating look
at the tragic
consequences when the mental
health care system

52:57.341 --> 53:01.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fails to help a troubled
individual on a downward
spiral.

53:01.111 --> 53:01.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:02.012 --> 53:03.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:03.881 --> 53:07.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening. For all of us at the
"PBS NewsHour,"

53:07.418 --> 53:15.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
