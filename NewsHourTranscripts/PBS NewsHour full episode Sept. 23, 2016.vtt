JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.274 --> 00:11.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Dramatic cell phone
video taken by the wife of the
victim in this

00:11.845 --> 00:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week's deadly encounter with
Charlotte police
raises even more questions.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:19.386 --> 00:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
take on this
week in politics, as we also
examine a Hillary

00:24.258 --> 00:29.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton presidency in the second
part of our
series on how the candidates
would actually

00:29.997 --> 00:31.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
govern.

00:31.732 --> 00:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Two years after the death
of Michael
Brown at the hands of police in
Ferguson,

00:36.470 --> 00:41.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Missouri, the community turns to
a classic
Greek tragedy for a way to
address ongoing

00:41.975 --> 00:43.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN DOERRIES, Co-Founder,
Outside the Wire:
The central question of this
play, "Antigone,"

00:45.679 --> 00:50.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, what happens when everyone's
right or
feels justified in what they're
doing?

00:50.517 --> 00:54.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.087 --> 00:58.325 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.358 --> 01:10.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For the first
time, the public
is getting a look at the police
shooting that

01:10.570 --> 01:12.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rocked Charlotte, North
Carolina.

01:12.572 --> 01:18.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Keith Scott was killed Monday,
and it turns
out his wife recorded his last
moments.

01:18.111 --> 01:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Be advised: The video may be
disturbing to
some.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT, Wife of Keith
Lamont Scott:
Don't shoot him.

01:23.717 --> 01:24.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't shoot him.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He has no weapon.

01:26.520 --> 01:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The voice of
Rakeyia Scott,
pleading with Charlotte police,
telling them

01:30.590 --> 01:36.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her husband is unarmed and has a
brain injury,
as the confrontation quickly
escalates.

01:36.063 --> 01:37.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Drop the gun!

01:37.864 --> 01:38.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Drop the gun!

01:38.865 --> 01:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: He doesn't have a
gun.

01:40.968 --> 01:41.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He has a TBI.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Drop the gun.

01:43.236 --> 01:45.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: He is not going
to do anything
to you guys.

01:45.505 --> 01:46.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He just took his medicine.

01:46.506 --> 01:47.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Keith, don't let them break the
windows.

01:47.808 --> 01:48.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Come on out the car.

01:48.809 --> 01:49.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Drop the gun!

01:49.810 --> 01:52.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: Keith, don't do
it.

01:52.312 --> 01:53.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Drop the gun!

01:53.313 --> 01:54.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: Get out the car.

01:54.314 --> 01:55.282 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Keith!

01:55.315 --> 01:56.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Keith!

01:56.316 --> 01:57.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't you do it!

01:57.317 --> 01:58.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't you do it!

01:58.318 --> 01:59.286 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Keith!

01:59.319 --> 02:00.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Drop the gun.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: Keith!

02:01.388 --> 02:02.356 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Keith!

02:02.389 --> 02:03.357 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Keith!

02:03.390 --> 02:04.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't you do it!

02:04.391 --> 02:05.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNSHOTS)

02:05.392 --> 02:06.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: Did you shoot
him?

02:06.393 --> 02:07.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did you shoot him?

02:07.561 --> 02:09.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did you shoot him?

02:09.162 --> 02:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Keith Scott is
now lying on
the ground, as his wife screams.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: Did you shoot
him?

02:15.268 --> 02:17.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He better not be (EXPLETIVE
DELETED) dead.

02:17.604 --> 02:19.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He better not be (EXPLETIVE
DELETED) dead.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Release the video!

02:21.241 --> 02:23.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Release the video!

02:23.143 --> 02:28.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of this as
city officials
face mounting pressure to
release police body

02:28.181 --> 02:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
camera and dash cam video.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.651 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
KERR PUTNEY,
Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North
Carolina, Police Chief: One
piece of evidence

02:31.685 --> 02:35.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will never, ever make a good
case.

02:35.288 --> 02:41.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know the expectation that
video footage
can be the panacea, and I can
tell you that

02:41.395 --> 02:43.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is not quite the case.

02:43.196 --> 02:47.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The city's mayor
said today
the police video should be
released, but only

02:47.934 --> 02:50.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it won't jeopardize the
investigation.

02:51.004 --> 02:58.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott's family has now seen the
police footage,
and is calling for its public
release.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And protesters kept up that call
last night.

03:01.415 --> 03:06.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: If you want people to not
come out here,
and protest, and not to be
suspicious or second-guess

03:06.853 --> 03:10.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what's going on with the
politicians and the
police, you need to have
transparency.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People need to -- people need to
know the
truth.

03:12.459 --> 03:18.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thursday's
demonstrations were
largely peaceful, as the city
imposed a midnight

03:18.532 --> 03:22.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
curfew, and National Guard
troops helped patrol
the streets.

03:22.669 --> 03:28.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, police say they
arrested a suspect
in the fatal shooting of a
protester, Justin

03:28.675 --> 03:30.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Carr, on Wednesday night.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They gave no other details.

03:32.846 --> 03:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on that new video and
the ongoing
investigation, we turn to
Yamiche Alcindor,

03:37.918 --> 03:41.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who is covering the events in
Charlotte for
The New York Times.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I spoke to her a short time ago.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yamiche Alcindor, thank you very
much for
talking with us.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We just showed that video.

03:48.895 --> 03:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were one of the reporters
the family gave
this to.

03:53.433 --> 03:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where was Mr. Scott's wife when
she took this?

03:56.770 --> 04:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR, The New York
Times: Mr.
Scott's wife was nearby his car.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was in the complex where
they lived together.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have been married about 20
years.

04:05.779 --> 04:09.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she, from my understanding,
what the lawyers
told me, she had seen her
husband sitting

04:09.916 --> 04:11.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the car.

04:11.718 --> 04:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He flashed his cell phone at her
indicating
that he wanted -- that he his
phone was dying

04:14.955 --> 04:16.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that he wanted a charger.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She then went inside to go get
that cell phone
charger.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was inside only for a couple
of minutes,
and then she came out.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when she came out, she saw
the scene unfolding
and, as the scene was unfolding,
she started

04:26.867 --> 04:30.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to record her video, to record
the video on
her phone.

04:30.370 --> 04:36.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it is very
difficult to
watch, as we just showed our
audience.

04:36.376 --> 04:37.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's been the reaction?

04:37.711 --> 04:40.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has there been any official
reaction since
this has been out?

04:40.547 --> 04:45.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: From my
understanding, we
have asked for several hours now
for a reaction

04:45.485 --> 04:50.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the city, and we have not,
as of this
hour, gotten any reaction from
the city about

04:50.690 --> 04:52.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this video.

04:52.559 --> 04:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should say the police chief
has said that
the dash cam video, which is a
different video

04:55.996 --> 05:00.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than the video that was released
today, but
that that video doesn't really
answer all

05:00.967 --> 05:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the questions and it's not
definitive what
happened.

05:03.537 --> 05:08.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they have at least talked a
little bit
about what the video, all the
videos that

05:08.942 --> 05:10.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
captured the shooting show.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, in that regard, they have
done that.

05:12.245 --> 05:16.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But they have not at all
responded specifically
to the video released today by
the family

05:16.416 --> 05:17.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Keith Scott.

05:17.784 --> 05:21.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What questions,
Yamiche, does
this video answer?

05:21.821 --> 05:29.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know there are some blurry
objects on the
ground near where Mr. Scott's
body is lying.

05:29.262 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there any consensus on
whether there was
a gun?

05:33.300 --> 05:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: The family has
said -- has
told us through their attorneys
that Mr. Scott

05:41.408 --> 05:43.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't own a gun.

05:43.243 --> 05:48.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was told by the attorneys
today that the
wife often cleaned that vehicle
and that there

05:48.248 --> 05:51.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was not a -- she never saw a gun
and that
he didn't own a gun.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, the police, of course,
have been
very clear.

05:54.221 --> 05:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say that he did have a gun,
that they
had found a gun -- that they had
found a gun

05:57.791 --> 05:59.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on him after the shooting.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not exactly sure where
that gun was
found.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, they are saying that
there was a
gun on the scene.

06:05.265 --> 06:09.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of what this video --
the questions
this video answers, that was one
of the first

06:09.669 --> 06:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questions that I asked the
attorney.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I got on the phone, I
made a list
of questions.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first one I said was, well,
what does
this video show?

06:15.442 --> 06:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think that the video
tells us?

06:17.444 --> 06:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, really, they said this
video doesn't
tell us all that much.

06:20.347 --> 06:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It obviously just shows you kind
of the emotion
and the chaos that unfolded when
Keith Scott

06:26.052 --> 06:27.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was killed.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there really isn't anything
in terms of
whether or not he had a gun in
his hand, whether

06:30.557 --> 06:34.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or not he was walking toward
police or walking
away from police.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was really no -- there was
really not
much captured.

06:37.597 --> 06:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The video is very shaky, as your
audience,
I'm sure, has seen.

06:40.967 --> 06:45.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea is that this video
really doesn't
show a clear picture even really
of Keith

06:45.105 --> 06:46.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Scott himself.

06:46.873 --> 06:51.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, I have been told by the
attorneys
that the dash cam video that
they saw with

06:51.578 --> 06:55.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the family, that that shows a
lot more than
the video that was released
today.

06:55.248 --> 07:00.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say that that video shows
Keith Scott
backing up and that he had his
hands down

07:00.287 --> 07:02.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at his side.

07:02.155 --> 07:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said that there was some
sort of object
in his left hand, but they're
not sure what

07:05.292 --> 07:07.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that object was.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are saying that he was
right-handed,
and that they are not -- and
that that would

07:09.629 --> 07:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be the hand that he -- so, in
other words,
he would be holding an object in
the hand

07:13.166 --> 07:16.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he wouldn't have usually
been using primarily.

07:16.069 --> 07:21.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the family is not at all
saying specifically
to me that he didn't have a gun
in his hand.

07:21.141 --> 07:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are saying that no one has
seen a gun
on him and that they didn't
believe that he

07:25.645 --> 07:27.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
owned a gun.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, I have been talking to
the attorneys
now for two days, and they're
not telling

07:30.016 --> 07:33.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me definitely he definitely
didn't have a
gun, the video shows that he
didn't have a

07:33.720 --> 07:34.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gun.

07:34.721 --> 07:36.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're definitely not saying
that

07:36.289 --> 07:41.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Yamiche,
reaction in the community to
this?

07:41.394 --> 07:42.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are they saying?

07:42.395 --> 07:44.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are people saying?

07:44.230 --> 07:49.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: People are
saying that this
video illustrates that the
police really need

07:49.502 --> 07:54.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to release the videos that they
have, the
dash cam video and the body cam
video, need

07:54.240 --> 07:57.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to give us more information
about what happened.

07:57.744 --> 08:02.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people I have talked to so
far say that
the fact they're screaming, you
know, gun

08:02.615 --> 08:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they're saying put your
hands up, and
the wife is screaming he doesn't
have a gun

08:05.985 --> 08:09.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and trying to explain to them
that he has
a traumatic brain injury, that
he had just

08:09.823 --> 08:14.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken his medication, that
indicates to people
that I have talked to that the
police really

08:14.594 --> 08:18.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were looking at this and looking
at Keith
Scott as someone who was violent
from the

08:18.431 --> 08:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning, and they were not
really taking
into consideration the fact that
this might

08:21.101 --> 08:25.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have someone who was disabled,
someone whose
wife was standing there really
trying to explain

08:25.505 --> 08:26.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to them the situation.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So people are very angry at
seeing this video.

08:28.908 --> 08:32.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I should say that people
also say this
doesn't prove that he didn't
point a gun at

08:32.879 --> 08:34.214 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
police.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they really want all the
other videos to
be released as well.

08:36.449 --> 08:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yamiche Alcindor,
reporting
in Charlotte, we thank you.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Thanks.

08:43.089 --> 08:47.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: A
Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer
accused of

08:47.961 --> 08:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fatally shooting an unarmed
black man turned
herself in early today.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Betty Shelby is charged with
first-degree
manslaughter.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She was released after posting a
$50,000 bond.

08:59.506 --> 09:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her first court appearance is
next week.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Donald Trump got a
boost today
ahead of the first presidential
debate on

09:06.780 --> 09:08.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Monday night.

09:08.615 --> 09:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a reversal, former rival
Texas Senator
Ted Cruz announced that he will
vote for Trump

09:13.787 --> 09:15.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after all.

09:15.422 --> 09:20.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Writing on Facebook, Cruz said:
"I promised
to support the Republican
nominee.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I intend to keep my word."

09:22.195 --> 09:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's
camp called for
increased scrutiny of Trump at
the debate.

09:27.267 --> 09:33.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A spokeswoman said -- quote --
"His level
of lying is unprecedented in
American politics."

09:33.640 --> 09:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal appeals court has
struck down Ohio's
process for purging voters from
the rolls

09:39.813 --> 09:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if they haven't voted in at
least two years.

09:42.749 --> 09:48.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court ruled today that the
process removes
people who are in fact still
eligible to vote.

09:48.922 --> 09:53.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state's Republican elections
chief defended
the process, saying that Ohio
has used it

09:53.927 --> 09:56.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for more than 20 years.

09:56.296 --> 10:02.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bombs rained down on Syria's
largest city
today in the fiercest aerial
onslaught there

10:02.168 --> 10:03.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
yet.

10:03.970 --> 10:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The heavy air attacks on Aleppo
came as the
Syrian government's military
launched a new

10:08.308 --> 10:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offensive to retake the city
with backing
from Russia.

10:12.278 --> 10:17.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rescuers worked to dig out
victims buried
beneath the rubble, but they
came under fire

10:17.450 --> 10:19.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

10:19.252 --> 10:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM AL-HAJ, Syria (through
translator):
We weren't able to help them
quickly because

10:23.122 --> 10:27.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the shelling that we were
subjected to
as we were pulling them from
under the debris

10:27.460 --> 10:28.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all night.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have never in my life seen
such a bombardment.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is very, very intense.

10:32.599 --> 10:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The assault on
Aleppo appeared
to shred any remaining hope of
reviving last

10:37.670 --> 10:39.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
week's cease-fire.

10:39.439 --> 10:43.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, U.S. Secretary of State
John Kerry
says that he and his Russian
counterpart made

10:44.010 --> 10:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- quote -- "a little bit of
progress" in
talks today.

10:47.981 --> 10:53.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a veto
showdown now
looms over an act of Congress
permitting families

10:53.286 --> 10:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi
Arabia, the home
of most of the hijackers.

10:59.092 --> 11:04.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama rejected the
bill today, saying
that it could boomerang against
U.S. troops

11:04.130 --> 11:06.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and diplomats abroad.

11:06.232 --> 11:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even so, the House and Senate
may have the
votes to override the veto.

11:11.037 --> 11:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
slumped after a
new drop in oil prices.

11:15.208 --> 11:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 131
points to close at 18261.

11:21.147 --> 11:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 33, and the S&amp;P
500 slid 12.

11:25.518 --> 11:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
gained about
1 percent.

11:29.956 --> 11:35.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how President
Hillary Clinton would govern on
day one; inside

11:35.962 --> 11:43.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last meeting of Colombia's
largest rebel
group ahead of a deal to end 50
years of war;

11:43.036 --> 11:56.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks'
take on the
week's news; and much more.

11:56.749 --> 12:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, we're taking a close
look at how
the presidential candidates
might actually

12:01.387 --> 12:03.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
govern.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, the focus was on
what Donald Trump's
early days in office could look
like.

12:06.726 --> 12:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we turn to Hillary
Clinton and what
her campaign statements tell us
about a Clinton-led

12:12.065 --> 12:13.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang takes it from there.

12:14.834 --> 12:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hillary Clinton's
opponents have
said that her presidency will be
extension

12:18.771 --> 12:20.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Obama agenda.

12:20.573 --> 12:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what would the early days of
a Hillary
Clinton White House look like?

12:24.744 --> 12:28.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What might she propose and what
could she
actually get done?

12:28.114 --> 12:30.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For this, we turn to my
colleague Lisa Desjardins.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Amie Parnes, who's in New
York.

12:32.852 --> 12:37.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's the co-author of "HRC" and
senior White
House correspondent for The
Hill.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Amie, let me start with you.

12:40.259 --> 12:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You literally wrote the book on
Hillary Clinton.

12:43.463 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think her priorities
will be in
the first days in the White
House?

12:47.400 --> 12:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIE PARNES, The Hill: Well,
she's mentioned
as much on the campaign trail
repeatedly.

12:51.571 --> 13:00.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said that she wants to push
a major infrastructure
bill to fix roads and bridges
and highways

13:00.246 --> 13:01.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the country.

13:01.347 --> 13:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She also wants to do a whole
immigration overhaul.

13:06.486 --> 13:10.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something that she
says is at the
top, the very top of her list.

13:10.456 --> 13:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also wants to get done
campaign finance
reform, and I think, also, she's
going to

13:15.028 --> 13:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to deal with the Supreme
Court and whether
or not she picks up Obama's
appointee and

13:21.000 --> 13:22.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
takes that forward.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that is going to be
interesting to see
in this political climate.

13:25.838 --> 13:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Amie, based on
your reporting
on Hillary Clinton, based on her
time in the

13:33.079 --> 13:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate, do you think she's going
to take a
bipartisan approach, try to be
more bipartisan

13:37.917 --> 13:38.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than we have seen in the past?

13:38.918 --> 13:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMIE PARNES: I definitely think
so.

13:41.120 --> 13:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you talk to people who have
worked with
both Clintons, they're very much
into working

13:47.860 --> 13:51.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
across the aisle, to extending
an arm.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have spoken to Trent Lott
about this.

13:53.766 --> 14:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he was majority leader, he
worked with
Majority Leader Daschle and with
Bill Clinton.

14:00.206 --> 14:05.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He feels very confident, he has
said in the
past, that Secretary Clinton
will work in

14:05.445 --> 14:07.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the same way.

14:07.180 --> 14:11.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has a pretty good track
record of working
across the aisle with
Republicans.

14:11.517 --> 14:16.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She worked with Tom DeLay and
other Republicans,
so I think this is very much her
approach.

14:16.622 --> 14:20.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think she's very much a
centrist and I think
this is what she's really
looking to do when

14:20.259 --> 14:21.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
she takes the office.

14:21.994 --> 14:25.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa, one of the many
things you
watch here at the "NewsHour" is
the other

14:25.131 --> 14:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
end of Pennsylvania Avenue.

14:26.899 --> 14:32.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Is that outreach or
bipartisanship going to
be replied to or answered, do
you think?

14:32.538 --> 14:34.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It remains to
be seen.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In her corner, Hillary Clinton
has two big
factors in Congress.

14:37.410 --> 14:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has a growing women's caucus
that she's
worked with for a long time,
right now, 20

14:42.415 --> 14:43.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
female senators.

14:43.983 --> 14:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It could be 19 or 20, depending
on what happens
this election, very likely 20.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she also has something even
better.

14:49.789 --> 14:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has a commanding general
coming into his
own, Chuck Schumer.

14:53.826 --> 14:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And notice, in the past few
years, year-and-a-half,
we haven't seen him on our air
very much.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's because he's becoming
more bipartisan
himself.

15:01.768 --> 15:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been reaching across the
aisle in preparation,
I think, for becoming the new
Democratic leader.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he's trying to build that
groundwork for
her.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She has got that.

15:11.544 --> 15:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also, however, John, has
some conservative
Democratic senators who are not
going to agree

15:15.114 --> 15:16.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with her on everything.

15:16.215 --> 15:18.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And talk more about
the women senators.

15:18.718 --> 15:22.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a very tight group, as you
know, and
includes Republicans.

15:22.989 --> 15:25.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Could that help her reach across
the aisle?

15:25.291 --> 15:27.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I'm sure she's
hoping so.

15:27.293 --> 15:30.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is an interesting group,
because they eat
dinner together, they support
each other,

15:30.930 --> 15:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they want to grow their ranks
across the aisle.

15:33.900 --> 15:38.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some of them are in very
risky Senate
seats and they can only go so
far.

15:38.771 --> 15:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Hillary Clinton is perceived
as unpopular
as she becomes president, some
of these female

15:43.576 --> 15:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
senators are not going to take a
big risk
for her.

15:46.045 --> 15:49.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not going to support
maybe tax cuts
-- or tax increases for the
wealthy.

15:49.615 --> 15:53.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may support some things
that are more
across-the-board popular, like a
change in

15:53.753 --> 15:58.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
child care or perhaps a smaller
infrastructure
plan than the one Hillary
Clinton is proposing

15:58.825 --> 16:00.059 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

16:00.092 --> 16:03.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amie, you mentioned
the Supreme
Court vacancy.

16:03.396 --> 16:08.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could be an issue that
she's got to deal
with starting essentially on day
one.

16:08.968 --> 16:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think that will tell
us about
the rest of her -- about her
approach to Congress,

16:13.639 --> 16:15.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about her attitude toward
Congress?

16:15.808 --> 16:22.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIE PARNES: It will tell us a
lot, and she's
going to have quite a little
debacle, because

16:22.582 --> 16:25.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she's going to face some stress
and some pressure
from the left.

16:25.918 --> 16:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to want her to not
go with someone
like Merrick Garland and pick
someone who

16:30.990 --> 16:34.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a little more of their liking
and of their
ilk.

16:34.594 --> 16:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then she's going to face --
it basically
shows what she's going to do
with Republicans,

16:40.666 --> 16:45.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if she kind of, you know, walks
toward them
a little bit and offers someone
who's more

16:46.005 --> 16:47.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
centrist.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's very much -- you
can kind of
read the tea leaves there and
see how she's

16:50.476 --> 16:52.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to govern.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Lisa, do you
think the leaders
on the Hill, the Republican
leaders on the

16:55.147 --> 16:57.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hill, are going to take that as
an indication
as well?

16:57.650 --> 16:59.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Absolutely.

16:59.318 --> 17:02.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be one of the first big
signs of how
she's going to work with them or
not.

17:02.221 --> 17:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's even more important
than just sort
of predicting what the next few
years are

17:06.192 --> 17:08.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to be.

17:08.194 --> 17:11.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That Supreme Court choice may
determine what
she can do on immigration, not
just any comprehensive

17:11.898 --> 17:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reform that may or may not go
through Congress,
but can she issue executive
orders, can she

17:16.335 --> 17:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep President Obama's executive
orders?

17:18.971 --> 17:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That Supreme Court choice will
determine all
of that.

17:22.041 --> 17:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amie, are there
things that she
might try to do by executive
action, rather

17:26.178 --> 17:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than going to Congress first?

17:28.481 --> 17:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMIE PARNES: I think there are
quite a few.

17:30.883 --> 17:37.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think she's going to try to
take Obama's
executive actions a little
further on immigration,

17:37.089 --> 17:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think maybe on climate.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has basically tiptoed and
hinted as much
about this.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she's been asked about this.

17:44.397 --> 17:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of Republicans
kind of feel
threatened that she's already
talking about

17:48.334 --> 17:50.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taking executive action.

17:50.136 --> 17:54.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think her first step would be
to work with
Congress, and I think that's her
preference,

17:54.907 --> 17:58.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so I don't think she's going to
move right
away into executive action.

17:58.311 --> 18:03.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Lisa, what's her
relations
with, or what do you think the
relations will

18:03.649 --> 18:09.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be between the Republican
majority leader,
Mitch McConnell, and the
Republican leader

18:09.455 --> 18:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- we don't know if he will be
majority or
minority -- and the House
speaker, who likely

18:12.992 --> 18:14.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will remain House speaker, Paul
Ryan?

18:14.694 --> 18:16.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

18:16.529 --> 18:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both of those men have their own
very complex
dynamics within their caucuses
or conferences.

18:21.067 --> 18:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that Hillary Clinton has
worked with
Mitch McConnell in the past.

18:24.303 --> 18:28.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We understand it's a
relationship of respect,
not a particularly warm
relationship necessarily,

18:28.841 --> 18:32.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vs. Mitch McConnell who did work
perhaps best
of all with Joe Biden.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something she will have
to work on,
but there is a potential there.

18:35.781 --> 18:42.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Ryan, I think, he is
someone who has
such difficult dynamics in his
own conference.

18:42.154 --> 18:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has the far right, who
sometimes says they
will just jump ship on him.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's got moderates.

18:47.927 --> 18:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are things that the White
House under
Hillary Clinton is going to have
to be very

18:50.429 --> 18:51.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tactical about.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are strategists.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to try to use that
to their
advantage, but it's difficult
for them, because

18:56.702 --> 19:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes Paul Ryan cannot make
the decisions
himself for his conference.

19:00.473 --> 19:05.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amie, we have less
than 30 seconds
left, but how do you think a
President Hillary

19:05.745 --> 19:09.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton would make use of a
President Bill
Clinton?

19:09.148 --> 19:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIE PARNES: I think that's a
really interesting
question, and a lot of us want
to know that.

19:14.020 --> 19:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She talked about making him
maybe an economic
adviser, and got a little bit of
pushback

19:18.691 --> 19:19.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for that.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think she is definitely
going to put
him to use.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is not going to have the
traditional spouse
role.

19:23.796 --> 19:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She will definitely, obviously,
send him to
Capitol Hill, I would think, to
work with

19:27.600 --> 19:29.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people that he knows.

19:29.402 --> 19:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she will probably host --
she and he maybe
will host meetings at the White
House for

19:33.539 --> 19:35.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
both Democrats and Republicans.

19:35.207 --> 19:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure that's something
that they want
to start right away.

19:38.677 --> 19:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amie Parnes, Lisa
Desjardins, thank
you very much.

19:43.049 --> 19:50.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMIE PARNES: Thank you.

19:50.256 --> 19:58.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This coming
Monday, in Cartagena,
Colombia, a peace deal will be
signed that

19:58.497 --> 20:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aims to end more than 50 years
of war.

20:01.634 --> 20:07.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The accord also will mark the
end of the insurgency
by the revolutionary armed
forces of Colombia,

20:07.573 --> 20:09.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
known as the FARC.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has more.

20:10.976 --> 20:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All this week,
the guerrilla
group has been meeting at a
desolate location

20:14.613 --> 20:16.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Southern Colombia.

20:16.315 --> 20:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, unanimously, the FARC
voted to approve
the deal and form a new
political party.

20:21.921 --> 20:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the signing this coming
Monday, the
accord must survive one more
hurdle, a nationwide

20:26.759 --> 20:29.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
popular referendum next weekend.

20:29.662 --> 20:33.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Nadja
Drost has been
at this meeting all week, and
joins me now.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nadja, we usually don't talk
about political
conventions in other countries.

20:36.202 --> 20:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the images that I have seen
from here
have sound stages, fog machines.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It seems almost like a musical
festival.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Give us a sense of what it was
like there.

20:43.742 --> 20:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Well, to give you a
sense of
where we are, we are in the
middle of the

20:49.181 --> 20:53.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colombian plains, essentially
the middle of
nowhere, and we're surrounded by
miles and

20:53.652 --> 20:55.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
miles of shrubland.

20:55.321 --> 21:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It might strike one as a strange
place to
hold an enormous conference, but
this is a

21:01.594 --> 21:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FARC stronghold and it has
significant historical
meaning for the rebel group.

21:09.735 --> 21:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The conference that the FARC has
been holding
here this week is historic.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is their final conference as
an armed group.

21:17.843 --> 21:23.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here, they have made the
decision to terminate
their armed existence and they
have been plotting

21:23.282 --> 21:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their strategy to transform to a
political
party.

21:27.319 --> 21:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you mentioned, there are
sound stages,
concerts.

21:31.724 --> 21:35.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are also guerrilla camps.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're really going all out.

21:37.530 --> 21:43.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It looks like the FARC are using
this as an
opportunity to introduce a new
face to the

21:43.969 --> 21:46.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Colombian and international
public.

21:46.906 --> 21:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With over 300 journalists here
camped out
in the middle of nowhere, it's a
chance for

21:51.710 --> 21:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FARC to change the image of
them as a
narco-terrorist group to a group
of rebels

21:57.950 --> 22:02.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who very much want peace and
want to transform
themselves to become political
actors.

22:02.688 --> 22:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
what's the
next step here?

22:05.291 --> 22:07.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do they move forward to
disarm?

22:07.193 --> 22:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: If the peace
accords do receive
approval from the Colombian
public, then FARC

22:13.332 --> 22:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troops, thousands of them, will
start mobilizing
themselves into large areas that
are being

22:19.205 --> 22:24.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called zones of concentration,
where they
will stay put for six months as
they start

22:24.710 --> 22:27.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a gradual process of
disarmament.

22:27.046 --> 22:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But FARC leaders here this week
said that
they need assurance that an
amnesty law will

22:34.086 --> 22:37.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be passed before their troops
can move anywhere.

22:37.823 --> 22:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are demanding that they
have legal protections
to ensure their troops are not
going to get

22:43.862 --> 22:45.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
arrested as they move on that.

22:45.998 --> 22:50.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What are the
indications
in how that referendum vote will
go?

22:50.135 --> 22:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: It is leaning more
towards the
side of accepting the peace
deal.

22:54.773 --> 23:00.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, there is a very strong
campaign,
being led mostly by former
President Alvaro

23:00.779 --> 23:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Uribe, in rejection of the peace
deal.

23:04.250 --> 23:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, both sides of the
negotiation, both
the FARC and the government,
have made very

23:09.755 --> 23:15.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear that, if the no side wins,
if the public
rejects this peace deal, there
is no way that

23:15.928 --> 23:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are going back to the
negotiating table.

23:19.565 --> 23:25.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the FARC head
negotiators, Carlos Antonio
Lozada, told reporters that
there is not even

23:25.871 --> 23:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the remotest possibility.

23:27.673 --> 23:33.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the government side, it's
expected
that in the case that this
referendum fails

23:33.212 --> 23:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the peace process, then we will
likely not
see another negotiation for at
least 10 years.

23:39.518 --> 23:43.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So both the FARC and the
government are sending
a very strong message to the
public that this

23:43.989 --> 23:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Colombia's best, if not
possibly last chance
for peace.

23:48.894 --> 23:51.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Nadja, you have
covered the FARC for a long
time.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did we get to this point?

23:53.365 --> 23:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: There have been
many attempts
in the past decades to end this
conflict,

23:57.369 --> 24:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both through negotiation or
through military
means.

24:01.373 --> 24:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Essentially, both sides have
become very tired
of war.

24:05.778 --> 24:09.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Colombia has lived now in 52
years of war.

24:09.148 --> 24:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The FARC has suffered year after
year of military
blows.

24:14.653 --> 24:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Their ranks have been shrinking.

24:16.388 --> 24:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And despite very strong military
campaigns,
the Colombian government has not
defeated

24:22.027 --> 24:23.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them entirely.

24:23.862 --> 24:29.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that it became clear
to both sides
that this war was going to be
intractable

24:29.668 --> 24:31.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unless a negotiation took place.

24:31.737 --> 24:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
special correspondent
Nadja Drost joining us from
Colombia tonight,

24:36.041 --> 24:37.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

24:37.309 --> 24:44.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Thank you so much.

24:44.183 --> 24:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

24:50.723 --> 24:54.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

24:54.927 --> 24:55.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy.

24:57.763 --> 25:02.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we turn to
the lead story
tonight and for the last few
nights, David,

25:02.568 --> 25:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two more shootings in Tulsa and
Charlotte,
North Carolina, by police of
black men.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're still getting the
information.

25:10.776 --> 25:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know the Tulsa policewoman
was charged
with manslaughter.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are we to make of this, the
fact that
these keep happening?

25:17.883 --> 25:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, first of
all, the videos
are just harrowing and have an
effect on,

25:22.755 --> 25:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, all of us and an effect
on the national
mood.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just this is a man losing
his life.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a wife losing her
husband.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are cops in the middle.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can feel the pressure
building on
them as they don't know -- quite
know what

25:34.466 --> 25:35.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beyond that, we don't really
know that much.

25:37.136 --> 25:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think these things -- these
particular
situations are always going to
happen.

25:41.874 --> 25:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems to me there are two
issues here,
one, getting justice in the
individual case

25:45.644 --> 25:50.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or these individual cases and
all the individual
cases, and then, second, which
is to me more

25:50.649 --> 25:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serious and the more political
subject, is,
we do know there is tremendous
racial disparities

25:57.623 --> 26:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in searches, in arrests, in all
sorts of police
activities, maybe not in police
killings.

26:03.061 --> 26:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Harvard Research shows there is
not much racial
disparity there, but just about
in every other

26:06.799 --> 26:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police activity, there are these
huge racial
disparities.

26:09.568 --> 26:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we see the protests, at
least the
legitimate parts of the
protests, that's the

26:13.605 --> 26:15.407 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
problem.

26:15.441 --> 26:17.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so some -- I think it's
useful to separate
these individual cases -- and we
don't know

26:18.010 --> 26:22.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what happened here yet -- from
the larger
problem, which is indisputable.

26:22.347 --> 26:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And finding a solution to that
larger problem
is really the political issue.

26:25.484 --> 26:27.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

26:27.319 --> 26:32.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And can we focus on the real
problem, Mark,
when we have these -- when
feelings run high,

26:32.291 --> 26:33.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
emotions run high,
understandably?

26:33.559 --> 26:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I'm not sure.

26:35.461 --> 26:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think really we have so
far, certainly.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, there's -- I agree with
David.

26:40.165 --> 26:43.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is so incredible -- it's
wrenching and
it's sobering.

26:43.702 --> 26:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my own perspective on it has
changed since
Senator Tim Scott, the
African-American Republican

26:51.376 --> 26:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from South Carolina, took to the
Senate floor,
a card-carrying conservative, an
authentic

26:56.548 --> 27:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative man, ran as such,
got elected
and reelected as such, and said
-- spoke about

27:03.255 --> 27:11.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his own experience of being
stopped seven
times by police officers for the
principal

27:11.296 --> 27:18.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offense of, as he put it,
driving a new car
in the wrong neighborhood, or
even being stopped

27:18.403 --> 27:22.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Capitol Police and demanded
to show his
I.D.

27:22.975 --> 27:29.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It does give you an idea that
this is a real
problem understanding fully the
pressures

27:30.015 --> 27:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that David talked about and the
risks that
police officers do take.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

27:36.388 --> 27:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Dramatic cell phone
video taken by the wife of the
victim in this

27:37.890 --> 27:39.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week's deadly encounter with
Charlotte police
raises even more questions.

27:39.691 --> 27:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's Friday. Mark Shields
and David Brooks
take on this week in politics,
as we also

27:41.560 --> 27:42.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
examine a Hillary Clinton
presidency in the
second part of our series on how
the candidates

27:42.127 --> 27:43.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would actually govern.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Two years after the death
of Michael
Brown at the hands of police in
Ferguson,

27:45.597 --> 27:45.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Missouri, the community turns to
a classic
Greek tragedy for a way to
address ongoing

27:45.898 --> 27:47.799 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

27:47.833 --> 27:49.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN DOERRIES, Co-Founder,
Outside the Wire:
The central question of this
play, "Antigone,"

27:49.434 --> 27:50.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, what happens when everyone's
right or
feels justified in what they're
doing?

27:50.702 --> 27:50.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

27:51.003 --> 27:52.804 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

27:52.838 --> 27:54.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For the first
time, the public
is getting a look at the police
shooting that

27:54.673 --> 27:55.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rocked Charlotte, North
Carolina. Keith Scott
was killed Monday, and it turns
out his wife

27:55.307 --> 27:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recorded his last moments.

27:56.441 --> 27:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Be advised: The video may be
disturbing to
some.

27:58.243 --> 27:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT, Wife of Keith
Lamont Scott:
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot
him. He has no

27:58.544 --> 28:00.312 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weapon.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The voice of
Rakeyia Scott,
pleading with Charlotte police,
telling them

28:02.114 --> 28:02.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her husband is unarmed and has a
brain injury,
as the confrontation quickly
escalates.

28:02.814 --> 28:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

28:03.949 --> 28:04.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: He doesn't have a
gun. He has
a TBI.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Drop the gun.

28:05.784 --> 28:06.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: He is not going
to do anything
to you guys.

28:06.418 --> 28:07.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He just took his medicine.

28:07.719 --> 28:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keith, don't let them break the
windows. Come
on out the car.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Drop the gun!

28:09.054 --> 28:09.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: Keith, don't do
it.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Drop the gun!

28:11.356 --> 28:11.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: Get out the car.
Keith! Keith!
Don't you do it! Don't you do
it! Keith!

28:11.857 --> 28:12.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Drop the gun.

28:13.025 --> 28:13.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: Keith! Keith!
Keith! Don't
you do it!

28:13.392 --> 28:14.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNSHOTS)

28:14.893 --> 28:16.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: Did you shoot
him? Did you
shoot him? Did you shoot him?

28:16.428 --> 28:18.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Keith Scott is
now lying on
the ground, as his wife screams.

28:18.196 --> 28:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAKEYIA SCOTT: Did you shoot
him? He better
not be (EXPLETIVE DELETED) dead.
He better

28:18.897 --> 28:19.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not be (EXPLETIVE DELETED) dead.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Release the video!
Release the
video!

28:21.934 --> 28:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All of this as
city officials
face mounting pressure to
release police body

28:22.568 --> 28:24.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
camera and dash cam video.

28:24.403 --> 28:26.104 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
KERR PUTNEY,
Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North
Carolina, Police Chief: One
piece of evidence

28:26.138 --> 28:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will never, ever make a good
case. I know
the expectation that video
footage can be

28:27.406 --> 28:29.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the panacea, and I can tell you
that is not
quite the case.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The city's mayor
said today
the police video should be
released, but only

28:31.043 --> 28:32.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it won't jeopardize the
investigation.
Scott's family has now seen the
police footage,

28:32.811 --> 28:34.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and is calling for its public
release. And
protesters kept up that call
last night.

28:34.813 --> 28:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: If you want people to not
come out here,
and protest, and not to be
suspicious or second-guess

28:36.615 --> 28:37.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what's going on with the
politicians and the
police, you need to have
transparency. People

28:37.549 --> 28:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need to -- people need to know
the truth.

28:39.518 --> 28:40.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thursday's
demonstrations were
largely peaceful, as the city
imposed a midnight

28:40.819 --> 28:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
curfew, and National Guard
troops helped patrol
the streets.

28:42.688 --> 28:43.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, police say they
arrested a suspect
in the fatal shooting of a
protester, Justin

28:43.855 --> 28:45.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carr, on Wednesday night. They
gave no other
details.

28:45.691 --> 28:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on that new video and
the ongoing
investigation, we turn to
Yamiche Alcindor,

28:47.526 --> 28:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is covering the events in
Charlotte for
The New York Times. I spoke to
her a short

28:47.893 --> 28:49.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time ago.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yamiche Alcindor, thank you very
much for
talking with us.

28:50.896 --> 28:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just showed that video. You
were one of
the reporters the family gave
this to. Where

28:51.830 --> 28:53.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was Mr. Scott's wife when she
took this?

28:53.565 --> 28:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR, The New York
Times: Mr.
Scott's wife was nearby his car.
She was in

28:55.200 --> 28:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the complex where they lived
together. They
have been married about 20
years.

28:57.002 --> 28:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she, from my understanding,
what the lawyers
told me, she had seen her
husband sitting

28:58.870 --> 29:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the car. He flashed his cell
phone at her
indicating that he wanted --
that he his phone

29:00.639 --> 29:02.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was dying and that he wanted a
charger. She
then went inside to go get that
cell phone

29:02.207 --> 29:04.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charger. She was inside only for
a couple
of minutes, and then she came
out.

29:04.142 --> 29:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when she came out, she saw
the scene unfolding
and, as the scene was unfolding,
she started

29:05.410 --> 29:07.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to record her video, to record
the video on
her phone.

29:07.145 --> 29:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it is very
difficult to
watch, as we just showed our
audience.

29:08.947 --> 29:10.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's been the reaction? Has
there been any
official reaction since this has
been out?

29:10.816 --> 29:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: From my
understanding, we
have asked for several hours now
for a reaction

29:12.618 --> 29:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the city, and we have not,
as of this
hour, gotten any reaction from
the city about

29:13.018 --> 29:14.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this video.

29:14.886 --> 29:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should say the police chief
has said that
the dash cam video, which is a
different video

29:16.622 --> 29:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than the video that was released
today, but
that that video doesn't really
answer all

29:17.789 --> 29:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the questions and it's not
definitive what
happened.

29:19.558 --> 29:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they have at least talked a
little bit
about what the video, all the
videos that

29:21.393 --> 29:23.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
captured the shooting show. So,
in that regard,
they have done that. But they
have not at

29:23.161 --> 29:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all responded specifically to
the video released
today by the family of Keith
Scott.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What questions,
Yamiche, does
this video answer? I know there
are some blurry

29:26.932 --> 29:27.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
objects on the ground near where
Mr. Scott's
body is lying. Is there any
consensus on whether

29:27.366 --> 29:29.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
there was a gun?

29:29.201 --> 29:31.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: The family has
said -- has
told us through their attorneys
that Mr. Scott

29:31.103 --> 29:32.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't own a gun. I was told by
the attorneys
today that the wife often
cleaned that vehicle

29:32.738 --> 29:34.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that there was not a -- she
never saw
a gun and that he didn't own a
gun.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, the police, of course,
have been
very clear. They say that he did
have a gun,

29:36.375 --> 29:38.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they had found a gun --
that they had
found a gun on him after the
shooting. They're

29:38.143 --> 29:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not exactly sure where that gun
was found.
However, they are saying that
there was a

29:38.644 --> 29:40.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gun on the scene.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of what this video --
the questions
this video answers, that was one
of the first

29:42.381 --> 29:44.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions that I asked the
attorney. And when
I got on the phone, I made a
list of questions.

29:44.149 --> 29:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first one I said was, well,
what does
this video show? What do you
think that the

29:44.583 --> 29:46.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
video tells us?

29:46.451 --> 29:48.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, really, they said this
video doesn't
tell us all that much. It
obviously just shows

29:48.220 --> 29:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you kind of the emotion and the
chaos that
unfolded when Keith Scott was
killed. But

29:50.022 --> 29:51.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there really isn't anything in
terms of whether
or not he had a gun in his hand,
whether or

29:51.857 --> 29:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not he was walking toward police
or walking
away from police. There was
really no -- there

29:52.557 --> 29:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was really not much captured.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The video is very shaky, as your
audience,
I'm sure, has seen. And the idea
is that this

29:56.161 --> 29:57.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
video really doesn't show a
clear picture
even really of Keith Scott
himself. However,

29:57.929 --> 29:59.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have been told by the
attorneys that the
dash cam video that they saw
with the family,

29:59.297 --> 30:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that that shows a lot more than
the video
that was released today.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say that that video shows
Keith Scott
backing up and that he had his
hands down

30:02.868 --> 30:04.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at his side. They said that
there was some
sort of object in his left hand,
but they're

30:04.736 --> 30:06.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not sure what that object was.
They are saying
that he was right-handed, and
that they are

30:06.571 --> 30:08.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not -- and that that would be
the hand that
he -- so, in other words, he
would be holding

30:08.140 --> 30:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an object in the hand that he
wouldn't have
usually been using primarily.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the family is not at all
saying specifically
to me that he didn't have a gun
in his hand.

30:11.810 --> 30:12.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are saying that no one has
seen a gun
on him and that they didn't
believe that he

30:12.210 --> 30:14.012 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
owned a gun.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, I have been talking to
the attorneys
now for two days, and they're
not telling

30:15.847 --> 30:16.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me definitely he definitely
didn't have a
gun, the video shows that he
didn't have a

30:16.782 --> 30:18.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gun. They're definitely not
saying that

30:18.483 --> 30:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Yamiche,
reaction in the community to
this? What are

30:19.317 --> 30:21.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they saying? What are people
saying?

30:21.153 --> 30:22.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: People are
saying that this
video illustrates that the
police really need

30:22.921 --> 30:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to release the videos that they
have, the
dash cam video and the body cam
video, need

30:23.989 --> 30:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to give us more information
about what happened.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people I have talked to so
far say that
the fact they're screaming, you
know, gun

30:27.526 --> 30:29.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they're saying put your
hands up, and
the wife is screaming he doesn't
have a gun

30:29.327 --> 30:31.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and trying to explain to them
that he has
a traumatic brain injury, that
he had just

30:31.229 --> 30:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken his medication, that
indicates to people
that I have talked to that the
police really

30:32.831 --> 30:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were looking at this and looking
at Keith
Scott as someone who was violent
from the

30:34.599 --> 30:36.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning, and they were not
really taking
into consideration the fact that
this might

30:36.535 --> 30:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have someone who was disabled,
someone whose
wife was standing there really
trying to explain

30:37.102 --> 30:38.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to them the situation.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So people are very angry at
seeing this video.
But I should say that people
also say this

30:40.739 --> 30:41.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't prove that he didn't
point a gun at
police. So they really want all
the other

30:41.440 --> 30:42.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
videos to be released as well.

30:42.908 --> 30:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yamiche Alcindor,
reporting
in Charlotte, we thank you.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Thanks.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: A
Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer
accused of

30:46.712 --> 30:48.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fatally shooting an unarmed
black man turned
herself in early today.

30:48.513 --> 30:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Betty Shelby is charged with
first-degree
manslaughter. She was released
after posting

30:49.748 --> 30:51.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a $50,000 bond. Her first court
appearance
is next week.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Donald Trump got a
boost today
ahead of the first presidential
debate on

30:53.285 --> 30:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Monday night. In a reversal,
former rival
Texas Senator Ted Cruz announced
that he will

30:55.253 --> 30:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote for Trump after all.
Writing on Facebook,
Cruz said: "I promised to
support the Republican

30:56.121 --> 30:57.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nominee. And I intend to keep my
word."

30:57.923 --> 30:59.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's
camp called for
increased scrutiny of Trump at
the debate.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A spokeswoman said -- quote --
"His level

A federal appeals court has
struck down Ohio's
process for purging voters from
the rolls

31:03.462 --> 31:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they haven't voted in at
least two years.
The court ruled today that the
process removes

31:05.430 --> 31:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who are in fact still
eligible to vote.
The state's Republican elections
chief defended

31:06.832 --> 31:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the process, saying that Ohio
has used it
for more than 20 years.

Bombs rained down on Syria's
largest city
today in the fiercest aerial
onslaught there

31:10.435 --> 31:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yet. The heavy air attacks on
Aleppo came
as the Syrian government's
military launched

31:12.370 --> 31:13.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new offensive to retake the
city with backing
from Russia. Rescuers worked to
dig out victims

31:13.672 --> 31:15.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
buried beneath the rubble, but
they came under
fire themselves.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IBRAHIM AL-HAJ, Syria (through
translator):
We weren't able to help them
quickly because

31:17.242 --> 31:18.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the shelling that we were
subjected to
as we were pulling them from
under the debris

31:18.977 --> 31:20.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all night. I have never in my
life seen such
a bombardment. It is very, very
intense.

31:20.846 --> 31:22.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The assault on
Aleppo appeared
to shred any remaining hope of
reviving last

31:22.681 --> 31:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week's cease-fire. Still, U.S.
Secretary of
State John Kerry says that he
and his Russian

31:24.149 --> 31:26.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
counterpart made -- quote -- "a
little bit
of progress" in talks today.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a veto
showdown now
looms over an act of Congress
permitting families

31:27.819 --> 31:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi
Arabia, the home
of most of the hijackers.
President Obama

31:29.688 --> 31:31.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rejected the bill today, saying
that it could
boomerang against U.S. troops
and diplomats

31:31.356 --> 31:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abroad. Even so, the House and
Senate may
have the votes to override the
veto.

31:33.158 --> 31:34.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
slumped after a
new drop in oil prices. The Dow
Jones industrial

31:34.926 --> 31:36.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost 131 points to close
at 18261.
The Nasdaq fell 33, and the S&amp;P
500 slid 12.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
gained about
1 percent.

31:37.996 --> 31:39.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how President
Hillary Clinton would govern on
day one; inside

31:39.865 --> 31:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last meeting of Colombia's
largest rebel
group ahead of a deal to end 50
years of war;

31:41.366 --> 31:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks'
take on the
week's news; and much more.

31:43.168 --> 31:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, we're taking a close
look at how
the presidential candidates
might actually

31:43.468 --> 31:45.237 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
govern.

31:45.270 --> 31:47.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, the focus was on
what Donald Trump's
early days in office could look
like.

31:47.205 --> 31:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we turn to Hillary
Clinton and what
her campaign statements tell us
about a Clinton-led

31:47.606 --> 31:48.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

31:48.306 --> 31:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang takes it from there.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hillary Clinton's
opponents have
said that her presidency will be
extension

31:51.877 --> 31:53.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Obama agenda. But what
would the early
days of a Hillary Clinton White
House look

31:53.245 --> 31:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like? What might she propose and
what could
she actually get done?

31:55.147 --> 31:56.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For this, we turn to my
colleague Lisa Desjardins.
And Amie Parnes, who's in New
York. She's

31:56.681 --> 31:57.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the co-author of "HRC" and
senior White House
correspondent for The Hill.

31:57.215 --> 31:57.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

31:57.883 --> 31:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Amie, let me start with you.

31:59.684 --> 32:00.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You literally wrote the book on
Hillary Clinton.
What do you think her priorities
will be in

32:00.519 --> 32:02.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the first days in the White
House?

32:02.320 --> 32:04.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIE PARNES, The Hill: Well,
she's mentioned
as much on the campaign trail
repeatedly.

32:04.356 --> 32:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said that she wants to push
a major infrastructure
bill to fix roads and bridges
and highways

32:06.191 --> 32:07.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across the country. She also
wants to do a
whole immigration overhaul. And
that's something

32:07.325 --> 32:08.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that she says is at the top, the
very top
of her list.

32:08.994 --> 32:10.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also wants to get done
campaign finance
reform, and I think, also, she's
going to

32:10.896 --> 32:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to deal with the Supreme
Court and whether
or not she picks up Obama's
appointee and

32:12.731 --> 32:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
takes that forward. And that is
going to be
interesting to see in this
political climate.

32:14.566 --> 32:16.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Amie, based on
your reporting
on Hillary Clinton, based on her
time in the

32:16.368 --> 32:17.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate, do you think she's going
to take a
bipartisan approach, try to be
more bipartisan

32:17.068 --> 32:17.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than we have seen in the past?

32:17.903 --> 32:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMIE PARNES: I definitely think
so.

32:19.704 --> 32:21.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you talk to people who have
worked with
both Clintons, they're very much
into working

32:21.540 --> 32:23.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across the aisle, to extending
an arm. I have
spoken to Trent Lott about this.
When he was

32:23.408 --> 32:25.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
majority leader, he worked with
Majority Leader
Daschle and with Bill Clinton.
He feels very

32:25.210 --> 32:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confident, he has said in the
past, that Secretary
Clinton will work in the same
way.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has a pretty good track
record of working
across the aisle with
Republicans. She worked

32:28.947 --> 32:30.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with Tom DeLay and other
Republicans, so I
think this is very much her
approach. I think

32:30.715 --> 32:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's very much a centrist and I
think this
is what she's really looking to
do when she

32:31.216 --> 32:32.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
takes the office.

32:32.951 --> 32:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa, one of the many
things you
watch here at the "NewsHour" is
the other

32:33.618 --> 32:35.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
end of Pennsylvania Avenue.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Is that outreach or
bipartisanship going to
be replied to or answered, do
you think?

32:36.254 --> 32:38.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It remains to
be seen.

32:38.089 --> 32:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her corner, Hillary Clinton
has two big
factors in Congress. She has a
growing women's

32:39.925 --> 32:41.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caucus that she's worked with
for a long time,
right now, 20 female senators.
It could be

32:41.326 --> 32:43.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
19 or 20, depending on what
happens this election,
very likely 20.

32:43.161 --> 32:44.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she also has something even
better. She
has a commanding general coming
into his own,

32:44.930 --> 32:46.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chuck Schumer. And notice, in
the past few
years, year-and-a-half, we
haven't seen him

32:46.665 --> 32:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on our air very much. That's
because he's
becoming more bipartisan
himself. He's been

32:48.533 --> 32:50.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reaching across the aisle in
preparation,
I think, for becoming the new
Democratic leader.

32:50.268 --> 32:52.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he's trying to build that
groundwork for
her. She has got that. She also,
however,

32:52.270 --> 32:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John, has some conservative
Democratic senators
who are not going to agree with
her on everything.

32:54.172 --> 32:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And talk more about
the women senators.
It's a very tight group, as you
know, and

32:55.473 --> 32:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
includes Republicans. Could that
help her
reach across the aisle?

32:56.408 --> 32:58.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I'm sure she's
hoping so.

32:58.210 --> 33:00.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is an interesting group,
because they eat
dinner together, they support
each other,

33:00.078 --> 33:01.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they want to grow their ranks
across the aisle.
But some of them are in very
risky Senate

33:01.947 --> 33:03.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seats and they can only go so
far. If Hillary
Clinton is perceived as
unpopular as she becomes

33:03.815 --> 33:05.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, some of these female
senators are
not going to take a big risk for
her. They're

33:05.317 --> 33:07.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to support maybe tax
cuts -- or
tax increases for the wealthy.

33:07.085 --> 33:08.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may support some things
that are more
across-the-board popular, like a
change in

33:08.987 --> 33:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
child care or perhaps a smaller
infrastructure
plan than the one Hillary
Clinton is proposing

33:09.254 --> 33:10.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

33:11.022 --> 33:12.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amie, you mentioned
the Supreme
Court vacancy. That could be an
issue that

33:12.858 --> 33:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's got to deal with starting
essentially
on day one. What do you think
that will tell

33:14.759 --> 33:16.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us about the rest of her --
about her approach
to Congress, about her attitude
toward Congress?

33:16.595 --> 33:17.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIE PARNES: It will tell us a
lot, and she's
going to have quite a little
debacle, because

33:17.963 --> 33:19.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she's going to face some stress
and some pressure
from the left.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to want her to not
go with someone
like Merrick Garland and pick
someone who

33:21.700 --> 33:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a little more of their liking
and of their
ilk. And then she's going to
face -- it basically

33:23.568 --> 33:24.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shows what she's going to do
with Republicans,
if she kind of, you know, walks
toward them

33:24.736 --> 33:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a little bit and offers someone
who's more
centrist.

33:26.571 --> 33:26.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's very much -- you
can kind of
read the tea leaves there and
see how she's

33:27.005 --> 33:28.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to govern.

33:28.874 --> 33:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Lisa, do you
think the leaders
on the Hill, the Republican
leaders on the

33:30.041 --> 33:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hill, are going to take that as
an indication
as well?

33:31.843 --> 33:32.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Absolutely. It
will be one
of the first big signs of how
she's going

33:32.477 --> 33:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to work with them or not.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's even more important
than just sort
of predicting what the next few
years are

33:35.981 --> 33:37.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be. That Supreme Court
choice may
determine what she can do on
immigration,

33:37.749 --> 33:39.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just any comprehensive
reform that may
or may not go through Congress,
but can she

33:39.251 --> 33:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issue executive orders, can she
keep President
Obama's executive orders?

33:40.418 --> 33:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That Supreme Court choice will
determine all
of that.

33:42.187 --> 33:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amie, are there
things that she
might try to do by executive
action, rather

33:42.888 --> 33:43.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than going to Congress first?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMIE PARNES: I think there are
quite a few.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think she's going to try to
take Obama's
executive actions a little
further on immigration,

33:47.559 --> 33:49.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think maybe on climate. She
has basically
tiptoed and hinted as much about
this. And

33:49.361 --> 33:50.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's been asked about this. I
think a lot
of Republicans kind of feel
threatened that

33:50.495 --> 33:52.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she's already talking about
taking executive
action.

33:52.297 --> 33:53.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think her first step would be
to work with
Congress, and I think that's her
preference,

33:53.765 --> 33:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so I don't think she's going to
move right
away into executive action.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Lisa, what's her
relations
with, or what do you think the
relations will

33:57.302 --> 33:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be between the Republican
majority leader,
Mitch McConnell, and the
Republican leader

33:59.170 --> 34:00.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- we don't know if he will be
majority or
minority -- and the House
speaker, who likely

34:00.038 --> 34:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will remain House speaker, Paul
Ryan?

34:00.605 --> 34:02.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both of those men have their own
very complex
dynamics within their caucuses
or conferences.

34:04.009 --> 34:05.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that Hillary Clinton has
worked with
Mitch McConnell in the past.

34:05.911 --> 34:07.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We understand it's a
relationship of respect,
not a particularly warm
relationship necessarily,

34:07.746 --> 34:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vs. Mitch McConnell who did work
perhaps best
of all with Joe Biden. That's
something she

34:08.914 --> 34:10.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will have to work on, but there
is a potential
there.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Ryan, I think, he is
someone who has
such difficult dynamics in his
own conference.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has the far right, who
sometimes says they
will just jump ship on him. He's
got moderates.

34:14.386 --> 34:14.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are things that the White
House under
Hillary Clinton is going to have
to be very

34:14.819 --> 34:16.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tactical about.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are strategists. They're
going to try
to use that to their advantage,
but it's difficult

34:18.556 --> 34:20.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for them, because sometimes Paul
Ryan cannot
make the decisions himself for
his conference.

34:20.458 --> 34:21.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amie, we have less
than 30 seconds
left, but how do you think a
President Hillary

34:21.593 --> 34:23.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton would make use of a
President Bill
Clinton?

34:23.528 --> 34:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIE PARNES: I think that's a
really interesting
question, and a lot of us want
to know that.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She talked about making him
maybe an economic
adviser, and got a little bit of
pushback

34:27.098 --> 34:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for that. But I think she is
definitely going
to put him to use. He is not
going to have

34:28.967 --> 34:29.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the traditional spouse role. She
will definitely,
obviously, send him to Capitol
Hill, I would

34:29.901 --> 34:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think, to work with people that
he knows.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she will probably host --
she and he maybe
will host meetings at the White
House for

34:33.538 --> 34:33.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both Democrats and Republicans.
And I'm sure
that's something that they want
to start right

34:33.838 --> 34:35.140 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

34:35.173 --> 34:35.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amie Parnes, Lisa
Desjardins, thank
you very much.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMIE PARNES: Thank you.

34:37.642 --> 34:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This coming
Monday, in Cartagena,
Colombia, a peace deal will be
signed that

34:39.477 --> 34:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aims to end more than 50 years
of war. The
accord also will mark the end of
the insurgency

34:40.879 --> 34:41.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the revolutionary armed
forces of Colombia,
known as the FARC.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has more.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All this week,
the guerrilla
group has been meeting at a
desolate location

34:45.216 --> 34:45.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Southern Colombia. Today,
unanimously,
the FARC voted to approve the
deal and form

34:45.784 --> 34:47.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a new political party.

34:47.686 --> 34:48.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the signing this coming
Monday, the
accord must survive one more
hurdle, a nationwide

34:48.386 --> 34:50.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
popular referendum next weekend.

34:50.221 --> 34:52.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Nadja
Drost has been
at this meeting all week, and
joins me now.

34:52.057 --> 34:53.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nadja, we usually don't talk
about political
conventions in other countries.
And the images

34:53.925 --> 34:55.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I have seen from here have
sound stages,
fog machines. It seems almost
like a musical

34:55.060 --> 34:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
festival. Give us a sense of
what it was like
there.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Well, to give you a
sense of
where we are, we are in the
middle of the

34:58.563 --> 34:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colombian plains, essentially
the middle of
nowhere, and we're surrounded by
miles and

34:59.097 --> 35:00.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
miles of shrubland.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It might strike one as a strange
place to
hold an enormous conference, but
this is a

35:02.367 --> 35:04.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FARC stronghold and it has
significant historical
meaning for the rebel group.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The conference that the FARC has
been holding
here this week is historic. It
is their final

35:06.104 --> 35:07.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conference as an armed group.
Here, they have
made the decision to terminate
their armed

35:07.872 --> 35:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
existence and they have been
plotting their
strategy to transform to a
political party.

35:09.574 --> 35:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you mentioned, there are
sound stages,
concerts. There are also
guerrilla camps.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're really going all out. It
looks like
the FARC are using this as an
opportunity

35:13.211 --> 35:14.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to introduce a new face to the
Colombian and
international public. With over
300 journalists

35:14.946 --> 35:16.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here camped out in the middle of
nowhere,
it's a chance for the FARC to
change the image

35:16.748 --> 35:17.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them as a narco-terrorist
group to a group
of rebels who very much want
peace and want

35:17.849 --> 35:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to transform themselves to
become political
actors.

35:19.584 --> 35:19.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
what's the
next step here? How do they move
forward to

35:19.884 --> 35:21.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
disarm?

35:21.786 --> 35:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: If the peace
accords do receive
approval from the Colombian
public, then FARC

35:23.588 --> 35:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troops, thousands of them, will
start mobilizing
themselves into large areas that
are being

35:25.323 --> 35:26.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called zones of concentration,
where they
will stay put for six months as
they start

35:26.124 --> 35:27.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a gradual process of
disarmament.

35:27.892 --> 35:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But FARC leaders here this week
said that
they need assurance that an
amnesty law will

35:29.928 --> 35:31.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be passed before their troops
can move anywhere.
They are demanding that they
have legal protections

35:31.463 --> 35:33.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to ensure their troops are not
going to get
arrested as they move on that.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What are the
indications
in how that referendum vote will
go?

35:34.933 --> 35:36.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: It is leaning more
towards the
side of accepting the peace
deal. However,

35:36.668 --> 35:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a very strong campaign,
being led
mostly by former President
Alvaro Uribe, in

35:37.335 --> 35:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rejection of the peace deal.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, both sides of the
negotiation, both
the FARC and the government,
have made very

35:41.039 --> 35:42.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear that, if the no side wins,
if the public
rejects this peace deal, there
is no way that

35:42.040 --> 35:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are going back to the
negotiating table.

35:44.009 --> 35:45.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the FARC head
negotiators, Carlos Antonio
Lozada, told reporters that
there is not even

35:45.810 --> 35:47.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the remotest possibility. And on
the government
side, it's expected that in the
case that

35:47.645 --> 35:48.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this referendum fails the peace
process, then
we will likely not see another
negotiation

35:48.213 --> 35:50.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for at least 10 years.

35:50.048 --> 35:51.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So both the FARC and the
government are sending
a very strong message to the
public that this

35:51.316 --> 35:53.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is Colombia's best, if not
possibly last chance
for peace.

35:53.118 --> 35:53.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Nadja, you have
covered the FARC for a long
time. How did

35:53.685 --> 35:55.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we get to this point?

35:55.453 --> 35:56.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: There have been
many attempts
in the past decades to end this
conflict,

35:56.588 --> 35:58.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both through negotiation or
through military
means.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, both sides have
become very tired
of war. Colombia has lived now
in 52 years

36:00.425 --> 36:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of war. The FARC has suffered
year after year
of military blows. Their ranks
have been shrinking.

36:02.093 --> 36:02.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And despite very strong military
campaigns,
the Colombian government has not
defeated

36:02.527 --> 36:04.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them entirely.

36:04.429 --> 36:05.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that it became clear
to both sides
that this war was going to be
intractable

36:05.130 --> 36:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unless a negotiation took place.

36:07.132 --> 36:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
special correspondent
Nadja Drost joining us from
Colombia tonight,

36:07.565 --> 36:08.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

36:08.266 --> 36:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Thank you so much.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
analysis of Shields
and Brooks. That's syndicated
columnist Mark

36:11.269 --> 36:11.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shields and New York Times
columnist David
Brooks.

36:11.803 --> 36:12.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we turn to
the lead story
tonight and for the last few
nights, David,

36:15.940 --> 36:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two more shootings in Tulsa and
Charlotte,
North Carolina, by police of
black men. We're

36:17.842 --> 36:19.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still getting the information.
We know the
Tulsa policewoman was charged
with manslaughter.

36:19.210 --> 36:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are we to make of this, the
fact that
these keep happening?

36:20.979 --> 36:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, first of
all, the videos
are just harrowing and have an
effect on,

36:22.147 --> 36:23.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, all of us and an effect
on the national
mood.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just this is a man losing
his life. This
is a wife losing her husband.
These are cops

36:25.850 --> 36:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the middle. And you can feel
the pressure
building on them as they don't
know -- quite

36:27.118 --> 36:28.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know what to do. Beyond that, we
don't really
know that much.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think these things -- these
particular
situations are always going to
happen. And

36:30.655 --> 36:32.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it seems to me there are two
issues here,
one, getting justice in the
individual case

36:32.590 --> 36:34.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or these individual cases and
all the individual
cases, and then, second, which
is to me more

36:34.492 --> 36:36.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serious and the more political
subject, is,
we do know there is tremendous
racial disparities

36:36.294 --> 36:38.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in searches, in arrests, in all
sorts of police
activities, maybe not in police
killings.

36:38.163 --> 36:39.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Harvard Research shows there is
not much racial
disparity there, but just about
in every other

36:39.931 --> 36:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police activity, there are these
huge racial
disparities. And when we see the
protests,

36:41.332 --> 36:43.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least the legitimate parts of
the protests,
that's the problem.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so some -- I think it's
useful to separate
these individual cases -- and we
don't know

36:44.936 --> 36:46.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what happened here yet -- from
the larger
problem, which is indisputable.
And finding

36:46.337 --> 36:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a solution to that larger
problem is really
the political issue.

36:46.905 --> 36:48.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

36:48.740 --> 36:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And can we focus on the real
problem, Mark,
when we have these -- when
feelings run high,

36:49.541 --> 36:51.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
emotions run high,
understandably?

36:51.342 --> 36:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I'm not sure.
I don't think
really we have so far,
certainly. I mean,

36:53.144 --> 36:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's -- I agree with David.
This is so
incredible -- it's wrenching and
it's sobering.

36:55.113 --> 36:56.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my own perspective on it has
changed since
Senator Tim Scott, the
African-American Republican

36:56.915 --> 36:58.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from South Carolina, took to the
Senate floor,
a card-carrying conservative, an
authentic

36:58.750 --> 37:00.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative man, ran as such,
got elected
and reelected as such, and said
-- spoke about

37:00.518 --> 37:02.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his own experience of being
stopped seven
times by police officers for the
principal

37:02.454 --> 37:03.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offense of, as he put it,
driving a new car
in the wrong neighborhood, or
even being stopped

37:03.621 --> 37:05.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Capitol Police and demanded
to show his
I.D.

37:05.423 --> 37:06.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It does give you an idea that
this is a real
problem understanding fully the
pressures

37:06.791 --> 37:08.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that David talked about and the
risks that
police officers do take.

37:08.593 --> 37:09.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I guess, when I look at
this, Judy, most
of, I mean, I -- I just think
about where

37:09.727 --> 37:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are as a country. And I'm not
sure at this
moment.

37:11.296 --> 37:11.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that's
pretty -- I don't
know what one says to that.

37:11.796 --> 37:13.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

37:13.598 --> 37:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think, you know, as we
go around
the country -- I was in
Nashville last night.

37:15.433 --> 37:17.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I met with some cops. I was in
Chicago last
week. And you find that a couple
things happen.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You find a lot of police forces
that are actually
doing better, I think, at
community policing,

37:18.937 --> 37:20.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting integrated with the
communities. San
Antonio, Texas, does a fine job.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then -- but then, in say,
the Chicago
case, there does seem to be some
evidence

37:22.540 --> 37:23.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a Ferguson effect, of the
cops being -- not
wanting to be on those videos,
and then pulling

37:23.908 --> 37:25.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back. And then you get the spike
in the murder
rate as a result.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so these are just super hard
issues. And,
on the one hand, there's clear
bias in the

37:27.445 --> 37:29.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way African-Americans are
treated. On the
other hand, I used to be a
police reporter.

37:29.247 --> 37:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When cops are out there, even if
they have
a gun in their hands, they do
not feel safe.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They feel like they're scared.

37:31.082 --> 37:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so these situations are
harrowing on all
sides.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Mark...

37:33.618 --> 37:34.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Tulsa does show, I
think, the
value of transparency, which we
are not seeing...

37:34.853 --> 37:36.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They put the
video out almost
immediately.

37:36.621 --> 37:38.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They put it out.
And it was
there in the case of Terence
Crutcher. And

37:38.189 --> 37:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the district attorney moved
quickly, and started
the process of resolution.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Carolina is -- the only
video we have
seen so far is that of the
widow. So, you

37:41.526 --> 37:43.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, there seems to be a lack
of -- or an
absence so far of transparency.

37:43.361 --> 37:44.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. It seems to
me the arguments
for not releasing the video seem
weak to me.

37:44.195 --> 37:44.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they really should release
it.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

37:46.498 --> 37:47.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we saw --
well, the family
is saying they have seen the
video, and they

37:47.799 --> 37:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not saying it's definitive,
but they want
it made public.

37:49.601 --> 37:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, David, Hillary Clinton put
out a statement.
I guest she tweeted that the
video should

37:50.768 --> 37:52.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be made public. She's going to
Charlotte this
weekend.

37:52.570 --> 37:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do we know about these
candidates at
a moment? This comes in the
middle of the

37:54.339 --> 37:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election. We're just a couple of
days away
from the debate. She's made some
sympathetic

37:56.241 --> 37:57.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comments. Donald Trump initially
made a sympathetic
comment about the victim in
Tulsa, but then,

37:57.942 --> 37:58.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess, last night made a
speech and talked
about we need to support the
police.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Right. Yes.

38:00.378 --> 38:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, just politically -- and this
is not what
I support, but what I think
realistically

38:02.247 --> 38:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the effect of this. I think
it helps Donald
Trump. I go back to 1968.
Richard Nixon was

38:04.149 --> 38:05.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helped by riots, if you want to
put it that
way. And Trump's campaign, from
the convention

38:05.984 --> 38:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speech on, has been really
predicated on the
argument that Americans are
under violent

38:07.519 --> 38:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threat, and that there is chaos
and that our
social order is being undone.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if there's not just the
shootings, but
the riots and the unrest, I
think, at least

38:11.156 --> 38:12.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a certain segment of the
population, that
will undergird and support his
argument, his

38:13.024 --> 38:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perceptions of what America is.
And I do think,
if there's any political effect
of this, that

38:14.159 --> 38:15.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
air of disorder will end up
helping him a
little.

38:15.059 --> 38:16.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You agree it
helps him?

38:16.928 --> 38:18.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think it's a
pretty established
principle in American politics
that looting

38:18.329 --> 38:19.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during a campaign helps the
self-identified
law and order candidate.

38:19.497 --> 38:20.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, not all the
protests
involve looting.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No. No -- but when
there is
looting, is my point.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that North Carolina is a
test case
in many respects. North Carolina
had the reputation

38:24.502 --> 38:26.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among Southern states for being
so progressive
under the governorships of --
particularly

38:26.404 --> 38:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Terry Sanford and Jim Hunt,
exceptional
national -- state leaders and
national leaders.

38:28.106 --> 38:29.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now, since -- in the last
year, since
the legislature and its bathroom
laws and

38:29.874 --> 38:31.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other effects, it's seen its own
reputation
tarnished. It's lost the
National Basketball

38:31.709 --> 38:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Association all-star game, a
matter of pride
in a basketball state, lost the
Atlantic Coast

38:33.244 --> 38:34.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conference tournament, which is
an identifying
icon of North Carolina life.

38:34.379 --> 38:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then some voting
rights controversies.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's lost -- the
voting rights
controversy.

38:37.582 --> 38:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's lost jobs and business
expansion. But
I think this -- Charlotte had
the self-identified

38:39.417 --> 38:41.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reputation of being the Atlanta,
the new Atlanta,
too busy to hate, and all the
rest of it.

38:41.219 --> 38:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think this is a blow. And
I don't know
how it plays out politically in
the national

38:41.586 --> 38:43.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

38:43.454 --> 38:45.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Secretary Clinton, it's
-- I'm not
sure what the rewards are of
going to Charlotte.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a risk if looting
followers, if there
isn't -- there's peace and
tranquility, and

38:46.524 --> 38:48.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she's seen as a unifying figure,
then that's
a positive.

38:48.359 --> 38:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David, we
are, we said,
just a couple of days, hours
away from the

38:48.793 --> 38:50.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first debate.

38:50.662 --> 38:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk about it. What do we
see, what
do we feel at this moment? There
are expectations.

38:52.030 --> 38:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How different are they for these
two candidates
and what are they?

38:52.530 --> 38:54.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, it's easy to overestimate
the effects
of the debates. We all have 1960
in our head.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, historically, they produce
maybe a one-
or two-point bump. And so George
Bush lost

38:57.869 --> 38:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of debates. A lot of
losers have won
a lot of debates, and it hasn't
shifted the

38:58.236 --> 39:00.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm very taken with an article
in "The Atlantic
Monthly" by James Fallows, where
says, when

39:01.172 --> 39:01.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you watch the debate, you should
turn off
the volume.

39:01.706 --> 39:02.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: What?

39:02.073 --> 39:03.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:03.942 --> 39:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But when you --
you might lose
us, but -- unless you just want
to look at

39:04.309 --> 39:04.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our faces.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:06.444 --> 39:07.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But when you think
of pivotal
debate moments, it's often a
visual image.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's certainly true with
Donald Trump.

39:09.247 --> 39:10.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What he does is, he has
exercised dominance
displays throughout the
Republican race. And

39:11.015 --> 39:12.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's really his physical nature
that helped
him sort of stare down Jeb Bush
and Marco

39:12.884 --> 39:14.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio. And a lot of the moments
are -- either
-- Al Gore sighing -- they're
not the words

39:14.652 --> 39:15.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that come out of their mouth.
They're the
visual posture they display that
people are

39:15.053 --> 39:16.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evaluating.

39:16.821 --> 39:17.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though they don't
matter as much,
I do think if Trump can seem
normal, he will

39:18.022 --> 39:19.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have normalized himself a little
maybe for
some voters.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that's --
you're saying
that's a lower expectation, a
lower bar.

39:21.459 --> 39:23.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: To seem normal, a
normal human
being, yes, not mentally ill,
yes.

39:23.261 --> 39:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: To return to my
sports metaphor,
I think, like a good basketball
coach, the

39:25.096 --> 39:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton people have worked the
referees this
week. They have made the point
that this is

39:26.965 --> 39:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- he's not to be held to some
minimal standard,
if he shows up and isn't profane
or obscene

39:28.866 --> 39:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or obnoxious, that this is a
debate for the
presidency, that we're measuring
the qualifications

39:29.300 --> 39:30.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of these people.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think, in that sense, I
think it has
worked. He has been put on
notice.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think she has a great
advantage going in,
not simply that she has debated
Barack Obama

39:34.505 --> 39:36.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five times, 90 minutes of Bernie
Sanders five
-- he never has -- he's never
gone one on

39:36.307 --> 39:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one with anybody. He's been able
to choose
his spots, and go in and speak
in wall posters

39:36.975 --> 39:38.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and bumper sticker slogans.

39:38.710 --> 39:39.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can't do that for 90
minutes. You can't
just talk make America great
again, build

39:39.944 --> 39:41.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a great wall. This is a -- it's
a test of
some substance.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She knows exactly all the
policy. She just
has to not try and prosecute the
case. She

39:43.481 --> 39:45.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has to try and win and tell
people why she
wants to be president, what
difference it's

39:45.283 --> 39:46.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to make in their lives,
two things,
not 23 things, what two
differences they're

39:46.150 --> 39:47.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to make, what two
improvements.

39:47.986 --> 39:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I really think that she has
an advantage.
He has a great advantage, Judy,
in the sense

39:49.721 --> 39:51.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he's enormously comfortable
with the
camera, he's enormously
comfortable on stage.

39:51.522 --> 39:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Charlie Munger, Warren
Buffett's great
sidekick, had a marvelous
statement. He said

39:53.358 --> 39:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never underestimate a man who
overestimates
himself. And that's -- Donald
Trump meets

39:54.025 --> 39:54.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that definition completely.

39:54.525 --> 39:56.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

39:56.294 --> 39:57.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see --
David, how
do you see expectations for
Hillary Clinton?

39:57.161 --> 39:58.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What standard does she have to
meet?

39:58.096 --> 39:59.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, the coolness
standard.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If she loses this election, it
will be for
one reason, because she loses
millennials.

40:01.766 --> 40:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're not going to vote
for Trump, but
they could vote for Gary Johnson
and somebody,

40:02.867 --> 40:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jill Stein. And so she has to
win over millennial.

40:04.669 --> 40:06.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this might be one of the few
times she
gets a lot of voters, at least
live or later

40:06.537 --> 40:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
online, to actually look at her.
And she has
to somehow resonate with the
people that Bernie

40:07.472 --> 40:08.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders and Barack Obama touched
so deeply.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does she do
that?

40:10.275 --> 40:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, some of it
may be college
-- some of it may be just the
vulnerable style.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a generation that's
grown up with
-- on social media. And they're
used to a

40:13.978 --> 40:15.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
style of social communication
that's more
casual. And she has not been
that. Her fund-raising

40:15.780 --> 40:17.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
style is like Cher and Barbra
Streisand. It's
not like -- it's really reaching
the young.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her policy style is very 1960s
Democrat, sort
of traditional.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And she has not, either
stylistically or substantively,
broken in with the current
issues, either

40:20.818 --> 40:21.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stylistically, or the concerns a
lot of young
people have about TPP and all
that kind of

40:21.653 --> 40:22.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stuff, about the openness of
trade.

40:22.887 --> 40:24.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, somehow, millennials has
to be her
central focus.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: She's running
against somebody
who's substance-free,
substance-free.

40:26.524 --> 40:27.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, so I think there is a
certain responsibility
on filling in the empty spaces,
which are

40:27.492 --> 40:29.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
large in the case of the
Republican nominee.

40:29.360 --> 40:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the two of
you are going
to be with us all night Monday
night starting

40:29.927 --> 40:30.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at 6:00 on "NewsHour."

40:30.628 --> 40:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: With the sound...

40:31.029 --> 40:31.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:31.396 --> 40:32.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:32.630 --> 40:34.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a little bit
of news here
at the end.

40:34.465 --> 40:36.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're told that NBC is reporting
both Hillary
Clinton and Donald Trump will
meet on Sunday

40:36.434 --> 40:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu,
so a little bit of foreign
policy in the middle

40:36.834 --> 40:37.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of all this.

40:37.702 --> 40:38.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can't wait to see you Monday
night.

40:38.403 --> 40:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

40:39.404 --> 40:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, both,
Mark and David.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been, as we have been
discussing, a
difficult week in Charlotte,
where police

40:42.573 --> 40:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and residents have clashed over
the shooting
death of a black man.

40:44.309 --> 40:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It comes in the same week that
an officer
was charged with manslaughter,
as we have

40:45.443 --> 40:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also been discussing, over that
shooting in
Tulsa.

40:47.245 --> 40:48.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even amid the protests and
tensions around
the country, an unusual theater
project is

40:48.112 --> 40:49.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to help a community move
forward.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown went to Ferguson,
Missouri,
to see the efforts to heal.

40:51.115 --> 40:51.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Were you aware of my
proclamation forbidding
the body to be buried?

40:51.983 --> 40:52.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: Yes, I knew it was a
crime.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: And you still dared to
break the law?

40:54.585 --> 40:56.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: I didn't know your laws
were more
powerful than divine laws,
Creon.

40:56.321 --> 40:58.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In ancient
Thebes, a clash
between the state's need for
security and

40:58.089 --> 40:59.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
order and the conscience of an
individual,
as a dead body lies on the
ground unburied.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we are in modern-day
Missouri, near Ferguson,
where two years ago, 18-year-old
Michael Brown's

41:01.759 --> 41:02.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
body lay in the street for four
hours after
he was shot and killed by a
police officer,

41:03.027 --> 41:04.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leading to violent clashes and
days of protest
and rioting.

41:04.829 --> 41:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A grand jury cleared officer
Darren Wilson
of criminal wrongdoing. But the
U.S. Justice

41:06.597 --> 41:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department found a pattern of
racial bias
in a predominantly white police
force in a

41:07.298 --> 41:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
predominately black city.

41:09.067 --> 41:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. LATRICIA ALLEN, Saint Louis
Metropolitan
Police Department: We talk about
the racial

41:10.601 --> 41:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disparity and all of that. It
was just a populace
waiting to boil over.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We drove through
the area where
the shooting and rioting
occurred with Lieutenant

41:14.439 --> 41:16.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Latricia Allen of the Saint
Louis Metropolitan
Police Department. She was
brought into Ferguson

41:16.240 --> 41:16.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back then to help calm things
down. Two years
later, she told me, she can make
arguments

41:16.674 --> 41:18.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for both sides.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. LATRICIA ALLEN: My life is
being a law
enforcement person and being a
mother, because

41:20.244 --> 41:20.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nobody really knows how I feel.
But what I
do know is that a mother
shouldn't have to

41:20.812 --> 41:22.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bury her child, period.

41:22.146 --> 41:23.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: She also says
this of Ferguson
and its aftermath:

41:23.915 --> 41:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. LATRICIA ALLEN: It's the big
F-word. It's
something we don't even really
talk about

41:25.683 --> 41:27.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anymore. It's something that
occurred, and
no one is proud of anything that
happened.

41:27.452 --> 41:27.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not like we're on --
wearing a badge
of honor, police officers one,
the citizens

41:28.019 --> 41:29.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
zero, nothing like that.

41:29.821 --> 41:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, "Antigone in
Ferguson,"
a theater production, has
brought Lieutenant

41:30.688 --> 41:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Allen back here again, this time
to sing.

41:32.457 --> 41:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Performances at the Wellspring
Church and
Normandy High School, where
Michael Brown

41:34.392 --> 41:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
graduated months before his
death, were presented
by a New York-based group called
Outside the

41:36.160 --> 41:36.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Wire, best known for its
so-called Theater
of War productions aimed at
helping military

41:36.794 --> 41:38.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
personnel deal with PTSD.

41:38.663 --> 41:39.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN DOERRIES, Co-Founder,
Outside the Wire:
It's about holding a space,
creating a space

41:39.664 --> 41:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where truth can be told and they
can be heard.

41:41.332 --> 41:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Founder Bryan
Doerries has
expanded the subjects he
addresses in his

41:43.301 --> 41:43.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work, but kept the original
format. Four prominent
actors present a staged reading
of an ancient

41:43.735 --> 41:45.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Greek tragedy.

41:45.103 --> 41:46.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: No woman will ever tell
me what to
do as long as I live.

41:46.971 --> 41:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A group of
experts or, here,
community members
representatives, including

41:48.639 --> 41:50.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a friend of Michael Brown, and
his former
teacher respond to the issues
raised.

41:50.475 --> 41:52.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUANE FOSTER, Drama Teacher: So
many people
look at the actual act of the
shooting. People

41:52.276 --> 41:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forget about the total blatant
disrespect
of that boy laying in the ground
because people

41:53.144 --> 41:54.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were trying to figure out what
to do.

41:54.979 --> 41:55.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, most
important, the audience
of community members, people
living amid the

41:55.980 --> 41:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem being tackled, engage in
a discussion.

41:57.715 --> 41:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We, all over the country,
have the
same problems here as
everywhere. We are at

41:58.249 --> 41:59.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
war with ourselves.

42:00.017 --> 42:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Where do we go as a society
when we know
what we do is wrong and we
continue to do

42:00.284 --> 42:01.252 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

42:01.285 --> 42:03.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sometimes, that
can get heated.

42:03.121 --> 42:04.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LT. LATRICIA ALLEN: That's the
big elephant
in the room, that we don't want
to talk about

42:04.989 --> 42:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the murder rate. We don't want
to talk about
black-on-black crime, because
that gives us

42:05.390 --> 42:07.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a black eye.

42:07.258 --> 42:08.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: There is no such thing as
black-on-black
crime; 94 percent of all crimes
committed

42:08.960 --> 42:10.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by black men are -- yes, are
perpetrated by
other black men, but, also -- if
you read

42:10.762 --> 42:11.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the statistics, it also says
that 84 percent
of murders that are committed on
white people

42:11.462 --> 42:13.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are committed by white people.

42:13.197 --> 42:13.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All of them
connecting dots
between the ancients and their
experience

42:13.564 --> 42:15.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and pain.

42:15.366 --> 42:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We collectively are the
Greek chorus,
and we speak for what democracy
is and for

42:16.000 --> 42:17.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what we want in our world.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Ferguson,
Doerries chose
Sophocles' tragedy "Antigone."

42:19.337 --> 42:20.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN DOERRIES: So, the central
question of
this play, "Antigone," is, what
happens when

42:20.638 --> 42:22.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everyone's right or feels
justified in what
they're doing?

42:22.373 --> 42:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We think about the fact that the
protester
in the street is right for
feeling rage and

42:24.575 --> 42:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
betrayal and anger, for being
devastated by
incident after incident after
incident that

42:30.481 --> 42:34.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we keep hearing about in the
news. And the
police force is right to be
afraid, because

42:34.385 --> 42:40.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we live in this incredibly
violent world,
in which one only has a few
milliseconds sometimes

42:40.925 --> 42:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make a decision that could
change the rest
of your life.

42:44.395 --> 42:47.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the play's about stepping
back from
all that and acknowledging that
we're all

42:47.999 --> 42:51.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
human and we're all fallible.

42:51.903 --> 42:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Doerries found a
local collaborator
in Phil Woodmore, a choral
teacher at a middle

42:58.075 --> 43:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school who also heads singing
groups for the
Saint Louis Police Department
and for his

43:03.147 --> 43:04.882 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
church.

43:04.916 --> 43:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL WOODMORE, Choral Teacher: I
feel that
the artistic value of what we're
doing breaks

43:08.052 --> 43:13.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down a lot of barriers. It
breaks down a lot
of walls, and it breaks down a
lot of things

43:13.391 --> 43:19.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that put people in boxes, where
they can be
open, they can express
themselves freely,

43:19.397 --> 43:23.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and they can give maybe
information or share
things, personal stories that
they might not

43:23.768 --> 43:25.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have shared otherwise.

43:25.636 --> 43:32.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The star power
came from four
actors, Gloria Reuben, Reg E.
Cathey, Samira

43:32.443 --> 43:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wiley, and Glenn Davis, who'd
flown in from
various television and other
projects specially

43:37.882 --> 43:39.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for this one day of
performances.

43:39.417 --> 43:44.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REG E. CATHEY, Actor: Take her
away. She has
said enough. Bury her alive.

43:44.589 --> 43:49.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Cathey, known for
his work
on "House of Cards," is a
veteran performer

43:49.427 --> 43:59.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Theater of War. This
time, he played
Creon, the king and uncle of
Antigone, who,

43:59.403 --> 44:02.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in trying to preserve the state,
is also tearing
it apart.

44:02.507 --> 44:08.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REG E. CATHEY: The family
killing each other
struck me really deeply, I guess
because it's

44:08.279 --> 44:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only my sister and I. I have
lost both my
parents.

44:12.116 --> 44:20.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what we're doing in
America. America,
if we're one family, if we truly
are e pluribus

44:20.691 --> 44:25.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unum, we're killing each other
in a vile way.

44:25.096 --> 44:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMIRA WILEY, Actress: These
people are doing
wrong in the eyes of the gods.

44:29.000 --> 44:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Samira Wiley is a
newcomer
to this type of performance. She
played Antigone,

44:34.238 --> 44:38.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and said her current work on
"Orange Is the
New Black" has a deep connection
to events

44:38.709 --> 44:41.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Ferguson after Michael
Brown's death.

44:41.279 --> 44:45.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMIRA WILEY: You are standing
in front of
people. You are looking at
people who were

44:45.416 --> 44:52.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this young man's class,
people who were
his educators. And what we do,
at the end

44:52.390 --> 44:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the day, is fake. It's --
we're acting.

44:57.094 --> 45:05.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we can elicit real,
emotional, human feelings
from people. And one thing that
Bryan Doerries

45:05.336 --> 45:11.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tells -- or told me was that
it's not so much
about what we can give them, but
what they

45:11.309 --> 45:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can give us. And you can hear
that in theory,
but I really experienced that
today.

45:17.615 --> 45:27.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REG E. CATHEY: And that last
song, "I'm Covered,"
which has multiple meanings of,
I'm covered

45:27.892 --> 45:32.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the blood of the lamb, which,
of course,
is Jesus. But, sometimes, it
sounded like

45:32.563 --> 45:38.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were singing, I'm covered
in the blood
of the land, which strikes you a
whole different

45:38.402 --> 45:40.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

45:40.204 --> 45:44.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then you're thinking, oh, there
wasn't a dry
eye in the house, which is the
selfish part

45:44.175 --> 45:48.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of being an actor, that you love
it. We love
killing the people.

45:48.946 --> 45:50.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:50.781 --> 45:58.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REG E. CATHEY: But it's even
better when we
all get to take a journey
together. And that

45:58.255 --> 46:03.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happened this afternoon.

46:03.160 --> 46:10.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That song was
written by Phil
Woodmore and dedicated to Saint
Louis law

46:10.668 --> 46:18.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enforcement. Through art, a
chance to be heard

That song was written by Phil
Woodmore and
dedicated to Saint Louis law
enforcement,

46:21.679 --> 46:23.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through art, a chance to be
heard and perhaps
move forward.

From Ferguson, Missouri, I'm

for the "PBS NewsHour."

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular episodes.

46:30.855 --> 46:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular episodes.

47:08.392 --> 47:13.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, President Obama
honored Mel Brooks
with the National Medal of Arts.

47:13.230 --> 47:19.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we celebrate one of his
comedic cohorts,
legendary performer and writer
Carl Reiner,"

47:19.537 --> 47:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whose new book, "Carl Reiner:
Now You're Ninety-Four,"
will be out later this year.

47:24.408 --> 47:27.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARL REINER, Actor/Writer: I
wanted to be
an operatic tenor.

47:27.244 --> 47:32.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My father had these Red Seal
records of Enrico
Caruso. I lacked one thing --
two things,

47:32.917 --> 47:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually, pitch and timing.
Shall I sing it
for you?

47:36.487 --> 47:44.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know how the voice is
today, but we
will see. We will find out.

47:44.195 --> 47:48.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(SINGING)

47:48.499 --> 48:00.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARL REINER: Those people who
have a sense
of humor get through life more
comfortably

48:00.578 --> 48:02.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than those who don't.

48:02.379 --> 48:07.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My influences in comedy started
because my
parents loved comedy. My parents
always sought

48:07.551 --> 48:12.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out comedies. The Marx Brothers
were their
favorites and our favorites.
Couldn't wait

48:12.356 --> 48:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a new Marx Brothers movie.

48:14.191 --> 48:17.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was a straight actor. I didn't
think I would
ever be doing that. My brother
saw a thing

48:17.928 --> 48:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the paper that said free
acting classes,
WPA, 100th and Center Street,
New York.

48:23.300 --> 48:28.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I met Mrs. Whittington (ph), an
old English
woman, who said: "We're going to
all learn

48:28.873 --> 48:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something from Shakespeare.
We're going to
do a soliloquy from Shakespeare.
We're going

48:33.544 --> 48:38.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to recite Queen Gertrude's
speech on the death
of Ophelia."

48:38.282 --> 48:43.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to this day: "There is a
willow grows
aslant a brook, that shows his
hoar leaves

48:43.154 --> 48:49.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the glassy stream. There with
a clambering
to hang, an envious sliver
broke, when down

48:49.760 --> 48:54.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her weedy trophies and herself
fell in the
weeping brook, pulled the poor
wretch from

48:54.999 --> 48:58.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her melodious lay to muddy
death."

48:58.636 --> 49:04.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's pretty close to that,
anyway. Applause,
applause.

49:04.041 --> 49:09.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Max Liebman, who was doing a
show called "Your
Show of Shows," and he need a
straight man

49:09.380 --> 49:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Sid. Sid was maybe the best
comedian that
ever lived.

49:13.250 --> 49:18.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I auditioned, and I got the job.
There was
a young comic called Mel Brooks.
I didn't

49:18.789 --> 49:24.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know who he was, but he was
standing up and
delivering a monologue about a
Jewish pirate.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Delighted to be here on "The
Hollywood Palace."

49:26.797 --> 49:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEL BROOKS, Comedian: Delighted
to be alive,
never mind anything else.

49:29.333 --> 49:33.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARL REINER: And said to Mel,
here's a man
who was actually at the scene of
the crucifixion

49:33.737 --> 49:42.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2,000 years ago. He's not too --
and he said,
oh, boy. I said, you knew Jesus?
He says,

49:42.713 --> 49:47.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
thin lad, right? He wore
sandals, walked around
with 12 other guys? Yes, he
said, they always

49:48.018 --> 49:52.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came into the store. I had a
candy store.
They never bought anything, but
I gave them

49:52.890 --> 49:54.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
water. They were nice boys.

49:54.792 --> 49:59.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steve Allen, he said, fellows,
you got to
record this. He had a recording
studio, World

49:59.930 --> 50:03.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pacific Jazz. He said, go there,
wail, do
whatever you want with it.

50:03.767 --> 50:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For about two-and-a-half-hours,
Mel and I
ad-libbed. I cut it down to 47
minutes, and

50:09.573 --> 50:16.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 2000-Year-Old Man was born.
We still weren't
sure that it was for everybody,
and that only

50:16.347 --> 50:18.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jews would like it.

50:18.182 --> 50:22.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cary Grant popped by. And I
said, oh, I have
a record I think you're going to
like. And

50:22.286 --> 50:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I gave him one of the records.
He came back
the following day, and he says,
could I have

50:26.790 --> 50:31.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a dozen? He says, I'm going to
England. He
came back and he said, she loved
it. I said,

50:31.762 --> 50:33.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who loved it? He said, the queen
mother.

50:33.430 --> 50:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Went to Buckingham Palace,
played the record.

50:36.100 --> 50:41.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I said to Mel, the biggest
(INAUDIBLE)
in the world loved our record
we're in.

50:41.272 --> 50:46.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I'm asked what's the best
time I have
had in my life in show business,
hands down,

50:46.577 --> 50:50.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
creating and producing "The Dick
Van Dyke
Show" and writing for it.

50:50.180 --> 50:55.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you have one good friend,
you're lucky.
And I have one good friend. I
call him my

50:55.819 --> 50:59.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
best friend. My life is fuller
because I have
had Mel in my life.

50:59.757 --> 51:03.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he doesn't come over, I don't
know what
to do with myself. He comes over
every night.

51:03.527 --> 51:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We love movies. And we said any
movie that
has three or four lines in it,
and we hear

51:08.966 --> 51:14.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those, we know we're in for a
good time. The
lines are, lock all the doors,
secure the

51:14.371 --> 51:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perimeter, and let nobody in and
out, and
get some rest.

51:21.078 --> 51:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He became an entity. And that
entity wrote
some of the best and most
memorable movies

51:26.016 --> 51:31.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all times, I mean, to this
day. Farting
is OK because he wrote a movie
called "Blazing

51:31.689 --> 51:33.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Saddles."

51:33.524 --> 51:39.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The best thing that ever
happened to me was
meeting a woman named Estelle
Lebost. She

51:39.063 --> 51:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raised three of the greatest
kids ever lived.
And she raised one great
husband, because

51:45.002 --> 51:48.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she was eight years older than
I, knew everything
about everything.

51:48.405 --> 51:55.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She informed me about life,
politics. Everything
that I am is because Estelle
Reiner, Estelle

51:55.646 --> 51:58.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lebost, made me who I am today.

51:58.949 --> 52:04.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sixty-five years with the right
woman, you
can't ask for anything more.

52:04.121 --> 52:11.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is Carl Reiner. That was my
Brief But
Spectacular take on this guy.

52:11.895 --> 52:15.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carl and Mel, we
love you both.

52:15.065 --> 52:20.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can watch additional
Brief But Spectacular
episodes on our Web site,

Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week,"

the candidates
do if they were president? And
what will Monday's

52:37.688 --> 52:43.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

the context,
which we will provide tonight on

Week" -- Judy.

52:44.294 --> 52:46.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
watching.

52:46.196 --> 52:51.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on "PBS NewsHour" Saturday:
gerrymandering.
Who should have the power to
draw congressional

52:51.669 --> 52:53.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
district lines?

52:53.470 --> 52:57.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, on Monday, we will be back
with live
coverage of the first general
election debate

52:57.608 --> 52:59.410 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

Bush, your

53:11.722 --> 53:13.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patronizing...

53:13.090 --> 53:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
