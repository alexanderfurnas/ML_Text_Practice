JUDY WOODRUFF: The collapse of
the Republicans' push on health
care raises serious questions

00:04.733 --> 00:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the road ahead for
reform, key among them, will
the Democrats come to the table?

00:11.733 --> 00:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To explore that and more,
we are joined now by Senator
Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

00:14.433 --> 00:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is the ranking member on
the Senate Budget Committee.

00:17.233 --> 00:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome back to the
"NewsHour," Senator Sanders.

00:19.766 --> 00:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what happened to your
Republican colleagues?

00:21.800 --> 00:22.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What went wrong?

00:22.800 --> 00:24.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:24.866 --> 00:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont:
Well, what went wrong, Judy, is
they brought forth a disastrous

00:26.933 --> 00:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care bill that had the
support of all of 12 percent
of the American people, that

00:33.966 --> 00:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was opposed by the American
Medical Association,
the American Hospital
Association, the AARP.

00:40.766 --> 00:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And virtually every national
health care organization
understood that, when
you throw 22 million

00:48.566 --> 00:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people off of health insurance,
when you cut Medicaid by $800
billion, when you raise premiums

00:55.633 --> 00:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for older workers, when you
defund Planned Parenthood, and
you make it almost impossible

01:01.733 --> 01:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for people with preexisting
conditions to get the health
care they need and can afford,

01:04.833 --> 01:06.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know what?

01:06.500 --> 01:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have got a bill
that's a stinker, it
shouldn't go anyplace.

01:08.466 --> 01:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it didn't go anyplace.

01:09.733 --> 01:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's a good thing
for the American people.

01:11.866 --> 01:16.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I thank the millions
of people who stood up
and fought back and said
that that legislation

01:17.933 --> 01:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is not what this
country is about.

01:20.033 --> 01:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when the
president -- he did criticize
today the Republicans, but he

01:23.033 --> 01:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
also blamed Democrats
and he said Democrats
are obstructionists.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're only about obstructing.

01:28.133 --> 01:30.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:30.233 --> 01:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if he
wants to blame me for helping
kill that bill, I accept that

01:33.433 --> 01:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
responsibility completely.

01:35.466 --> 01:38.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This bill was an
absolute disaster.

01:38.266 --> 01:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its goal was primarily to give
tax breaks to the rich and
to large corporations, rather

01:44.733 --> 01:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than to address the needs
of the American people.

01:46.866 --> 01:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the president wants
to blame me and anyone
else for preventing 22
million Americans losing

01:51.666 --> 01:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their health insurance,
I accept that criticism.

01:53.733 --> 01:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
we're hearing, Senator
- - our Lisa Desjardins
was reporting the plan

01:56.533 --> 02:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now is if the vote for a pure
repeal goes down, which it's
expected to, the next step

02:03.533 --> 02:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to go to committees, go
back to what is called regular
order, to work with Democrats.

02:06.900 --> 02:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Are you and others
Democrats prepared to
work with Republicans?

02:10.133 --> 02:11.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:11.133 --> 02:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Of course.

02:13.266 --> 02:16.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Why not -- look, nobody
has said, Judy, that the
Affordable Care Act is
anywhere near perfect.

02:16.166 --> 02:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It did add 20 million
more people to the
ranks of the insured.

02:20.433 --> 02:21.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's good.

02:21.566 --> 02:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Deductibles, however,
are too high.

02:23.633 --> 02:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Co-payments are too high.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Premiums are too high.

02:27.666 --> 02:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we pay by far the highest
in the world for prescription
drugs, getting ripped off

02:32.866 --> 02:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
every day by the
pharmaceutical industry.

02:34.933 --> 02:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if the Republicans want
to sit town and say how do we
improve the Affordable Care

02:40.866 --> 02:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Act, not destroy it, how
do we improve it, let's
go forward and do that.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have some very
specific ideas on that.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
let's talk about that,
because, realistically,
you know where many

02:49.300 --> 02:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Republicans are.

02:50.733 --> 02:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know where the Democrats,
you and others, are.

02:53.066 --> 02:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where's the middle ground here?

02:54.733 --> 02:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where do you see a
place for compromise?

02:56.100 --> 02:57.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS:
Well, I'll tell you.

02:59.433 --> 03:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I just mentioned, the cost
of prescription drugs in this
country is far, far higher than

03:02.566 --> 03:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in any other country.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You may recall that Donald Trump
as a candidate for president
talked about how he was going

03:08.933 --> 03:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take on the pharmaceutical
industry and it was going to
lower prescription drug costs.

03:13.066 --> 03:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, we have some
ideas to do that.

03:15.566 --> 03:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans may
have other ideas.

03:18.066 --> 03:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk about lowering
prescription drug costs,
saving the federal
government substantial

03:21.500 --> 03:23.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sums of money.

03:23.500 --> 03:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about having
Medicare negotiate prices with
the pharmaceutical industry.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's number one.

03:29.866 --> 03:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, there are areas of
this country right now where
there are no insurance companies

03:33.433 --> 03:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
offering the
Affordable Care Act.

03:35.866 --> 03:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let us provide a public option
in every county in America, so
if people don't like what the

03:42.866 --> 03:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
private insurance companies
are offering or there is no
offer, let them have at least

03:47.133 --> 03:49.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a public option.

03:49.466 --> 03:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number three, I believe that
the American people would
very much like to see lowering

03:53.833 --> 03:58.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the eligibility age of
Medicare from 65 to 55.

04:00.866 --> 04:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, lastly, in my view --
and I speak only for myself
-- the United States must join

04:06.200 --> 04:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rest of the industrialized
world, guarantee health care
to all people as a right.

04:12.233 --> 04:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is why I will be
introducing a Medicare-for-all
single-payer programs.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will not be passed, believe
me, in this session of Congress.

04:18.933 --> 04:20.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I know that.

04:20.966 --> 04:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have got to begin the
discussion as to why we spend
so much more per capita on

04:24.433 --> 04:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care than any other
nation, why we pay the highest
prices in the world, why we

04:28.600 --> 04:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do not guarantee health
care to all people, as every
other major country does.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
ask you about what is going
to happen in the meantime.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You mentioned
prescription drug prices.

04:36.733 --> 04:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You mentioned having a
public option in different
parts of the country.

04:43.900 --> 04:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we know it's the case
that, in many states,
there is no insurance
company that is providing

04:48.800 --> 04:50.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

04:50.766 --> 04:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republicans like
to say the market, the
exchanges are collapsing.

04:54.066 --> 04:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What can be done in
the short term, Senator
Sanders, to shore these up?

04:58.966 --> 05:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there a way to come up
with subsidies that both
parties can agree to?

05:02.700 --> 05:03.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:03.700 --> 05:04.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS: Oh, yes.

05:04.933 --> 05:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, Judy, I think --
it's not me talking.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is what the insurance
companies are saying.

05:08.900 --> 05:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they're saying is,
there's great instability
in the marketplace,
precisely because of tweets

05:15.133 --> 05:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like the one President -- the
president sent out today: Let's
see the Obamacare act destroyed.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that's not exactly a
strong sign of confidence going
out to the insurance companies.

05:23.933 --> 05:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what we have got to do
is, number one, we have to
enforce the individual mandate.

05:28.466 --> 05:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're losing a lot of money that
is not coming into the system.

05:31.433 --> 05:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, number two, we have
to deal with cost-sharing,
which is something we
have been doing many,

05:35.600 --> 05:37.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
many years.

05:37.633 --> 05:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you do that, I think
you will stabilize the
market for the short term.

05:39.866 --> 05:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But long term, longer term, we
have to improve the Affordable
Care Act, and longer term than

05:46.833 --> 05:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have to join the rest
of the world and guarantee
health care to all people as

05:48.966 --> 05:50.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a right.

05:50.933 --> 05:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much more
money is the federal government
going to have to put into

05:56.133 --> 05:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health care in order
for this to work?

05:57.233 --> 05:58.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:58.666 --> 06:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Well,
that's a very good question.

06:00.766 --> 06:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure that there's
absolutely nobody in the world
who knows the answer to it.

06:04.600 --> 06:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All that I can say is that
we are spending far more per
capita than people in any other

06:11.533 --> 06:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, and our health care
outcomes are in many cases worse
in terms of life expectancy,

06:16.333 --> 06:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
infant mortality and so forth.

06:18.500 --> 06:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think the issue is
not necessarily -- we may
have to spend more money.

06:23.166 --> 06:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The issue is to trying to figure
out why we end up spending so
much more than other countries.

06:27.900 --> 06:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And one of the reasons, clearly,
high cost of prescription drugs.

06:31.400 --> 06:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second reason, we do
very, very badly in terms
of primary health care.

06:36.133 --> 06:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are millions of people,
even those who have insurance,
who can not get to a doctor

06:40.366 --> 06:41.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when they are sick.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They end up in the emergency
room, very expensive.

06:43.833 --> 06:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They end up in the hospital,
very, very expensive.

06:46.666 --> 06:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we greatly expanded primary
health care, lower the cost
of prescription drugs, we take

06:51.133 --> 06:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a giant step forward in lowering
health care costs in America.

06:53.900 --> 06:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, very quickly,
if you had to name one area
where you could see an early

06:58.533 --> 07:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement between Democrats
and Republicans on health
care, what would it be?

07:02.300 --> 07:03.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS:
Prescription drugs.

07:05.566 --> 07:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
we are listening to you,
Senator Bernie Sanders.

07:07.133 --> 07:08.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

07:08.133 --> 07:09.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.
