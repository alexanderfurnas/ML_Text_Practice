So, what are the Russians up to

For some answers, we turn to Pav

PAVEL BAEV, Peace Research Insti
little is actually known for fac

what the Russians are saying is,

11:53.313 --> 11:58.351
supplying -- were supplying smal
and personnel carriers and some

11:59.185 --> 12:00.186
and some technical personnel.

12:01.654 --> 12:08.294
This sort of military weapons do
any technical advisers and perso

12:09.762 --> 12:16.869
pretty elementary. So the feelin
the little increase in Russian m

12:18.071 --> 12:20.139
produced a lot of political spin
was deliberate.

12:32.151 --> 12:37.490
-- the viability of the Syrian r

12:38.958 --> 12:43.463
The Syrians have -- that is, the
absorbed pretty serious losses o

12:44.931 --> 12:50.103

not very good. They lost Idlib.

12:51.571 --> 12:53.640
Palmyra. They're under pressure

12:54.240 --> 12:54.807

They have got a demographic prob
not clear how long they can actu

up the fight. For the Russians,
of this regime is extremely impo

13:06.953 --> 13:09.622
a number of reasons, and I serio
they're going to let it go down.

13:11.090 --> 13:16.062
I infer from that that the kind
they're preparing to provide to

13:17.530 --> 13:22.135
will be military assistance, ass
will help keep the Syrian regime

13:23.002 --> 13:25.538

GWEN IFILL: Steven Simon, what d
get out of this?

14:29.635 --> 14:32.238
STEVEN SIMON: It gets a number o
of it.

14:33.706 --> 14:38.244
First of all, Putin's foreign po
in many respects. This is just a

14:39.712 --> 14:44.350
He's quite inclined to put a sti
Obama's eye, and this serves tha

14:45.818 --> 14:49.355
It puts down a trip wire to U.S.
action that might be directed ag

14:49.822 --> 14:50.656
regime.

14:52.125 --> 14:56.028
The U.S. can no longer be assure
they hit regime targets, they wo

14:57.497 --> 15:01.167
and that's an escalation that I
the administration would not fav

15:02.635 --> 15:07.073
also believe, as one seen senior
told me not that long ago, that,

15:08.541 --> 15:13.212
goes, the capital of Syria moves
to Raqqa, which is the Syrian ci

15:13.980 --> 15:15.581
has made its headquarters.

15:17.049 --> 15:21.554
They take that very seriously. A
Russia is still a maritime power

15:23.022 --> 15:26.492
to have a presence in the Easter
presumably. They have got intell

15:27.960 --> 15:31.731
and naval facilities in Syria. A
can put themselves in a position

15:33.099 --> 15:36.035
those investments and protect th
I assume that they would.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.839
GWEN IFILL: There has been some

15:53.820 --> 15:53.519
work?

15:54.987 --> 15:58.591
PAVEL BAEV: I think it's mostly
because for Russia, the main way

16:00.059 --> 16:05.565
is still from the sea. And the p
go through Iran and Iraq airspac

16:07.033 --> 16:11.404
So it's mostly exchange of signa
of political gesture as to what

16:12.872 --> 16:16.475
what is not, what we like, what
what we can do, what we cannot d

16:17.944 --> 16:21.180
on the Russian side, the capacit
really a difference in the battl

16:22.648 --> 16:26.485
Syria is very limited because mo
battalions are tied up in Ukrain

16:27.954 --> 16:33.092
There's very little they can rea
there, maybe a symbolic squadron

16:34.560 --> 16:37.363
to deliver a few strikes, which,
not make much of a difference, b

16:42.301 --> 16:43.836
symbolism which is involved ther

17:47.733 --> 17:51.837
of the regime with the nuclear i

17:53.306 --> 17:58.177
So I think, you know, this does
the Syrian regime in a stronger

17:59.645 --> 18:05.518
This isn't something that the Un
really, I think, has the leverag

18:06.986 --> 18:13.526
with effectively, really to coun
has two choices. And maybe this

18:14.393 --> 18:14.727
an exaggeration. It's a dichotom

18:16.195 --> 18:20.399
But, on the one hand, if you can
join them, so find a way to coop

18:21.867 --> 18:26.672
the Russians, pull them into an
coalition, coordinate airstrikes

18:28.140 --> 18:32.645
the Russian effort in that direc
alternative, really to try to bl

18:34.113 --> 18:39.251
move entirely, is going to be ve
in part because, as the other sp

18:40.720 --> 18:44.323
the Russians have plenty of othe
for getting this military equipm

18:45.024 --> 18:46.625
assistance into Syria.

18:48.094 --> 18:52.198
It's not something the U.S. can
a game of Whac-A-Mole with vario

18:53.065 --> 18:54.667
whose airspace the Russians need

18:55.935 --> 18:56.802
GWEN IFILL: Pavel Baev, what do
about those choices?

18:58.270 --> 19:01.807
PAVEL BAEV: I think the choices
very limited, because the situat

19:03.275 --> 19:08.881
is indeed very difficult, and it
to say that we want peace in Syr

19:10.082 --> 19:13.819
normalization, and we also want
Assad to go out.

19:15.287 --> 19:20.659
Whether the elimination of this
for a long time has been the mai

19:22.128 --> 19:26.866
only of the United States, but a
of many Arab states, whether it

19:28.334 --> 19:32.705
anywhere is very difficult to sa
with the rise of ISIS. And so Pu

19:34.173 --> 19:37.643
to play on this uncertainty, to
opportunity which is there for h

YASMEEN QURESHI: The requirement
Bill Haslam says, were simple by

GOV. BILL HASLAM: There really i
gap that has been created in thi

26:20.045 --> 26:22.614
And I think at the heart of that
in educational opportunities.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.018
And so for families that either
it or just don't think they can

26:27.486 --> 26:30.122
we had to do something to change
selfishly as a state, we had to

26:31.590 --> 26:34.526
say to employers out there, you'
for a trained work force and you

26:35.994 --> 26:37.996
skills training than they have h
we can provide that in Tennessee

26:39.465 --> 26:42.468
YASMEEN QURESHI: In fact, Haslam
country as a whole is lagging be

26:43.168 --> 26:43.802
it comes to education.

26:45.270 --> 26:50.075
GOV. BILL HASLAM: I think, as re
10 years ago, the United States

26:51.543 --> 26:54.947
in the world in the percentage o
with a degree beyond high school

26:56.415 --> 26:59.117
now we have slipped to 10th, 11t
Forever, one of the competitive

27:00.586 --> 27:05.691
we have had as a country is that
post-secondary education than an

Earlier this year, President Bar
unveiled his own proposal for a

27:23.575 --> 27:26.945
community college program. It's
part on the Tennessee approach,

27:28.413 --> 27:32.384
president's plan, the federal go
75 percent of the student's tuit

27:33.085 --> 27:33.085
state pays 25 percent.

27:34.553 --> 27:37.489
BARACK OBAMA, President of the U
Community colleges should be fre

27:38.957 --> 27:42.861
willing to work for it, because,
a quality education cannot be a

27:43.629 --> 27:46.231
that's reserved for a few.

28:03.615 --> 28:05.284
EMILY SHORT, Volunteer State Com
I think that in the state of Ten

28:06.752 --> 28:11.023
the inception of the Promise pro
we in higher education -- during

28:12.491 --> 28:17.095
in higher education, I think tha
been more encouraged by the stat

28:18.564 --> 28:21.266
governing board of Tennessee Boa
to be more innovative in what we

28:22.734 --> 28:25.804
YASMEEN QURESHI: But keeping stu
is another challenge. At Volunte

28:27.272 --> 28:30.309
just 16 percent of students grad
percent transfer to another scho

28:31.777 --> 28:34.646
EMILY SHORT: A lot of our studen
meaning that their parents never

28:36.114 --> 28:40.886
a college degree. And so they re
don't have a strong support netw

28:42.354 --> 28:46.158
them to go to college, because I
that sometimes they understand t

28:46.925 --> 28:47.593
and the benefit behind it.

28:49.061 --> 28:49.628
EDITH LESTER, Volunteer State Co
So, what I want you to do now is

28:51.096 --> 28:56.435
we looked at multiplication and

28:59.137 --> 29:02.007
YASMEEN QURESHI: That's why Vol
other colleges are giving studen

EDITH LESTER: Many of them are c
of high schools not as prepared

29:34.172 --> 29:39.645
them to be. If they can bridge t
they come in to college at the s

29:41.113 --> 29:44.950
as a student who doesn't have th

29:46.151 --> 29:49.755
those gaps, it's kind of like th
at a losing end.

29:51.223 --> 29:54.092
YASMEEN QURESHI: Still, not ever

they're making to new freshmen.

REP. STEVE COHEN (D), Tennessee:

excavators who slipped through t
narrower spaces to reach the fos

34:25.597 --> 34:26.298
Very interesting, very cool stuf

34:27.399 --> 34:26.932
MD-BOJAMIE SHREEVE, "National
Very cool.

34:27.799 --> 34:28.266
JEFFREY BROWN: Start with Jamie

34:29.334 --> 34:31.503
Set the scene for us. This was a
finding.

34:32.370 --> 34:32.904
JAMIE SHREEVE: Yes, pretty much.

34:34.372 --> 34:39.945
A couple of cavers were explorin

34:41.413 --> 34:45.750
it. It's very well known, and th
a little opening that's only eig

34:47.218 --> 34:50.588
wide in some places. One of them
down, took another step down, an

34:51.323 --> 34:52.390
it just kept going down.

34:53.858 --> 34:56.928
So they dropped into this cavern

34:58.396 --> 35:02.867
how long, and they found the flo
cave littered with bones, with h

35:04.336 --> 35:06.404
JEFFREY BROWN: And, Becca Peixot
where you come in. Is it true th

35:07.872 --> 35:11.142
brought in through a social medi
a call for small people who coul

35:11.710 --> 35:11.743
kind of work?

35:13.211 --> 35:14.646
BECCA PEIXOTTO, Excavation Team
was an ad put out on Facebook, o

35:15.914 --> 35:19.451
to find archaeologists, people w
as archaeologists...

35:20.919 --> 35:21.786
JEFFREY BROWN: That's mind-blowi
right, from Facebook to this kin

35:22.354 --> 35:22.454
But go ahead.

35:23.288 --> 35:23.321
BECCA PEIXOTTO: Exactly, yes.

35:24.789 --> 35:28.460
So, small archaeologists who had
skills in climbing and caving. A

35:29.928 --> 35:33.264
an unusual skill set, to have ex
and be comfortable working in a

35:34.299 --> 35:35.066
JEFFREY BROWN: And this is not y
area.

35:36.534 --> 35:38.536
BECCA PEIXOTTO: It's true. I am
historical archaeologist, so I w

35:40.005 --> 35:42.941
from the last 500 years, and not
are in the order of millions of

35:44.409 --> 35:46.478
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so describe
for -- the setting in the cave a

35:47.345 --> 35:48.813
chamber. What was it like to cli

35:50.281 --> 35:52.884
BECCA PEIXOTTO: Well, you drop d
a chute. You climb through a chu

35:54.352 --> 35:57.655
As Jamie said, it's about seven
wide at its narrowest bits, whic

35:59.124 --> 36:02.427
skinny. And it's a complicated c
there is a small landing zone, w

36:03.895 --> 36:07.665
off our shoes, and we entered th
actually barefoot, because there

36:09.134 --> 36:13.138
fossil material on the floor of
being barefoot, we were more con

36:14.606 --> 36:18.476
where we were stepping to help f
the fossils were on the ground.

36:19.744 --> 36:22.514
JEFFREY BROWN: And was it hard w
-- what was it like?

36:23.982 --> 36:27.952
BECCA PEIXOTTO: We were working
and paintbrushes, so toothpicks,

36:29.421 --> 36:34.259
And it's very tedious work, exci
but you're moving the soil away

36:35.727 --> 36:39.798
by grain in an effort to free th
from the matrix that they're enc

36:40.365 --> 36:40.632
damaging them.

36:42.100 --> 36:46.404
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Jamie Shreeve
we know so far about Homo naledi

36:47.739 --> 36:50.308
heard in that clip, humanlike fr
primitive on the inside?

36:51.009 --> 36:51.142
JAMIE SHREEVE: Right.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.713
We know this is a really bizarre
nothing -- nothing like it has b

36:57.182 --> 37:02.320
before in the fossil record. It
strange mix of characteristics t

37:02.887 --> 37:03.088
much like us.

37:04.556 --> 37:09.394
For instance, the foot is virtua
to a human foot, and yet the sho

37:10.862 --> 37:18.103
like an ape. Brain is a little p
So, it's a complicated equation

37:18.703 --> 37:19.070
by this fossil.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.739
JEFFREY BROWN: Researchers don't
the age of it, I gather.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.809
JAMIE SHREEVE: No, that's the bi
mark that's outstanding, because

37:26.277 --> 37:29.747
have an age, you can really star
the story of how this fits in wi

37:30.415 --> 37:30.381
of human evolution.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.686
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, when you sa
are humanlike, does that suggest

37:35.153 --> 37:34.752
upright?

37:36.221 --> 37:38.957
JAMIE SHREEVE: Oh, there is no d
this was an upright biped, and n

37:40.425 --> 37:45.864
upright biped, but one with -- h
and feet constructed for probabl

37:47.065 --> 37:49.901
striding gate like ours, so it w
walking upright.

37:51.369 --> 37:56.541
JEFFREY BROWN: The cave, I gathe
potentially to be, just by the s

37:57.809 --> 38:00.311
of bones there and other remnant
been a burial site?

38:01.713 --> 38:03.148
JAMIE SHREEVE: Well, the researc
like to use the word burial.

38:03.781 --> 38:03.448
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

38:04.883 --> 38:08.753
JAMIE SHREEVE: Because it has co
of ceremony and an afterlife.

38:10.221 --> 38:13.491
But it does seem to be that the
explanation for how these bones

38:14.959 --> 38:19.097
a remote place was that they put
other Homo naledi individuals, d

38:20.565 --> 38:26.638
disposed of. Now, whether they h
of an afterlife or whether they

38:27.505 --> 38:30.208
getting rid of these bodies, nob

38:31.676 --> 38:34.279
And, in fact, we really don't kn
the explanation, but that seems

38:34.812 --> 38:35.380
best so far.

38:36.848 --> 38:40.752
JEFFREY BROWN: You were in this
it was. What did it feel like to

38:42.220 --> 38:46.591
the astounding number of bones i
of, I gather, from just in one p

38:47.392 --> 38:47.592
this, in Africa, certainly?

38:48.393 --> 38:48.359
BECCA PEIXOTTO: Absolutely.

38:49.827 --> 38:54.899
We excavated an area that was le
meter square and about 15 centim

38:56.367 --> 39:00.471
and from that area, we got more
individual fossil specimens. And

39:01.940 --> 39:07.078
of that assemblage is really dra
it's really unusual in fossil si

39:08.546 --> 39:12.717
JEFFREY BROWN: You -- we were ta
the small skull, right? You held

39:13.518 --> 39:15.253
BECCA PEIXOTTO: I did, yes.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.422
JEFFREY BROWN: What was that lik

39:18.256 --> 39:17.488
BECCA PEIXOTTO: Nerve-racking.

39:18.957 --> 39:18.923
JEFFREY BROWN: You're taking a d
as you say it, right, a big sigh

39:20.391 --> 39:24.963
BECCA PEIXOTTO: Yes. Yes. It was
to be there when the skull was c

39:26.431 --> 39:30.501
of the ground, coming out of the
very gently trying to place it i

39:31.970 --> 39:35.006
to bring it to the surface witho
apart, because these fossils are

39:35.873 --> 39:37.275
particularly when they are first

39:38.743 --> 39:42.113
I take a deep breath now because
held my breath the whole time we

39:42.680 --> 39:42.614
on the skull.

39:44.082 --> 39:47.318
JEFFREY BROWN: You have a sense
of what you were holding, right?

39:48.786 --> 39:51.890
BECCA PEIXOTTO: Yes, definitely,
of it, that here we were with al

39:53.358 --> 39:59.564
fossil specimens and were coming
a very large fragment of a skull

40:00.431 --> 40:01.332
build a picture of what this cre

40:02.800 --> 40:05.770
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so, Jamie S
you try to think of the importan

40:07.238 --> 40:09.274
finding, you were saying we stil
learn a lot more to see how it f

40:10.575 --> 40:14.212

importance right now?

40:15.680 --> 40:20.551
JAMIE SHREEVE: Well, I think it'
you know, one of the most import

40:21.419 --> 40:23.488
in the last 50 years since Lucy.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.891
And the reason for that is becau
so much of it. Most of the time,

40:28.359 --> 40:33.998
find a new hominid fossil, you f
or a skull or a leg bone. Here,

40:35.466 --> 40:39.637
bones. So you actually know a gr
this creature that you couldn't

40:40.338 --> 40:41.005
from just a fragment.

40:42.473 --> 40:46.277
So, there will be a lot of analy
to come. And the date is extreme

40:47.745 --> 40:50.982
going forward to knowing how thi
it seems to be something that is

40:52.450 --> 40:56.020

40:57.455 --> 41:01.125
of how our genus evolved from th
form called Australopithecus.

41:02.593 --> 41:04.962
JEFFREY BROWN: And, very briefly
there are thought to be many, ma

41:06.097 --> 41:07.131
left in the cave, right, so ther
more to do.

41:08.533 --> 41:09.901
JAMIE SHREEVE: Yes, it is litter
if I'm not mistaken, right?

41:10.768 --> 41:11.836
BECCA PEIXOTTO: It certainly is.

41:13.304 --> 41:18.042
We went back a second time for a
of excavation in March of 2014,

41:19.510 --> 41:23.648

we were able to recover some fos

41:25.116 --> 41:29.354
we were hoping to get, but we ce
not exhaust the fossil supply in

JEFFREY BROWN: All right, amazin

41:32.423 --> 41:33.791

48:05.583 --> 48:04.315
of people that don't use Apple,
doesn't really make a difference

48:05.783 --> 48:08.753
PAUL SOLMAN: But aren't we being
by advertisers and their brands?

PAUL SOLMAN: Blame biology, says

STEVE QUARTZ: We all know that,
our kids become teenagers, they

48:29.640 --> 48:32.676
with their social life. They bec
concerned about how they are doi

48:34.145 --> 48:37.081
social group. It's because this
brain is coming online, and it's

social environment much more imp
them.

48:40.618 --> 48:43.621
PAUL SOLMAN: So, as that part of
develops, that's where peer pres

48:44.054 --> 48:43.721
from?

48:44.522 --> 48:44.221
STEVE QUARTZ: That's right.

48:45.556 --> 48:47.024
PAUL SOLMAN: And so is this why
are so brand-conscious?

48:48.492 --> 48:51.028
STEVE QUARTZ: That's right, beca
is an extension of themselves. T

PAUL SOLMAN: Quartz recalls s hi
obsessions growing up in Toronto

49:02.239 --> 49:08.112
STEVE QUARTZ: In Canada, we have
had two stripes called North Sta

49:09.580 --> 49:14.051
wore them when you were 8 or 10,
But in high school, you wore Adi

49:15.519 --> 49:19.924
three stripes. And so I recall,
with my mother, a standoff in a

49:21.392 --> 49:24.228
holding out for the third stripe
for that -- a kid, having that t

49:25.362 --> 49:26.630
meant all the difference between
or not cool.

49:27.731 --> 49:28.699
PAUL SOLMAN: And when, if ever,
over that?

49:30.167 --> 49:32.536
STEVE QUARTZ: I think we all sti
throughout our whole life to be

49:33.337 --> 49:34.171
to these kinds of processes.

49:35.639 --> 49:39.276
PAUL SOLMAN: And, in the end, th
epiphany of Professor Quartz's b

STEVE QUARTZ: We need to really
whether our consumerism is a bad

to give each other status, to fe

That sense of both all the time

Mindful walking. Mindful eating.
What activity wouldn't be helped

51:19.209 --> 51:26.884
by bringing more focus and care

of our investment in everything
that is the biggest source of st
