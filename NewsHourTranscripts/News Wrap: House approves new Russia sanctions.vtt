In the day's other news:
President Trump today
kept sawing on the tree
limb where he's recently

00:05.466 --> 00:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
placed his attorney
general, Jeff Sessions.

00:08.533 --> 00:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He charged that Sessions has
been very weak on investigating
Hillary Clinton, and needs

00:13.500 --> 00:15.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be -- quote --
"much tougher."

00:15.566 --> 00:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for whether Sessions will
keep his job, the president
said, "Time will tell."

00:19.633 --> 00:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of Mr. Trump's
advisers said he probably
wants Sessions to resign.

We will have a full report
later in the program.

today that Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson is
increasingly frustrated

00:32.633 --> 00:34.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in his job.

00:34.666 --> 00:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Several news outlets reported
that the former ExxonMobil
chief is chafing at curbs on his

00:39.966 --> 00:41.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
independence.

00:41.666 --> 00:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The reports said he's
told friends that he
may not last a year.

00:45.033 --> 00:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But spokesperson Heather
Nauert rejected any such talk.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HEATHER NAUERT, State Department
Spokeswoman: That is false.

00:49.433 --> 00:51.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have spoken
with the secretary.

00:51.500 --> 00:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The secretary has been very
clear he intends to stay
here at State Department.

00:55.500 --> 00:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a lot of work that is
left to be done ahead of us.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He recognizes that.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is deeply engaged
in that work.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Nauert said
that Tillerson is currently
taking a little time off.

Representatives today
voted overwhelmingly to
impose new sanctions on

01:12.000 --> 01:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia, partly over its
meddling in the 2016 election.

01:15.066 --> 01:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This bars President Trump
from relaxing the penalties
without congressional approval.

01:21.966 --> 01:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, in the Russia

to keep up protests and
avoid entering a contested

01:43.800 --> 01:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
holy site until further notice.

01:46.066 --> 01:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had objected to Israel
installing metal detectors at
the Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary

01:51.966 --> 01:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
site after an attack on police.

01:54.166 --> 01:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Overnight, the Israelis
dismantled the metal detectors,
in favor of high-tech cameras,

02:01.100 --> 02:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but protests continued
and Palestinian officials
remained adamant.

02:03.766 --> 02:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI HAMDALLAH, Prime Minister,
Palestinian National Authority
(through translator): We

02:05.933 --> 02:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condemn all the Israeli
measures that take away our
people's right for worship.

02:09.733 --> 02:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We reject all obstacles that
hinder the freedom of worship
granted by international laws.

02:14.133 --> 02:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we demand that we
return to the situation
where things stood before.

02:17.700 --> 02:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Palestinians
warned that the new cameras
could see through clothing and

02:22.533 --> 02:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
embarrass female worshipers.

02:25.033 --> 02:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israeli police said they
will not use cameras that
violate anyone's privacy.

We have a report from Neil
Connery of Independent
Television News.

02:42.933 --> 02:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

NEIL CONNERY: Tagrid Tatan
barely has the strength to cry.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's 12 years old.

02:57.833 --> 03:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For months, Yemen's children
have paid the highest price in
a war now in its third year.

03:08.233 --> 03:10.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Zara is 15.

03:10.433 --> 03:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is what hunger
has done to her.

03:14.633 --> 03:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

is spreading, with more
than 5,000 cases every day.

03:21.500 --> 03:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At Todada (ph) hospital, they're
overwhelmed by cholera victims.

03:27.900 --> 03:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 40 percent of
those affected are children.

03:34.300 --> 03:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yemen was already on its
knees, but now a disease which
should have been left in the

03:36.366 --> 03:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
19th century is in every
part of the country.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the villages, this waterborne
infection is claiming lives,
as one father who lost

03:48.333 --> 03:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his 4-year-old
son, Ali, told us.

son died of cholera because the
water is contaminated, and we

03:56.600 --> 03:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do not have a solution
for this well.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We need a solution to
stop this illness that

help, but, across Yemen,

04:10.733 --> 04:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hunger and cholera cast
the darkest of shadows.

04:14.566 --> 04:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

and came within 150 yards.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard
charged that the U.S. vessel
provoked the incident.
