GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.243 --> 00:12.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Oh, I think he represents a
great threat to

00:12.813 --> 00:14.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our society and our economy.

00:14.815 --> 00:19.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I sit down with
the new presumptive
nominee, Hillary Clinton, to
talk about facing

00:19.953 --> 00:23.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump head on and what
lies ahead.

00:23.090 --> 00:28.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Plus, we examine
Hillary Clinton's
achievement and the possibility
of a woman

00:28.295 --> 00:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president, as Republicans
express continued
concern about Donald Trump.

00:33.267 --> 00:38.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
inside Nepal's kilns. Children
workers are

00:38.672 --> 00:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making bricks to rebuild the
country's earthquake-stricken
towns.

00:42.910 --> 00:48.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And preventing fires
in space,
a look at how scientists are
keeping spacecrafts

00:48.916 --> 00:51.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
safe from micro-gravity fires.

00:51.418 --> 00:56.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY LINENGER, NASA: Fourteen
minutes is
a long time with a roaring fire
and a blackout

00:56.757 --> 01:01.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the smoke, and no place to
go. And if
it were any bigger, I'm pretty
darn sure we

01:01.695 --> 01:03.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would have lost that spacecraft.

01:03.163 --> 01:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:06.667 --> 01:11.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.071 --> 01:23.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
celebrated
today after clinching the
Democratic presidential

01:23.684 --> 01:29.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nomination and winning four of
six primaries
on Tuesday. Bernie Sanders
insisted he's not

01:29.990 --> 01:34.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dropping out, even as he plans
to meet tomorrow
with President Obama.

01:34.761 --> 01:41.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Republican Donald Trump
appealed to Democrats,
even as he feuded with GOP
leaders.

01:41.034 --> 01:43.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All three spoke to their
supporters last night.

01:43.036 --> 01:47.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Now, I know it never feels good
to put your

01:47.674 --> 01:55.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
heart into a cause or a
candidate you believe
in, and to come up short. I know
that feeling

01:55.382 --> 01:55.849 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

01:55.882 --> 01:56.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:56.450 --> 01:58.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:58.352 --> 02:05.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: But, as
we look ahead
-- as we look ahead to the
battle that awaits,

02:06.026 --> 02:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
let's remember all that unites
us.

02:08.095 --> 02:11.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I know that the fight in front
of us is a

02:11.965 --> 02:17.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very, very steep fight. But we
will continue
to fight for every vote and
every delegate

02:17.471 --> 02:18.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we can get.

02:18.171 --> 02:19.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:19.906 --> 02:22.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
To all of those Bernie Sanders
voters who

02:22.542 --> 02:29.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been left out in the cold
by a rigged
system of superdelegates, we
welcome you with

02:29.783 --> 02:30.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
open arms.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:32.586 --> 02:34.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will have
our interview
with Hillary Clinton right after
the news

02:34.955 --> 02:36.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: For the
first time, there won't be a
Republican in

02:39.960 --> 02:45.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
California's U.S. Senate race.
The top two
vote-getters advanced Tuesday,
and both were

02:45.932 --> 02:51.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats, state Attorney
General Kamala Harris,
by a wide margin, and
Congresswoman Loretta

02:51.104 --> 02:53.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sanchez, a 10-term veteran.

02:53.907 --> 02:59.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Representative Renee
Ellmers of
North Carolina was ousted by
another Republican

03:00.013 --> 03:03.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a redrawn district. She'd
been endorsed
by Donald Trump.

03:03.850 --> 03:08.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Israel, two
Palestinian
gunmen killed at least three
people and wounded

03:08.588 --> 03:14.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five in Tel Aviv. Police said
the attackers
were detained. The location was
a popular

03:14.094 --> 03:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
open-air market. It is the
latest in eight
months of Palestinian attacks,
most of them

03:19.599 --> 03:21.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
involving stabbings.

03:21.401 --> 03:26.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For the first time,
Italy has
custody of an alleged kingpin in
the smuggling

03:26.073 --> 03:31.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of thousands of migrants from
Libya. The suspect
from Eritrea was arrested in
Sudan two weeks

03:31.878 --> 03:37.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago. He was flown to Rome
overnight. Officials
say intercepted calls show him
talking about

03:37.851 --> 03:40.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cramming more people on rickety
boats.

03:40.687 --> 03:46.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: India's leader
went before
Congress today to declare
solidarity with

03:46.626 --> 03:47.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our report.

03:49.262 --> 03:52.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The prime minister of the
republic of
India.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was a
rousing welcome
today for Prime Minister
Narendra Modi.

03:55.902 --> 04:01.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARENDRA MODI, Indian Prime
Minister: The
constraints of the past are
behind us, and

04:01.942 --> 04:07.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foundations of the future are
firmly in place.

04:07.881 --> 04:12.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Of course,
things were not
always so friendly. For decades,
the U.S.

04:12.552 --> 04:16.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and India were divided by
mistrust and Cold
War politics.

04:16.490 --> 04:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Modi himself was refused
entry to the
U.S. in 2005, after religious
riots killed

04:21.695 --> 04:27.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 1,000 Muslims in the
state he governed.
But since becoming prime
minister in 2014,

04:27.968 --> 04:31.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's worked to foster new
cooperation with
Washington.

04:31.605 --> 04:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sumit Ganguly is a professor of
political
science at Indiana University in
Bloomington.

04:35.442 --> 04:40.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUMIT GANGULY, Indiana
University: Unlike
a host of other Indian prime
ministers who

04:40.347 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had cut their political teeth
during the Cold
War, and thereby harbored all
manner of misgivings

04:47.354 --> 04:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the United States, Modi
doesn't carry
the same sort of political
baggage.

04:53.260 --> 04:57.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The two
countries share
growing concerns about China's
assertiveness

04:57.531 --> 05:03.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Asia-Pacific. Climate
change could
be another area of agreement.
Modi suggested

05:03.170 --> 05:08.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday that India, the third
largest emitter
of carbon, could join last
year's Paris climate

05:08.341 --> 05:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pact by the end of this year.

05:10.110 --> 05:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARENDRA MODI: To take from
nature only what
is most essential is a part of
our Indian

05:17.017 --> 05:18.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
culture.

05:18.852 --> 05:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Still, serious
differences
remain. Human rights groups say
Modi has failed

05:22.923 --> 05:27.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to stop indentured servitude and
sex trafficking,
as well as protect India's
minorities.

05:28.028 --> 05:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUMIT GANGULY: This is where I
think he as
fallen short and he does really
need to wake

05:33.166 --> 05:35.068 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But such
concerns have clearly
been pushed to the background,
as Washington

05:37.103 --> 05:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and New Delhi move closer
together than ever.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

05:42.342 --> 05:47.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There has been
another incident
between the U.S. and China in
the East China

05:47.581 --> 05:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sea. The U.S. military says a
Chinese fighter
jet flew too close and too fast
to an American

05:53.787 --> 05:58.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reconnaissance plane yesterday.
But Beijing
said the U.S. is to blame.

05:58.358 --> 06:03.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on Wall
Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained
66 points

06:03.530 --> 06:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to close at 18500. The Nasdaq
rose nearly
13, and the S&amp;P 500 added seven.

06:10.170 --> 06:14.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour":
an interview with Hillary
Clinton, the presumptive

06:14.674 --> 06:20.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic presidential nominee;
what to expect
as candidates move full-speed
ahead into the

06:20.580 --> 06:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general election; child labor
rebuilding an
earthquake-struck Nepal; and
much more.

06:30.257 --> 06:41.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
interview with someone
who made history this week,
becoming the first

06:42.002 --> 06:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
woman nominee for president of a
major political
party.

06:45.572 --> 06:49.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with Hillary Clinton a
short time
ago.

06:49.376 --> 06:51.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Clinton, thanks for
joining us.
And congratulations.

06:51.544 --> 06:56.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Thank you so much, Judy. It was
an extraordinary

06:56.549 --> 06:58.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time last night.

06:58.318 --> 07:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, while you are
celebrating,
Senator Sanders is saying he's
out there,

07:01.921 --> 07:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to fight, continue to
fight for every
vote, every delegate.

07:06.293 --> 07:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know your staffs are talking,
but do you
have plans to personally talk to
him? And

07:13.099 --> 07:17.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what are the remaining hurdles
to come to
an agreement on rules and
platform at the

07:17.704 --> 07:19.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Democratic Convention?

07:19.506 --> 07:23.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I
called Senator
Sanders last evening and
congratulated him

07:23.343 --> 07:28.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the hard-fought, determined
campaign that
he ran.

07:28.348 --> 07:35.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am looking forward to
working with him
to unify the Democratic Party
against the

07:35.288 --> 07:42.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threat that Donald Trump poses
to our country.
So, we are talking. We will be
having an opportunity

07:42.162 --> 07:47.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to discuss in greater detail in
the days ahead
how we can best work together.

07:47.734 --> 07:53.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know he's seeing the president
tomorrow
at the White House. So, everyone
is focused

07:53.940 --> 07:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on bring the party together
behind our goal
of being sure that a Democrat
succeeds Barack

07:59.612 --> 08:01.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama next January.

08:01.314 --> 08:05.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you clearly
won many
more votes than Senator Sanders
did, but he

08:05.352 --> 08:11.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appears to have generated more
enthusiasm,
especially among younger voters.

08:11.191 --> 08:15.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you go about winning them
over, winning
their trust and getting them to
vote for you

08:15.762 --> 08:17.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in November?

08:17.597 --> 08:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
Judy, first
of all, let me say I think my
supporters are

08:20.500 --> 08:26.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretty enthusiastic, too, and
they have turned
out for me by the millions, many
more millions

08:26.172 --> 08:29.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than Bernie Sanders and Donald
Trump.

08:29.442 --> 08:35.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want the stand up for my
supporters.
You know, they may not be the
most vocal and

08:35.782 --> 08:42.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demonstrating, but they show up
and vote.
And we have a broad-based,
inclusive foundation

08:42.922 --> 08:46.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for this campaign that we're
going to build
on going into the general
election.

08:46.893 --> 08:52.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But of course I recognize that
Senator Sanders
really connected with young
people in our

08:52.565 --> 09:00.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country. A lot of his energy
came from their
support for him, and we are
going to be reaching

09:00.573 --> 09:05.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out. We're going to be working
to make sure
that every young person who
supported Senator

09:05.378 --> 09:10.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders, if that young person
cares about
income inequality or making
college affordable

09:10.450 --> 09:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or making sure everybody has
health care,
those are goals we share.

09:13.820 --> 09:17.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about
Donald Trump, because it's
typical in American

09:17.290 --> 09:22.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- modern American politics,
voters want a
change in direction, usually
after one president

09:22.395 --> 09:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for this long. Doesn't he
represent that?

09:24.364 --> 09:30.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Oh, I
think he represents
a great threat to our society
and our economy.

09:30.470 --> 09:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, there may be some people
who respond
to his sloganeering and his
bigotry and bullying,

09:38.278 --> 09:43.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I just don't think that a
majority of
Americans are going to buy it.
And we saw

09:43.283 --> 09:50.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just this past week his racist
attack on the
federal judge, accusing him of
being unable

09:50.056 --> 09:56.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be impartial in hearing the
case that is
exposing the fraud at Trump
University.

09:56.763 --> 10:05.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is just heartbreaking, as
well as outrageous.
So, I think he has a lot of
challenges in

10:05.171 --> 10:13.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overcoming the words and deeds
that he has
already used in this campaign
and before that

10:13.646 --> 10:19.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think make him unqualified to
be president,
temperamentally unfit to be
commander in chief.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Donald
Trump is saying,
as I think you know, that he's
going to make

10:22.655 --> 10:29.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a major speech early next week.
He says he's
going to detail how you, as
secretary of state,

10:29.929 --> 10:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there were conflicts of
interests while
the Clinton Foundation was doing
business

10:33.666 --> 10:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with foreign countries while you
were in office,
that the foundation benefited
personally from

10:42.208 --> 10:44.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

10:44.043 --> 10:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to talk about, he
said, millions
of dollars being exchanged. Is
this something

10:47.881 --> 10:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're worried about? And is the
foundation
something you need to sever you
and your family

10:53.686 --> 10:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from completely if you're
elected?

10:55.688 --> 10:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I am not
worried about
this.

10:57.790 --> 11:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this is just more of the
same recycled
attacks that people like Donald
Trump have

11:05.932 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been making against us for a
long time. There's
no factual basis to it. That's
been proven

11:13.106 --> 11:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time and time again. I can't
stop someone
from retreading arguments that
have been disproved

11:21.147 --> 11:22.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over and over again.

11:22.882 --> 11:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He can say whatever he wants to.
He can run
whatever campaign he wants to.
So I'm not

11:26.419 --> 11:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to respond to his personal
attacks.
That's something that, you know,
he can choose

11:31.925 --> 11:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do. I'm going to respond,
however, to the
attacks that he makes on women
and immigrants

11:38.064 --> 11:44.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Muslims and people with
disabilities and
POWs and federal judges, and the
list keeps

11:44.203 --> 11:46.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
growing.

11:46.039 --> 11:49.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary
Clinton, one question
on foreign policy. You were
described in a

11:49.108 --> 11:54.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recent acclaimed book by Mark
Landler as being
the -- quote -- "house hawk" in
the Clinton

11:54.814 --> 11:56.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
war cabinet.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that you -- and you
talked about
this -- you encouraged the
president to intervene

11:59.419 --> 12:06.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Libya in 2011. Recently,
President Obama
said his worst mistake in office
was probably

12:06.726 --> 12:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
failing to plan for the day
after what he
thought was the right thing to
do in intervening

12:13.299 --> 12:14.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you see your
responsibility in that?

12:16.102 --> 12:20.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
first of all,
it's important to remember where
we were and

12:20.073 --> 12:24.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why the president made the
decision he did,
because this was a presidential
decision.

12:24.811 --> 12:30.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have advised the president.
Sometimes, he
follows my advice. Sometimes, he
doesn't.

12:30.950 --> 12:37.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, he uses a combination
of what he
hears from his advisers. We were
looking at

12:37.290 --> 12:45.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a potential disaster, as Gadhafi
threatened
to massacre large numbers of his
population.

12:45.999 --> 12:52.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Europeans, our Arab allies
were urging
us to help them to try to
prevent that. After

12:52.071 --> 12:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
due diligence, we came up with a
way of supporting
their efforts that didn't cost a
single American

12:58.611 --> 13:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life. And we saved a lot of
Libyan lives.

13:02.415 --> 13:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, could we have done more
after the Gadhafi
regime was ended? Well, that's
always second-guessing.

13:12.358 --> 13:16.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm sure that there's more
we could have
done, but let's look at what we
did do.

13:16.129 --> 13:23.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We, along with the U.N. and
others, helped
to superintend two free and fair
elections,

13:23.236 --> 13:28.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that is still quite an
accomplishment
by the Libyan people. They chose
moderate

13:28.508 --> 13:30.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leaders.

13:30.309 --> 13:38.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, preexisting
rivalries within
the country has prevented the
government from

13:38.885 --> 13:44.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really being able to act on
behalf of the
nation. So, of course, if there
were more

13:44.891 --> 13:50.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things to be done that we could
have influenced,
I think that's something we
should be looking

13:50.997 --> 13:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at and evaluating, because Libya
still is
a country that is struggling to
be successful.

13:57.804 --> 14:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, a
quick running
mate question. How big a
negative do you think

14:02.608 --> 14:07.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would be to choose a sitting
senator from
a state with a Republican
governor, knowing

14:07.980 --> 14:09.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that would mean a Republican
replacement?

14:09.749 --> 14:14.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I
know it's
a big concern to my friends in
the Senate,

14:14.253 --> 14:16.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and I respect that concern.

14:16.556 --> 14:24.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm going the choose someone who
I think would
be ready to be president at a
moment's notice.

14:24.297 --> 14:31.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, I will listen to my
former colleagues,
as they are working so hard to
take back the

14:31.738 --> 14:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate. But I'm going to really
be focused
on the qualifications that the
person brings

14:38.578 --> 14:40.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the job.

14:40.413 --> 14:44.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I haven't gotten into that
in the depth
I will, but that's what my
guiding star will

14:44.417 --> 14:45.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

14:45.952 --> 14:48.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary
Clinton, we thank
you. And, again,
congratulations.

14:48.654 --> 14:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Thanks a
lot, Judy.
Great to talk to you.

14:51.457 --> 14:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now for some
context on this
historic moment.

14:55.128 --> 15:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are joined by Rebecca
Traister, writer-at-large
for "New York" magazine and the
author of

15:00.399 --> 15:05.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"All The Single Ladies:
Unmarried Women and
the Rise of an Independent
Nation"," presidential

historian Ellen Fitzpatrick,
author of the
book "The Highest Glass Ceiling:
Women's Quest

15:10.576 --> 15:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the American Presidency,"
and John Lawrence,
visiting professor at the
University of California

Washington Center and former
chief of staff
to House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi.

15:21.154 --> 15:27.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ellen Fitzpatrick, this takes me
back to Margaret
Chase Smith in 1964, Shirley
Chisholm, in

15:27.627 --> 15:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1972, but neither of them got
this far. How
big a breakthrough, I guess,
what Hillary

15:33.499 --> 15:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton accomplished last night?

15:35.535 --> 15:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK, Professor of
History, University
of New Hampshire: Huge, as our
current candidates

15:38.037 --> 15:41.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would say. It's absolutely an
extraordinary
achievement.

15:41.874 --> 15:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Hillary Clinton really
has been underestimated
as a politician. But when you
set her campaign

15:48.815 --> 15:56.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within the long arc of history,
you can see
what an extraordinary
achievement it is, 150

15:56.422 --> 16:01.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years almost since the first
woman attempted
to run for president, Victoria
Woodhull, in

16:01.861 --> 16:03.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the 1870s.

16:03.629 --> 16:10.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now Hillary Clinton has
actually won the
nomination of a major -- or come
close to,

16:10.403 --> 16:13.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will soon win the nomination of
major political
party.

16:13.639 --> 16:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Rebecca Traister,
you know, two,
four -- eight years ago, when
Barack Obama

16:18.411 --> 16:23.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bested her, there was a general
idea that
took hold that she just really
wasn't that

16:23.883 --> 16:28.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good a candidate, and that, even
though it
was close, she just couldn't
pull it off.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's the difference between
2008 and 2016?

16:29.789 --> 16:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER, Author, "All
The Single
Ladies: Unmarried Women and the
Rise of an

16:31.591 --> 16:34.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Independent Nation": Well, I
think she was
running against a less
formidable opponent,

16:34.861 --> 16:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that's not to take anything
away from
Bernie Sanders, who ran a
tremendous campaign.

16:38.231 --> 16:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And obviously he was a long-shot
candidate
by many measures, and he
generated an enormous

16:43.536 --> 16:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount of excitement, was very
inspiring,
very inspiring to so many young
people, so

16:49.909 --> 16:52.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many people on the left, was
wonderful.

16:52.211 --> 16:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when she was competing
against Barack
Obama, she was really competing
against one

16:56.082 --> 17:02.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the most gifted politicians
of our lifetimes,
I think. And the idea that she
didn't perform

17:02.722 --> 17:07.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well in 2008, there were all
kinds of problems
with her campaign, and she
wasn't as good

17:07.593 --> 17:10.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a candidate in 2008, but she did
have a very
strong performance.

17:10.429 --> 17:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember that she earned 18
million votes
in 2008. I mean, both she and
Obama ran exceptional

17:18.304 --> 17:24.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaigns, by some measures, in
terms of getting
people enthusiastic and involved
in the process.

17:24.210 --> 17:30.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, I think the
campaign was stronger.
She's a more comfortable and a
more confident

17:30.449 --> 17:35.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate this time around. I
think that she
trusted herself a little bit
more. She still

17:35.187 --> 17:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has flaws. She's still not
wonderful on a
big stage.

17:39.191 --> 17:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that she was much
more in control
of her campaign and her
candidacy this time,

17:44.130 --> 17:48.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I think she just wasn't up
against a superstar
like Barack Obama, all respect
to Bernie Sanders.

17:48.868 --> 17:52.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: John Lawrence, you
worked for
Nancy Pelosi for some time. We
still remember

17:52.505 --> 17:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that moment when she became
speaker of the
House and the huge gavel was
handed over to

17:56.642 --> 17:58.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

17:58.411 --> 18:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How different was it when a
woman, in her
-- in this case, for speaker of
the House,

18:02.815 --> 18:04.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
became such a breakthrough
candidate?

18:04.684 --> 18:06.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LAWRENCE, Former Chief of
Staff to Nancy
Pelosi: It was a very historic
moment.

18:06.552 --> 18:10.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think maybe you remember
that she asked
all the children who were in the
chamber to

18:10.690 --> 18:15.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come up and join her on the
podium, although
that was technically against the
rules, because

18:15.561 --> 18:21.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she wanted to symbolize the
importance of
a woman, and someone who was
primarily concerned

18:21.567 --> 18:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the economics and the
needs of American
families, to be part of that
transition.

18:28.774 --> 18:33.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Speaker Pelosi used to say,
now we have
made history. Now we have to
make progress.

18:33.346 --> 18:39.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think she was very adamant
about wanting
to define the importance of her
accession

18:39.151 --> 18:43.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speakership in terms of the
legislation and
the policy goals that she
sought, not simply

18:43.856 --> 18:45.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in terms of gender.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And yet I heard a
lot of discussion
then, as now with Hillary
Clinton, about her

18:48.761 --> 18:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hair, about her clothes, about
the fact that
her husband shopped for her,
what designers

18:52.832 --> 18:55.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she wore, which you didn't
generally hear
about men.

18:55.534 --> 18:59.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LAWRENCE: No, I actually
worked for somebody
for 30 years before that, and if
I could get

18:59.105 --> 19:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him to comb his hair, I thought
that was a
major accomplishment.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:03.709 --> 19:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LAWRENCE: I think that's
true. I think
it's true that women are still
subjected to

19:06.379 --> 19:13.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
standard that most male
candidates and male
officeholders are not subjected
to.

19:13.652 --> 19:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We used to talk in the office
about the fact
that John Boehner would cry at
the drop of

19:17.790 --> 19:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a hat. Imagine if Nancy Pelosi
had cried when
she faced a difficult vote. So,
there's a

19:22.695 --> 19:24.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
different standard.

19:24.630 --> 19:28.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the women who get to this
stage in politics,
just like women who get to this
stage in other

19:28.467 --> 19:32.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very competitive areas of life,
they have
learned to live with the
challenges that are

19:32.505 --> 19:34.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thrown at them.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ellen Fitzpatrick,
you're on a
college campus. Perhaps you can
explain to

19:36.108 --> 19:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us part of the generational
divide that we
have seen. I don't know whether
we're talking

19:40.446 --> 19:43.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about strategy or ideology or
just fact.

19:43.382 --> 19:49.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's the leap for young women
in -- why
are they so -- so many of them
so unimpressed

19:49.121 --> 19:50.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by this kind of breakthrough?

19:50.589 --> 19:54.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Well, I'm not
sure that
that's actually true, Gwen.

19:54.960 --> 20:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we have to see how
things unfold
in the next few months. It is
the case, of

20:01.000 --> 20:06.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
course, that Bernie Sanders
really excited
a lot of college students, and I
think they

20:06.272 --> 20:13.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were drawn to his message, his
idealism, the
scope of his progressive
platform, and less

20:13.846 --> 20:17.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so perhaps to Hillary Clinton,
or clearly
so.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:19.018 --> 20:21.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Rebecca Traister,
you spent some
time with her on the campaign
trail prior

20:21.253 --> 20:23.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the final primaries.

20:23.289 --> 20:28.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wonder, A, if that's true.
And I wonder
if, instead of not knowing her
well enough,

20:29.028 --> 20:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we feel that we know Hillary
Clinton too well?

20:31.430 --> 20:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER: Yes, all those
things are
true.

20:34.333 --> 20:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In part, I think that what Ellen
is talking
about is very true. There is
more enthusiasm

20:40.005 --> 20:44.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her than is necessarily made
clear by
the media narratives around her.
I mean, after

20:44.376 --> 20:48.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all, look, she -- she won more
votes. I mean,
despite all the stories about
the enormous

20:48.547 --> 20:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders,
which clearly
existed amongst young people and
people of

20:53.185 --> 20:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all ages, Hillary Clinton got
three million
more votes than he did in the
end.

20:57.756 --> 21:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is obviously enthusiasm
about her, but
there are some translation
issues around how

21:03.295 --> 21:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to express that enthusiasm. And
I think that
that's something that has to
change. One of

21:07.466 --> 21:11.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the things that I did notice on
the campaign
trail, as I mentioned, she's
very bad in these

21:11.370 --> 21:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big, inspiring -- well, not very
bad.

21:13.372 --> 21:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She can be bad in these big,
inspiring speech
contests -- context, the big
stages. But she's

21:19.945 --> 21:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really an exceptional retail
politician. And
when you're with her not just
one-on-one in

21:25.351 --> 21:30.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a kind of social or friendly
situation, but
watching her shake the hands of
voters, of

21:30.356 --> 21:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
local politicians, address rooms
full of people
talking about their individual
stories, their

21:35.561 --> 21:39.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues, she really lights up a
room and people
get thrilled about her.

21:39.498 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that doesn't often come
through in the
media coverage of her.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.104 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:45.137 --> 21:47.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, of course,
Judy Woodruff
just interviewed Hillary
Clinton, so I will

21:47.373 --> 21:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let the viewers judge how well
she did with
the press.

21:49.475 --> 21:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I want to ask John Lawrence
here about
the Donald Trump factor, which
is, with Donald

21:56.315 --> 22:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump as the foil, macho guy,
not hesitating
to challenge, to throw the
gauntlet down,

22:03.122 --> 22:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does that change what she has to
do as a breakthrough
woman candidate?

22:07.526 --> 22:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LAWRENCE: I think that
Trump in that
sense is a bit of a gift,
because he has such

22:11.530 --> 22:19.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a strong misogynist tone to so
much of what
he says, that he almost
insulates Mrs. Clinton

22:19.471 --> 22:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against some of what might
otherwise be questions
about being a woman or being the
first woman

22:24.743 --> 22:26.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate.

22:26.545 --> 22:29.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the other problem that
Mr. Trump will
find running against Secretary
Clinton is

22:30.015 --> 22:36.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that security is a very
high-priority issue,
and particularly a high-priority
issue with

22:36.555 --> 22:42.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women voters. To be running
against somebody
who was a secretary of state, a
United States

22:42.161 --> 22:47.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senator, sat in the Situation
Room, met with
dozens of foreign national
leaders, and then

22:47.166 --> 22:52.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play that off against a complete
lack of experience,
I think, really will cause a lot
of voters

22:52.905 --> 22:57.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who might otherwise be somewhat
ambivalent
to Mrs. Clinton say, in a world
that is as

22:57.576 --> 23:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
uncertain and as dangerous as
this world,
we really -- we really feel more
comfortable

23:04.083 --> 23:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with somebody who has been
around the track,
as she has.

23:06.185 --> 23:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm afraid we are
going to have
to come back to this topic again
and again

23:09.255 --> 23:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the year unfolds to see if
what you just
said is true, for instance.

23:12.858 --> 23:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Lawrence, thank you very
much. Rebecca
Traister and Ellen Fitzpatrick,
thank you

23:16.595 --> 23:17.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

23:17.396 --> 23:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Thank you.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN LAWRENCE: Thanks.

23:20.466 --> 23:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on
Donald Trump's
campaign for the White House,
I'm joined by

23:24.470 --> 23:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan Page, Washington bureau
chief for USA
Today, and Reid Wilson, chief
political correspondent

23:30.709 --> 23:32.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the Morning Consult.

23:32.478 --> 23:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to both of you.

23:34.280 --> 23:38.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, let's pick up the
conversation, Reid,
about Donald Trump, all this
focus for days

23:38.117 --> 23:43.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after days now about what he
said about this
judge of Mexican heritage. How
much damage

23:43.088 --> 23:44.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has been done?

23:44.957 --> 23:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON, Morning Consult:
Well, not only
has he done more damage to his
own campaign.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's doing damage now to the
rest of the Republican
Party.

23:49.828 --> 23:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican Party has spent
years trying
to rebuild relationships with
the Hispanic

23:54.400 --> 23:59.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community in particular. George
W. Bush got
44 percent of the Hispanic vote
when he won

23:59.038 --> 24:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reelection in 2004. Mitt Romney
got 27 percent
of the vote. It's the
fastest-growing minority

24:04.009 --> 24:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group in America. Republicans
need to make
those inroads.

24:07.613 --> 24:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is busy erasing all
of the inroads
that have been made. And it's
starting to

24:12.084 --> 24:16.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact down-ballot Republicans
across the
country. The Des Moines Register
today takes

24:16.455 --> 24:21.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Chuck Grassley to task
for not having
-gone - having repudiated Donald
Trump's comments,

24:21.794 --> 24:24.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying that they had seen better
spines on
invertebrates.

24:24.596 --> 24:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is starting to infect
the entire
party, and that's the real
danger in Donald

24:28.801 --> 24:30.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump's comments.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
this, Susan?
How long-lasting is this?

24:32.171 --> 24:34.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Well, you know, we have been
talking about

24:34.039 --> 24:37.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
divisions in the Democratic
Party and whether
Bernie Sanders will embrace
Hillary Clinton.

24:37.876 --> 24:40.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The divisions in the Democratic
Party are
nothing compared to the civil
war that is

24:40.946 --> 24:42.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
brewing in the Republican Party.

24:42.648 --> 24:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Civil war?

24:43.282 --> 24:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: The civil war.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We had the top-ranking
Republican of the United
States, the speaker of the
House, Paul Ryan,

24:48.554 --> 24:54.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
say that the party's
presidential nominee
was making racist statements.
This is an extraordinary

24:54.993 --> 24:56.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
situation, and not resolved.

24:56.829 --> 25:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw Donald Trump try to be
more restrained
last night, when he talked with
the benefit

25:00.799 --> 25:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a teleprompter, kind of a
different message
than he's had before. But the
test will be,

25:05.404 --> 25:09.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the time of this campaign,
over the next
six weeks, before the
convention, can he keep

25:09.875 --> 25:11.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that more moderate tone?

25:11.710 --> 25:15.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we heard --
Reid, we heard
Donald Trump -- or we read today
that he said

25:15.814 --> 25:20.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was disappointed that these
Republican
leaders are being critical of
him.

25:20.152 --> 25:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does something like this get
repaired?

25:22.154 --> 25:25.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REID WILSON: And he is
disappointed that his
comments have been misconstrued.
I find it

25:25.924 --> 25:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard to imagine how the comments
were misconstrued.
He was pretty clear about what
he said.

25:30.763 --> 25:36.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that how this gets
repaired depends
on how professionally Donald
Trump's campaign

25:36.935 --> 25:42.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to be run. He ran this
primary campaign
on a sort of seat-of-his-pants
basis, these

25:42.207 --> 25:48.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big mega-rallies, without the
sorts of sort
of blocking and tackling that
are required

25:48.213 --> 25:51.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to run a professional, modern
presidential
campaign.

25:51.517 --> 25:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Trump isn't going to build
that kind of
modern campaign, I don't think
these things

25:55.487 --> 25:57.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can be repaired.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where do you see
this going,
Susan? Is this the kind of thing
that just

25:59.391 --> 26:04.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- is just going to have legs as
long as the
-- there's oxygen to support it?

26:04.263 --> 26:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, as long as
Donald Trump
is at center stage. And he's
going to be at

26:07.933 --> 26:13.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center stage for the rest of
this year, until
Election Day. You know, he's
going to be the

26:13.539 --> 26:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
face of the Republican Party.

26:15.374 --> 26:19.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other Republicans are going to
have to either
embrace him or distance
themselves from him.

26:19.178 --> 26:23.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every day they spend doing
that is a day
they don't attack Hillary
Clinton and the

26:23.415 --> 26:27.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic Party. Every day that
goes on,
it makes it less likely that
Republicans will

26:27.786 --> 26:32.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to hold control of the
Senate, for
instance, even longer shot, get
control of

26:32.791 --> 26:34.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the House.

26:34.626 --> 26:37.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that Republicans --
some senior
Republicans are now looking at
this and trying

26:37.296 --> 26:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to figure out, how can we not
only be competitive
in a presidential race, but
avoid longer-lasting

26:43.235 --> 26:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
damage down the ballot and in
years to come?

26:46.205 --> 26:48.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

26:48.073 --> 26:54.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reid, we showed a clip of Donald
Trump last
night saying he was appealing to
Bernie Sanders

26:54.046 --> 26:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporters in this election.
What do people
think is there? Is that really
something that

26:58.016 --> 26:59.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could happen?

26:59.785 --> 27:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Every four years, I
feel like
we get to this point in the
election where

27:01.887 --> 27:06.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we talk about how deeply divided
one party
is and how one party's candidate
-- voters

27:06.792 --> 27:11.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might go and vote for the other
party's candidate
in protest.

27:11.363 --> 27:16.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It never really happens. Even
today, we have
got close to 90 percent of
Republican voters

27:16.802 --> 27:20.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying they will vote for Donald
Trump, about
85 percent of Democratic voters
saying they

27:20.873 --> 27:24.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will vote for Hillary Clinton.
Once there
is a clear contrast between
Hillary Clinton

27:24.810 --> 27:27.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Donald Trump, those partisan
voters will
largely come home.

27:27.880 --> 27:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the notion of appealing
-- Donald
Trump appealing to Bernie
Sanders voters is

27:34.586 --> 27:36.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fanciful at best.

27:36.421 --> 27:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: You know, I actually
think there
is one way in which there could
be some overlap

27:39.057 --> 27:43.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, where Donald Trump could
in fact appeal
to Bernie Sanders voters, in
that there are

27:43.762 --> 27:47.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some voters who are just so
eager for change,
so disgusted with the way the
system works

27:47.633 --> 27:50.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now, that they might have
supported Bernie
Sanders.

27:50.102 --> 27:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, they might be open to a
Trump appeal.
I mean, that's the tantalizing
thing for Republicans.

27:54.540 --> 27:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some strengths that
Donald Trump
could bring to a presidential
campaign, an

27:58.377 --> 28:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ability to appeal to some voters
that Republicans
haven't traditionally gotten.
The question

28:02.681 --> 28:05.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, does he wash that away with
some of his
more provocative statements?

28:05.851 --> 28:09.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
finally, to both
of you, I asked Hillary Clinton
about the

28:10.022 --> 28:14.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump threat really to
bring out new
information, damaging
information about the

28:14.793 --> 28:15.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton Foundation.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something she should be
worried about?

28:17.663 --> 28:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: I don't think so.
Hillary Clinton
has been in the public spotlight
for 25 years.

28:22.234 --> 28:26.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is there new? Who is
undecided about
Hillary Clinton and whether or
not they have

28:26.338 --> 28:28.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
favorable impression?

28:28.173 --> 28:31.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of these attacks
are going to
be the same things that
Republicans have tried

28:31.443 --> 28:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a very long time, and they
haven't worked.

28:33.278 --> 28:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: It does reinforce,
though, her
biggest vulnerability. Do you
trust her? Is

28:36.448 --> 28:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she honest? And so, in that way,
it goes to
a weakness that she's going to
have to face

28:41.253 --> 28:42.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the months to come.

28:42.421 --> 28:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan Page, Reid
Wilson, thank
you.

28:44.823 --> 28:49.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

28:49.895 --> 29:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us. Coming
up on the
"NewsHour": scientists try to
protect astronauts

29:04.376 --> 29:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by setting fires in spacecraft.

29:06.845 --> 29:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: a report about the
scourge of
child labor in the back-breaking
brick manufacturing

29:12.584 --> 29:14.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
process in Nepal.

29:14.553 --> 29:18.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's from special
correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro, and it's part of his
series, Agents

29:18.724 --> 29:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Change, a collaboration with
The Christian
Science Monitor.

29:22.094 --> 29:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Heavy
lifting is a way
of life in this Himalayan
country, but workers

29:28.467 --> 29:33.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Nepal's brick kilns are in a
league of
their own.

29:33.171 --> 29:39.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, work is an endless cycle
of loads that
weigh more than the laborers who
carry them,

29:39.911 --> 29:45.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of polluted, oppressive
conditions, grinding
coal to stoke kilns that must be
kept alive

29:45.584 --> 29:53.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at some 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit
round the
clock, of molding clay into raw
bricks that

29:53.792 --> 29:55.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
feed the ovens.

29:55.560 --> 29:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TILOOK MOKTAN, Nepal (through
translator):
You don't use your brains to do
this work.

29:59.598 --> 30:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just physical labor, but we
have no choice.
We have debts to pay.

30:03.935 --> 30:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Tilook
Moktan and his
wife, Rina, say life is a
never-ending cycle

30:09.174 --> 30:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of debt for medical bills, for
just running
the household, they say, and to
put their

30:14.579 --> 30:16.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
children in school.

30:16.381 --> 30:19.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TILOOK MOKTAN (through
translator): I want
to see that my children are
educated, that

30:19.885 --> 30:23.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they complete their higher
education. Work
is too tough in the brick
sector.

30:23.922 --> 30:25.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HOLTZ, Christian Science
Monitor:
They will get up at midnight,
before it gets

30:26.024 --> 30:31.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too hot, work until dawn, sleep
for a few
hours, get up, start molding
more bricks,

30:31.730 --> 30:33.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and do it again the next night.

30:33.665 --> 30:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN HERMES, Christian Science
Monitor: It's
physically demanding at all
aspects. And that's

30:38.070 --> 30:39.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why I think its startling to see
children.

30:39.871 --> 30:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: We partnered
with Christian
Science Monitor reporter Michael
Holtz and

30:43.642 --> 30:48.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
photographer Ann Hermes, who
took these still
photographs, on a story we found
especially

30:48.647 --> 30:54.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
relevant now in this
earthquake-ravage country
about an industry notorious for
trapping children

30:55.020 --> 30:56.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and families in poverty.

30:56.755 --> 31:00.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HOLTZ: I think we really
wanted to
get a sense of, now that
reconstruction is

31:00.459 --> 31:06.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finally getting under way in
Nepal, and demands
for bricks is going to go so
high, what -- how

31:06.398 --> 31:10.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would affect the brick kiln
industry
itself, in terms of, would there
be increases

31:10.902 --> 31:13.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in child labor, increases in
bonded labor?

31:13.472 --> 31:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: There are
some 1,100 brick
kilns across Nepal, a number
that's grown

31:19.077 --> 31:22.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
recently, anticipating
large-scale rebuilding
from the earthquake.

31:22.380 --> 31:25.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMRAJ ACHARYA, Better Brick
Nepal: So these
are the areas where they make
bricks.

31:25.584 --> 31:30.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: All told,
they employ
about 250,000 people, says
Homraj Acharya,

31:30.956 --> 31:36.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who is part of a two-year-old
initiative called
Better Brick Nepal, or BBN.

31:36.695 --> 31:40.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how many children again did
you say are
working in kilns today in Nepal?

31:40.332 --> 31:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOMRAJ ACHARYA: We can find
around 60,000.

31:42.167 --> 31:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Sixty
thousand?

31:43.869 --> 31:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMRAJ ACHARYA: Children, yes,
because, you
know, it's a family-based
industry.

31:45.971 --> 31:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They live in
brick shacks,
surrounded by LEGO-like
fortresses, molded

31:53.411 --> 31:58.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bricks stacked up at the start
of an almost
preindustrial process.

31:58.250 --> 32:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For brick makers, there are no
set working
hours. The basic rule is, you
work until you're

32:02.854 --> 32:08.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too tired to continue, and
there's every incentive
to continue to the point of
exhaustion, because

32:08.093 --> 32:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workers are paid by the brick.
They get a
little less than one U.S. cent
for every one

32:13.732 --> 32:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of these that they produce.

32:15.534 --> 32:20.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMRAJ ACHARYA: Because it's
paid on a piece
basis, so if children are making
like hundred

32:20.639 --> 32:23.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bricks more, so that means you
might get a
hundred.

32:23.775 --> 32:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, they
help the productivity,
which helps their wages?

32:27.312 --> 32:29.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOMRAJ ACHARYA: Yes, exactly.

32:29.147 --> 32:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Do the
children help mold
bricks, I asked the Moktan?
Seven-year-old

32:32.851 --> 32:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ritesh, no, but 12-year-old
Ritika, yes.

32:35.854 --> 32:40.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TILOOK MOKTAN (through
translator): She works
a few hours a week. She helps
with the cooking.

32:40.792 --> 32:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, sometimes, when their
mother needs to
do the cooking, she helps out
with the bricks.

32:44.229 --> 32:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It may seem
normal for
children to pitch in with
chores. But Acharya

32:48.700 --> 32:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says these desperately poor
families invariably
grow to depend excessively on
the children

32:54.472 --> 32:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to scrape together more income.

32:56.374 --> 33:01.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMRAJ ACHARYA: The system
creates that enabling
environment for children to be
used.

33:01.746 --> 33:06.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The Better
Brick program
wants to create a different
environment, using

33:06.451 --> 33:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
incentives for kiln owners.

33:12.657 --> 33:17.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those who sign on agree to pay
for preschool
facilities like this one to get
children into

33:17.963 --> 33:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a classroom and away from the
brick workplace
of their parents. And BBN works
with owners

33:23.535 --> 33:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and parents to ensure that older
children
attend school.

33:27.606 --> 33:30.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For owners, these steps could be
good business.

33:30.141 --> 33:36.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMRAJ ACHARYA: Giving them
incentive in terms
of access to loans, and there is
helping them

33:36.147 --> 33:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to improve their quality of
bricks, and then,
when there is a bidding process,
we are talking

33:41.586 --> 33:43.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the government.

33:43.288 --> 33:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So you would
want the
government to procure bricks,
when it buys

33:46.391 --> 33:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bricks, from operators who are
certified as
not employing children and
improving conditions?

33:52.163 --> 33:56.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMRAJ ACHARYA: Absolutely. Yes,
that is one
of the -- the major point of
this program.

33:56.568 --> 34:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: This is one
of 23 kilns
that have so far signed on to
the program.

34:02.507 --> 34:08.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Co-owner Shiva Regmi said he's
happy to improve
conditions for workers, and he
can certainly

34:08.079 --> 34:09.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
use the technical help.

34:09.881 --> 34:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIVA REGMI, Kiln Owner (through
translator):
For every one brick that we
make, two are

34:13.685 --> 34:15.553 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
broken.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Regmi is a
newcomer to
this business -- this kiln is
just a few months

34:18.556 --> 34:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
old -- and he may be more
receptive to the
Better Brick program than
others.

34:23.361 --> 34:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At another facility, the owner
complained
to Acharya that his industry is
being unfairly

34:28.366 --> 34:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
singled out by advocates.

34:30.335 --> 34:35.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We are
giving opportunities
to 400,000 people who work in
our industry,

34:35.941 --> 34:40.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we don't ask their children
to work. People
are spreading rumors that we are
hiring children,

34:40.845 --> 34:42.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but that's not true.

34:42.714 --> 34:46.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Many owners
can technically
make that claim, Acharya says,
because their

34:46.484 --> 34:53.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contracts are with adults. It's
parents who
press their children into
service.

34:53.825 --> 34:59.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there's the murkier world
of subcontractors
who provide laborers, many of
them children

34:59.130 --> 35:04.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are not with their families
brought here
under various arrangements by
labor agents

35:04.169 --> 35:09.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or traffickers. It was quite
common to see
young boys loading and herding
the steady

35:09.541 --> 35:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
train of work animals that carry
raw bricks
to the kilns.

35:13.712 --> 35:18.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was more difficult to talk to
them. In
a strange twist, children here,
like many

35:18.183 --> 35:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other places, are told not to
talk to strangers.
I did manage one fleeting
conversation with

35:24.422 --> 35:26.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this young man.

35:26.458 --> 35:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"I had to leave school because
my mom and
dad weren't earning," he said,
"so I went

35:31.730 --> 35:32.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to work."

35:32.597 --> 35:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"How did you get this job?" I
asked.

35:35.834 --> 35:38.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"A rich man from our village
brought me here,"
he said.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How many others accompanied him?

35:41.806 --> 35:45.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Oh, there are many," he said.
"All these
guys are from my village."

35:45.577 --> 35:49.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Do you get any time to play?" I
asked.

35:49.547 --> 35:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"I do not play," he said.

35:52.617 --> 35:59.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And no more time for a stranger.
His is just
one anonymous story of thousands
in an underground

35:59.524 --> 36:05.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
labyrinth that preys on poverty
and illiteracy,
one Nepal's government admits it
has few resources

36:05.897 --> 36:07.699 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to police.

36:07.732 --> 36:13.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Homraj Acharya sees a tiny
silver lining.
Reconstruction will soon get
into high gear

36:13.905 --> 36:17.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a windfall of foreign aid.
And, here,
he sees leverage.

36:17.442 --> 36:22.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOMRAJ ACHARYA: Four billion has
already been
pledged by different countries.
And we want

36:22.380 --> 36:28.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make sure that all of those
countries who
are giving money to Nepalese
government do

36:28.720 --> 36:32.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- we want them to use the
bricks that are
produced child-labor-free.

36:32.957 --> 36:38.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He says
Nepal's builders
association has agreed to buy
bricks from

36:38.229 --> 36:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kilns his program has certified
as free of
child labor, where they're
available.

36:44.369 --> 36:49.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems more likely the
Moktan family's
bricks will be free of child
labor, especially

36:49.207 --> 36:53.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after our interview, when I
asked sixth-grader
Ritika what her favorite subject
was.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GIRL: English.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: When you
grow up, what
kind of work would you like to
do?

36:58.483 --> 37:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GIRL: I would like to be a
doctor.

37:02.387 --> 37:06.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Doctor. Why?

37:06.291 --> 37:09.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GIRL: Because I want to help the
poor people.

37:09.894 --> 37:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Two short,
hesitant sentences,
but to her parents, she'd moved
a mountain,

37:15.667 --> 37:17.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and she'd moved them to tears.

37:17.869 --> 37:22.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TILOOK MOKTAN (through
translator): I'm really
proud that she was able to speak
to you in

37:22.740 --> 37:23.942 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
English.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): They
are tears
of happiness.

37:26.010 --> 37:30.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TILOOK MOKTAN (through
translator): We will
work as hard as we possibly can
to see that

37:30.582 --> 37:32.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she completes her education.

37:32.450 --> 37:36.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
this is Fred de Sam Lazaro in
Nepal's Kathmandu

37:36.654 --> 37:38.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

37:38.490 --> 37:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Fred's report was

the Pulitzer Center on Crisis
Reporting and

37:42.727 --> 37:47.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a partnership with the

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: how NASA is
trying to
fight fire with fire in space.

38:10.822 --> 38:14.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers are conducting new
experiments
that would limit that particular
danger for

38:14.993 --> 38:16.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
future space travel.

38:16.961 --> 38:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien has the
story. It's part of our weekly
series on the

38:21.432 --> 38:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Leading Edge of science and
technology.

38:23.801 --> 38:30.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN GRUNSFELD, NASA: We are
crossing an international
boundary. We are on the U.S.
side now, and

38:31.009 --> 38:34.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now we are on the Russian Mir
space station.

38:34.379 --> 38:40.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: By 1997, the
Russian space
station Mir was 11 years old and
showing its

38:40.185 --> 38:45.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
age. During the fifth shuttle
mission to the
station, astronaut John
Grunsfeld documented

38:45.823 --> 38:51.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the warren of modules brimming
with a disorienting
maze of cables, hoses and trash.

38:51.963 --> 38:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN GRUNSFELD: I feel like I am
exploring
a cave.

38:54.799 --> 38:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Can you imagine
being in a
fire here?

38:58.203 --> 39:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. astronaut Jerry Linenger
lived that nightmare
on February 23, 1997.

39:03.107 --> 39:10.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY LINENGER, NASA: The fire
was basically
in this region here with the
flames shooting

39:10.281 --> 39:12.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
across this way.

39:12.083 --> 39:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The source was a
canister filled
with chemicals designed to
generate oxygen.

39:15.420 --> 39:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY LINENGER: You have got a
two- or three-foot
flame, blowtorch-like in
intensity, sparks

39:21.025 --> 39:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flying off the end of it. It
looks like a
hundred sparklers all at once.

39:23.928 --> 39:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Linenger and his
Russian crewmates
donned masks and frantically
fought the fire.

39:29.000 --> 39:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY LINENGER: The fire took
about 14 minutes
total, and 14 minutes is a long
time with

39:34.672 --> 39:40.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a roaring fire and a blackout
from the smoke,
and no place to go. And if it
were any bigger,

39:40.511 --> 39:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm pretty darn sure we would
have lost that
spacecraft.

39:42.981 --> 39:46.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: For NASA
scientists and engineers,
it was a big wakeup call.

39:46.618 --> 39:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY RUFF, NASA Glenn Research
Center: One
of the things that you learn is,
we really

39:49.654 --> 39:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
didn't have a way to put that
fire out.

39:51.890 --> 39:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Gary Ruff is a
scientist at
NASA's Glenn Research Center in
Cleveland,

39:57.929 --> 40:03.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ohio. This is where the agency
does most of
its research on fires in the
weightless environment

40:03.234 --> 40:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of space called microgravity.

40:05.336 --> 40:11.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY RUFF: They used water foam
fire extinguishers
that they had, but that probably
at most just

40:11.609 --> 40:14.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of cooled everything else
around it and
kept it from spreading.

40:14.779 --> 40:21.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ruff leads a team
that is trying
to learn more about big fires in
space. So,

40:21.452 --> 40:25.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the plan is to deliberately set
one and watch
what happens, really.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, so what are we
looking at here,
David?

40:27.392 --> 40:29.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID URBAN, NASA: This is the
Saffire-III
module.

40:29.460 --> 40:34.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: David Urban is
the principal
investigator for the Spacecraft
Fire Experiment,

40:34.932 --> 40:36.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or Saffire.

40:36.901 --> 40:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spoke beside Saffire-III,
slated for launch
at the end of 2016. The one
currently in space,

40:43.574 --> 40:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saffire-I, is an identical box
strapped inside
a cargo ship. Once the craft
makes its delivery,

40:50.381 --> 40:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
departs and is a safe distance
from the International
Space Station, it will be time
to light the

40:55.553 --> 40:58.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fire inside Saffire.

40:58.256 --> 41:00.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fire on a spacecraft is a pretty
scary thing,
isn't it?

41:00.158 --> 41:03.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID URBAN: It's a very small
space. What
you would normally tolerate in
your house

41:03.628 --> 41:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are completely non-tolerable in
a spacecraft.

41:05.530 --> 41:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: NASA's most
painful fire lesson
came in 1967, when three
astronauts were killed

41:11.936 --> 41:19.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during a countdown test on the
launchpad in
Florida. It prompted a lot of
changes in spacecraft

41:19.277 --> 41:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
designs. The agency took great
pains to eliminate
flammable materials wherever
possible.

41:25.450 --> 41:28.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But fires in microgravity are
harder to predict.

41:28.486 --> 41:32.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of unanswered questions
about fires
in microgravity, right?

41:32.223 --> 41:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID URBAN: A huge number.
Basically, we
don't really know how fast they
will grow

41:35.960 --> 41:41.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or how large they will get, nor
do we really
understand, given the way the
spacecraft are

41:41.132 --> 41:45.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
built, how quickly that
temperature and pressure
rise will be a problem for the
crew.

41:45.370 --> 41:50.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: On the ground,
when you light
a candle, the heat of the flame
melts the

41:50.908 --> 41:56.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wax. It pulls up into the wick.
It vaporizes,
and that is what fuels the
flame.

41:56.681 --> 42:02.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So if gravity is pushing
everything downward,
what is it that makes a flame go
upwards?

42:02.286 --> 42:08.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, as it turns out, the flame
is surrounded
by higher-pressure air. And
gravity is pulling

42:08.259 --> 42:13.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down colder, denser air, meaning
there is
more pressure at the base of the
flame. That's

42:13.631 --> 42:20.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what causes the flame to go up.
It's buoyancy.
It's the same thing that keeps a
boat afloat.

42:20.505 --> 42:26.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In space, when the gravity meter
reads zero,
the cool, dense air no longer
flows downward.

42:26.344 --> 42:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, the air puts equal
pressure on the
flame from all directions. The
end result?

42:32.183 --> 42:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Candle flames in space are
spherical. Over
the years, NASA has conducted
several combustion

42:37.855 --> 42:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experiments on small samples of
paper, cloth,
plastics and hydrocarbons in
special chambers

42:44.395 --> 42:46.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Skylab, the space shuttle and
station.

42:46.964 --> 42:51.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID URBAN: But they have all
been really
small. And so one of the open
questions that

42:51.035 --> 42:53.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have got is how large that
flame can get.

42:53.237 --> 42:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: During the
Saffire-I test,
they will set fire to a piece of
cloth just

42:57.675 --> 43:03.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like this. It's 75 percent
cotton, the rest
fiberglass to give it strength.

43:03.581 --> 43:08.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will analyze the fire with
sensors that
measure temperature, airflow,
velocity, carbon

43:08.719 --> 43:15.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dioxide, and oxygen. But their
main instrument
will be two cameras and some
controlled lighting.

The images in the data will be
beamed back
to Earth. When the experiment is
done, the

43:20.231 --> 43:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cargo ship will be will be
guided to its own
fiery end over the South
Pacific.

The Saffire team is planning
three more experiments,
for a total of six. The fires
will grow larger,

43:32.443 --> 43:36.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
eventually simulating a
full-fledged spacecraft
fire scenario.

GARY RUFF: Since we're going to
release the
gases into the cabin, we want to
have some

43:41.352 --> 43:45.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
material there that the crew
would have to
help clean up after a fire.

43:45.690 --> 43:48.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jerry Linenger
would certainly
not disagree with that.

JERRY LINENGER: Packing up. Time
to head home.

MILES O'BRIEN: Linenger made it
home safe
and sound after all, but by the
skin of his

43:55.766 --> 43:57.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
teeth.

43:57.602 --> 44:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY LINENGER: People say how
brave you were.
I don't know. Bravery, you have
got to have

44:01.305 --> 44:03.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an option. You have got to have
an option
to run.

MILES O'BRIEN: As NASA sets its
sights on
long-duration human missions to
Mars, it really

44:08.713 --> 44:14.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't a question of if there
will be a fire,
just when and how will the crew
be equipped

44:14.485 --> 44:16.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to respond?
