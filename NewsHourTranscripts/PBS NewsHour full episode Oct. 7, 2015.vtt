WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:07.774
HARI SREENIVASAN: Good
evening. I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:07.774 --> 00:11.278
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Gwen
Ifill and Judy Woodruff are on
assignment.

00:11.278 --> 00:17.484
JUDY WOODRUFF: I caught up with
Hillary Clinton in Iowa, where
she disclosed she is against

00:17.484 --> 00:21.622
the massive trade agreement
announced this week by President
Obama. We also talked about

00:21.622 --> 00:25.792
guns, Vladimir Putin
and her e-mails.

00:25.792 --> 00:29.496
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: What I
know about it, as of today, I am
not

00:29.496 --> 00:34.201
in favor of what I
have learned about it.

00:34.201 --> 00:39.406
GWEN IFILL: I'm in Seattle,
where I sit down with two of the
world's biggest philanthropists

00:39.406 --> 00:44.478
and two of the largest voices in
education: Bill and Melinda
Gates.

00:44.478 --> 00:48.015
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus, on a
different stage, recording
artist Josh Groban visits our
studio

00:48.015 --> 00:52.219
to discuss his latest album,
covers of songs from Broadway.

00:52.219 --> 00:56.189
JOSH GROBAN, Musician: There's
the goose bump thing, where the
melody or whatever it is

00:56.189 --> 01:01.028
just gets you and you don't know
why. Sometimes, it's in a genre
that you didn't think you

01:01.028 --> 01:03.764
liked and, all of a sudden, the
song hits you and you just say,
wow, I feel the hairs

01:03.764 --> 01:06.433
on the back of my neck.
I love this song.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.901
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's "PBS
NewsHour."

01:07.901 --> 01:13.707
(BREAK)

01:13.707 --> 01:25.552
HARI SREENIVASAN: In a moment,
Judy's and Gwen's headline
interviews with Hillary Clinton

01:25.552 --> 01:30.123
and Bill and Melinda Gates, but
first the day's news, starting
with Clinton's decision

01:30.123 --> 01:35.362
to oppose the Trans-Pacific
trade agreement. It's her
biggest break yet with President

01:35.362 --> 01:39.533
Obama, but she says the deal
does too much for big drug
companies and not enough to
create

01:39.533 --> 01:42.402
jobs.

01:42.402 --> 01:47.274
Russia sharply escalated its
military campaign in Syria
today, adding missile might to
an

01:47.274 --> 01:54.514
aerial assault. It came in
conjunction with a new ground
offensive. They launched from

01:54.514 --> 01:59.786
Russian warships in the Caspian
Sea, as seen in Russian military
video, 26 medium-range

01:59.786 --> 02:04.224
cruise missiles
streaking toward Syria.

02:04.224 --> 02:09.296
Russian animation showed the
missiles flew more than 900
miles, crossing Iran and Iraq,

02:09.296 --> 02:15.635
aimed at targets in Raqqa and
Aleppo provinces, plus Idlib
province to the northwest.
Amateur

02:15.635 --> 02:18.872
video appeared to show some of
the missile strikes were timed
to coincide with a Syrian

02:18.872 --> 02:23.343
ground assault in Idlib
and Hama provinces.

02:23.343 --> 02:26.747
From Moscow, meeting with his
defense minister, President
Vladimir Putin praised the
results.

02:26.747 --> 02:30.217
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
The fact that we have performed

02:30.217 --> 02:36.456
strikes with precision weapons
from the Caspian Sea area to the
distance of 1,500 kilometers

02:36.456 --> 02:40.427
and hit all the planned targets
means good advance preparation
of the military industrial

02:40.427 --> 02:43.663
sector and good
training of the staff.

02:43.663 --> 02:48.201
HARI SREENIVASAN: But plenty of
questions remained about who's
taking the brunt of Russia's

02:48.201 --> 02:52.305
air campaign. Turkish leaders
claimed again today the real
targets are moderate rebels

02:52.305 --> 02:54.875
fighting the Assad government.

02:54.875 --> 02:58.378
AHMET DAVUTOGLU, Turkish Prime
Minister (through translator):
These airstrikes are not carried

02:58.378 --> 03:03.050
out against the Islamic State.
Russian air forces carried out
57 airstrikes, and according

03:03.050 --> 03:07.187
to the information we received,
only two of these airstrikes are
against Islamic State.

03:07.187 --> 03:11.091
HARI SREENIVASAN: The head of
one American-trained rebel
faction confirmed that Russian
planes

03:11.091 --> 03:15.595
have bombed his weapons
depots in Aleppo and Homs.

03:15.595 --> 03:19.399
And in Italy, U.S. Defense
Secretary Ash Carter echoed the
complaint.

03:19.399 --> 03:23.603
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: They continue to hit
targets that are not ISIL.

03:23.603 --> 03:30.177
We believe this is a fundamental
mistake. Despite what the
Russians say, we have not

03:30.177 --> 03:34.881
agreed to cooperate with Russia,
so long as they continue to
pursue a mistaken strategy

03:34.881 --> 03:37.717
and hit these targets.

03:37.717 --> 03:41.555
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
Russia's military buildup in the
Eastern Mediterranean has
escalated

03:41.555 --> 03:45.225
over the last week, now
including 10 navy ships, a
number described by NATO
officials

03:45.225 --> 03:48.728
as out of the ordinary.

03:48.728 --> 03:54.167
A rebel group supported by the
U.S. says Russian soldiers are
taking part in the Syrian ground

03:54.167 --> 03:58.905
offensive. The Russians deny
sending in any ground troops.

03:58.905 --> 04:03.743
There's word the FBI has foiled
repeated attempts in Eastern
Europe to smuggle radioactive
material

04:03.743 --> 04:08.482
to Middle Eastern extremists.
The Associated Press reported
the findings today. It cited

04:08.482 --> 04:13.520
four incidents in the past five
years, the latest in February
involving gangs with suspected

04:13.520 --> 04:19.526
Russian ties. In that case, a
smuggler sought a buyer from the
Islamic State group.

04:19.526 --> 04:23.430
President Obama apologized today
for a deadly airstrike in
Kunduz, Afghanistan. Last
Friday's

04:23.430 --> 04:28.568
attack killed at least 22 people
at a hospital run by Doctors
Without Borders. Mr. Obama

04:28.568 --> 04:30.704
telephoned the group's
president today.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.573
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: He believed that it
was appropriate for the

04:33.573 --> 04:37.644
United States to do what we have
done before, which is to
acknowledge that a mistake had

04:37.644 --> 04:47.354
been made, to offer an apology,
to do so in a transparent way,
to own up to our mistakes,

04:47.354 --> 04:52.492
and to vow to carry out a full
investigation of to get to the
bottom of what exactly happened,

04:52.492 --> 04:54.961
so that we can learn
from this incident.

04:54.961 --> 04:58.298
HARI SREENIVASAN: Doctors
Without Borders has called for
an independent investigation,

04:58.298 --> 05:02.369
but the White House says the
president didn't directly
address that demand today.

05:02.369 --> 05:08.041
A defense bill worth $612
billion is headed to the
president's desk, despite a veto
threat.

05:08.041 --> 05:15.382
The Senate approved it today
70-27, enough to override a
veto. It already has passed

05:15.382 --> 05:19.586
in the House. The president
objects to the way Congress
provided the money by padding

05:19.586 --> 05:25.258
a war-fighting account and
denying new money for domestic
agencies.

05:25.258 --> 05:29.763
France and Germany joined forces
today, urging the European Union
not to fracture under the

05:29.763 --> 05:34.067
strain of debt and refugees.
French President Francois
Hollande and German Chancellor
Angela

05:34.067 --> 05:37.837
Merkel appeared before the
European Parliament, and
Hollande warned against
returning to go-it-alone

05:37.837 --> 05:40.006
nationalism.

05:40.006 --> 05:46.613
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through translator):
Focusing on sovereign interest

05:46.613 --> 05:51.284
is a road to decline and it's
also dangerous not to give a
people hope, not to build
anything

05:51.284 --> 05:55.755
together, but to turn in on each
other, without any future. Faced
with these trials, I am

05:55.755 --> 05:59.726
convinced that if we don't go
further, it will be the end of
the European project.

05:59.726 --> 06:04.264
HARI SREENIVASAN: For her part,
Merkel said Europe faces a test
of historic proportions.

06:04.264 --> 06:08.401
The flood disaster in South
Carolina surged toward the coast
today. One swollen river

06:08.401 --> 06:13.139
crested at record levels in
Kingstree, and Conway and
Georgetown braced for bad news

06:13.139 --> 06:18.478
as well. Back around Columbia,
crews worked to shore up the
52-year-old Beaver Dam. But

06:18.478 --> 06:23.283
the governor rejected criticism
that many of the state's dams
have fallen into disrepair.

06:23.283 --> 06:26.987
GOV. NIKKI HALEY (R), South
Carolina: You have got a
1,000-year flood. And out of
thousands

06:26.987 --> 06:32.792
of dams, right now, we're
watching 62 of them; 13 have
failed. Look at the proportion
of

06:32.792 --> 06:39.165
that. And even of the ones
they're working on, when you
have floods of this magnitude,

06:39.165 --> 06:42.969
it is really amazing that we
have not had more issues than we
have had.

06:42.969 --> 06:47.107
HARI SREENIVASAN: More than 400
roads and bridges are also being
checked and remain

06:47.107 --> 06:52.312
closed for now. Long-distance
traffic on part of Interstate 95
is having to make a 170-mile

06:52.312 --> 06:54.514
detour.

06:54.514 --> 06:59.619
Authorities in Roseburg, Oregon,
have issued a detailed new
account on how a gunman died

06:59.619 --> 07:03.857
after killing nine people at a
community college. They say
Chris Harper Mercer was wounded
by

07:03.857 --> 07:09.029
police, then shot himself in a
classroom in front of his dead
and wounded victims.

07:09.029 --> 07:13.667
Meanwhile, "People" magazine is
publishing the names and phone
numbers of every member

07:13.667 --> 07:19.072
of Congress in an effort to
encourage action to decrease gun
violence.

07:19.072 --> 07:23.076
The Nobel Prize for Chemistry
was presented today to three
scientists who discovered how

07:23.076 --> 07:29.683
the human body repairs its own
DNA. The honorees are Tomas
Lindahl of Sweden, Aziz Sancar
of

07:29.683 --> 07:33.720
Turkey and American Paul
Modrich. Nobel officials say
their research is leading to new
treatments

07:33.720 --> 07:36.990
for cancer and other diseases.

07:36.990 --> 07:40.894
GUNNAR VON HEIJNE, Nobel
Committee for Chemistry: It is
based on the idea that cancer
cells

07:40.894 --> 07:46.566
already have kind of a weakened
DNA repair system. So then if
you can come in with a

07:46.566 --> 07:54.341
drug that makes the DNA repair
systems even less functional,
the cancer cells will really

07:54.341 --> 07:59.346
go bad, because they cannot
repair at all their DNA anymore.
And very quickly, this

07:59.346 --> 08:03.083
will degrade the DNA and the
cancer cells cannot survive.

08:03.083 --> 08:06.252
HARI SREENIVASAN: Scientists
estimate human DNA is damaged
daily by everything from solar

08:06.252 --> 08:10.790
radiation to cigarette
smoke to pollution.

08:10.790 --> 08:14.761
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average gained more
than 120 points to close at
16912.

08:14.761 --> 08:22.102
The Nasdaq rose more than 40
points, and the S&P 500 added
16.

08:22.102 --> 08:27.574
And there's more fallout from
claims of insider trading at
fantasy sports Web sites. The
industry

08:27.574 --> 08:31.845
leaders, FanDuel and DraftKings,
said today they are banning all
employees from playing

08:31.845 --> 08:36.783
any such daily games for money.
There've been allegations that
an employee at DraftKings

08:36.783 --> 08:44.924
had unfair access to special
data, before winning $350,000 in
a FanDuel contest.

08:44.924 --> 08:48.995
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Judy's interview with Hillary
Clinton; Gwen's discussions with

08:48.995 --> 08:59.973
Bill and Melinda Gates;
recording artist Josh Groban on
his latest album, and much more.

08:59.973 --> 09:12.652
The Clintons have had a tough
time in Iowa. Candidate Bill
Clinton lost the Democratic

09:12.652 --> 09:19.759
caucuses here in 1992. Hillary
Clinton lost to Barack Obama in
2008.

09:19.759 --> 09:24.898
This time around, she's spending
a lot of time in the Hawkeye
State, today with students

09:24.898 --> 09:28.535
a town hall meeting at Cornell
College in Mount Vernon.

09:28.535 --> 09:32.472
And that's where I caught
up with her this afternoon.

09:32.472 --> 09:35.308
Secretary Hillary Clinton,
thank you for talking with us.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.010
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: Thank
you so much, Judy. I'm glad to
see you.

09:37.010 --> 09:40.847
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's start
with the big announcement from
President Obama this week

09:40.847 --> 09:45.585
about a trade deal, the
Trans-Pacific Partnership, the
U.S. and 11 other countries,
covering

09:45.585 --> 09:51.157
40 percent of the global
economy, 800 million consumers.

09:51.157 --> 09:54.093
It's already started a big
battle between people who love
free trade and people who

09:54.093 --> 09:55.929
care more about protectionism.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.764
Where do you come down?

09:57.764 --> 10:02.836
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I
have said from the very
beginning that we had to have

10:02.836 --> 10:07.373
a trade agreement that would
create good American jobs, raise
wages, and advance our national

10:07.373 --> 10:10.143
security.

10:10.143 --> 10:16.182
And I still believe that's the
high bar we have to meet. I have
been trying to learn

10:16.182 --> 10:22.755
as much as I can about the
agreement, but I am worried. I'm
worried about currency
manipulation

10:22.755 --> 10:28.027
not being part of the agreement.
We've lost American jobs to the
manipulations that countries,

10:28.027 --> 10:31.231
particularly in Asia,
have engaged in.

10:31.231 --> 10:37.770
I'm worried that the
pharmaceutical companies may
have gotten more benefits, and
patients

10:37.770 --> 10:43.877
and consumers fewer. I think
that there are still a lot of
unanswered questions. Sometimes,

10:43.877 --> 10:50.283
they look great on paper. I
know, when President Obama came
into office, he inherited a
trade

10:50.283 --> 10:54.821
agreement with South Korea. I,
along with other members of the
Cabinet, pushed hard

10:54.821 --> 10:59.025
to get a better agreement. We
think we made improvements.

10:59.025 --> 11:02.929
Now, looking back on it, it
doesn't have the results we
thought it would have, in terms

11:02.929 --> 11:06.332
of access to the markets,
more exports, et cetera.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.535
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you
saying that, as of today, this
is not something you could

11:08.535 --> 11:10.103
support?

11:10.103 --> 11:14.741
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: What I
know about it, as of today, I am
not in favor of what

11:14.741 --> 11:17.410
I have learned about it.

11:17.410 --> 11:22.215
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is President
Obama wrong? He is vigorously
defending this. He's saying

11:22.215 --> 11:26.586
that it does protect jobs. He
says that, when it comes to
worrying about jobs, that
automation

11:26.586 --> 11:30.890
and technology are more
responsible than trade
agreements.

11:30.890 --> 11:36.629
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Look, I
think the president has been
extraordinarily effective

11:36.629 --> 11:41.834
in making as strong a
case as could be made.

11:41.834 --> 11:46.739
But I do worry that we have got
an equation here. How do we
raise incomes in America?

11:46.739 --> 11:51.210
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just quickly,
if this agreement is rejected,
Asia experts are saying, this

11:51.210 --> 11:56.382
is going to influence -- it's
going to decrease the influence
of the U.S. in Asia, it is going

11:56.382 --> 12:01.487
to give a boost to China, which
is trying to become more
dominant. And doesn't it
conflict

12:01.487 --> 12:05.992
with your pivot to Asia when
you were secretary of state?

12:05.992 --> 12:10.563
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I don't
think so, because the best way
that we can exercise

12:10.563 --> 12:16.169
influence in Asia is to remain
the world's strongest economy
here at home.

12:16.169 --> 12:20.006
And that means we have to have
more middle-class jobs, more
people being in the middle
class,

12:20.006 --> 12:24.644
more people being able to get
into the middle class. And we
haven't looked at this from

12:24.644 --> 12:28.147
a competitive perspective,
because the Republicans have
stood in the way.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.916
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned the
middle class. You have said you
would favor middle-class

12:29.916 --> 12:32.485
tax cuts.

12:32.485 --> 12:36.322
My question is, would yours be
bigger or smaller than what the
Republicans have put out there?

12:36.322 --> 12:39.025
Donald Trump is out there with a
plan. Jeb Bush is out there with
a plan. What would

12:39.025 --> 12:41.361
yours look like?

12:41.361 --> 12:45.865
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I
want to have families be able to
invest in what they tell

12:45.865 --> 12:51.771
me they care about. How do they
pay for child care? How do they
pay for college? How do

12:51.771 --> 12:55.908
they pay the daily expenses of
health care and the other things
that are really straining

12:55.908 --> 12:58.244
the family budget?

12:58.244 --> 13:03.282
I have looked at the plans
produced on the other side by
Donald Trump, by Jeb Bush and

13:03.282 --> 13:07.887
others. They would explode the
deficit. And, once again, they
are so tilted toward the

13:07.887 --> 13:11.290
rich, it's embarrassing. And
we know that doesn't work.

13:11.290 --> 13:17.196
So, when I roll out my tax plan,
it is very much focused and
targeted on the middle class.

13:17.196 --> 13:23.369
JUDY WOODRUFF: Your private
e-mail server. The Washington
Post fact-checker, Glenn
Kessler,

13:23.369 --> 13:29.542
wrote this weekend that when you
speak publicly about how you
handle the disclosure requests,

13:29.542 --> 13:34.313
you don't include the fact that
the first request came just to
you from the State Department

13:34.313 --> 13:36.516
based on the
congressional inquiry.

13:36.516 --> 13:42.555
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, my
understanding of what happened
is that the State Department

13:42.555 --> 13:51.030
had e-mails that they gave to
the committee that was formed,
we now know, to politically,

13:51.030 --> 13:55.968
in a partisan way, go after me,
not investigate what happened in
Benghazi, and that we had

13:55.968 --> 13:59.906
already provided those e-mails
because they were already on the
State.gov system.

13:59.906 --> 14:05.445
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the first
request came to you alone in
response to the committee.

14:05.445 --> 14:09.816
And I guess Glenn Kessler's
point is that this was the
indication that the State
Department

14:09.816 --> 14:13.820
didn't realize before that, that
you were conducting government
business on your -- solely

14:13.820 --> 14:16.055
on your private server.

14:16.055 --> 14:20.326
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I
e-mailed with hundreds of people
in the State Department, across

14:20.326 --> 14:25.064
the government, some even in the
Congress, and so that is just
not credible.

14:25.064 --> 14:29.035
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why wouldn't it
have been better at the very
beginning of all this to simply

14:29.035 --> 14:34.774
say, I did this, I wanted a
private server because I have
been through this kind of thing

14:34.774 --> 14:37.376
before, I didn't want Republican
congressmen rifling through my
personal e-mails?

14:37.376 --> 14:39.445
HILLARY RODHAM
CLINTON: That's...

14:39.445 --> 14:42.048
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wouldn't that
have done away with the
controversy, done away with
people

14:42.048 --> 14:45.017
now saying they don't trust you?

14:45.017 --> 14:47.987
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
all I can tell you, Judy, is
that that's not what happened.

14:47.987 --> 14:54.227
I didn't give any thought to it.
I had used my own e-mail. I got
into the State Department's.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.330
It was allowed. I did it for
convenience. My husband already
had a system. I just added

14:57.330 --> 14:59.999
on to the system. Now,
that's what happened.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.668
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have
commented on what Kevin McCarthy
said about the political nature

15:02.668 --> 15:04.570
of this committee.

15:04.570 --> 15:09.742
But what do you expect from
Chairman Trey Gowdy when those
hearings get under way on

15:09.742 --> 15:11.344
October 22?

15:11.344 --> 15:13.513
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I
don't know what to expect.

15:13.513 --> 15:18.518
I do know that it's pretty much
pulled the curtain back, that
this was set up to be a

15:18.518 --> 15:23.623
political partisan attack on me.
Of course, you know, that
probably is something we could

15:23.623 --> 15:28.027
have concluded earlier, since
there had already been seven
investigations. And now we see

15:28.027 --> 15:32.198
the Congress setting up a
special committee to look into
Planned Parenthood.

15:32.198 --> 15:37.303
It's really sad to me that,
whether it's women's health, or,
in this case, the death of four

15:37.303 --> 15:42.675
Americans serving our country,
that the Republicans in Congress
try to partisanize and exploit

15:42.675 --> 15:45.344
these events.

15:45.344 --> 15:50.116
JUDY WOODRUFF: Something else in
foreign policy, Syria, you came
out and have said you would

15:50.116 --> 15:56.255
favor the idea of a no-fly -- of
setting up a no-fly zone to
protect refugees and others.

15:56.255 --> 16:00.560
But, in talking to experts, they
say, in order to do that, you
would have to take out Syria's

16:00.560 --> 16:06.065
air defenses, most of which --
or at least much of which are in
urban areas. In other

16:06.065 --> 16:10.837
words, you would have to go into
an area, risk huge civilian
casualties, in order to

16:10.837 --> 16:12.705
set up this no-fly zone.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.741
Is that something you're
prepared to take on?

16:15.741 --> 16:17.376
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
there are different parts of the
countries with different levels

16:17.376 --> 16:21.113
remaining of air defense.

16:21.113 --> 16:24.684
What I want to do is to see if
we can't get a coalition of all
the countries that have

16:24.684 --> 16:29.689
a stake in this, including the
Russians, to agree on three
things. One, we have to do

16:29.689 --> 16:34.694
as much as possible to end the
conflict. We have to stop the
refugee flow by helping people

16:34.694 --> 16:40.633
have a safe space to stay in and
to get supplies, medical and
food and other things. And we

16:40.633 --> 16:43.436
have to begin the process
of a political transition.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.706
JUDY WOODRUFF: Would you be
prepared to shoot down Russian
planes if they flew into this

16:46.706 --> 16:48.374
no-fly area?

16:48.374 --> 16:53.546
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: No, the
point is to have the leverage of
this discussion.

16:53.546 --> 16:58.217
The Russians have already
invaded Turkish airspace. Turkey
is a NATO ally. They are

16:58.217 --> 17:03.222
now on notice if they invade the
airspace of a NATO ally, there
will be actions taken.

17:03.222 --> 17:05.358
This is in the absence
of a no-fly zone.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.493
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do
you mean actions taken?

17:07.493 --> 17:10.963
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
they have been put on notice, as
I understand it, from NATO.

17:10.963 --> 17:15.935
Turkey sent up fighters. That's
a pretty strong sense of notice,
that, Russia, get out of

17:15.935 --> 17:18.838
our airspace.

17:18.838 --> 17:24.243
So, we need to send a clear
message to Russia. They are
going after those who oppose
Assad,

17:24.243 --> 17:29.649
under the guise of going after
ISIS, which is the common enemy
of everyone. And we need

17:29.649 --> 17:33.686
to begin to push back on them,
so that they don't engage in
behavior that invades Turkish

17:33.686 --> 17:36.355
airspace.

17:36.355 --> 17:40.993
And that's why I think it's
absolutely imperative that
Secretary Kerry begin immediate
talks

17:40.993 --> 17:44.964
with everybody at the table to
try to, as they say, deconflict
the airspace and put

17:44.964 --> 17:47.300
the Russians on notice.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.870
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have dealt
President Putin. You favored the
so-called reset with Russia

17:50.870 --> 17:53.039
in 2009.

17:53.039 --> 18:00.379
My question, is did you and
others in the administration
misread Putin and underestimate

18:00.379 --> 18:03.449
what he was capable of doing?

18:03.449 --> 18:06.652
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
remember, when President Obama
came into office, Putin was

18:06.652 --> 18:11.857
not president. Medvedev was
president. And Medvedev turned
out to be a good partner.

18:11.857 --> 18:13.626
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Putin was
always in the background.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.963
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, he
was, but he was letting Medvedev
make the decisions,

18:16.963 --> 18:19.865
backed up by him.

18:19.865 --> 18:25.171
Now, when Putin decided in the
fall of 2011 that he wanted to
go back and be president,

18:25.171 --> 18:31.243
and basically announced it, we
knew that we were going to have
a lot tougher time, because

18:31.243 --> 18:35.247
he was taking back the
presidency to assert himself
and, therefore, assert Russia.

18:35.247 --> 18:37.984
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, doesn't that
add up to misreading what was
going on?

18:37.984 --> 18:40.586
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: No,
I don't think so at all.

18:40.586 --> 18:48.227
When we dealt in 2009, 2010, and
the first part of 2011 with the
Russian government,

18:48.227 --> 18:53.532
sitting across from Medvedev in
many meetings, we got results.
Putin comes back, of course

18:53.532 --> 18:57.703
you have to readjust, because
he's coming back with an agenda.

18:57.703 --> 19:03.075
It's an ongoing challenge,
because of the way he behaves
and how he basically wants

19:03.075 --> 19:06.645
to, you know, push the
boundaries in Europe and now in
the Middle East.

19:06.645 --> 19:10.116
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me bring you
back home to the subject of guns
and gun control and

19:10.116 --> 19:11.984
the aftermath of this terrible
shooting at the community
college in Oregon.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.552
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Right.

19:13.552 --> 19:16.655
JUDY WOODRUFF: This week, you
came out for tightening controls
on guns and you talked

19:16.655 --> 19:20.426
about what you would
do differently.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.362
Is this really laying out the
defining difference between you
and Senator Sanders when it
comes

19:23.362 --> 19:25.698
to gun control?

19:25.698 --> 19:29.602
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
look, I think -- this is
something I care passionately
about.

19:29.602 --> 19:34.373
I have been -- I have spoken out
and tried to work on this for
more than 20 years. I

19:34.373 --> 19:37.543
have a record. I'm going to
defend my record. I will let
others speak to their records.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.546
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you saying
that's a contrast with Senator
Sanders?

19:40.546 --> 19:43.983
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I'm
saying, this is my position. And
others will state their
positions.

19:43.983 --> 19:47.853
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have said
that the super PAC that is out
there supporting you, at least

19:47.853 --> 19:52.458
one of them, that they're there
really to criticize Republicans.

19:52.458 --> 19:56.729
But one of the PACs that is
supporting you is now attacking
Senator Sanders. I guess

19:56.729 --> 20:00.232
my question is, is, do you
approve of this, of going after
Senator Sanders by the super

20:00.232 --> 20:02.601
PAC? We know there
is coordination.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.870
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I
don't know anything about what
you're saying. I have

20:04.870 --> 20:08.140
no knowledge of
what they're doing.

20:08.140 --> 20:13.312
I have said I want anybody
supporting me to go after
Republicans, because, whatever
differences

20:13.312 --> 20:18.017
we might have on the Democratic
side, they pale in comparison to
the really substantive

20:18.017 --> 20:20.719
differences we have
with the Republicans.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.889
JUDY WOODRUFF: Would you call on
them to cease and desist and
stop criticizing Senator...

20:23.889 --> 20:26.892
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I have
just said I want them to -- I
want people who support

20:26.892 --> 20:29.261
me to go after Republicans.
That's what I have -- I have
said it before. I'm saying

20:29.261 --> 20:31.797
it again on this show.

20:31.797 --> 20:37.570
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and just
continuing in that vein, the
David Brock group, it's been

20:37.570 --> 20:43.209
reported this week in "New York
Magazine," is digging through
Vice President Biden's

20:43.209 --> 20:49.782
past, his record, so-called
opposition research. My question
is, do you approve of this?

20:49.782 --> 20:52.918
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: You
know, I -- first of all, I have
no knowledge of it.

20:52.918 --> 20:58.824
I have been clear. Anybody who
listens to my public statements,
anybody who pays attention

20:58.824 --> 21:02.495
to what I say, I want to give
Vice President Biden whatever
space and time he needs to

21:02.495 --> 21:05.097
make his decision.

21:05.097 --> 21:10.703
Now, if he gets into the
election, then people are going
to be raising questions, just
like

21:10.703 --> 21:14.807
they do about me. That's what
happens when you get into the
arena. But I'm not asking

21:14.807 --> 21:19.879
and I don't approve of anybody
who is supporting me, or say
they support me, to be focusing

21:19.879 --> 21:22.848
on anyone other than
the Republicans.

21:22.848 --> 21:26.352
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, for you to
-- you're saying that you
weren't aware that they were
doing

21:26.352 --> 21:30.022
this and you don't approve of
it, but the fact that they're
doing it, isn't that really

21:30.022 --> 21:33.425
an effort to intimidate the vice
president against getting into
the race?

21:33.425 --> 21:35.494
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Judy, I
have -- I don't know anything
about it. I can't comment

21:35.494 --> 21:38.230
on it any further than I have.

21:38.230 --> 21:44.336
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you believe
that -- Vice President Biden has
made it very clear he's

21:44.336 --> 21:48.841
looking at getting in. How does
it change the race if he gets
in?

21:48.841 --> 21:52.978
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, if
he gets in, I will continue to
speak positively about

21:52.978 --> 21:57.583
him, because I feel that way. We
have been friends a long time.

21:57.583 --> 22:01.921
But I will put forth my
platform, what I want to do, to
build on what President Obama
has

22:01.921 --> 22:06.759
done. And then the Democratic
voters will make their decision.

22:06.759 --> 22:10.162
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary Hillary
Clinton, we thank you very much
for talking with us.

22:10.162 --> 22:13.732
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON:
My pleasure. Thank you.

22:13.732 --> 22:29.515
GWEN IFILL: They have spent $35
billion so far tackling malaria
and AIDS and Ebola abroad.

22:29.515 --> 22:33.285
But here at home, their laser
focus has been on education
reform, which has catapulted

22:33.285 --> 22:36.922
them into the middle of a
2016 political debate.

22:36.922 --> 22:40.626
I sat down today in Seattle
with Bill and Melinda Gates.

22:40.626 --> 22:43.362
Melinda, Bill Gates, thank
you for joining us.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.697
MELINDA GATES, Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation: Thanks for
having us.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.466
GWEN IFILL: For better or worse
this year, education is a
campaign issue. You can say

22:47.466 --> 22:52.371
that is good news, that's bad
news. How do you see it,
Melinda?

22:52.371 --> 22:57.910
MELINDA GATES: I think the fact
that education is part of the
public discourse in an election

22:57.910 --> 23:03.983
year is incredibly important,
because education for us in
America is the bridge to equal
opportunity.

23:03.983 --> 23:07.219
And so, if it's not working for
everybody, we need to be
discussing that as a nation.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.555
So, in that sense, it's
actually a good thing.

23:09.555 --> 23:13.525
GWEN IFILL: But the discussion
is all about Common Core and
about whether standardized

23:13.525 --> 23:18.030
testing, and however you choose
to define Common Core, is the
right idea.

23:18.030 --> 23:22.868
Do you worry that the whole
issue that you have pushed to
support, this idea of raising

23:22.868 --> 23:26.805
achievement through standardized
testing and other ways, do you
worry that politics is

23:26.805 --> 23:29.642
obscuring Common Core arguments?

23:29.642 --> 23:32.278
BILL GATES, Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation: Well, it is
concerning that the facts about

23:32.278 --> 23:36.649
Common Core are often obscured.

23:36.649 --> 23:42.655
The Common Core sets high
standards for what math, reading
and writing kids should learn

23:42.655 --> 23:48.794
in high school, and it helps get
the progression down, so that
even if a kid is moving from

23:48.794 --> 23:55.734
state to state, if they're using
online material, it's all
benchmarked the same way. And if

23:55.734 --> 23:58.937
a kid graduates from high
school, they will know that they
don't have to go and take
remedial

23:58.937 --> 24:01.206
classes.

24:01.206 --> 24:07.646
So, it's a very important
advance. It's a standard that is
allowing for a lot of
innovation,

24:07.646 --> 24:13.952
where people build elements that
connect up to the Common Core.
So, we're seeing great

24:13.952 --> 24:19.091
results. Kentucky was the first
state to go ahead with it.
They're actually the state

24:19.091 --> 24:23.195
that's seen the most improvement
in a lot of their test scores,
and even in their high

24:23.195 --> 24:26.031
school graduation rates.

24:26.031 --> 24:32.037
So, it's rolling out. It's a
foundational piece that will
help improve things.

24:32.037 --> 24:37.209
GWEN IFILL: How did the worm
turn on this debate, from so
many states adopting it so

24:37.209 --> 24:42.147
quickly, to so many people,
especially Republicans, saying,
if you endorse this, it's a
disqualifying

24:42.147 --> 24:43.449
feature?

24:43.449 --> 24:47.252
MELINDA GATES: Well, I think
it's important to look back.

24:47.252 --> 24:52.891
It was the state governors and
the state superintendents who,
in 2006, said, this is right for
each

24:52.891 --> 24:58.263
of our states. This is what we
want, because if these are
standards are set properly, we

24:58.263 --> 25:00.432
know that our kids are on a
learning trajectory to learn
what they need to know to be
part

25:00.432 --> 25:02.801
of the knowledge economy.

25:02.801 --> 25:07.639
So, that's when it was set.
There has been a lot of
political now debate about --
and

25:07.639 --> 25:12.144
people have confounded it with,
is it federal control vs. state
control? No, it's states

25:12.144 --> 25:17.082
who are deciding this. A few
states have actually rolled back
the Common Core, but it's
interesting.

25:17.082 --> 25:20.119
What they have put in, in place
of it is 95 percent the Common
Core. It just is a different

25:20.119 --> 25:22.121
word.

25:22.121 --> 25:26.625
But 42 states and the District
of Columbia are still doing the
Common Core, because they

25:26.625 --> 25:30.062
know it's right. And more
important, quite honestly, than
the political debate that goes

25:30.062 --> 25:33.699
on is what's happening with
teachers in the schools.

25:33.699 --> 25:38.303
When you survey teachers across
the nation whose states have
Common Core in place, they

25:38.303 --> 25:43.375
say, we like it. It's hard to
implement, but we know it's the
right thing for our students.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.612
Our students are learning the
things that they need to learn.

25:46.612 --> 25:50.315
So, they believe in it. And so,
in some ways, the political
discourse just isn't, thank

25:50.315 --> 25:53.552
goodness, trickling down to the
reality of what's happening in
schools.

25:53.552 --> 25:55.754
GWEN IFILL: How have you been
able to -- or have you been able
to measure that these higher

25:55.754 --> 25:58.123
standards have led to
hiring achievement?

25:58.123 --> 26:01.126
MELINDA GATES: Well, so,
Kentucky is a fantastic example.
They're the first state that put

26:01.126 --> 26:05.464
the Common Core into
place statewide.

26:05.464 --> 26:09.835
And what we're seeing is that
their graduation rate has gone
up, and that's incredibly
important.

26:09.835 --> 26:14.640
But even more important is the
college readiness rate. And that
is, before -- before they put

26:14.640 --> 26:18.110
the Common Core standards in, 34
percent of kids who graduated
from their high schools

26:18.110 --> 26:21.213
were actually ready
to go to college.

26:21.213 --> 26:25.918
Today, that number is 62
percent. That means that kids
are going into college and
they're

26:25.918 --> 26:29.788
succeeding. They know they're
ready to go and they're not
having to be remediated and

26:29.788 --> 26:33.692
then dropping out. That is a
profound change in just a few
years.

26:33.692 --> 26:37.629
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
what's happening here in your
hometown of Seattle, where the

26:37.629 --> 26:41.967
-- there was a recent teachers
strike, in part over some of
these issues. And a judge

26:41.967 --> 26:45.804
struck down the charter schools
that were supposed to begin
here.

26:45.804 --> 26:51.243
I wonder whether that -- this
example makes you rethink how
you can sell what it is you

26:51.243 --> 26:52.478
have.

26:52.478 --> 26:57.116
BILL GATES: Well, most states
do have charter schools.

26:57.116 --> 27:03.722
And although only about 5
percent of kids go to those
schools, they have been
laboratories

27:03.722 --> 27:08.060
where a lot of good things have
been learned. For example, this
idea of, how do you give

27:08.060 --> 27:13.665
teachers more feedback, how do
you help teachers get better, a
lot of charter schools really

27:13.665 --> 27:19.171
invested in doing that. And then
-- and we are seeing some of
those now be adopted broadly,

27:19.171 --> 27:22.407
so that all students
can benefit from them.

27:22.407 --> 27:30.749
We are very disappointed that
courts saw that the way that the
charter referendum that the

27:30.749 --> 27:37.022
voters approved, the court said
that the way it was funded was
inappropriate. And so we're

27:37.022 --> 27:41.927
hopeful that charters will be
restored in the state. It's
possible they won't. That

27:41.927 --> 27:45.531
would be a real
disappointment to us.

27:45.531 --> 27:50.602
We're among the people who have
invested. We have got 1,200 kids
in charter schools

27:50.602 --> 27:54.873
whose fate are up in the air.
Some people are trying to get
those defunded, which is

27:54.873 --> 28:01.813
-- for those nine schools that
are in place, you know, that
seems like a bad thing to want

28:01.813 --> 28:05.984
to shut those down.

28:05.984 --> 28:10.822
But we do have charters in most
states, and we think they can be
a place where good learnings

28:10.822 --> 28:13.058
take place.

28:13.058 --> 28:16.194
GWEN IFILL: What about the
students who are opting out of
these tests, especially here

28:16.194 --> 28:20.265
in Seattle, who are just saying,
I don't want to take part in
this, there are too many tests?

28:20.265 --> 28:24.336
MELINDA GATES: Well, I think
you're hearing that from some
students and some parents.

28:24.336 --> 28:27.973
And I think, when new
assessments go in, you have to
say, what assessments are we
taking

28:27.973 --> 28:32.177
out? We have to have
assessments. They are very
important tests to know whether
kids

28:32.177 --> 28:35.614
who are learning what they need
to know against the Common Core
standard, whether in fact

28:35.614 --> 28:38.450
they are learning the material,
so we know by the end of the
year.

28:38.450 --> 28:42.788
But I think some of those are
also myths about the numbers of
kids dropping out. If you look

28:42.788 --> 28:47.292
at Louisiana, they talked about
thousands of kids dropping
ought. It turns out it's

28:47.292 --> 28:51.129
less than 1 percent of the kids
who dropped out of the state
tests. That tells you how

28:51.129 --> 28:54.132
important parents and students
know they actually are.

28:54.132 --> 28:57.636
GWEN IFILL: When you say that
some of the numbers have been
skewed, is that because

28:57.636 --> 29:01.773
teachers who don't want to be
subject to those tests are the
ones driving some of this
unrest?

29:01.773 --> 29:05.844
MELINDA GATES: Well, I think you
get both parents and teachers
who get concerned. I

29:05.844 --> 29:09.748
would be concerned if my child
was tested too many times in the
year.

29:09.748 --> 29:13.218
But I think, sometimes, what
happened with the Common Core
is, it got rolled out. The

29:13.218 --> 29:16.955
standards -- the teachers agreed
with the standards. They
believed in them. But then

29:16.955 --> 29:22.027
the tests came out very quickly
thereafter. And teachers will
tell you, teaching to the

29:22.027 --> 29:26.031
Common Core is hard. They have
to step up their game in the
classroom. And it takes

29:26.031 --> 29:30.335
a while to get that
implementation down. And they
need a few years before the
testing begins.

29:30.335 --> 29:33.672
So there were a few states that,
quite honestly, went too fast
with the tests. And I think

29:33.672 --> 29:34.940
that's where you started to
see some of the pushback.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.143
GWEN IFILL: So, what's the fix?

29:38.143 --> 29:44.149
BILL GATES: Well, in fact, tests
where students are told what
they got wrong, and they use

29:44.149 --> 29:50.789
it as an opportunity to learn
and see, OK, how should this
concept work, tests are a

29:50.789 --> 29:53.992
very good thing done properly.

29:53.992 --> 29:59.164
So, it would be very unfortunate
out of this if people thought,
oh, we shouldn't test students,

29:59.164 --> 30:02.901
we shouldn't test doctors, we
shouldn't test drivers, you
know, tests are kind of this

30:02.901 --> 30:09.074
bad thing. You can make
mistakes, particularly how many
tests do you have that are those

30:09.074 --> 30:17.082
summative tests at the end, how
-- are those really that
beneficial vs. the classroom
time?

30:17.082 --> 30:24.756
But, overall, testing is a
fundamental piece. And it should
be about making them better,

30:24.756 --> 30:28.493
instead of saying, OK, let's
just take the day off.

30:28.493 --> 30:32.998
GWEN IFILL: In the years that
you have been undertaking this
enterprise to fix America's

30:32.998 --> 30:38.670
education system, what would you
say has been the least pleasant
and the most pleasant surprise

30:38.670 --> 30:41.973
that you have picked
up along the way?

30:41.973 --> 30:47.846
BILL GATES: Well, it's always so
encouraging when you go in and
see a great teacher at

30:47.846 --> 30:52.884
work, whether that's in a
charter school or public school,
to see that energy and the

30:52.884 --> 30:56.688
sense of potential those kids
feel when that teacher is not
only educating them, but giving

30:56.688 --> 30:59.324
them confidence.

30:59.324 --> 31:06.231
Then, when we see things that
are designed to help teachers
improve, that are, you know,

31:06.231 --> 31:13.472
pretty good, but there's some
fear about how those systems are
run, when those are shut

31:13.472 --> 31:18.410
down, and teachers aren't
getting any feedback at all,
that's disappointing.

31:18.410 --> 31:23.181
You know, we need to get to a
point where teachers really love
the professional feedback

31:23.181 --> 31:27.319
they're given. And that's a
struggle, to design those
systems, to keep them in place,
until

31:27.319 --> 31:32.090
they get so good that teachers
wouldn't want to live without
them.

31:32.090 --> 31:35.961
MELINDA GATES: I think the most
encouraging thing is, yes, when
you see great teaching

31:35.961 --> 31:39.965
happen in the classroom, and we
see great teachers across the
nation.

31:39.965 --> 31:44.002
And I think it's encouraging
when you hear from the kids what
a difference their teacher

31:44.002 --> 31:49.207
makes to them, and they say,
this person believed in me. This
person helped me with my work.

31:49.207 --> 31:52.878
It was hard. It wasn't easy. But
he or she believed in me. And
they helped me know that

31:52.878 --> 31:55.414
I could do this.

31:55.414 --> 31:59.584
When you hear that, and you hear
it from kids across the nation,
no matter where they're

31:59.584 --> 32:03.955
from, you say, wow, that's
encouraging. We know it's
possible. We know great teaching

32:03.955 --> 32:08.360
happens and is possible. Let's
figure out how to make sure that
all teachers can be

32:08.360 --> 32:11.329
fantastic teachers and get the
feedback they need, so they keep
improving at their craft.

32:11.329 --> 32:13.064
And that's exciting.

32:13.064 --> 32:16.168
GWEN IFILL: Melinda Gates, Bill
Gates, thank you both very much.

32:16.168 --> 32:18.503
MELINDA GATES: Thanks, Gwen.

32:18.503 --> 32:21.673
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next week,
Gwen will have a report from
Seattle that features one of

32:21.673 --> 32:25.010
the prominent voices that has
been pushing back on the Common
Core and encouraging parents

32:25.010 --> 32:29.247
to opt out of testing.

32:29.247 --> 32:40.892
Stay with us.

32:40.892 --> 32:44.830
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
California's drought is causing
the state to sink; and

32:44.830 --> 32:49.568
recording artist Josh Groban on
singing Broadway hits. Congress

32:49.568 --> 32:54.072
But, first, cell phones are
ringing furiously at the U.S.
Capitol tonight, as House
Republicans

32:54.072 --> 32:57.642
prepare for a closed-door vote
tomorrow on whom they would like
to be the next speaker

32:57.642 --> 33:00.412
of the House.

33:00.412 --> 33:02.881
Political director Lisa
Desjardins joins us now to
explain the tumultuous time and
what

33:02.881 --> 33:06.785
will be a major decision for
the direction of Congress.

33:06.785 --> 33:10.488
So, first of all, Lisa, I'm sure
you will do this throughout the
interview, but why

33:10.488 --> 33:14.092
does this matter? And there were
some recent dramatic
developments this afternoon too.

33:14.092 --> 33:16.228
Fill us in.

33:16.228 --> 33:20.065
LISA DESJARDINS: This is a
critical decision, Hari,
because, as I don't need to tell
our

33:20.065 --> 33:23.568
viewers, Congress has had some
trouble over the past years in
dealing with major issues

33:23.568 --> 33:27.239
and dealing especially
with fiscal crises.

33:27.239 --> 33:31.209
While there are more fiscal
crises coming, including a debt
ceiling that the U.S. is

33:31.209 --> 33:36.548
about to hit on November 5, the
government runs out of funding
in December. Also, Highway

33:36.548 --> 33:40.318
Trust Fund is about to run out.
These are all issues that are
circulating. These are

33:40.318 --> 33:44.189
all unresolved. And without
clear leadership from the House,
it just makes the current

33:44.189 --> 33:47.125
problems even more
difficult to figure out.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.827
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. What
happened late this afternoon?

33:48.827 --> 33:51.963
LISA DESJARDINS: All right.
So, I just came from there.

33:51.963 --> 33:56.601
We had a group of conservatives
known as the House Freedom
Caucus. They're partially
responsible

33:56.601 --> 34:01.806
for the ouster of House Speaker
Boehner. They decided to endorse
a new candidate, a relatively

34:01.806 --> 34:05.677
new candidate for speaker, a man
named Daniel Webster from
Florida.

34:05.677 --> 34:11.116
He himself was a House speaker
in the Florida Statehouse. A lot
of folks might not have

34:11.116 --> 34:14.686
heard of him. This is important
for a couple of reasons. These
are who -- this is a man

34:14.686 --> 34:18.123
that conservatives want. We
don't think he has more votes
than the current front-runner.

34:18.123 --> 34:21.559
That's Kevin McCarthy
of California.

34:21.559 --> 34:26.264
But these conservatives may have
enough votes to block Kevin
McCarthy from getting the
majority

34:26.264 --> 34:31.269
that he needs. McCarthy is
facing a lot of doubts right
now, Hari, about his ability,

34:31.269 --> 34:34.940
especially after words he had
about the Benghazi hearings and
about how those affected
Secretary

34:34.940 --> 34:38.343
of State and presidential
candidate Clinton.

34:38.343 --> 34:42.113
But he did try to assuage his
critics this morning when he
spoke to reporters.

34:42.113 --> 34:44.416
REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA),
House Majority Leader: I think I
have been very clear when

34:44.416 --> 34:49.721
it comes to Benghazi. I could
have said it in a different
manner, yes.

34:49.721 --> 34:54.559
And I think, at any given time,
somebody could always say
something better. Over time, you

34:54.559 --> 34:58.430
will prove that we have a very
good message. I think the job of
a speaker is to be a team

34:58.430 --> 35:02.968
captain, all part of a team. We
have got a lot of members inside
this conference that

35:02.968 --> 35:07.305
lead a very good job of getting
the message out, and we will
continue to do it.

35:07.305 --> 35:10.208
LISA DESJARDINS: Hari, that's
McCarthy wanting to be team
captain, but, right now, I have

35:10.208 --> 35:14.512
to tell you, there's a lot of
nervousness even among those who
are firmly on his team.

35:14.512 --> 35:17.515
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. Let's talk
about his sort of -- his biggest
rival, Mr. Chaffetz

35:17.515 --> 35:18.216
of Utah.

35:18.216 --> 35:20.418
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

35:20.418 --> 35:25.824
I think Mr. -- Jason Chaffetz
also in the hunt here, he's the
number three. And I think

35:25.824 --> 35:30.328
what's interesting is that
Chaffetz is in this because
there is this critical problem.

35:30.328 --> 35:35.333
I spoke to him Monday about what
essentially is a math problem
for both Kevin McCarthy

35:35.333 --> 35:37.569
and for House Republicans.

35:37.569 --> 35:42.707
REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), Utah:
And you need 218 votes on the
floor of the House.

35:42.707 --> 35:48.380
The problem for Mr. McCarthy is,
there are roughly 50 or so, and
growing, number of people

35:48.380 --> 35:53.518
who just cannot or will not vote
to promote existing leadership
into the speaker's role.

35:53.518 --> 35:58.823
So, I worry that he is going to
fall short of the 218. It's
going to cause some chaos

35:58.823 --> 36:02.660
internally, and nobody is
arguing with the premise that
Mr. McCarthy might be more than

36:02.660 --> 36:05.764
a few votes shy of
the 218 necessary.

36:05.764 --> 36:08.400
LISA DESJARDINS: Now, I know,
Hari, "NewsHour" is a place
where we can get into a little

36:08.400 --> 36:11.669
bit into the weeds. That
got a lot into the weeds.

36:11.669 --> 36:16.508
Because, what he's saying is
that while Kevin McCarthy may
have more votes than anyone else

36:16.508 --> 36:21.980
for Republicans right now, he
still doesn't have a majority in
the House. So, here's what

36:21.980 --> 36:26.384
we think might happen. Kevin
McCarthy might walk away
tomorrow with more votes than
anyone

36:26.384 --> 36:30.255
else behind closed doors, but he
may not have enough votes for
what matters, the speaker's

36:30.255 --> 36:33.625
election on October 29.

36:33.625 --> 36:39.064
He needs 218 votes. And because
of conservatives supporting
either Chaffetz or Congressman

36:39.064 --> 36:44.702
Webster, no one might have
enough votes right now. This
leads to a very difficult
situation.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.739
One longtime source of mine
tonight called it Neverland.

36:47.739 --> 36:52.510
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK, so what
happens? Is there a scenario
here where either John Boehner

36:52.510 --> 36:56.948
has to stick around and be a
speaker, or do we not have a
number three in line to the

36:56.948 --> 36:58.249
presidency?

36:58.249 --> 37:00.685
LISA DESJARDINS: That's what
happens when you're in
Neverland.

37:00.685 --> 37:04.589
I think that a lot of folks are
reading the rules tonight and
over the next week to see

37:04.589 --> 37:10.228
what could happen if no one gets
218 when a speaker's vote is
held. In the past, in

37:10.228 --> 37:14.265
the history, there have been
many long speaker's elections.
It's been several decades since

37:14.265 --> 37:16.434
we have had one.

37:16.434 --> 37:21.706
But they could just continue to
have ballot votes until someone
reaches 218. Hari, another

37:21.706 --> 37:26.744
plan is sort of evolving
tonight, that if they reach this
point, perhaps Speaker Boehner

37:26.744 --> 37:29.881
does stay in the job until they
find consensus, until
Republicans find a person who
they want

37:29.881 --> 37:32.317
to lead.

37:32.317 --> 37:37.956
Now, again, Kevin McCarthy still
is the leading candidate, but
there are real questions about

37:37.956 --> 37:40.758
his leadership at this point.
And, to be honest, he has got
just another day to try and
shore

37:40.758 --> 37:42.961
that up.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.430
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Lisa Desjardins, political
director for the "NewsHour"
joining

37:45.430 --> 37:46.464
us from Capitol Hill
tonight, thanks so much.

37:46.464 --> 37:53.705
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

37:53.705 --> 38:09.187
HARI SREENIVASAN: California's
drought is resulting in a big
drop. The state is sinking,

38:09.187 --> 38:13.024
and sinking fast. Some parts of
the state are settling lower at
a rate of two inches

38:13.024 --> 38:17.529
a month, according to a report
NASA released last month.

38:17.529 --> 38:21.599
As Nathan Halverson from Reveal
shows us, the sinking is
increasing the flood risk in

38:21.599 --> 38:24.903
one area of the state that
is desperate for water.

38:24.903 --> 38:28.640
This story was produced by
member station KQED in San
Francisco.

38:28.640 --> 38:36.447
MAN: Let's fire it up.
It's better than nothing.

38:36.447 --> 38:40.418
NATHAN HALVERSON: Johnny Andrews
is a third-generation farmer in
California's Central Valley.

38:40.418 --> 38:44.622
JOHNNY ANDREWS, Farmer: My
grandpa came out of Texas, and
he told me years ago, he said,

38:44.622 --> 38:47.325
you know, whiskey is for
drinking. Water is for fighting.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.661
See how it's changing colors?

38:49.661 --> 38:52.697
NATHAN HALVERSON: Andrews is one
of thousands of farmers in the
state struggling to keep

38:52.697 --> 38:54.699
their crops green during
a record drought.

38:54.699 --> 38:56.734
JOHNNY ANDREWS: It's
lifting the water.

38:56.734 --> 39:01.506
NATHAN HALVERSON: He is turning
to what he calls a last resort:
drilling for groundwater.

39:01.506 --> 39:05.410
JOHNNY ANDREWS: You're looking
at $200,000 to drill a well.
You're looking at the pumping

39:05.410 --> 39:11.015
cost every month of about
between $2,500 and $3,500 per
well.

39:11.015 --> 39:15.820
NATHAN HALVERSON: Farmers like
Andrews use about 80 percent of
the state's developed

39:15.820 --> 39:21.326
water, growing everything from
tomatoes to almonds. With the
drought in its fourth year,

39:21.326 --> 39:25.296
farmers are drilling deeper and
deeper, running pumps day and
night.

39:25.296 --> 39:27.599
NATHAN HALVERSON: These are just
running all the time and burning
diesel?

39:27.599 --> 39:31.769
JOHNNY ANDREWS: Yes. They're
running all the time. They're
burning four gallons an hour.

39:31.769 --> 39:36.174
NATHAN HALVERSON: All that
pumping has consequences. As the
groundwater gets drawn up, the
land

39:36.174 --> 39:40.812
sinks down. Scientists
call it subsidence.

39:40.812 --> 39:45.583
The land around me, literally
the dirt underneath my tires, is
sinking, more than a foot per

39:45.583 --> 39:48.820
year in some areas.

39:48.820 --> 39:53.191
No one knows exactly how much
water is being pumped, but
hydrologist Michelle Sneed is

39:53.191 --> 39:56.694
alarmed by how quickly
the ground is sinking.

39:56.694 --> 39:59.364
MICHELLE SNEED, United States
Geological Survey: I have been
studying land subsidence
throughout

39:59.364 --> 40:04.435
the West for 20 years, and I
have never measured rates like
this before.

40:04.435 --> 40:08.673
NATHAN HALVERSON: Over the past
two decades, the ground in one
area has sunk from Sneed's

40:08.673 --> 40:13.211
head to her feet. According to
NASA, some parts of the Central
Valley are now sinking

40:13.211 --> 40:16.214
more than two inches a month.

40:16.214 --> 40:22.487
MICHELLE SNEED: We saw that the
area being affected by
subsidence was enormous,
stretching

40:22.487 --> 40:27.992
all the way from I-5 to 99.
About 1,200 square miles are
being affected by subsidence.

40:27.992 --> 40:32.263
NATHAN HALVERSON: That's an area
the size of Rhode Island, and it
has sunk permanently.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.199
How do you stop those
areas from sinking?

40:35.199 --> 40:39.103
MICHELLE SNEED: Well, the
scientific solution is really
easy. You stop lowering
groundwater

40:39.103 --> 40:44.108
levels. Putting that into
practice is a whole 'nother ball
of wax.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.878
NATHAN HALVERSON: Farmers would
have to cut back on drilling for
water.

40:46.878 --> 40:50.415
CLAUDIA FAUNT, United States
Geological Survey: The center of
it is down south of here.

40:50.415 --> 40:53.217
NATHAN HALVERSON: Sneed's
colleague Claudia Faunt took me
to see some of the damage
subsidence

40:53.217 --> 40:55.053
has already caused.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.789
What have we got going on here?
I mean, it's really buckling.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.325
CLAUDIA FAUNT: Yes. And a few
years ago, when I was here, it
wasn't nearly this bent. So,

41:00.325 --> 41:03.995
it's showing evidence of
continuing to warp even more.

41:03.995 --> 41:07.231
NATHAN HALVERSON: These canals
deliver water to farms and
cities throughout Southern
California,

41:07.231 --> 41:09.467
including Los Angeles.

41:09.467 --> 41:12.503
And this isn't the only one I
see. I mean, I see it here, I
see it right down there,

41:12.503 --> 41:14.339
and I see a third one.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.741
CLAUDIA FAUNT: Yes. There's
another one up that direction as
well.

41:16.741 --> 41:20.845
NATHAN HALVERSON: So, this can
be happening to the bridges, to
the roadways, to the railroads.

41:20.845 --> 41:24.816
CLAUDIA FAUNT: Correct. In fact,
there's a bridge right down the
road from here that

41:24.816 --> 41:29.220
the water level is now coming up
over the base of the road
because that area has sunk.

41:29.220 --> 41:33.424
NATHAN HALVERSON: When I went to
see the bridge, the flood risk
was clear.

41:33.424 --> 41:37.128
The water level has risen up so
high now, that it would go right
over the surface of

41:37.128 --> 41:41.199
the road, if they hadn't built
these retaining walls to keep it
back.

41:41.199 --> 41:46.404
Problems like these are already
costing taxpayers tens of
millions of dollars. And
subsidence

41:46.404 --> 41:50.641
is also damaging a vital part of
California's flood control
system.

41:50.641 --> 41:52.143
CHRIS WHITE, Central California
Irrigation District: So, the
levees through here are

41:52.143 --> 41:56.581
about five to six feet lower
than they were historically.

41:56.581 --> 42:01.586
NATHAN HALVERSON: Chris White
runs the Central California
Irrigation District. He says
subsidence

42:01.586 --> 42:04.021
is weakening levees.

42:04.021 --> 42:07.892
CHRIS WHITE: This area, we have
always had flood challenges
through here. But with this

42:07.892 --> 42:10.228
subsidence that's occurred, it's
going to be even more
challenging to deal with floods

42:10.228 --> 42:12.730
in the future.

42:12.730 --> 42:16.267
NATHAN HALVERSON: Forecasters
are predicting a record El Nino
this winter. The wet weather

42:16.267 --> 42:18.636
pattern could bring heavy
rains to this region.

42:18.636 --> 42:20.805
CHRIS WHITE: Red on
this map is bad.

42:20.805 --> 42:24.275
NATHAN HALVERSON: White showed
me areas most at risk of
flooding.

42:24.275 --> 42:28.112
CHRIS WHITE: There's a school.
There's an elementary school
there. Highway 152 crosses

42:28.112 --> 42:34.519
right through the area. There is
significant farmland assets. I'm
praying for rain regardless,

42:34.519 --> 42:38.089
but it's a high-risk situation
from a flood control standpoint.

42:38.089 --> 42:42.193
NATHAN HALVERSON: Nearly half
the nation's fruits, vegetables
and nuts are produced in

42:42.193 --> 42:47.365
California. To find out what the
state is doing to protect its
vital farmland, I met

42:47.365 --> 42:51.035
with Jeanine Jones of the
governor's Drought Task Force.

42:51.035 --> 42:53.538
JEANINE JONES, California
Department of Water Resources:
Subsidence is not regulated
historically

42:53.538 --> 42:57.975
under California law. No
one is responsible for it.

42:57.975 --> 43:01.379
NATHAN HALVERSON: The state
doesn't even know how big the
subsidence problem is.

43:01.379 --> 43:04.148
We're not even monitoring
all of the subsidence?

43:04.148 --> 43:08.553
JEANINE JONES: There has -- no,
there has not been funding or
programs, because there

43:08.553 --> 43:13.791
has been no statutory
responsibility or requirement to
do so.

43:13.791 --> 43:18.029
NATHAN HALVERSON: Last year,
California lawmakers passed
legislation to manage
groundwater,

43:18.029 --> 43:23.534
but it won't require regulators
to limit pumping for another 25
years. Until then, the sinking

43:23.534 --> 43:26.037
will likely continue.

43:26.037 --> 43:30.341
So, how much is the state
projecting this subsidence is
going to cost taxpayers?

43:30.341 --> 43:37.782
JEANINE JONES: We have not run
that analysis. It is a local
scale issue, so -- and most

43:37.782 --> 43:43.855
local agencies -- because
subsidence happens very slowly,
and over the long term, it is

43:43.855 --> 43:48.759
not something that comes to the
top of the priority list
generally in terms of
maintenance.

43:48.759 --> 43:53.764
NATHAN HALVERSON: The
independent nonprofit California
Water Foundation has estimated

43:53.764 --> 43:57.034
that damage due to subsidence
across the state could cost
taxpayers billions of dollars to

43:57.034 --> 43:58.970
fix.

43:58.970 --> 44:02.273
Do you think a billion dollars
is a high estimate for what the
total costs will be or a low

44:02.273 --> 44:03.941
estimate?

44:03.941 --> 44:09.180
JEANINE JONES: I really don't
have anything to judge it by.
Just don't have the data.

44:09.180 --> 44:14.151
NATHAN HALVERSON: For some
farmers, drilling for water has
provided a lifeline during the

44:14.151 --> 44:20.558
drought. But the long-term
consequences of that drilling
are becoming clearer. As large

44:20.558 --> 44:26.030
swathes of the state continue to
sink, the risk of flooding
increases.

44:26.030 --> 44:30.668
And people like Johnny Andrews,
whose farms have survived four
dry years, are now worried

44:30.668 --> 44:34.205
they could be wiped out by the
rain the state desperately
needs.

44:34.205 --> 44:37.808
JOHNNY ANDREWS: We're talking
about the state and feeding the
people in the state. If that

44:37.808 --> 44:42.346
flood is bad enough, it will
wipe out the next year's
farming, or a lot of it.

44:42.346 --> 44:47.084
NATHAN HALVERSON: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Nathan Halverson
in Los Banos, California.

44:47.084 --> 44:51.589
HARI SREENIVASAN: In response to
the NASA report, Governor Jerry
Brown's Drought Task

44:51.589 --> 44:56.193
Force announced it would work
with local communities to
develop recommendations aimed at
reducing

44:56.193 --> 45:01.966
subsidence.

45:01.966 --> 45:13.477
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight: Recording artist Josh
Groban recently kicked off a
tour

45:13.477 --> 45:17.782
for his latest album, "Stages,"
which features covers of songs
from Broadway.

45:17.782 --> 45:22.620
His music has sold more than
25 million albums worldwide.

45:22.620 --> 45:26.123
Jeffrey Brown caught up with him
about his multiplatinum career
and the role of the arts

45:26.123 --> 45:29.193
in his life from an early age.

45:29.193 --> 45:34.265
JEFFREY BROWN: I think I want to
start with the song, the idea of
the song. What it that

45:34.265 --> 45:38.135
attracts you to one? What makes
you feel you must sing it?

45:38.135 --> 45:40.504
JOSH GROBAN, Musician: Well,
there is a little bit of a head
vs. heart kind of battle that

45:40.504 --> 45:44.442
happens sometimes with the song.

45:44.442 --> 45:48.245
There's the goose bump thing,
where the melody or whatever it
is just gets you and you don't

45:48.245 --> 45:52.917
know why. Sometimes, it's in a
genre that you didn't think you
liked and, all of a sudden,

45:52.917 --> 45:54.852
the song hits you and you just
say, wow, I feel the hairs on
the back of my neck. I love

45:54.852 --> 45:57.321
this song.

45:57.321 --> 46:01.892
And then there's the cerebral
side of, you know, what is this
song saying? What is the

46:01.892 --> 46:03.260
story that I want to tell here?

46:03.260 --> 46:05.796
JEFFREY BROWN: You
think about story?

46:05.796 --> 46:09.967
JOSH GROBAN: You think about
that. You think about, is the
lyric smart enough? Is it
something

46:09.967 --> 46:12.703
that satisfies
that side as well?

46:12.703 --> 46:16.874
And so when those two things
come together, you realize it is
the song. And sometimes

46:16.874 --> 46:24.115
the song is not in the language
that you are fluent in, so
sometimes the song is a demo

46:24.115 --> 46:27.385
that you have recorded at 2:00
in the morning, where you have
goose bumps, but it's all in

46:27.385 --> 46:29.987
gibberish at this point because
you haven't put a lyric to it.
And then sometimes...

46:29.987 --> 46:31.455
JEFFREY BROWN: You're not sure
what the story is at that point,
right.

46:31.455 --> 46:34.291
JOSH GROBAN: You're not sure
what the story is. But for
whatever reason, that, whatever

46:34.291 --> 46:39.964
that is, has the it factor. And
it really all comes down to from
the moment that happens

46:39.964 --> 46:43.167
to the moment you have mastered
it and put it out, that that
feeling happens.

46:43.167 --> 46:46.771
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, in the
latest album, "Stages," you are
specifically taking great

46:46.771 --> 46:51.142
songs from musical theater,
right, and doing what with them?

46:51.142 --> 46:53.577
Because these are songs that, in
many cases, have been
interpreted many times.

46:53.577 --> 46:55.546
JOSH GROBAN: Countless
times, yes.

46:55.546 --> 46:57.181
And that's intimidating. And
so there are some songs...

46:57.181 --> 46:58.282
JEFFREY BROWN: It is, right?

46:58.282 --> 47:00.284
JOSH GROBAN: Oh,
very intimidating.

47:00.284 --> 47:04.155
You're taking off the songwriter
hat and you're putting on the
interpretive hat. And with

47:04.155 --> 47:08.392
that comes a great
responsibility. And so, as a
singer, of course,
self-indulgently,

47:08.392 --> 47:15.166
it's a joy to take a song like
"Somewhere Over the Rainbow" or
"Bring Him Home" and

47:15.166 --> 47:26.777
say, OK, well, I'm just
-- I'm going to sing it.

47:26.777 --> 47:30.347
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you listen
to the other renditions?

47:30.347 --> 47:32.016
JOSH GROBAN: I have of
course listened to them.

47:32.016 --> 47:32.750
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. How
could you not, right?

47:32.750 --> 47:34.018
JOSH GROBAN: They have been
in our DNA for so many years.

47:34.018 --> 47:36.187
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:36.187 --> 47:41.659
JOSH GROBAN: But I don't listen
to them with the intent on
recording them or singing them

47:41.659 --> 47:45.196
the same way. I listen to them
for inspiration based on the
fact that the songs are so
universal,

47:45.196 --> 47:48.432
that so many different people
can record them and have their
own moment with them.

47:48.432 --> 47:53.604
JEFFREY BROWN: I noticed that,
in some cases, you did strip
them down to a much more
spare...

47:53.604 --> 47:59.910
JOSH GROBAN: Yes. That was a
nice surprise when that
happened. We fully intended on
putting

47:59.910 --> 48:04.448
the full orchestrations. We did
it at Abbey Road with most of
the London Philharmonic.

48:04.448 --> 48:08.319
And then there were the songs
where we really felt like taking
a breath from that. Like,

48:08.319 --> 48:11.789
"Bring Him Home" was just piano,
one take. Just worked
surprisingly well. And that's

48:11.789 --> 48:20.030
a testament to the melody.

48:20.030 --> 48:35.946
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you like the
power of that orchestra behind
you? I mean, that's how we

48:35.946 --> 48:38.549
see you most times, right?

48:38.549 --> 48:44.121
JOSH GROBAN: Yes, I really do. I
would be lying if I said I
didn't. It's a pretty cool

48:44.121 --> 48:47.391
feeling. It's a high-five to the
15-year old theater geek
whenever you're standing in that

48:47.391 --> 48:48.125
room.

48:48.125 --> 48:48.993
JEFFREY BROWN: Is that
15-year old there?

48:48.993 --> 48:50.528
JOSH GROBAN: Oh, absolutely.

48:50.528 --> 48:53.164
JEFFREY BROWN: He's
sitting in front of me.

48:53.164 --> 48:54.732
JOSH GROBAN: He is. He's there.
He's definitely there. He
couldn't grow a beard then.
That's

48:54.732 --> 48:55.299
different.

48:55.299 --> 48:57.334
JEFFREY BROWN: Right. Right.

48:57.334 --> 49:00.271
But he wanted to be in front of
the orchestra and on the stage?

49:00.271 --> 49:02.206
JOSH GROBAN: Absolutely. The
9-year-old, 5-year-old me wanted
that.

49:02.206 --> 49:03.941
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

49:03.941 --> 49:08.813
JOSH GROBAN: I had the bug at a
very young age. And it's truly
because of the arts exposure

49:08.813 --> 49:13.851
that I had from my parents, from
teachers, from PBS that allowed
me...

49:13.851 --> 49:16.387
JEFFREY BROWN: You're welcome
on behalf of all of us.

49:16.387 --> 49:18.856
JOSH GROBAN: Well, yes,
absolutely. I have so much
thanks for that, because it
really

49:18.856 --> 49:22.393
gave me that spark. It made me
realize that that's out there.
And, in turn, it gave me

49:22.393 --> 49:28.032
my first moments of truly my
most honest voice and real
communication.

49:28.032 --> 49:32.169
JEFFREY BROWN: You have, as much
as anyone perhaps, found the
space in a -- some call

49:32.169 --> 49:33.938
it a crossover world or
different genres. Right?

49:33.938 --> 49:35.706
JOSH GROBAN: Sure.

49:35.706 --> 49:38.843
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you see
yourself as doing? Who are you
reaching to, what are you

49:38.843 --> 49:40.244
aiming for?

49:40.244 --> 49:41.679
JOSH GROBAN (singing):
Who am I anyway?

49:41.679 --> 49:43.881
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Is this
something you think about or is
just -- did it all just...

49:43.881 --> 49:45.850
JOSH GROBAN: No.

49:45.850 --> 49:49.386
And that's the kind of
off-putting thing, when you read
about people putting you in

49:49.386 --> 49:54.225
a place or what genre you are or
subgenre that you're in. It's
jarring when you read

49:54.225 --> 49:57.962
that stuff, because I'm just me
to me. And the songs that I sing
and the songs that I

49:57.962 --> 50:02.566
write have always just been what
I feel my voice does well, and
what my inspirations

50:02.566 --> 50:06.470
have been and a kind of
culmination of everything.

50:06.470 --> 50:09.340
But the voices that I grew up
loving are the voices that,
within five seconds, you can

50:09.340 --> 50:16.480
tell exactly who that is.

50:16.480 --> 50:29.860
JEFFREY BROWN: When you look out
that far -- and I get to talk to
a lot of especially

50:29.860 --> 50:32.863
musicians nowadays in a hugely
changing music history, right?

50:32.863 --> 50:35.266
JOSH GROBAN: Oh, yes, for sure.

50:35.266 --> 50:40.471
JEFFREY BROWN: How do you
maintain the success you have
had? How do you reach new
audiences?

50:40.471 --> 50:42.873
You're still with a record --
records are -- you're still
making albums, right?

50:42.873 --> 50:44.041
JOSH GROBAN: Sure,
yes. Yes, sure. Yes.

50:44.041 --> 50:47.444
JEFFREY BROWN: In an age where
that's almost -- nobody does it.

50:47.444 --> 50:49.346
JOSH GROBAN: Yes, of course.

50:49.346 --> 50:52.583
Well, there's kind of a singles
mentality now. We have all kind
of -- there's a whole

50:52.583 --> 50:58.122
new generation that's being --
that is kind of being
conditioned to stream, and
download

50:58.122 --> 51:02.393
song after song. And I think
that my course doesn't change.

51:02.393 --> 51:07.197
I still want to make an album
from song one to song 12 that is
an experience for my fans.

51:07.197 --> 51:12.336
Truly, it's up to every artist
to still make great music, and
not let the immediacy of

51:12.336 --> 51:17.241
the technology make the artist
lazy. You still can't download a
great concert where someone

51:17.241 --> 51:18.709
is in the seat and feeling goose
bumps in a great theater. So,
that's why I love touring

51:18.709 --> 51:19.944
so much.

51:19.944 --> 51:22.913
JEFFREY BROWN: I see you're
doing a lot more acting now.

51:22.913 --> 51:28.052
Does this signify a certain
restlessness from music or...

51:28.052 --> 51:30.154
JOSH GROBAN: It is, definitely.
It's a side of my brain that is
saying you have got to

51:30.154 --> 51:33.223
do some of this.

51:33.223 --> 51:37.628
I was a theater major in high
school I was at an arts high
school, so I was able to study

51:37.628 --> 51:40.631
drama there. I eventually went
to Carnegie Mellon University
for musical theater training.

51:40.631 --> 51:44.301
I left to sign a record deal.
And music became my everything.

51:44.301 --> 51:48.706
But the acting was definitely
half of what I loved about
storytelling and about theater.

51:48.706 --> 51:54.044
So, when I get a chance to do a
cameo in a show or do a movie,
it's a lot of fun and

51:54.044 --> 51:56.880
it's always great stepping
outside of yourself and either
playing a bizarro version of
yourself

51:56.880 --> 51:59.049
or playing a character.

51:59.049 --> 52:01.785
So, yes, there will more,
hopefully doing some Broadway in
the next year. We will see.

52:01.785 --> 52:04.521
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Broadway,
that's big-bore, yes?

52:04.521 --> 52:06.690
JOSH GROBAN: Yes, it would
be. Yes, it would be a...

52:06.690 --> 52:09.426
JEFFREY BROWN: That's not --
from your high school stage to a
little camera on TV to Broadway,

52:09.426 --> 52:11.095
that was a big leap
you just made.

52:11.095 --> 52:12.896
JOSH GROBAN: No.

52:12.896 --> 52:18.002
Yes, it would be a great leap.
And the reason that it hasn't
happened so far is because

52:18.002 --> 52:23.307
it takes so much time and effort
to mount a Broadway production,
and something that

52:23.307 --> 52:26.844
you can put the time and effort
into. And so I'm constantly
looking at things. I have

52:26.844 --> 52:28.078
been honored to have had some
wonderful offers in the last few
years, but the timing hasn't

52:28.078 --> 52:30.447
worked out.

52:30.447 --> 52:32.850
So, I'm really looking at this
next year to hopefully make that
leap and hopefully include

52:32.850 --> 52:34.718
some of the acting
into what I do.

52:34.718 --> 52:35.886
JEFFREY BROWN: Josh Groban,
thank you so much.

52:35.886 --> 52:38.355
JOSH GROBAN: Thanks
for having me.

52:38.355 --> 52:42.860
HARI SREENIVASAN: PBS will air a
full concert called "Josh
Groban: Stages" live in
December.

52:42.860 --> 52:48.632
Check your local
listings for more.

52:48.632 --> 53:03.647
On the "NewsHour" online: It's
two distinct sounds you are
probably familiar with, only

53:03.647 --> 53:10.454
not like this. Canadian band A
Tribe Called Red combines Native
American powwow with electronic

53:10.454 --> 53:13.957
dance music, and the result is a
rhythmic surprise. You can
listen yourself on our home

53:13.957 --> 53:16.126
page.

53:16.126 --> 53:19.897
You can also watch our full
interviews from tonight, Judy's
conversation with Hillary

53:19.897 --> 53:24.101
Clinton in Iowa, plus Gwen's
interview with Bill and Melinda
Gates -- all that and more

53:24.101 --> 53:27.805
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:27.805 --> 53:30.641
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:30.641 --> 53:34.178
On Thursday, Gwen sits down with
the U.S. attorney general,
Loretta Lynch.

53:34.178 --> 53:36.680
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:36.680 --> 53:40.350
Join us online and again here

at the "PBS NewsHour," thank

53:40.350 --> 53:40.751
you, and good night.
