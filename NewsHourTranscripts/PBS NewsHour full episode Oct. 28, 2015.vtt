deal and on budget deal that wouthe debt limit to go up.

13:44.457 --> 13:48.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
After kicking this can down the with Congress, what changed this

13:49.796 --> 13:51.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a two-year deal to be on the ver

13:52.265 --> 13:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK LEW: Well, I think a lot oftogether.

13:55.935 --> 13:59.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, the fact that the debgoing to be reached on Tuesday o

14:01.240 --> 14:03.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they have to act before thentheir minds on the debt limit in

14:05.044 --> 14:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way. I have been communicating won a very regular basis. It's be

14:08.948 --> 14:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
closer and closer. And I think ithing that they have reached an

14:13.352 --> 14:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that it certainly seems to befor the debt limit being raised

14:17.490 --> 14:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
avoid that unnecessary self-infl

14:20.827 --> 14:24.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the budget side, there have bgoing on for many years, but int

14:26.299 --> 14:32.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many weeks, to try and figure outhis year's funding bills. The a

14:34.006 --> 14:36.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one that we have supported for awhich is to relieve the across-t

14:38.211 --> 14:44.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in sequestration by replacing thwith a balanced mix of tax and s

14:45.685 --> 14:48.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The breakthrough in the last weeus to reach an agreement, where

14:50.289 --> 14:53.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that goal, and providing $80 bilis going to give Congress the ab

14:55.128 --> 14:58.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appropriations bills to meet ourneeds and our defense needs. Thi

14:59.766 --> 15:02.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they will be able to invest in reducation and also in our nation

15:03.703 --> 15:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's what Americans wato do. It shouldn't be so hard t

15:07.840 --> 15:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moments where these agreements cAnd I hope this passes in a way

15:12.678 --> 15:13.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and enables Congress to get on w

15:20.453 --> 15:26.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK LEW: You know, the conversagoing on before that. And I thin

15:27.493 --> 15:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approached it with an intensity create in these last couple of w

15:34.567 --> 15:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Congress coming to termslimit helps that they understand

15:38.738 --> 15:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
real deadline. The two are separover the budget. On the debt lim

15:44.844 --> 15:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clear from the beginning, they japprove the debt limit. It's not

15:48.281 --> 15:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they can kind of extract co

15:51.317 --> 15:55.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We heard incoming spRyan say the process stinks, eve

15:56.823 --> 16:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

16:01.828 --> 16:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this next round of negotiations,that might be, with the new spea

16:06.365 --> 16:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK LEW: Well, to be clear, thito give the Congress a total amo

16:11.504 --> 16:16.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to spend for the next two years process. They now have to produc

16:17.710 --> 16:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
December 11 to fund the governmeyear, because that's when the sh

16:21.747 --> 16:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill expires.

16:23.783 --> 16:29.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hope that they approach that wkind of spirit of compromise and

16:31.090 --> 16:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mutually acceptable outcomes, andoesn't become an occasion for t

16:37.430 --> 16:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues that cause unnecessary cobe introduced.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Have you spoken withRyan yet about this process?

16:45.004 --> 16:49.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

16:50.509 --> 16:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of years from multiple differentwas the OMB director when he was

16:56.916 --> 17:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Committee chair. I worked with hwas chief of staff at the White

17:01.420 --> 17:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worked with him as treasury secr

17:03.789 --> 17:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have always been able to issues. And it won't come as a s

17:08.361 --> 17:11.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have very different policy viewsbut we have always been able to

17:12.698 --> 17:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
respectful way and to look for awe can work together. I hope tha

17:16.736 --> 17:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continues.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to talk to yoof the nuts and bolts in this bu

17:21.307 --> 17:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of them has had to do with MB, the part of Medicare which pa

17:24.710 --> 17:28.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
services, doctors' visits. Therethat that was going to rise, tha

17:29.515 --> 17:31.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would rise by 30 percent. Now itback to 15 percent.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But some people say there were sused to do this, the kinds of gi

17:36.756 --> 17:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president vetoed or spoke out agdefense policy bill.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK LEW: On the Medicare premiuwe had no cost of living increas

17:45.898 --> 17:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because inflation didn't hit theto trigger an adjustment, there

17:52.438 --> 17:55.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of roughly 30 percent of Medicarwho were going to actually see a

17:56.776 --> 17:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent increase in their Medica

17:59.278 --> 18:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a bipartisan interest that out over a period of time a

18:04.250 --> 18:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the impact not be as immediate aAnd I think that's what was work

18:08.721 --> 18:11.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bill. It is the kind of thinshould be able to work together

18:12.591 --> 18:16.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
basis, and everything that is inis paid for in one -- with one o

18:17.763 --> 18:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Not a gimmick to borto do it?

18:19.832 --> 18:23.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK LEW: Well, I think if you lsavings in the bill overall, the

18:24.370 --> 18:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spending reductions and some taxmeasures.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There are no taxes ithis deal, as the president said

18:32.278 --> 18:32.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to be.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK LEW: Well, there will be recome from our enforcing the exis

18:37.249 --> 18:37.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more effectively.

18:38.851 --> 18:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the spending side, there are of real savings provisions. As i

18:44.623 --> 18:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agreement, you know, nobody likeoffsets in a budget agreement. S

18:49.128 --> 18:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be some criticism over the cominthink that we will focus not so

18:53.966 --> 18:56.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or not they're real, but with sowhy did you get the savings here

18:57.970 --> 19:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is cutting benefits a backdoor way of decreasing adv

19:03.342 --> 19:03.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a patient?

19:04.910 --> 19:08.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK LEW: There are no beneficiathis package. You know, sensible

19:10.016 --> 19:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reforms that have reimbursementsthat reflects best practice, bes

19:16.522 --> 19:17.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of what costs are, that's a good

19:19.291 --> 19:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think that what we have putin this package is a fair and ba

19:25.164 --> 19:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In terms of the Medicare provisiit's a good thing that we're goi

19:30.169 --> 19:31.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something that would have been vexplain to people, their Medicar

19:32.505 --> 19:34.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going up 50 percent because inflgo up.

19:35.741 --> 19:40.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is it fiscally soundwhat, $6.5 billion by releasing

19:41.447 --> 19:41.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Strategic Petroleum Reserve?

19:43.382 --> 19:46.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK LEW: Well, the Strategic Peis an important national asset.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
old asset. It's an asset that wadecades ago, and it actually nee

19:53.025 --> 19:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million dollars of improvements be as useful and usable as it sh

19:59.465 --> 20:02.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Part of this agreement will modeStrategic Petroleum Reserve, so

20:03.469 --> 20:06.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get access to it when we need itreliable way. And we produce qui

20:08.240 --> 20:11.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
domestic energy today than when the Strategic Petroleum Reserve

place.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think if you look at this in light of our national securit

20:17.583 --> 20:18.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a very important step forward.

20:20.086 --> 20:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

20:33.432 --> 20:35.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spending on that, are we going tat the same place again?

20:37.269 --> 20:41.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACK LEW: You know, Gwen, the desometimes thought of as spending

20:42.641 --> 20:46.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The debt limit actually doesn't All it does is, it gives us the

pay for the bills that have beento by prior acts of Congress. So

20:52.952 --> 20:55.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the debt limit would be useto control spending is just fund

20:56.655 --> 20:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wrong. You have to make those debefore you hit the debt limit.

21:01.093 --> 21:05.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we clearly have challenges obut for the next 10 years, we're

it's so hard to get documents abthat happen in school and arrest

25:27.126 --> 25:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that there is a discipline probl

25:30.829 --> 25:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think that what we saw on tjust a snapshot of a larger set

25:38.637 --> 25:42.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues around discipline. So, foblack students are just about ha

We at the Center for the Study oEquity in Education recently pub

reason -- what is the reasoning armed officers on site?

26:38.497 --> 26:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN FERRISS: I think there's areasons. One, I think, most obvi

26:42.534 --> 26:44.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is fear of school shootings and

26:46.171 --> 26:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And after a school shooting, thea request locally to add more po

also, going back to the '80s andthe growth of security guards an

27:00.118 --> 27:04.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of fear of violence among studen

27:06.158 --> 27:11.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think that people bargaigetting deeply involved in what

27:11.930 --> 27:13.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

27:19.605 --> 27:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
online today where the students the principal, where the -- wher

27:24.977 --> 27:28.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
felt like they had to protect --means to protect themselves agai

27:29.214 --> 27:29.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students.

27:30.282 --> 27:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did this, or has this gotteneither way?

27:34.253 --> 27:40.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHAUN HARPER: Well, one thing thhave at our disposal are the vid

27:41.093 --> 27:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
footage. Right?

27:42.628 --> 27:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I'm not sure that there has bin or even a decrease in the num

27:51.336 --> 27:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
such as the ones that we have sevideos, but, just like policing

27:57.009 --> 28:00.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
communities and in our larger sowe have dash-cams and we have pe

28:02.080 --> 28:08.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cell phones, cell phone cameras,you know, exposed to the world t

28:09.087 --> 28:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are happening.

28:10.923 --> 28:15.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I don't know that I'm able toone way or another about, you kn

28:16.495 --> 28:21.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, violence against teachers leaders, you know, is really, yo

28:22.568 --> 28:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big problem. What I can say, thois that the officer who was fire

28:28.507 --> 28:31.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assaulted that young lady, and Ithat there was someone there wit

28:32.044 --> 28:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
camera to capture it.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you anothwhile you're on that point, whic

28:36.848 --> 28:40.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do we know that this is race thathis? You talked about the dispa

28:41.119 --> 28:42.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
numbers, but what drives that?

28:43.455 --> 28:44.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHAUN HARPER: Sure.

28:45.991 --> 28:51.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that -- and our researchclear that, you know, there are

28:52.931 --> 28:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that many educators and school aand perhaps even school resource

28:58.637 --> 29:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have about young black children,violent, we're unruly.

29:03.842 --> 29:09.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, I'm not a child anymore, b-- just that they're young crimi

29:10.916 --> 29:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consumed for almost all of our lknow, these messages about who y

29:18.090 --> 29:22.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people are, so those same messagway into schools. And, you know,

29:23.996 --> 29:29.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and tragically even, you know, ykids are often, you know, severe

29:30.802 --> 29:34.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
harshly penalized for the same kthat young white children do.

29:36.041 --> 29:40.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm pretty sure that there is a boy in a class somewhere in Amer

29:42.114 --> 29:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his cell phone out on the same dyoung lady was attacked, and the

29:47.786 --> 29:51.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
put your cell phone away, and heyet, when that young lady, becau

29:52.658 --> 29:57.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right, you know, that engenders response that is unequivocally r

GWEN IFILL: So, Susan Ferriss, wthe training for the officers or

resource officers or the discipleven teachers, why isn't that ta

30:07.906 --> 30:08.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or is it taken into account in t

30:09.941 --> 30:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN FERRISS: There is really nstandard for that. It's almost d

30:17.015 --> 30:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are other concerns about tthat police officers should have

30:23.555 --> 30:27.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go into schools because of the llarge from proportion of special

30:28.894 --> 30:31.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also that are getting referred tto courts.

30:33.098 --> 30:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When we did our data analysis, wthere were 14 percent of student

States who had special needs, bu-- but 26 percent of those refer

30:44.943 --> 30:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

30:46.745 --> 30:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will give you an example of whin Virginia. Virginia was the to

plenty of news about Apple earniof dollars off of iPhones and ot

Yahoo!'s chief executive, Marissshe will soon launch a plan to s

and charged with broadening Twitat a time when Snapchat and othe

33:06.685 --> 33:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rising.

33:08.553 --> 33:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jon Kelly is a contributing editFair" who covers this sector, jo

33:11.990 --> 33:16.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's start with Twitter firthere's almost this Jobsian myth

33:17.829 --> 33:21.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the founder coming back tocompany, to take it to the new h

33:22.601 --> 33:25.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where is Twitter, and why has itto have fallen out of favor?

33:26.972 --> 33:28.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON KELLY, Contributing Editor, Well, there certainly is a Jobsi

33:29.908 --> 33:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in part, that's because Dorwant to promote that sort of myt

33:34.980 --> 33:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for very obvious reasons. But Twfrom the same sort of problem th

33:40.852 --> 33:47.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has. It was a hot company in itsit's struggling to recapture tha

33:48.660 --> 33:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to satisfy the expectations of iwho expect that it will.

33:52.163 --> 33:54.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it's not aIt's a 10-year-old company. Righ

33:55.767 --> 33:58.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when you start to think of 10-yeyou think of like, wow, Facebook

33:58.970 --> 34:00.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken off in this almost same am

34:01.539 --> 34:04.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON KELLY: No, it's true. It's vIn the modern tech landscape, a

34:05.176 --> 34:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an old company is 10 years old.

34:08.413 --> 34:10.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So Twitter at year 10 is trying the growth that it experienced i

34:12.217 --> 34:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years in the public market. And an impossible job as it looks fo

34:17.255 --> 34:19.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it looks for new audiences afor new ways to create revenue s

34:20.926 --> 34:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of new products, like Moments, wrecently unveiled.

34:24.896 --> 34:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's possible that Twitter may bcompany. It's also possible that

34:29.234 --> 34:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
company.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There was a faarticle just a few days talking

34:34.239 --> 34:36.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still used by the "ists," the joand the activists, right, but no

34:37.208 --> 34:36.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON KELLY: Yes, Right.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lots of peopleTwitter, but they don't seem to

34:41.379 --> 34:43.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I guess Moments is an oppthem or trying to capture those

34:45.250 --> 34:47.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON KELLY: Well, Twitter's real itself to its role during the Ar

34:48.586 --> 34:51.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which I think made it a truly inforce for democracy.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was what a Silicon Valley comto be. It hoped to change the wo

34:56.328 --> 34:59.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it a better place. Now people fiis kind of cumbersome and tricky

35:01.232 --> 35:04.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a place for people to communicathard to bring in new users when

35:05.704 --> 35:07.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to them essentially, you have tofollow hundreds if not thousands

35:07.772 --> 35:08.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get live news.

35:09.641 --> 35:13.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Moments hopes to reclaim Twiin that universe and in the news

35:15.013 --> 35:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to play a bit of catchup to whatdid. And they seem to think that

35:18.817 --> 35:21.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some heat there and some opportuindeed they're already trying to

35:21.886 --> 35:22.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against this.

35:23.922 --> 35:27.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, clearly, they see this as a their next year, and if not the

35:28.259 --> 35:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
three years in catching up reven

35:30.628 --> 35:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of renot a small company, not a small

35:34.432 --> 35:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
revenue. What, is it a billion dso?

35:37.836 --> 35:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Compare that, though, in the eyeshareholders, Apple and the mass

35:43.074 --> 35:46.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of cash that they're sitting on,Marissa Mayer's report card now?

35:48.346 --> 35:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have given her a pretty long kintime and said, fine, here's a ch

35:52.417 --> 35:53.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
buy a bunch of companies, if thathink it's going to take.

35:55.086 --> 35:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Yahoo! hasn't performed the thought that it would.

35:58.356 --> 36:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON KELLY: Well, in a funny way,me of Dorsey. She's somebody who

36:02.527 --> 36:06.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perhaps an impossible job. Yahooa first-generation Internet comp

36:07.699 --> 36:12.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of age in the early '90s. How mcompanies still exist? Amazon, e

36:13.104 --> 36:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
others are still around.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's not surprising that Yahback toward its glory days. Now,

36:20.311 --> 36:23.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Mayer was seen as this almostopportunity. Her first day on th

36:24.816 --> 36:27.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was literally greeted with ShepaObama hope posters with her face

36:28.987 --> 36:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And you can godown after that.

36:30.155 --> 36:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(LAUGHTER)

36:30.889 --> 36:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON KELLY: No, I know. It's tougpresident.

36:33.825 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think that they felt she acould deliver a transformative p

36:38.696 --> 36:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own version of an iPod, their owof some sort of Jobsian fantasy

36:42.834 --> 36:45.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life that would transform the coyou know what? It's very, very h

36:45.970 --> 36:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that.

36:47.639 --> 36:51.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, indeed, Mayer had this threcover, where Alibaba, which they

36:52.477 --> 36:54.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent stake in, was going to gSo, she had three years in which

36:55.780 --> 36:59.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and roll out some hot product. Ahappened.

37:00.718 --> 37:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in January, the Alibaba spinand then Yahoo! is truly wearing

37:05.457 --> 37:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On its own.

37:05.957 --> 37:05.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON KELLY: It's on its own.

37:07.325 --> 37:09.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It does earn revenue of about $1quarter. That's about what it hi

37:10.829 --> 37:13.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most recent quarter. And there amany companies that would love t

37:14.165 --> 37:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
revenue, but not in the Valley.

37:18.002 --> 37:19.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, the shift emphasized mobile when she came

37:21.339 --> 37:23.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make Yahoo! much more mobile-because the world has moved to t

37:25.143 --> 37:27.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and is not as P.C.-centric or asas we used to be.

37:28.146 --> 37:28.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON KELLY: Yes. Right.

37:29.814 --> 37:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right? So, hasShe's also made some big acquisi

37:32.016 --> 37:32.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON KELLY: Right.

37:33.852 --> 37:36.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Yahoo! was, in all fairness Mayer, nowhere on mobile when sh

37:37.655 --> 37:41.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in 2012. And that's a scary propwhen you think about the billion

37:42.694 --> 37:47.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
revenue that Yahoo! earned this it to Apple, which essentially c

37:48.833 --> 37:52.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
smartphone, and made $50 billionand you get a sense of where peo

37:53.671 --> 37:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, indeed, Twitter, which is fcatching up to Snapchat and What

37:59.811 --> 38:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- all of its mission is attempton to the phone in front of you.

38:04.749 --> 38:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than half of the audience i

38:07.352 --> 38:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's where Mayer has been she's tried to be as prodigious

38:12.090 --> 38:15.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in creating new products. But whYahoo! Mail didn't even have a f

38:15.860 --> 38:16.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
application on the smartphone.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's very, very difficult totheir long-term expectations are

38:21.266 --> 38:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Jon"Vanity Fair," thanks so much fo

Wyoming is the least populated scountry, and one of the whitest,

40:33.531 --> 40:37.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be slowly changing. Since state's African-American populat

41:28.086 --> 41:32.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's partially thanks to the fsurge in shale oil production. W

42:42.760 --> 42:47.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the plummeting price of oil Dakota hard. Those plentiful job

43:21.899 --> 43:24.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
necessarily mean workers will le

SCOTT HOYING: We never thought, we be the best a cappella group?

45:06.704 --> 45:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thought, like, how can we competSwift and Rihanna? Like, how we

45:10.408 --> 45:12.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh, really, that

45:13.411 --> 45:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(CROSSTALK)

45:14.245 --> 45:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT HOYING: Exactly, yes.

45:17.248 --> 45:21.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They first gained2011 with an appearance on NBC's

45:23.321 --> 45:27.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show "The Sing-Off," then, with of covers of top 40 hits, found

to a large, loyal audience throu

45:32.930 --> 45:38.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Next, they turned to a more tradroute, making albums and selling

45:38.703 --> 45:44.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two million.

45:45.643 --> 45:53.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And their Christmas album at onemegastar Taylor Swift's for numb

45:54.952 --> 46:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2014. Along the way, they won a for best arrangement and appeare

"Pitch Perfect 2."

46:09.567 --> 46:11.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KIRSTIN MALDONADO: I think it's too to see people's perspectives

46:13.170 --> 46:15.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of music change. Like, with "Gleout initially -- I remember, "Gl

46:17.041 --> 46:23.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when we were seniors in high schwere like in show choir and seni

46:24.749 --> 46:26.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like, oh, yes, this is awesome. cool. We did it. And so that...

46:27.451 --> 46:26.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(CROSSTALK)

46:28.285 --> 46:27.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did you say, thiscould do this right away?

46:29.420 --> 46:31.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KIRSTIN MALDONADO: No. Literallypilot came out for "Glee," I thi

46:33.124 --> 46:34.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a watching party or something. Wseniors, and everyone all of a s

46:36.327 --> 46:38.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show choir were so excited. We wthis show is awesome. It's so co

46:39.430 --> 46:39.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exactly us.

46:40.364 --> 46:40.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT HOYING: It was essentiallyalready doing.

46:41.499 --> 46:41.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KIRSTIN MALDONADO: Yes.

46:42.733 --> 46:47.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think that really opened uplike different chapter of music.

46:49.006 --> 46:53.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Kirstin Maldonadoand Mitch Grassi first met as hi

46:54.011 --> 46:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students in Arlington, Texas.

46:55.980 --> 46:59.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MITCH GRASSI: We originally joinfor an a cappella trio for a rad

47:00.451 --> 47:01.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Texas that we lost. But...

47:02.219 --> 47:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(LAUGHTER)

47:03.220 --> 47:04.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the rest is h

47:06.323 --> 47:08.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MITCH GRASSI: And the rest is hiI remember one instance where we

47:09.760 --> 47:12.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and rehearsing and we called a cinto the room. And we were like,

47:13.998 --> 47:15.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we need to like -- we need your is this good? Should we even ent

47:16.967 --> 47:20.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they were like -- after we swere like, oh, my gosh, this is

47:20.905 --> 47:21.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you guys have truly something sp

47:23.240 --> 47:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Group members, alcame to this with music lessons

47:27.211 --> 47:32.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experience as kids, believe a bia cappella's appeal is it back-t

47:33.117 --> 47:35.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very different from most of toda

47:37.188 --> 47:40.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kevin Olusola and Avi Kaplan, whthree original friends later on,

47:42.393 --> 47:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEVIN OLUSOLA: We live in a socimusic is very, very overproduced

47:46.263 --> 47:47.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Overproduced?

47:48.532 --> 47:51.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KEVIN OLUSOLA: In a sense. Thereelectronics. I mean, obviously,

47:52.770 --> 47:54.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
electronics sound, as we do too.there's there's a lot of people

47:55.239 --> 47:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of want a more organic sound.

47:57.208 --> 48:00.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we think that we can provthis kind of music industry that

48:01.479 --> 48:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can kind of be that solace fosay, oh, I don't want to listen

48:06.317 --> 48:07.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of electronic, overproduced sounto listen to something a little

48:08.953 --> 48:11.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and pure. And that is kind of hothat void in this industry.

48:12.857 --> 48:17.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AVI KAPLAN: People just that wanthat is just kind of a little mo

48:17.928 --> 48:17.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we...

48:18.429 --> 48:18.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Humble?

48:19.263 --> 48:19.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AVI KAPLAN: Yes.

48:21.098 --> 48:24.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, you are oYou're sort of -- and I have see

48:26.036 --> 48:28.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's like -- it's fun and it-- it's loud, in a sense.

48:30.341 --> 48:32.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AVI KAPLAN: Yes, it is loud in awe do, do the flashy type of thi

48:34.445 --> 48:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the end of the day, we're just 2singing choir music. You know wh

48:40.384 --> 48:41.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we just made it a different

48:42.853 --> 48:46.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's really just kind of takto the most organic form of musi

48:47.725 --> 48:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming straight from us. We are you know? And we see ourselves a

48:52.029 --> 48:52.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a band. We just happen to use ou

48:53.697 --> 48:54.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You can travel mo

48:55.199 --> 48:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

48:58.002 --> 49:00.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How does it work?got a demonstration.

49:01.806 --> 49:03.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT HOYING: We're most inspirethe groove, the beat, or at leas

49:05.442 --> 49:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what inspires me. And so we willKevin. And then we will add the

49:11.215 --> 49:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we will have core progressionwe have two background parts. An

49:19.623 --> 49:25.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just lay the solo on top.
