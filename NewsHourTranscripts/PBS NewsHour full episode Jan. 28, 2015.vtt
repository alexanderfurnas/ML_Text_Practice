JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is
away.

00:09.710 --> 00:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
World Health Organization
announces the Zika virus is
spreading

00:15.148 --> 00:22.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explosively in the Americas,
predicting up to four million
people infected this year.

00:22.189 --> 00:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead this Thursday, we sit
down with Matthew Trevithick,
one of the Americans released

00:26.326 --> 00:29.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this month from an
Iranian prison.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK, Freed From
Iranian Prison: And he says, "Do
you know who Jason Rezaian

00:30.931 --> 00:32.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is?"

00:32.566 --> 00:37.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said, "Of course. The whole
world knows that name." And he
said, next sentence, "He's

00:37.304 --> 00:40.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
never leaving, and
neither are you."

00:40.007 --> 00:45.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the politics
of corn, how ethanol plays a
vital role in Iowa.

00:45.545 --> 00:49.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID YEPSEN, Southern Illinois
University: Every member of the
United States Senate who

00:49.416 --> 00:54.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has run comes through Iowa and
offers up an ethanol program.
Everyone has to worship at

00:54.054 --> 00:55.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the altar of ethanol.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:58.859 --> 01:04.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:04.665 --> 01:17.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: United Nations
health experts issued a powerful
new warning today about

01:17.711 --> 01:22.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Zika virus. The World Health
Organization said it may have
mushroomed into a full-blown

01:22.182 --> 01:24.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
global emergency.

01:24.785 --> 01:28.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARGARET CHAN, Director
General, World Health
Organization: It is now
spreading explosively.

01:28.488 --> 01:34.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The sense of
urgency was palpable as WHO
Director Margaret Chan addressed
a

01:34.428 --> 01:38.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
special session on the
Zika virus in Geneva.

01:38.432 --> 01:44.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. MARGARET CHAN: As of today,
cases have been reported in 23
countries and territories

01:44.571 --> 01:49.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the region. The level of
alarm is extremely high.

01:49.810 --> 01:54.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Most of the
outbreak has been concentrated
across Central and South
America.

01:54.915 --> 02:00.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WHO officials estimated today
there could be three to four
million cases in the Americas

02:00.621 --> 02:04.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the next year alone.

02:04.491 --> 02:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brazil, hosting this summer's
Olympics, has been hit the
hardest, with more than a
million

02:09.896 --> 02:16.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people contracting the virus.
Fear has spiked there with a
rise in birth defects apparently

02:16.470 --> 02:22.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caused by Zika, babies born with
small heads, known as
microcephaly, and with
neurological

02:22.776 --> 02:24.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems.

02:24.277 --> 02:30.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. MARGARET CHAN: The possible
links, only recently suspected,
have rapidly changed the

02:30.450 --> 02:36.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
risk profile of Zika from a mild
threat to one of alarming
proportions.

02:36.590 --> 02:42.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Researchers say
it's still relatively rare that
a pregnant woman infected

02:42.396 --> 02:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the time of delivery can
pass the virus to her newborn.
There's also been one report

02:48.568 --> 02:54.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a possible spread through
blood transfusion, and another
through sexual contact.

02:54.875 --> 03:00.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Brazil's President Dilma
Rousseff announced a meeting of
Latin American and Caribbean

03:00.614 --> 03:08.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nations next week on how to
eradicate the virus. In the
meantime, some 220,000 Brazilian

03:08.655 --> 03:14.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soldiers are going house to
house, checking for stagnant
water and fumigating for
mosquitoes

03:14.327 --> 03:17.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that transmit Zika.

03:17.364 --> 03:24.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
El Salvador has taken still more
drastic measures. Last week, its
deputy health minister urged

03:24.504 --> 03:31.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women to refrain from getting
pregnant before 2018. At least
31 Americans were infected

03:31.745 --> 03:35.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the past year, but all are
believed to have contracted the
virus after traveling

03:35.582 --> 03:38.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to affected areas.

03:38.718 --> 03:45.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For now, there is no cure, and
the WHO says it could take years
to get a vaccine.

03:45.192 --> 03:51.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SYLVAIN ALDIGHIERI, World
Health Organization: There is no
immunity. So we would expect
huge

03:51.131 --> 03:56.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
numbers of infections, some
detected, some not detected.

03:56.203 --> 04:01.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The agency was
criticized for not moving
quickly enough on the Ebola
outbreak.

04:01.808 --> 04:06.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's calling a crisis
meeting for Monday on whether to
declare Zika an international

04:06.246 --> 04:08.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health emergency.

04:08.682 --> 04:14.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We will get an expert
perspective on Zika after the
news summary.

04:14.554 --> 04:19.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An armed militia group is down
to its last four holdouts at a
wildlife refuge in Eastern

04:19.826 --> 04:25.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Oregon. Three more surrendered
overnight, a day after seven
were arrested and one was

04:25.799 --> 04:30.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed in a shoot-out. Their
jailed leader, Ammon Bundy, is
now urging the rest to -- quote

04:30.570 --> 04:32.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- "stand down and go home."

04:32.506 --> 04:35.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His lawyer read a statement
from Bundy today.

04:35.542 --> 04:42.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISSA CASEY, Attorney for Ammon
Bundy: Turn yourselves in. Do
not use physical force.

04:42.849 --> 04:49.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Use the national platform that
we have to continue to defend
liberty through our
constitutional

04:49.289 --> 04:55.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right in an Article 3 court
with an Article 3 judge.

04:55.328 --> 05:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a YouTube
video posted today, one of the
remaining militia members said

05:00.567 --> 05:07.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're willing to depart the
refuge, if police promise they
won't be arrested.

05:07.207 --> 05:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dangerous winter sea crossings
to Europe turned deadly again
today. At least 25 migrants
drowned

05:12.946 --> 05:17.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when their boat sank off the
Greek island of Samos en route
from Turkey. Meanwhile,

05:17.918 --> 05:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Italian navy rescued nearly
300 people, and recovered six
bodies off Sicily.

05:25.091 --> 05:30.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon has announced it's
doubling paid maternity leave to
12 weeks for women in uniform

05:30.964 --> 05:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and military child care centers
will stay open longer.

05:35.635 --> 05:39.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Defense Secretary Ash Carter
said it's part of an effort to
recruit and retain a top-flight

05:39.339 --> 05:40.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
military.

05:40.907 --> 05:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: We will become a more
powerful magnet for the

05:44.544 --> 05:48.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
high-end talent we will need in
the coming generation. We will
make it easier to retain

05:48.949 --> 05:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the top talent we have and
to develop future leaders.

05:53.553 --> 05:59.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Carter also
called for greater health care
benefits for military women.

05:59.593 --> 06:04.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NASA today marked the 30th
anniversary of the Challenger
disaster. Six astronauts and

06:04.598 --> 06:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a teacher were killed on January
28, 1986, when a booster
exploded and blew the shuttle

06:11.905 --> 06:16.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
apart. The crew of the
International Space Station
observed a moment of silence
today,

06:16.610 --> 06:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a ceremony at Cape Canaveral
honored the men and women of
Challenger.

06:21.047 --> 06:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB CABANA, Director, Kennedy
Space Center: They continue to
motivate us to explore and

06:26.019 --> 06:32.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to never quit just because it's
hard. We are better for having
known them. They are a part

06:32.959 --> 06:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of us forever and we will
never let them down.

06:36.696 --> 06:41.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
longer look at the Challenger
later in the program.

06:41.801 --> 06:46.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A former Providence, Rhode
Island, mayor who became a
larger-than-life figure has
died.

06:46.740 --> 06:52.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Buddy Cianci passed away this
morning in a Providence
hospital. He spent 21 years as

06:52.545 --> 06:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mayor, helped revitalize the
city and gained national
attention, but ultimately went
to

06:56.916 --> 07:02.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
federal prison for corruption.
Buddy Cianci was 74 years old.

07:02.856 --> 07:08.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street gained ground for a
change today, as oil prices
climbed again. The Dow Jones

07:08.094 --> 07:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industrial average was up 125
points to close near 16070. The
Nasdaq rose 38 points, and

07:15.168 --> 07:19.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the S&amp;P 500 added 10.

07:19.539 --> 07:26.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turns out Hawaii and Alaska
are the places to be for your
own well-being. An annual
Gallup/Healthways

07:26.713 --> 07:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
survey of all 50 states finds
Hawaii is number one when it
comes to a sense of well-being

07:33.186 --> 07:39.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the fifth time since 2008.
Alaska is second, after coming
in first last year, and is
followed

07:39.893 --> 07:44.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Montana, Colorado, and
Wyoming. And at the bottom, West
Virginia has the lowest ranking

07:44.998 --> 07:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the seventh straight year.

07:48.201 --> 07:54.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, finally, new times in toy
land. Mattel announced today
that Barbie dolls will now

07:54.074 --> 08:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be sold in three body types,
curvy, tall and petite, plus new
skin tones and hair styles,

08:01.948 --> 08:07.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reflect a more diverse view
of beauty. And LEGO confirmed
there's a figure in a wheelchair

08:07.420 --> 08:13.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in an upcoming set. It's the
company's first depiction of
disabilities ever.

08:13.526 --> 08:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what you need to know about the
rapidly spreading Zika

08:17.964 --> 08:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
virus; an American student freed
from an Iranian prison speaks
out; when corn becomes
political,

08:24.671 --> 08:43.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ethanol debate ahead of the
Iowa caucuses; and much more.

08:43.556 --> 08:49.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just weeks ago, hardly anyone in
the U.S. knew what the Zika
virus was, much less worried

08:49.062 --> 08:54.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about it. But the World Health
Organization's warning today put
the Americas, including

08:54.267 --> 08:59.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S., on new notice. And,
suddenly, a mosquito-borne virus
is raising serious fears,

08:59.773 --> 09:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
especially for pregnant women.

09:03.176 --> 09:08.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Anthony Fauci is with the
National Institutes of Health,
and he updated the situation
today.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He joins us now from
the NIH campus.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Welcome back to the
program, Dr. Fauci.

09:13.953 --> 09:17.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Just how high a level
of concern is there?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, Director,
National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases: Well,

09:18.258 --> 09:24.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we certainly are taking this
very seriously. This is a new
virus for the Western Hemisphere

09:24.564 --> 09:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the Americas. And it's been
explosive in its outbreak in
South America and in the

09:28.301 --> 09:31.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Caribbean.

09:31.037 --> 09:36.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the issues that you
mentioned that's important is
that it is associated, at least

09:36.810 --> 09:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
temporally and geographically,
with a disturbing increase in
the incidence of a very serious

09:42.949 --> 09:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complication of pregnancy, and
that is fetuses having what's
called microcephaly.

09:48.721 --> 09:54.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And microcephaly is a problem
with the brain where the skull
and the head is small, and

09:54.861 --> 09:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a developmental problem
and/or a damage problem to the
brain, leading to dire
consequences,

09:58.798 --> 10:02.869 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
often death, but
major impairment.

10:02.869 --> 10:08.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Zika as a virus infection itself
is relatively mild, and that's
the reason why it's been

10:08.675 --> 10:14.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
essentially off the radar screen
of people until it came in with
a vengeance to South

10:14.147 --> 10:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America. It causes a mild
illness that lasts anywhere from
three to five to seven days,

10:19.018 --> 10:22.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and then it goes away,
and you're fine.

10:22.021 --> 10:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the potential complication
that we're seeing in South
America and in the Caribbean

10:28.995 --> 10:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with regard to pregnancy. And
it's interesting, because it's
an association that hasn't been

10:32.866 --> 10:36.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
completely proven to
be cause and effect.

10:36.769 --> 10:41.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It certainly is associated, and
it's puzzling, and we're trying
to figure out just what the

10:41.341 --> 10:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nature of this association is
between infection and pregnant
women and this problem of
microcephaly

10:46.613 --> 10:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the fetus and in the infant.

10:48.481 --> 10:52.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it understood
why this is spreading so fast?

10:52.318 --> 10:57.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, one of
the reasons that we see spread
like this, Judy, is that,

10:57.624 --> 11:03.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up until now, South America and
the Caribbean has been what we
call immunologically naive

11:03.429 --> 11:10.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Zika virus. They have never
had Zika virus in the Western
Hemisphere or in the Americas.

11:10.003 --> 11:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when a new infection like
this comes in, there's no
background immunity in the

11:14.974 --> 11:21.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
population that would blunt the
outbreak that we're seeing now,
whereas something like dengue

11:21.314 --> 11:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
infection has been prevalent in
South America, particularly in
Brazil, for several years

11:26.386 --> 11:32.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now. So there's that background
immunity to it. No such immunity
with Zika.

11:32.025 --> 11:37.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's perfectly new to them,
which makes it much, much easier
to explode in the population.

11:37.230 --> 11:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That, together with the fact
that they're loaded with
mosquitoes, who are the vectors

11:42.802 --> 11:48.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of this particular virus
infection. The Aedes aegypti
mosquitoes are all over South
America

11:48.141 --> 11:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Brazil, and that's the
perfect vector to spread this
infection.

11:52.111 --> 11:56.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we have
talked about pregnant women.
Should everyone be concerned?

11:56.182 --> 11:59.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Just women? I mean, who
should be most worried?

11:59.085 --> 12:03.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Well,
certainly the focus is on women
who are pregnant.

12:03.656 --> 12:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is the reason why the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the CDC, has

12:08.995 --> 12:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given a guideline travel alert
that, if an individual, a woman
is pregnant, planning

12:14.934 --> 12:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be pregnant, not sure if
they're pregnant, they should
seriously consider postponing

12:19.105 --> 12:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any travel to this region.

12:22.241 --> 12:28.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is recommended that they
actually postpone until this
situation gets clarified because

12:28.047 --> 12:31.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of this association with
this dire consequence.

12:31.384 --> 12:36.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
for men? I mean, for men who
contract the virus, can they can

12:36.189 --> 12:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they pass it onto a woman
through sexual contact?

12:39.025 --> 12:41.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Well,
that's a good question.

12:41.861 --> 12:45.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What has happened is, first of
all, for a man who has no issue
with passing it on to

12:45.999 --> 12:53.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a woman sexually, it's a mild
illness. But there is a single
case that has been reported

12:53.172 --> 12:59.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a man who was infected in the
region, went home to his wife,
had sex with his wife, and

12:59.345 --> 13:03.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she definitely got infected with
Zika, and she had never left the
country.

13:03.383 --> 13:11.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's one example. We don't
know if that's an outlier that's
a very rare event, or if

13:11.190 --> 13:16.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is something that we will
see more commonly. And the way
you find out is do careful
following

13:16.863 --> 13:21.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and natural history studies and
case control studies. So we're
paying close attention to

13:21.434 --> 13:24.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that. We're not sure how
significant it's going to be.

13:24.904 --> 13:29.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as we
reported a minute ago, there's
no vaccine yet, no treatment.

13:29.242 --> 13:34.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: That is
correct. Vaccines under certain
circumstances such as this,

13:34.147 --> 13:40.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a new virus and a new
disease, generally take a few
years before you have a vaccine

13:40.553 --> 13:45.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that's approved by the
regulatory authorities and ready
to be distributed.

13:45.158 --> 13:50.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're not thinking about
that for at least another three
to five years. However, since

13:50.463 --> 13:56.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have experience with similar
viruses, we are now in the
process of beginning the early

13:56.002 --> 14:03.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stages of developing a vaccine
for a phase one trial to
determine safety and whether

14:03.276 --> 14:06.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or not it induces the
proper immune response.

14:06.512 --> 14:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we fully expect that we will
be able to be into that phase
one trial within the calendar

14:11.150 --> 14:14.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
year of 2016.

14:14.087 --> 14:19.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And beyond that,
just warning people to stay away
from these affected areas.

14:19.058 --> 14:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, that's
the truth. In other words, you
have got to be careful,

14:22.695 --> 14:25.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particularly with pregnant
women, to make sure that if they
are pregnant, that they

14:25.998 --> 14:30.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go by the CDC guidelines and, as
best as possible, avoid travel
to these areas.

14:30.903 --> 14:35.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Tony Fauci
at the NIH, we thank you.

14:35.374 --> 14:47.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI:
Good to be with you.

14:47.153 --> 14:53.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we return to
the stories of the Americans
recently freed from detention

14:53.860 --> 14:59.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Iran, and turn to our
interview with one of those set
free on January 16.

14:59.098 --> 15:01.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For that, we go to
Hari Sreenivasan.

15:01.601 --> 15:06.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We heard for
the first time today from Jason
Rezaian, the Washington Post

15:06.439 --> 15:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporter released from more than
500 days' imprisonment by
Iranian authorities. He was

15:12.378 --> 15:16.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of a prisoner swap with
Iran that released four
Americans in exchange for
Iranians here

15:16.048 --> 15:17.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the U.S.

15:17.884 --> 15:21.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Rezaian spoke at the
headquarters of the paper this
morning.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON REZAIAN, Journalist
Detained in Iran: For much of
the 18 months I was in prison,

15:24.924 --> 15:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my Iranian interrogators told me
that The Washington Post didn't
exist, that no one

15:30.096 --> 15:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knew of my plight, and that the
United States government
wouldn't lift a finger for my
release.

15:38.037 --> 15:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, I'm here in this room
with the very people who helped
prove the Iranians wrong

15:43.543 --> 15:46.212 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in so many ways.

15:46.212 --> 15:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There was a
fifth American released from
prison in Iran, separate from

15:50.683 --> 15:54.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the deal that freed Rezaian and
three others. His name is
Matthew Trevithick, and he had

15:54.887 --> 15:59.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been held for 40 days in
Tehran's notorious Evin prison.

15:59.325 --> 16:03.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trevithick was in Tehran to
study Farsi when he was detained
late last year.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins me now from New York.

16:05.898 --> 16:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, why were you in prison?
What did the authorities say?

16:09.502 --> 16:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK, Freed From
Iranian Prison: So, I was
arrested and accused of trying
to

16:15.374 --> 16:22.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
overthrow the Iranian
government. And they said I had
access to bank accounts with
millions

16:22.315 --> 16:29.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of dollars in them, and that I
knew the locations of weapons
caches around the country.

16:29.655 --> 16:35.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I pointed out to them
that the only things I had in my
possession were Farsi textbooks,

16:35.428 --> 16:39.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a newspaper or two, some flash
cards and a pencil, well, they
weren't very happy to hear

16:39.398 --> 16:40.499 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right. So what
happened? How were you arrested?

16:43.302 --> 16:48.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK: On my way to
buy my plane ticket home, I had
just talked with my parents

16:48.307 --> 16:52.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the day before on Skype and
said, really looking to being
home -- really looking forward
to

16:52.979 --> 16:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being home for Christmas and New
Year's, and I think my time here
is done. I have been

16:58.084 --> 17:02.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here for just over three months.
And I have seen some things, and
it's time to come home.

17:02.688 --> 17:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next morning, I was walking
outside of the dorm. It's a
student dorm at Tehran
University.

17:08.728 --> 17:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just, you know, a few feet
from the front gate, three men
jumped out of a car, asked

17:14.300 --> 17:18.337 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
me one question,
"Matthew?" I said, "Yes."

17:18.337 --> 17:22.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they pushed me into the
backseat, and off we went to
Evin prison.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: When were the
conditions in that prison like?
What was the room you

17:24.043 --> 17:26.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were staying in like?

17:26.412 --> 17:32.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK: I was in
solitary confinement for 29
days. And it's a very small
room. It's

17:32.685 --> 17:37.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about six-feet-by-seven-feet, as
I measured it. And I'm just over
six feet tall myself,

17:37.623 --> 17:41.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so this makes for a pretty
cramped -- pretty cramped
living.

17:41.360 --> 17:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no bed. There's no
pillow. You know, it's a
concrete floor with a very thin
carpet

17:46.832 --> 17:53.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over it that's been very worn.
And, you know, that feeling of
worn, of things being used

17:53.172 --> 17:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was very -- I mean, it was a
very consistent theme in my
time.

17:57.810 --> 18:03.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Inside the prison, you are very
well -- you're very aware that
you're in a place where a

18:03.382 --> 18:08.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of people have been before
you, and most likely a lot of
people will be after you.

18:08.187 --> 18:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You were in
solitary for that long. Did you
meet other prisoners in

18:11.457 --> 18:13.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the time that you were not,
and what were they in for?

18:13.526 --> 18:15.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK: I did.

18:15.528 --> 18:19.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I started to cross paths
with other prisoners, I was
moved out of solitary
confinement at

18:19.665 --> 18:25.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the evening of day 29, and
stayed in what they referred to
as a suite -- I disagreed

18:25.271 --> 18:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with their terminology a bit --
where two other prisoners there
were, and they had seen

18:29.275 --> 18:32.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other prisoners come
and go as well.

18:32.712 --> 18:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's, I think, when you
start to become more aware of
who you are sharing this
building

18:37.583 --> 18:41.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with. It was there that I
learned that Jason Rezaian was
downstairs. It was there that

18:41.988 --> 18:48.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I learned that newspaper
editors, journalists,
dissidents, artists, poets,
intellectuals,

18:48.361 --> 18:52.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
et cetera, were all
in the cells nearby.

18:52.765 --> 18:58.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, that also -- you
draw a small amount of comfort
from knowing who you're

18:58.070 --> 19:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sharing this building with.

19:00.840 --> 19:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
Jason Rezaian mentioned today
that he was constantly told

19:04.043 --> 19:08.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the paper that he worked
for didn't exist, right?

19:08.147 --> 19:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you're in solitary, you
obviously have no access to
information that the rest of

19:11.283 --> 19:15.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world is trying to work on
behalf of you to try to get you
released. What kept you

19:15.788 --> 19:18.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going through all this?

19:18.224 --> 19:21.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK: You know, in
fact, before I answer your
question, the very first
sentence

19:21.660 --> 19:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they said to me on day one, you
know, within an hour of being
taken off the street, my

19:27.233 --> 19:32.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interrogators pacing the --
right behind me, and I'm facing
a wall and can't see his face.

19:32.104 --> 19:35.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he says, "Do you know
who Jason Rezaian is?"

19:35.541 --> 19:39.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said, "Of course. The whole
world knows that name." And he
said, next sentence, "He's

19:39.578 --> 19:42.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
never leaving, and
neither are you."

19:42.448 --> 19:49.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was the tone by which
we started. That set the tone
for my time there.

19:49.255 --> 19:52.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, did you
imagine that the United States
government was working on

19:52.591 --> 19:54.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your behalf or your parents?

19:54.293 --> 19:56.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK:
Yes, absolutely.

19:56.529 --> 20:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had a very simple check-in
system with my mother every day.
We'd shoot each other a

20:01.467 --> 20:04.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
text note, and say, hi, Matt.
How is everything? Hi, mom,
everything is going really well.

20:04.837 --> 20:08.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thanks. Or everything
is going fine. Thanks.

20:08.441 --> 20:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think when I started to
not reply to those messages, she
got a little more concerned.

20:15.414 --> 20:21.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then something very bizarre
happened. On day three, they
hand me my phone, and they

20:21.420 --> 20:24.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, we want you to call your
mother. And they had prepared a
very stilted script that

20:24.857 --> 20:28.694 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I had to kind of
regurgitate from memory.

20:28.694 --> 20:32.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said, call your mother
and tell her you're going to the
mountains for a while

20:32.765 --> 20:38.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and will not be in
communication. And, of course,
calling a mother and trying to
say

20:38.904 --> 20:41.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything is fine when it's not
fine, I don't think that ever
works.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

20:43.242 --> 20:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK: And -- but,
no, I mean, to answer your
question, you know, in my time

20:48.447 --> 20:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overseas in the Middle East and
Central Asia, you know, you
start to become aware of just

20:54.153 --> 21:02.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how hard so many people work the
minute an American goes missing
anywhere.

21:02.328 --> 21:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I spent time in the cell
wondering who got my file on
Christmas and who got my file

21:07.900 --> 21:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on New Year's, and I kind of
felt a little guilty about that.

21:10.703 --> 21:14.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Hey, you sent
out a tweet today that I wanted
a little explanation of.

21:14.273 --> 21:18.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It says basically this photo
sums up your entire feelings
about Iran. It was a -- tell

21:18.444 --> 21:21.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
me what, does that mean?

21:21.580 --> 21:27.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK: So, it's a
photo. I'm at the Golestan
Palace in Tehran. And the

21:27.953 --> 21:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
backdrop of the photograph is
beautiful Persian artwork, you
know, traditional mosaic tiling.

21:36.896 --> 21:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's absolutely captivating.
And, you know, so in one sense,
that, you know, deep

21:44.069 --> 21:52.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beauty and sort of romance is --
of the culture is demonstrated
in the photograph. And then

21:52.077 --> 21:56.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on one side of the photograph,
my friend who took the picture
just managed to capture the

21:56.815 --> 22:01.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that, you know, somebody in
uniform was watching me as I
posed and smiled for the

22:01.020 --> 22:03.522 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
picture.

22:03.522 --> 22:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just think that that sense
of always being watched and
always being under surveillance

22:11.964 --> 22:17.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is what some Iranians live with
and it's what all foreigners
know is happening. And, you

22:17.169 --> 22:19.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, you do -- you hope to deal
with one more than the other.

22:19.972 --> 22:23.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, you
have worked in Afghanistan for a
number of years. You

22:23.742 --> 22:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have lived in Turkey. This is
part of your life's work. Do you
plan to go back to the

22:28.214 --> 22:30.516 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
region? What are
your plans next?

22:30.516 --> 22:32.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK: I will
certainly be heading back, but I
think Iran and I have had enough

22:32.384 --> 22:34.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for now.

22:34.253 --> 22:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Matthew, thanks so much for
joining us.

22:37.223 --> 22:46.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATTHEW TREVITHICK:
Absolutely. Thank you.

22:46.532 --> 22:52.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:52.838 --> 22:58.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
end of economic growth as we
know it; 30 years after the
Challenger

22:58.944 --> 23:05.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
space shuttle tragedy; and
Radiolab's host on the
timelessness of his profession.

23:05.451 --> 23:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, we are getting close
to voting time in the
presidential race, and it seems

23:10.256 --> 23:15.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this wild campaign
continues to surprise.

23:15.261 --> 23:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now on this night
when most, but apparently not
all, Republicans will be
debating,

23:19.198 --> 23:20.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is our political director,
Lisa Desjardins.

23:20.799 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hello, again, Lisa.

23:21.967 --> 23:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Whew. Hello.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hello.

23:24.903 --> 23:30.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Donald Trump,by saying he is
not going to be in this debate
tonight, manages to be

23:30.709 --> 23:34.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right in the center of the
limelight, all over a dispute
he's been having with FOX News

23:34.980 --> 23:35.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Channel.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

23:37.316 --> 23:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's going on
here? You have been talking to
people.

23:38.350 --> 23:39.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

23:39.551 --> 23:42.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is it that
they think Trump is trying to
do?

23:42.288 --> 23:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: When you talk
to people, Republican
operatives, about this, they
think

23:45.624 --> 23:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump is trying to show that he
defies the rules that he doesn't
like, that he deifies

23:49.561 --> 23:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the establishment when he thinks
the establishment is wrong.

23:53.432 --> 23:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His supporters love this, Judy.
They think, here is someone who
can finally not just say

23:58.137 --> 24:00.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they're going to change
Washington, but will do things
unexpected that will make a
difference,

24:00.572 --> 24:02.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take action.

24:02.741 --> 24:07.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, of course, his opponents
say this shows an unpredictable
candidate who operates and

24:07.012 --> 24:10.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reacts on emotion,
not substance.

24:10.616 --> 24:15.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he is taking a risk there,
but it seems his supporters
really love him doing this.

24:15.521 --> 24:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, he's using the
proceeds to benefit veterans,
but even there is an interesting

24:18.924 --> 24:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sign about Trump. We don't know
yet what veterans groups it is
supporting. He hasn't announced

24:22.328 --> 24:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it. The event is tonight.

24:24.797 --> 24:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's Trump again making a
statement, but not giving us
details.

24:28.334 --> 24:31.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, meanwhile,
what about the Republicans who
are going to be showing

24:31.770 --> 24:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up on the debate stage tonight?
This is an unusual moment for
them. What do they need

24:34.506 --> 24:35.374 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do?

24:35.374 --> 24:37.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

24:37.209 --> 24:40.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the prime-time debate, there
are still seven other
Republicans who each of them
think

24:40.979 --> 24:44.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they still have a chance to be
president, and for most of them,
Judy, tonight is make

24:44.116 --> 24:47.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or break. Let's start
with Ted Cruz.

24:47.553 --> 24:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, he is right there with
Donald Trump, in a sense, or
they're fighting for a lot

24:51.957 --> 24:56.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the same space. But when I
talk to operatives about him,
they say Ted Cruz was doing fine

24:56.895 --> 25:01.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he didn't engage with
Donald Trump. In the last week,
he has engaged, Judy, and Ted

25:01.867 --> 25:05.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz hasn't really landed any
punches on Donald Trump. It has
not shown a strength for Ted

25:05.270 --> 25:07.239 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Cruz.

25:07.239 --> 25:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he has a major decision
tonight for everyone watching
the debate. Does Ted Cruz go
after

25:11.009 --> 25:16.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump or not? Then you
turn to the rest of the field. I
think this could be a

25:16.115 --> 25:20.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very important night for John
Kasich. Talking to people in New
Hampshire, Judy, there is

25:20.552 --> 25:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a tremendous amount of interest
in John Kasich. He seems to be
sort of rising as someone people

25:25.624 --> 25:28.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are looking to as very human,
practical, and smart, and I
think he needs to stand out on

25:28.894 --> 25:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his own two feet tonight.

25:32.064 --> 25:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meantime, you
have got the other party, the
Democrats, again being
overshadowed,

25:36.969 --> 25:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but Bernie Sanders out with a
new ad and announcing a
different position on an
important issue.

25:41.940 --> 25:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right,
starting with the ad. This is an
ad that doesn't name anyone,

25:45.411 --> 25:49.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but does say that there's a
problem with Wall Street
donating too much money to
political

25:49.348 --> 25:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaigns and politicians.

25:52.151 --> 25:56.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think Bernie Sanders is
talking about Ross Perot.
Clearly, this is a swipe at
Hillary

25:56.655 --> 26:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton. The Clinton campaign
came out today and said they see
this as an attack ad, that

26:00.359 --> 26:04.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Bernie Sanders has gone
negative. Clearly, he's making a
move here.

26:04.763 --> 26:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time as he's going
on office against her, he is
going on defense. He announced

26:09.201 --> 26:15.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today that he is co-sponsoring a
bill that would reverse a bill
he voted for on guns

26:15.841 --> 26:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 2005. Many of our viewers
know that's the controversial
bill that would protect some

26:19.645 --> 26:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gun makers from civil lawsuits.

26:23.182 --> 26:27.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders supported it in the
past. He's reversed his position
this January. Clinton's gone

26:27.719 --> 26:29.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after him again and again in
debates. It will be interesting
to see what happens in our

26:29.988 --> 26:32.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
debate coming up in a
couple weeks on that.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this
happening just five days before
the caucuses.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's a lot.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's
a lot to digest.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins, keeping
track of it all, thank you.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

26:42.201 --> 26:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we
turn to the politics of corn.

26:45.971 --> 26:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The issue of ethanol briefly
took center stage in Iowa last
week, when Governor Terry
Branstad

26:51.243 --> 26:56.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
declared caucus-goers should
choose anyone but Senator Ted
Cruz for president.

26:56.982 --> 27:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz has promised to repeal the
law that requires ethanol in the
nation's fuel supply.

27:03.088 --> 27:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Biello is the senior
energy and environment editor
with "Scientific American," and
he

27:07.960 --> 27:10.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is working with Detroit Public
Television on a documentary
about ethanol that will air

27:10.696 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this fall.

27:12.064 --> 27:15.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He reports for us from Iowa.

27:15.734 --> 27:21.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Pocahontas, Iowa,
one of the many small-town stops
on Senator Ted Cruz's

27:21.740 --> 27:26.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bus tour.

27:26.178 --> 27:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz is being followed by an
R.V., calling him out for his
opposition to ethanol. This

27:31.617 --> 27:35.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shadow campaign comes courtesy
America's Renewable Future, a
pro-ethanol group.

27:35.287 --> 27:35.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Good morning.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.655 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: Hi.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Here's some information
on Iowa's economy.

27:37.523 --> 27:38.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Thank you.

27:38.056 --> 27:40.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Yes. Thanks.

27:40.192 --> 27:43.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate: Because
I don't believe Washington
should

27:43.128 --> 27:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pick winners or losers, I
believe we should end the RFS
and phase it out over five
years.

27:48.700 --> 27:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: The Renewable Fuel
Standard, the RFS, was created
by Congress 10 years

27:53.839 --> 27:58.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago. It's regulated by the
Environmental Protection Agency,
and requires 10 percent ethanol
to

27:58.877 --> 28:03.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

percent of our gasoline.

28:03.882 --> 28:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most ethanol comes from corn.
And Iowa is the heart of the
Corn Belt. Ethanol is now

28:09.121 --> 28:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of the fabric of the
Iowa's rural economy.

28:13.058 --> 28:17.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Craig Peterson's farm in Dayton,
Iowa, has been in his family for
nearly 150 years.

28:17.629 --> 28:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRAIG PETERSON, Iowa Farmer: A
lot of my corn goes to the local
elevators, and they haul

28:22.534 --> 28:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it right to the ethanol plants.
There's like three ethanol
plants 25 miles away.

28:27.172 --> 28:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SWENSON, Iowa State
University: You're not allowed
to talk bad about ethanol. This

28:28.473 --> 28:30.976 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is Iowa.

28:30.976 --> 28:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: David Swenson is
an Iowa State University
economist.

28:33.912 --> 28:39.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SWENSON: It's no different
than if you bad-mouth coal in
West Virginia or timber

28:39.785 --> 28:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Oregon. You're going to get
blowback, no matter what
happens. And that's the way it

28:42.487 --> 28:45.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is with ethanol in
the state of Iowa.

28:45.824 --> 28:51.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: David Yepsen has
covered Iowa politics for more
than 30 years.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID YEPSEN, Southern Illinois
University: Over the years, the
biggest winner of the

28:54.199 --> 28:59.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iowa caucuses has been the
ethanol industry. And I say that
because every member of the

28:59.271 --> 29:05.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States Senate who has run
comes through Iowa and offers up
an ethanol program. Everyone

29:05.043 --> 29:08.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has to worship at the
altar of ethanol.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: We found Donald
Trump at a renewable fuels
conference in Altoona, just
outside

29:10.949 --> 29:11.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Des Moines.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: What convinced
you on ethanol?

29:14.653 --> 29:17.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: I just feel strongly
we should do everything

29:17.856 --> 29:21.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we can to create fuel,
everything we can to create
fuel.

29:21.426 --> 29:25.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Democrats Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders
support the RFS too. The ethanol

29:25.564 --> 29:29.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
debate this year is
just among Republicans.

29:29.768 --> 29:35.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eric Branstad, the son of Iowa's
popular Republican Governor
Terry Branstad, leads America's
Renewable

29:35.407 --> 29:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Future, that group following
Ted Cruz in the R.V.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ERIC BRANSTAD, America's
Renewable Future: I would say
that Carly Fiorina has turned

29:40.278 --> 29:43.649 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
into one of our
better candidates.

29:43.649 --> 29:47.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Branstad's ethanol
report card shows some
candidates have changed their
position

29:47.519 --> 29:51.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after setting foot in Iowa. Now
all but two make the grade.

29:51.456 --> 29:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Looking at this, it's kind of
an anybody but Cruz or Paul.

29:54.626 --> 29:57.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ERIC BRANSTAD: That's
what it comes down to.

29:57.129 --> 30:01.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: And neither
Senators Ted Cruz nor Rand Paul
have budged.

30:01.199 --> 30:02.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. RAND PAUL (R-KY),
Presidential Candidate: If push
comes to shove and I have to
vote

30:02.701 --> 30:06.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the Renewable Fuel Standard,
I'm not an advocate of it.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BIELLO: Ted Cruz
remains the big concern.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ: God bless
the great state of Iowa.

30:11.543 --> 30:15.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: He's near the top
of the polls with the caucuses
days away.

30:15.080 --> 30:19.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID YEPSEN: One of the reasons
you're hearing a lot about
ethanol now is that the industry

30:19.384 --> 30:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is very concerned that, if Ted
Cruz wins here, having shown
some question about Renewable

30:26.425 --> 30:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fuel Standards, it will open the
floodgate. It will make it
permissible for presidential

30:30.962 --> 30:35.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates not to support a
strong Renewable Fuel Standard.

30:35.734 --> 30:38.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC BRANSTAD: From his first
hour coming to Iowa, he put that
badge on and said that,

30:38.270 --> 30:41.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I am against the RFS, period.

30:41.106 --> 30:45.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Iowa Republican
Congressman Steve King supports
the RFS, but he's also

30:45.777 --> 30:50.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
national co-chair of Ted
Cruz's presidential campaign.

30:50.182 --> 30:55.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: King promised to fight
for Iowa's farmers, calling
ethanol and renewable fuels

30:55.253 --> 31:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our Holy Grail. But now King
calls Senator Ted Cruz the
answer to his prayers. Senator

31:01.560 --> 31:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cruz is fighting in Congress to
end the Renewable Fuel Standard.

31:05.097 --> 31:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BIELLO: Iowa
economist David Swenson:

31:08.166 --> 31:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SWENSON: Not only is
Representative King an ardent
supporter of ethanol. His
district

31:13.739 --> 31:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has the highest concentration of
ethanol plants in the United
States.

31:17.642 --> 31:22.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: King has said he
will defend the RFS, and will
even go against Cruz should

31:22.447 --> 31:28.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz become president. Here,
King explains his position to a
room full of ethanol producers.

31:28.253 --> 31:30.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. STEVE KING (R), Iowa: From
where I sit, as much as I care
about renewable fuels, it's

31:30.956 --> 31:33.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not the only thing.

31:33.125 --> 31:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: King says Cruz's
constitutional and moral
principles need support, despite

31:38.663 --> 31:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz's stand on the RFS. Cruz
does appear to have shifted a
bit on ethanol. Some feared

31:44.736 --> 31:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he'd repeal the RFS immediately.
Now it's a five-year phase-out.
But only recently,

31:50.575 --> 31:55.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's claimed to be even more
pro-ethanol than the others,
because its the RFS's fault
ethanol

31:55.046 --> 31:57.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hasn't reached its
full potential.

31:57.382 --> 32:03.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: You want to talk
about a big impact for Iowa for
corn farmers, for ethanol

32:03.054 --> 32:07.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
producers, getting rid of that
government barrier is a much,
much bigger deal than the

32:07.392 --> 32:09.361 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
RFS.

32:09.361 --> 32:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Dave Vander Griend
runs a Kansas-based ethanol
technology company. He wants the
RFS

32:14.566 --> 32:20.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eliminated too, and managed to
get Cruz's attention two months
ago. The EPA limits the

32:20.405 --> 32:26.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amount of ethanol in our fuel
supply to 10 percent, the
standard E10 most of us use,

32:26.578 --> 32:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or the less popular and less
available E85 you can use if you
have a flex-fuel vehicle.

32:32.083 --> 32:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVE VANDER GRIEND, CEO, ICM,
Inc.: What do I want to put in
my car? Do I want to put

32:35.420 --> 32:41.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an E10, E20, E30, E85? I want
those choices. I want those
opportunities and I want to be

32:41.059 --> 32:43.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
able to save money.

32:43.128 --> 32:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SWENSON: That's a fanciful
idea. And it doesn't feel very
good. They're saying

32:49.234 --> 32:55.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the ethanol industry can
produce ethanol more cheaply
than the petroleum industry can

32:55.707 --> 32:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
produce gasoline, and that they
can compete. There's no evidence
of that. There's absolutely

32:59.811 --> 33:01.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no evidence of that.

33:01.913 --> 33:08.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: A recent Des
Moines Register poll shows most
Iowans still favor the RFS.

33:08.320 --> 33:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But only one in five Iowans
actually works in an
agriculture-related industry.
The question

33:14.125 --> 33:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remains, how hard will Iowans
fight for ethanol in the
caucuses?

33:18.997 --> 33:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Yepsen doesn't think
ethanol will be a deciding
factor.

33:22.267 --> 33:27.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID YEPSEN: Other issues are
driving this election, national
security questions, social

33:27.272 --> 33:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues, and, most importantly,
what people think of the
candidate as a human being. You

33:31.309 --> 33:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, they don't sit there with
a clipboard and say ethanol, yes
or no, and that's how

33:33.712 --> 33:36.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they decide their vote.

33:36.147 --> 33:42.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: It's not just the
caucuses. Come November, if Ted
Cruz or Rand Paul wins

33:42.587 --> 33:45.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican nomination,
Iowans may just get another
chance to show just how much
they

33:45.891 --> 33:48.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
support ethanol.

33:48.727 --> 33:52.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
David Biello in Des Moines,
Iowa.

33:52.597 --> 33:57.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a reminder:
Tomorrow, I will be reporting
from Iowa on the race for

33:57.802 --> 34:01.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the White House. Be sure to tune
to the "NewsHour" all weekend
and Monday for the latest on the

34:01.606 --> 34:04.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Iowa caucuses.

34:04.309 --> 34:08.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will air at our regular time.
Plus, we will have a late-night
special report Monday

34:08.680 --> 34:24.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
night at 11:00 Eastern.

34:24.796 --> 34:29.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the key themes you hear
in this presidential campaign
is, why isn't the economy
growing

34:29.601 --> 34:34.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
faster and yielding even better
wages for workers? That question
isn't just a matter

34:34.005 --> 34:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of debate among politicians.

34:37.575 --> 34:41.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some economists are also
wondering if something
fundamental has changed in the
U.S. in recent

34:41.713 --> 34:43.548 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades.

34:43.548 --> 34:47.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the subject of tonight's
report by our economics
correspondent, Paul Solman.

34:47.786 --> 34:52.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his series, Making
Sense, which airs Thursdays.

34:52.424 --> 34:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: President Obama's
last of State of the Union
featured this proud
proclamation:

34:57.462 --> 35:00.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: Anyone claiming
that America's economy is

35:00.265 --> 35:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in decline is peddling fiction.

35:04.336 --> 35:09.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But really? Tell
that to eminent economist Robert
Gordon, a Democrat, who's

35:09.474 --> 35:15.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
peddling a distinctly
nonfictional new book, "The Rise
and Fall of American Growth."

35:15.480 --> 35:18.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON, Author, "The Rise
and Fall of American Growth":
Did you know that the

35:18.316 --> 35:22.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cable car dates back to 1870,
the beginning of what I call the
special century, when life

35:22.454 --> 35:25.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was revolutionized in
the United States?

35:25.857 --> 35:33.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A century that
ended in 1970, 46 years ago.
Gordon's thesis that slower

35:33.865 --> 35:40.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growth is the new normal in the
U.S. has sparked a major debate
in economics the past few years.

35:40.438 --> 35:43.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His book was a hot topic at this
year's meeting of the American
Economic Association in San

35:43.875 --> 35:45.176 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Francisco.

35:45.176 --> 35:48.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOB SHILLER, Nobel Laureate:
It's what you call a magnum
opus.

35:48.880 --> 35:53.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's Nobel
laureate Bob Shiller, this
year's president of the group,
who organized

35:53.718 --> 35:59.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a session on the new book and
chaired it himself to spotlight
Gordon and his special century

35:59.224 --> 36:01.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
thesis.

36:01.259 --> 36:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: A century that
freed households from an
unremitting daily grind of
gainful

36:06.097 --> 36:11.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
manual labor, household
drudgery, darkness, isolation
and early death.

36:11.803 --> 36:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: There seems little
dispute in economics these days
that 1870 to 1970 was

36:16.274 --> 36:18.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
technologically special.

36:18.710 --> 36:24.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: No one who hasn't cooked
over a wood stove by the light
of a kerosene lamp can

36:24.516 --> 36:24.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really appreciate
what it all means.

36:24.949 --> 36:27.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So it was an
amazing century, right?

36:27.252 --> 36:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology: It was
an amazing century.

36:29.320 --> 36:32.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We took so much muscle power,
things that used to be done by
horses or by humans, and

36:32.390 --> 36:34.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
replaced it with machines.

36:34.826 --> 36:38.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But MIT's Erik
Brynjolfsson doesn't buy the
argument that the U.S. economy's
best

36:38.430 --> 36:40.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
days are over.

36:40.732 --> 36:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON: We're now
just in the early stages of what
we sometimes call a second

36:43.802 --> 36:49.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
machine age, where we're
beginning to do the same things
for brainpower, things like
artificial

36:49.040 --> 36:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence, computers and big
data. And I think we're going to
see a productivity

36:52.544 --> 36:55.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wave the likes of which we
have never seen before.

36:55.313 --> 37:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: It's just a hope
that Erik has that these new
inventions of robots and

37:00.819 --> 37:04.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
artificial intelligence are
going to change the world on a
par with electricity and the

37:04.756 --> 37:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
internal combustion engine.

37:07.625 --> 37:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just think of the benefits of
getting rid of the urban horse.
Think of all the horse

37:11.396 --> 37:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
droppings all over the street
that we no longer have to think
about and clean up.

37:15.400 --> 37:19.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To counter those
who consider his cavalier
dismissal of high technology

37:19.337 --> 37:24.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so much, well, horse manure,
Gordon took us on an intimate
show-and-tell.

37:24.709 --> 37:27.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: Look at a few of
the things that were invented in
the special century

37:27.912 --> 37:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after 1870, starting with the
electric light, the greatest
invention of all. And now let's

37:33.418 --> 37:38.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
look at two of the great
inventions of all time. First,
we have running water, which

37:38.123 --> 37:42.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eliminated the need to carry
water into the house in pails.

37:42.594 --> 37:47.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we have the flush
toilet, which eliminated the
need to go outside into the
bitter cold

37:47.899 --> 37:54.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to an outhouse. And here we have
a double invention, central
heating and air conditioning.

37:54.339 --> 38:00.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have the telephone invented
in 1876. We have the television
set, partly invented here

38:00.278 --> 38:04.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in San Francisco by Philosophy
Farnsworth, and then look what
we have hidden down here,

38:04.315 --> 38:08.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a refrigerator, which eliminated
the contamination of food.

38:08.853 --> 38:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here we have the Golden Gate
Bridge, an example of the
tremendous investment in
infrastructure

38:13.791 --> 38:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that made our economy grow so
fast in the middle of the 20th
century. This bridge was

38:16.661 --> 38:18.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
finished in 1937.

38:18.563 --> 38:25.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: The Golden
Gate is bridged.

38:25.837 --> 38:27.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Put them all
together, says Gordon, and
there's been no comparable
stretch of

38:27.138 --> 38:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economic growth before or since.

38:31.609 --> 38:37.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: Here is the basic
point of my book. The early 20th
century, the middle

38:37.916 --> 38:43.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the 20th century between 1920
and 1970, and all the years
since then, and the role

38:43.421 --> 38:48.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of innovation and technology is
that black area at the bottom.
And when we highlight

38:48.426 --> 38:52.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it we see that in the middle of
the 20th century, we were
growing three times faster than
we

38:52.363 --> 38:55.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have been in the last 40 years.

38:55.099 --> 39:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And not only were
the really big inventions
already on the market by 1970.

39:01.506 --> 39:06.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This footage of the 1962 Seattle
World's Fair suggests the ones
we consider big today were

39:06.644 --> 39:09.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
already in the works.

39:09.514 --> 39:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: One day, you may be
able to call home and
automatically turn off the oven
or,

39:14.552 --> 39:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from a public telephone, water
the lawn during that dry spell
when you are many miles away

39:18.690 --> 39:21.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on vacation. Sounds
fantastic, doesn't it?

39:21.759 --> 39:25.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Critics like
Brynjolfsson don't dispute the
wonders of the past. They just

39:25.430 --> 39:28.266 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
think we haven't
seen anything yet.

39:28.266 --> 39:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON: It's been
said that the greatest failing
of the human mind is the

39:31.669 --> 39:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inability to understand the
exponential function. And that's
especially true in the computer

39:35.273 --> 39:39.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
era, where computer power
doubles about every 24 months or
so.

39:39.344 --> 39:44.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Exponential growth
like 2-4-8-16 and so on.

39:44.148 --> 39:48.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON: What that
does is, it leads us to
overestimate what's going to
happen

39:48.119 --> 39:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the short run, because at
first it's happening fairly
slowly, but then we
underestimate what

39:50.622 --> 39:51.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happens in the long run,
when things really take off.

39:51.856 --> 39:54.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Bob Gordon scoffs.

39:54.592 --> 39:57.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: But computers
have been riding this
exponential wave for the last 50
years,

39:57.962 --> 40:00.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and it's not shown
up in productivity.

40:00.031 --> 40:04.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In measured GDP
output per unit of labor, that
is.

40:04.535 --> 40:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: We have gone from
the mainframe to the personal
computer to the smartphone,

40:08.606 --> 40:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and only in the late 1990s did
we see a revival of productivity
growth of the kind of magnitude

40:15.280 --> 40:18.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to match the great old days of
electricity and the invention of
the motorcar and the

40:18.416 --> 40:20.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
airplane.

40:20.518 --> 40:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Productivity, says
Gordon, has slowed to a crawl
for years now, what's called

40:24.856 --> 40:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
long-term or secular stagnation.

40:28.393 --> 40:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIK BRYNJOLFSSON: The last time
people were talking a lot about
stagnation was in the

40:31.963 --> 40:37.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1930s. And guess what? The next
couple of decades were the best
decades ever for economic

40:37.135 --> 40:38.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
growth.

40:38.870 --> 40:43.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Admittedly,
Americans have been
techno-overoptimists before.

40:43.608 --> 40:49.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: The 9000 series is the
most reliable computer ever
made. We are all foolproof and

40:49.147 --> 40:51.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
incapable of error.

40:51.582 --> 40:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The year 2001 came
and went without any manned
space odysseys of note.

40:57.522 --> 41:00.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Open the pod
bay doors, Hal.

41:00.258 --> 41:03.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Much less ones with
the likes of artificially
intelligent Hal.

41:03.361 --> 41:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: I'm sorry, Dave. I'm
afraid I can't do that.

41:08.800 --> 41:14.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But most striking
to us is the near-universal
agreement about the headwinds

41:14.706 --> 41:20.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now facing U.S. economic growth:
problems in education, an aging
population, a huge

41:20.912 --> 41:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
national debt, and, most of
all, growing inequality.

41:27.018 --> 41:30.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economic historian Greg Clark
said he's long been a
techno-optimist. But after
reading

41:30.722 --> 41:32.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Gordon's book:

41:32.824 --> 41:34.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GREGORY CLARK, Economic
Historian, University of
California, Davis: I am actually
convinced

41:34.325 --> 41:38.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now that the best of America is
behind us in terms of economic
growth.

41:38.830 --> 41:44.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Clark titled his
talk "Winter Is Coming," a nod
to the grim TV series about

41:44.102 --> 41:48.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a more primitive time,
HBO's "Game of Thrones."

41:48.439 --> 41:53.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREGORY CLARK: I titled it that
way because I was struck, when I
looked at the future

41:53.778 --> 41:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the U.S. economy, how much it
was going to resemble the
medieval economy.

41:58.583 --> 42:00.952 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN: The
medieval economy?

42:00.952 --> 42:05.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY CLARK: The medieval
economy, in terms of the types
of jobs that people now are
doing,

42:05.790 --> 42:13.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gardening, food preparing,
serving, cleaning, bricklaying,
carpentry. You could get someone

42:13.030 --> 42:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from 1400, put them on the job
and in two hours, they'd be
perfectly functional.

42:17.402 --> 42:21.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Working, that
is, but hardly getting by.

42:21.339 --> 42:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to Robert Gordon, the
connection between stagnant
wages and today's political
unease

42:26.277 --> 42:28.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is obvious.

42:28.279 --> 42:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GORDON: Because the heart
of slow wage growth is slow
productivity growth. And added

42:33.351 --> 42:37.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to that is the inequality that
is siphoning off the little
productivity that we have got

42:37.622 --> 42:40.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the top 1 percent. And so
the bottom 99 percent have good
reason to be resentful

42:40.625 --> 42:43.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and anxious.

42:43.127 --> 42:46.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," this is economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting

42:46.931 --> 42:53.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from San Francisco.

42:53.371 --> 43:05.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
anniversary of the Challenger
shuttle tragedy, and how it
changed

43:05.349 --> 43:09.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the U.S. space program
for years to come.

43:09.120 --> 43:14.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was 30 years ago today when
we watched the Challenger
explode on live television

43:14.058 --> 43:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just a little more than a minute
after it lifted off. All seven
people aboard, including

43:19.030 --> 43:25.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a high school teacher who became
the first ordinary citizen to go
into space, were killed.

43:25.169 --> 43:28.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Ronald Reagan was
supposed to deliver the State of
the Union speech that night.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Instead, he spoke to the
country from the Oval Office.

43:31.576 --> 43:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here is some of what he said
in a video we produced.

43:35.746 --> 43:40.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Three, two, one, and
liftoff, liftoff of the 25th
space shuttle mission, and it

43:40.952 --> 43:43.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has cleared the tower.

43:43.020 --> 43:46.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Challenger, go
with throttle-up.

43:46.123 --> 43:51.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RONALD REAGAN, Former President
of the United States: Today is a
day for mourning and
remembering.

43:51.629 --> 43:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nancy and I are pained to the
core by the tragedy of the
shuttle Challenger. We know

43:56.767 --> 44:01.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we share this pain with all the
people of our country. This is
truly a national loss.

44:01.739 --> 44:04.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Here comes the
flight crew now.

44:04.842 --> 44:08.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RONALD REAGAN: We have never
lost an astronaut, not in
flight. We have never had a
tragedy

44:08.112 --> 44:10.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this.

44:10.548 --> 44:16.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And perhaps we've forgotten the
courage it took for the crew of
the shuttle, but they,

44:16.053 --> 44:22.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Challenger seven, were aware
of the dangers, but overcame
them and did their jobs
brilliantly.

44:22.326 --> 44:31.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We mourn seven heroes, Michael
Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith
Resnik, Ronald McNair, Ellison

44:31.068 --> 44:39.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and
Christa McAuliffe. We mourn
their loss as a nation together.

44:39.076 --> 44:43.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The crew of the space shuttle
Challenger honored us by the
manner in which they lived their

44:43.080 --> 44:50.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lives. We will never forget
them, nor the last time we saw
them, this morning, as they

44:50.021 --> 44:55.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prepared for their journey and
waved goodbye and slipped the
surly bonds of Earth to touch

44:55.359 --> 44:57.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the face of God.

44:57.495 --> 45:03.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was 1986.

45:03.501 --> 45:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has more about
that moment, that day, and the
years since.

45:08.339 --> 45:11.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spoke earlier today with our
science correspondent, Miles
O'Brien, who has extensively
covered

45:11.976 --> 45:13.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the space program.

45:13.411 --> 45:16.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Miles,
welcome to you.

45:16.914 --> 45:21.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, one of the reasons why
this is so remembered is because
it really is so personal,

45:21.719 --> 45:24.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so many people seeing it as it
happened on live television or
right afterwards. Do you

45:24.689 --> 45:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have a personal memory to share?

45:26.357 --> 45:28.960 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
MILES O'BRIEN: I
do. Don't we all?

45:28.960 --> 45:32.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thirty years ago, if you were
alive and old enough, you
remember where you were. I sent

45:32.129 --> 45:37.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a tweet out today and heard all
kinds of vivid stories that
people had.

45:37.068 --> 45:43.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For me, I was a local reporter
in Tampa, Florida. I had been up
all night in citrus groves
covering

45:43.674 --> 45:47.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the freeze, that historic
freeze, which ultimately led to
the loss of Challenger, was a
big deal

45:47.712 --> 45:50.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the citrus industry.

45:50.381 --> 45:55.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I was asleep when Challenger
exploded. I got a call from my
office, said, you better

45:55.453 --> 46:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wake up and get to work. And I
walked outside in Tampa,
Florida, 150 miles away, and
looked

46:00.858 --> 46:06.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up in the blue sky, and saw that
horrible, forked rocket plume.
You could see it that

46:06.163 --> 46:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
far away. And I looked at
it and was just stunned.

46:09.967 --> 46:15.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, of course,
the presence of Christa
McAuliffe, as a private citizen,

46:15.039 --> 46:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
captured the imagination of the
whole country at that time,
right? Remind us what her role

46:18.743 --> 46:21.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was. Why was she there?

46:21.012 --> 46:25.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: She was there as
the teacher in space, and she
had lesson plans, and she

46:25.850 --> 46:32.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was going to go into space and
teach children, you know, from
space about the wonders of

46:32.690 --> 46:36.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
physics and science.

46:36.127 --> 46:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she was an enthusiastic
teacher who won a competition to
be on the space shuttle.

46:42.733 --> 46:49.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And classrooms all over the
country were tuned in and
watching this launch live, so
excited

46:49.840 --> 46:53.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to think that a teacher would be
up there and speaking to them in
a matter of days and

46:53.577 --> 46:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teaching them about space, and
that turning in an instant to
just horror.

46:57.948 --> 47:02.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then, of
course, when you look back
through time and you look at the

47:02.386 --> 47:08.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact of what happened on the
shuttle program, on NASA, first
came, of course, a long
investigation

47:08.092 --> 47:09.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into exactly what had caused it.

47:09.727 --> 47:12.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

47:12.096 --> 47:18.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it really led to a big loss
of innocence, I think, for all
of us in how we viewed NASA.

47:18.069 --> 47:23.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, sure, in the Apollo
program, we lost three
astronauts, 19 years almost to

47:23.174 --> 47:28.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the day prior to Challenger on
the launchpad for Apollo 1, but
they were test pilots, and

47:28.746 --> 47:33.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they knew the score, and we were
in the midst of a space race.

47:33.084 --> 47:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the case of Challenger, it
was different. NASA was telling
us that space access would

47:37.455 --> 47:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be routine. The shuttle was
going to be a lot like an
airliner, so safe that we can

47:42.560 --> 47:46.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
put civilians on board,
including, on the previous
flight, then-Congressman Bill
Nelson,

47:46.464 --> 47:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and, of course, Christa
McAuliffe on this flight.

47:50.000 --> 47:54.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the idea that NASA was
telling us it was safe, and the
investigation laid bare the

47:54.638 --> 47:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that they knew it wasn't as
safe, and that they were
ignoring serious signs of
trouble

47:59.610 --> 48:02.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really changed the way
we all viewed NASA.

48:02.747 --> 48:08.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Columbia
shuttle disaster happened in
2003. You have been on the
program

48:08.519 --> 48:12.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a number of times. We have
talked about sort of where
things are at now, the program
coming

48:12.490 --> 48:19.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to an end in 2011. What -- how
do you think about the legacy of
Challenger and since?

48:19.363 --> 48:24.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's a great case
study in the limits of
technology and some of the
decisions

48:24.101 --> 48:27.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that are made in the
development of technology.

48:27.271 --> 48:32.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the key things to
remember here is, space shuttles
didn't have a crew escape
system.

48:32.276 --> 48:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it had a crew escape system,
those seven crew members would
have very likely survived

48:37.148 --> 48:42.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that day. All of the previous
space flights involving human
beings from the U.S. did in

48:42.520 --> 48:46.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fact have that crew
abort capability.

48:46.190 --> 48:51.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Spacecraft today that are being
developed as follow-ons to the
space shuttle will all

48:51.028 --> 48:55.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have that capability. The
shuttle was really a dangerous
craft. It was --
technologically,

48:55.299 --> 48:59.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it was pushing a lot of
boundaries. And there were
compromises made in the
development to

48:59.336 --> 49:02.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
save money that made it
ultimately not very safe.

49:02.740 --> 49:05.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a hard lesson, a lesson
that I think has been learned.

49:05.676 --> 49:08.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
Challenger disaster 30 years ago
today.

49:08.445 --> 49:09.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien, thanks so much.

49:09.446 --> 49:10.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're
welcome, Jeff.

49:10.381 --> 49:10.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we bring
you a unique profile of two
female high school students

49:10.314 --> 49:10.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who refuse to let gender
stereotypes get in the way of
their passion for building and

49:10.281 --> 49:10.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
learning with their hands. This
is the fourth installment of our
student reporting labs

49:10.514 --> 49:08.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
series called outside the box,
and it's produced by the
aspiring journalists at hughes
stem

49:08.913 --> 49:10.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
high school.

49:10.681 --> 49:10.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP: Only 9 percent of U.S.
construction workers are women,
which is a relatively small
percentage

49:10.281 --> 49:10.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compared torg industries. In the
morning, typical females have a
hard time picking out

49:10.281 --> 49:10.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what they want to wear, but not
sierra. They worry about safety
gear and tool belts, a

49:10.381 --> 49:09.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard hat and goggles are all
they need each morning as they
prepare to use the skills

49:09.413 --> 49:10.347 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
required in the
construction pathway.

49:10.347 --> 49:10.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I chose construction because it
was a hobby to me. It was
something I always knew how

49:10.281 --> 49:09.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do. I was small playing with
leg expose I ended up playing
with tools and it's just

49:09.013 --> 49:10.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something I love.

49:10.447 --> 49:09.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My family is OK with all this.
Whatever I choose, I choose.
They go along with me. They're

49:09.513 --> 49:10.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pushing me to motivate
me to keep going.

49:10.381 --> 49:10.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I plan to be a carpenter, and
just keep doing hands-on, which
is hands-on. I can't just

49:10.247 --> 49:08.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sit back and watch all the fun.
I want to be able to tear things
down, build it. It's

49:08.913 --> 49:10.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just a passion.

49:10.281 --> 49:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I have learned is how to
use a power tool properly. There
are a lot of things that

49:09.814 --> 49:10.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can hurt you in construction.
Like, you can poke your eye out.

49:10.481 --> 49:09.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It gets difficult working with
the boys, but they get used to
me because I'm just as strong

49:09.380 --> 49:11.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as them. I know just
as much as them.

49:11.515 --> 49:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the female students tend
to be some of my better
students, some of the sharper

49:20.558 --> 49:26.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
student, good leaders, good
managers, and they do a great
job.

49:26.664 --> 49:31.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Take a good
listen to this next story. It's
all about the power of sound,

49:31.001 --> 49:33.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and finding your voice.

49:33.871 --> 49:41.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jad Abumrad is the host and
creator of Radiolab. It's a WNYC
Radio studio's podcast.

49:41.478 --> 49:45.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's the subject of this
week's Brief But Spectacular.
It's our series where we

49:45.316 --> 49:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ask interesting people to
describe their passions.

49:49.053 --> 49:52.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAD ABUMRAD, Radiolab: Radio is
such a cool thing, precisely
because it doesn't have that,

49:52.923 --> 49:57.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that thing, that evil thing
right there. It lacks pictures.

49:57.428 --> 50:01.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It creates a kind of active
empathy, where you literally are
co-authoring the experience

50:01.699 --> 50:06.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with me. You're finishing the
deed. I love radio precisely
because it's empty of the

50:06.737 --> 50:14.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things that you are awash in,
my impoverished friends.

50:14.478 --> 50:23.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I often hear Radiolab on the
radio, and I -- it's -- look,
let's just be honest, it's

50:23.287 --> 50:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
annoying on the radio. The radio
is across the room. You're
trying to do 12 things. The

50:27.358 --> 50:31.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids are running back and forth.
It's really hard to listen
casually to it, because then

50:31.228 --> 50:34.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it just zooms by and
you miss something.

50:34.031 --> 50:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel like we are actually now
more a podcast than we are a
radio show. I do not know one

50:39.370 --> 50:45.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20-year-old that has a radio.
It's being redefined. It's not
the box on the mantelpiece
anymore.

50:45.342 --> 50:50.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's our phones and our devices
and whatever the next three
versions of that will be. The

50:50.814 --> 50:54.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
radio will live on
that in some way.

50:54.018 --> 51:01.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I grew up as an Arab kid in
Nashville, Tennessee. And then I
would go to Lebanon, and I would

51:01.592 --> 51:05.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be the American kid, so I was
never quite in or out there. I
was always in this weird

51:05.129 --> 51:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in-between space, which I think
is very normal for a lot of
immigrant kids.

51:10.467 --> 51:13.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now that I look back on it, I
feel like it was kind of a gift.
It gives you this weird

51:13.504 --> 51:19.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way of being of something, but
standing apart from it. You
learn to sort of look at things

51:19.209 --> 51:24.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a way that's really helpful
when you're a journalist.

51:24.114 --> 51:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The confusion of my adolescence,
my identity, I carry that
forward in a way, in a very deep

51:32.056 --> 51:36.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way, into the show. This is not
a show about knowing what you're
talking about. You actually

51:36.961 --> 51:41.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear us sometimes uncomfortably
fumbling through the dark on our
way to a slightly better
understanding.

51:41.632 --> 51:46.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those sort of intermediate
places are awkward. And, I don't
know, it's just an awkwardness

51:46.837 --> 51:51.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know very well from having
grown up that way, as this Arab
kid in Tennessee. The
awkwardness

51:51.675 --> 51:56.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used to feel like a bad thing.
Now it just feels like work. It
just feels like my job.

51:56.680 --> 52:00.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, and this
is my Brief But Spectacular take
on why radio will never

52:00.517 --> 52:02.686 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
die.

52:02.686 --> 52:08.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we bring
you a unique profile of two
female high school students

52:08.759 --> 52:12.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

their passion for building and

52:12.596 --> 52:15.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
learning with their hands.

52:15.899 --> 52:21.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the fourth installment
of our Student Reporting Labs
series called Outside the Box,

52:21.171 --> 52:24.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and it's produced by the
aspiring journalists at Hughes
STEM High School in Cincinnati,

52:24.808 --> 52:27.344 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ohio.

52:27.344 --> 52:31.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Only 9 percent of U.S.
construction workers are women,
which is a relatively small

52:31.849 --> 52:34.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
percentage compared
to other industries.

52:34.651 --> 52:39.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the morning, typical females
have a hard time picking out
what they want to wear, but

52:39.323 --> 52:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not Sierra Buster and Channell
Rogers. They worry about safety
gear and tool belts. A

52:43.694 --> 52:46.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard hat and goggles are all
they need each morning as they
prepare to learn the skills

52:46.797 --> 52:49.633 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
required in the

52:49.633 --> 52:53.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHANNELL ROGERS, Student: I
chose construction because it
was a hobby to me. It was
something

I always knew how to do. I was
small playing with LEGOs, and I
ended up playing with tools.

52:59.343 --> 53:02.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's just something I love.

SIERRA BUSTER, Student: My
family is OK with all this. They
-- whatever I choose, I choose.

They go along with me. They're
pushing me to motivate me to
keep going.

carpenter, and just keep doing
hands-on, just hands-on.

I can't just sit back and watch
all the fun. I want to be able
to tear things down, build

53:20.097 --> 53:23.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

SIERRA BUSTER: What I have
learned is how to use a power
tool properly. There are a

53:32.142 --> 53:36.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of things that can hurt you
in construction. Like, you can
poke your eye out.

CHANNELL ROGERS: It gets
difficult working with the boys,
but they get used to me, because

53:39.750 --> 53:42.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm just as strong as them. I
know just as much as them.

53:45.322 --> 53:47.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be some of my better students,
some of the sharper students,
good leaders, good managers,

53:47.524 --> 53:51.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and they do a great job.
