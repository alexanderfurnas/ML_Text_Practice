JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.439 --> 00:06.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
The future commander in chief
strikes a deal

00:11.245 --> 00:17.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to keep factory jobs in the U.S.
-- what this
early push for the manufacturing
sector could

00:17.284 --> 00:19.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tell us about a Trump
administration.

00:19.119 --> 00:23.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday,

American
volunteers helping bandage and
heal the victims

00:29.096 --> 00:31.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the battle for Mosul.

00:31.164 --> 00:36.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And America's
forgotten government
investment -- a look at why the
nation's infrastructure

00:36.303 --> 00:39.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and productivity are getting
slower by the
century.

00:39.940 --> 00:45.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER, Yale University:
Every major
component of your iPhone is as a
result of

00:45.479 --> 00:52.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
public investment and
development, GPS, the
memory processors, touch-screen
technology,

00:52.986 --> 00:54.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even that annoying voice.

00:54.354 --> 01:01.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:01.995 --> 01:04.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:04.865 --> 01:14.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President-elect
Trump made
his first public speech today
since the election

01:14.274 --> 01:20.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a trip to Indiana to tout a
deal that he
said made good on a campaign
promise.

01:20.580 --> 01:25.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump met with Carrier
workers on the
floor of their Indianapolis
plant today.

01:25.919 --> 01:29.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of their jobs were saved
because of the
deal he helped broker.

01:29.656 --> 01:33.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: So many
people in these other -- that
big, big, beautiful

01:33.193 --> 01:39.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plant behind us, which will be
even more beautiful
in about seven months from now,
they're so

01:39.333 --> 01:40.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happy.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're going to have a great
Christmas.

01:41.568 --> 01:43.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's most important.

01:43.403 --> 01:48.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, also, I just want to let
all of the other
companies know that we're going
to do great

01:48.308 --> 01:49.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
things for business.

01:49.309 --> 01:50.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no reason for them to
leave anymore.

01:50.777 --> 01:55.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Word of what was
in the deal
filtered out today.

01:55.082 --> 02:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carrier's parent company, United
Technologies,
will get $7 million in Indiana
state tax breaks

02:01.822 --> 02:03.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over 10 years.

02:03.490 --> 02:09.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In exchange, the company is
investing $16
million into its Indiana
operations.

02:09.863 --> 02:16.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means its Indianapolis
furnace plant
will stay open, saving 800 jobs
there.

02:16.336 --> 02:20.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another 300 jobs in the state
will also be
spared.

02:20.073 --> 02:27.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's not all rosy -- 600
jobs at the Indianapolis
plant will still be outsourced
to Mexico.

02:27.748 --> 02:34.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The parent company is also
sticking with plans
to close a plant just two hours'
drive away.

02:34.521 --> 02:40.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, Mr. Trump left
Indiana for an
evening rally in Ohio, kicking
off what his

02:40.260 --> 02:42.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
team calls a thank you tour.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Earlier in the day, there was
transition work.

02:45.499 --> 02:51.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robert Gates, the former defense
secretary,
was spotted in Trump Tower,
while, on Capitol

02:51.471 --> 02:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hill, his education secretary
pick, Betsy
DeVos, met with Senate Majority
Leader Mitch

02:57.144 --> 02:58.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
McConnell.

02:58.979 --> 03:04.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Democrats pushed to
require nominees
like DeVos to release tax
returns before they

03:04.985 --> 03:05.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are confirmed.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.821 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY (D), Washington: If
they have
no shady business dealings or
records of taking

03:09.689 --> 03:13.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advantage of the middle class,
they should
be happy to have us take a look.

03:13.794 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in Wisconsin,
the recount
requested by Green Party nominee
Jill Stein

03:19.900 --> 03:23.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
began, although it's not
expected to change
the outcome.

03:23.236 --> 03:29.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's
popular vote
lead has now surpassed 2.5
million, with ballots

03:30.010 --> 03:32.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still being counted.

03:32.679 --> 03:38.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And late today, there were
reports that president-elect
Trump has decided who will fill
a major Cabinet

03:38.118 --> 03:39.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

03:39.986 --> 03:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post and CNN
reported that
he's chosen retired Marine
General James Mattis

03:44.758 --> 03:46.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as his secretary of defense.

03:46.593 --> 03:50.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a Trump spokesman said that
no decision
has been made yet.

03:50.363 --> 03:55.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will have a closer look at
the Carrier
deal in Indiana right after the
news summary.

03:55.035 --> 03:59.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In other news
today: The
smoke is clearing from days of
wildfires in

03:59.172 --> 04:03.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tennessee's Great Smoky
Mountains, and recovery
efforts are in full swing.

04:03.710 --> 04:07.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The death toll from the blaze
rose to 10 people
today as search-and-rescue crews
fanned out

04:07.948 --> 04:10.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around the eastern city of
Gatlinburg.

04:10.717 --> 04:16.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sevier County Mayor Larry Waters
said authorities
were making headway on dozens of
missing persons

04:16.523 --> 04:18.358 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reports.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY WATERS, Sevier County,
Tennessee, Mayor:
We're pleased with one aspect of
it, and that

04:20.193 --> 04:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that a significant number of
those leads,
we found people where they are,
and we hope

04:26.967 --> 04:31.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that that trend continues as we
move forward.

04:31.171 --> 04:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Officials said
they expected
the search teams to finish
combing the fire-ravaged

04:35.075 --> 04:36.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
areas tonight.

04:36.877 --> 04:41.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: French President
Francois Hollande
said today that he will not seek
a second

04:41.214 --> 04:44.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
term, citing historically low
approval ratings.

04:44.417 --> 04:49.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During his time in office,
France has grappled
with high unemployment rates and
terrorism.

04:49.856 --> 04:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first round of the French
presidential
election is set to begin next
April.

04:53.994 --> 04:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Colombia's
Congress has
ratified a long-sought peace
agreement with

04:57.631 --> 05:01.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the leftist rebel group FARC
after years of
negotiations.

05:01.234 --> 05:05.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That comes after Colombian
voters narrowly
rejected an earlier version in a
referendum

05:05.972 --> 05:07.607 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last October.

05:07.641 --> 05:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawmakers voted last night,
clearing a final
hurdle to the deal's
implementation.

05:11.178 --> 05:15.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now FARC rebels will have six
months to turn
over their weapons to U.N.
monitors.

05:15.448 --> 05:19.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We are
committed
to working very quickly on the
amnesty law

05:19.953 --> 05:24.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for members of the FARC who have
not committed
atrocious crimes, non-admissible
crimes.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is perhaps the first thing
we have to
do.

05:26.826 --> 05:30.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Opponents of
the deal in
Congress boycotted the vote,
calling the accord

05:30.697 --> 05:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
too lenient on the rebels.

05:32.599 --> 05:37.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Senate
today unanimously
voted to extend sanctions on
Iran for another

05:37.904 --> 05:39.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decade.

05:39.773 --> 05:43.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supporters said that it will
give Congress
the ability to punish Iran,
should it violate

05:44.010 --> 05:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its landmark nuclear deal with
the U.S.

05:46.313 --> 05:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The measure had already won
approval in the
House.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now President Obama is expected
to sign it
into law.

05:52.319 --> 05:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The United
Nations is out
with its latest tally of the
world's population.

05:56.556 --> 06:00.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It offers a staggering look at
the struggles
facing young women today.

06:00.794 --> 06:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The planet's population grew 1
percent this
year to 7.4 billion people; 89
percent of

06:06.967 --> 06:13.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the world's 125 million
10-year-olds are living
in developing countries, where
girls face

06:13.440 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
obstacles to equal education,
quality health
care, and safety.

06:16.977 --> 06:22.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are new
signs the U.S.
manufacturing sector is starting
to rebound.

06:22.682 --> 06:27.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Factory activity hit a
five-month high in
November, due in part to an
increase in new

06:27.821 --> 06:29.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
orders and production.

06:29.656 --> 06:32.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even so, stocks were mixed on
Wall Street
today.

06:32.392 --> 06:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
notched another
record high, climbing 68 points
to close at

06:38.365 --> 06:39.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nearly 19192.

06:39.799 --> 06:45.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 72 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped seven.

06:45.405 --> 06:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
what's in the deal to keep
Carrier manufacturing

06:50.076 --> 06:56.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs in the U.S.?; lifesaving
efforts on the
front lines of Mosul; the latest
scientific

06:56.082 --> 07:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advancements to prevent and cure
AIDS; and
much more.

07:03.757 --> 07:15.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President-elect
Trump's trip
today to the Carrier plant in
Indiana was

07:15.335 --> 07:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a moment to celebrate the jobs
that were saved,
but it's also led to more
questions about

07:20.874 --> 07:26.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether this kind of deal could
be replicated
and to concerns about the state
of the industry.

07:26.246 --> 07:31.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To break it down, I'm joined by
Scott Paul
of the Alliance for American
Manufacturing,

07:31.217 --> 07:36.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which represents some leading
companies in
that field, and Greg Ip of The
Wall Street

07:36.089 --> 07:37.123 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Journal.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

07:38.992 --> 07:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greg Ip, remind us, first of
all, why was
Carrier going to move these jobs
to Mexico

07:43.263 --> 07:44.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the first place?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GREG IP, The Wall Street
Journal: Cheap labor,
basically, in Mexico.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can pay workers $24 per
day, plus benefits.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Indiana, they are paying $30
per hour.

07:51.771 --> 07:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they were coming to the same
conclusion
that so many other manufacturers
over the

07:55.909 --> 07:59.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last few decades have come to,
which is that
it's cheaper to make that
product elsewhere.

07:59.546 --> 08:03.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Scott Paul,
what's your
understanding of why this
company changed

08:03.249 --> 08:05.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
its mind?

08:05.051 --> 08:07.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT PAUL, Alliance for
American Manufacturing:
Well, I think it's pretty clear
there was

08:07.120 --> 08:12.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a whole lot of pressure exerted
by the president-elect
of the United States and the
vice president-elect

08:12.592 --> 08:13.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

08:13.593 --> 08:14.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who happens to be
the governor.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PAUL: Who happens to be
the governor
of Indiana.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

08:18.131 --> 08:23.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT PAUL: Trump had started
tweeting about
this in February and talking
about it consistently,

08:23.970 --> 08:29.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to make, I think, a point
of holding
a company accountable for
offshoring.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's something that he said he
would do during
the campaign.

08:33.346 --> 08:40.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that there was just
a convergence
of factors that made Carrier the
right case

08:40.220 --> 08:42.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in which to make some progress.

08:42.155 --> 08:47.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been
reported today, though,
that the $6 million, $7 million
in tax incentives

08:47.761 --> 08:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the state of Indiana is
offering Carrier
is something that was offered to
them before

08:53.566 --> 08:55.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Carrier turned it down.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So what's different now?

08:56.836 --> 08:59.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT PAUL: Well, I think what's
different
now is that there was no one in
the state

08:59.873 --> 09:04.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Indiana who was in a position
to offer
both carrots and sticks.

09:04.444 --> 09:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether it was directly or
indirectly,
certainly, the knowledge that
there are billions

09:11.351 --> 09:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of dollars in defense contracts,
that there
is the ongoing exposure that the
president

09:17.424 --> 09:23.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States is going to
focus on
this company is not helpful and
probably causes

09:23.830 --> 09:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their executives and their board
to say, let's
see if we can work something out
here.

09:27.767 --> 09:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greg Ip, is there
any precedent
for this kind of move on the
part of a president

09:32.105 --> 09:33.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or president-elect?

09:33.606 --> 09:36.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG IP: You can sort of see
elements of it
in different walks of life.

09:36.176 --> 09:40.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in the '60s, for example,
just as inflation
was beginning to be a big
problem, Presidents

09:40.847 --> 09:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kennedy and Johnson would often
publicly browbeat
companies for raising prices and
threatening

09:45.118 --> 09:49.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to move federal defense
purchases to different
countries.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we see this in other
countries all the
time.

09:51.524 --> 09:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brazil and France, to name two
examples, have
a long history in intervening in
business

09:56.129 --> 09:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decisions to protect local jobs.

09:58.364 --> 10:02.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I don't think we see is
much evidence
that in the long run those types
of tactics

10:02.235 --> 10:05.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make much difference, when the
economics of
production are pushing in the
other direction.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
that, Scott
Paul?

10:07.941 --> 10:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this something that could be
replicated
company by company by company in
this country?

10:12.245 --> 10:13.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT PAUL: Right.

10:14.013 --> 10:17.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, there's a company around
the corner
from Carrier, Rexnord, which
still plans to

10:17.884 --> 10:20.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
offshore production to Mexico.

10:20.220 --> 10:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so from a case management
perspective,
there were about 1,600 plant
closures or notices

10:25.859 --> 10:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the last two years that are
related to
trade.

10:28.862 --> 10:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's impossible to work through
that list.

10:31.598 --> 10:36.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I will also say that I think
an intervention
like this sends shockwaves
through corporate

10:36.903 --> 10:38.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
boardrooms.

10:38.738 --> 10:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they're making sourcing
decisions, they're
considering the labor cost
factor that Greg

10:42.442 --> 10:44.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
indicated.

10:44.210 --> 10:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also consider some the
risks that would
result from exiting the United
States and

10:48.147 --> 10:50.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether there could be other
consequences
for that as well.

10:50.783 --> 10:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And consequence,
excuse me,
is a term, Greg Ip, that the
president-elect

10:54.821 --> 10:56.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
used today.

10:56.723 --> 11:00.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said there will be
consequences when other
companies announce they are
leaving and moving

11:00.193 --> 11:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
jobs out of this country.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What consequences could there
be?

11:03.696 --> 11:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG IP: Well, he hasn't been
specific, but
if you go back over some of the
campaign rhetoric,

11:06.566 --> 11:10.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, obviously, there's the
bully pulpit,
just publicly shaming these
companies.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that again is not new to
Trump.

11:12.205 --> 11:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you remember, back in 2004,
John Kerry
was making noises about Benedict
Arnold CEOs

11:17.176 --> 11:18.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a similar context.

11:18.912 --> 11:22.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's got a long and
gloried tradition.

11:22.649 --> 11:27.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He can, for example, imply the
threat that
federal business will be
withheld from some

11:27.353 --> 11:28.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of these companies.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's possibly dangerous
precedent.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know what I mean?

11:32.392 --> 11:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When -- the Pentagon has very
specific guidelines,
for example, when it goes out
and does procurement.

11:36.462 --> 11:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't want them buying a jet
engine which
is actually inferior to another
jet engine

11:39.899 --> 11:43.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
simply because that other
company outsourced
some jobs.

11:43.202 --> 11:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The final thing that Trump could
do is he
could impose tariffs on any
products that

11:48.808 --> 11:52.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are imported once they have been
outsourced
to another country.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not clear how they could do
it.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The legal authority is somewhat
murky.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's not much question
that he could
do it if he wanted to do it.

11:58.918 --> 12:02.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why people do worry
that we end
up with a trade war as a result
of these tactics.

12:03.022 --> 12:06.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that a concern
for the manufacturing
sector, Scott Paul?

12:06.092 --> 12:10.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PAUL: Well, I think a
full-blown trade
war is unlikely.

12:10.163 --> 12:14.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of safeguards in
place to
prevent it from escalating to
that point.

12:15.001 --> 12:19.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that there are a lot of
domestic businesses
that would argue we're in a
trade war with

12:19.572 --> 12:20.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
China now.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We haven't pushed back all that
much.

12:23.743 --> 12:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, the signal that this
sends to
corporate America and to our
trade partners

12:30.550 --> 12:32.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is that we're going to drive a
tougher bargain.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know that we have always
done that.

12:34.354 --> 12:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And depending on how it's
managed, it could
yield some returns for American
businesses

12:39.492 --> 12:40.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and American workers.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's what
I'm trying
to understand, Greg Ip.

12:42.862 --> 12:50.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On balance, is this move today
and maybe a
few other moves down the road
likely to alter

12:50.036 --> 12:55.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the health of the American
economy, the well-being
of American workers across the
board?

12:55.675 --> 13:00.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG IP: There's no question
that protectionist
or sort of moral suasion efforts
like this

13:00.480 --> 13:03.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can make a difference on a
case-by-case basis.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have seen it in the past.

13:04.550 --> 13:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will probably save a few
thousand, possibly
more, jobs this time.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as we were discussing
earlier, if the
economics are saying that this
is an expensive

13:12.792 --> 13:16.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
place to produce stuff, it's
very hard to
see that turning that around.

13:16.396 --> 13:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why it would be more
useful to focus
on some of the other points that
I think Mr.

13:20.533 --> 13:24.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump was making today about
making this a
better place to manufacture.

13:24.270 --> 13:28.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's not really about like
threatening
or bribery, which is what
incentives really

13:28.875 --> 13:30.209 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

13:30.243 --> 13:33.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about lower tax rates, less
regulation
and better education.

13:33.546 --> 13:39.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are 300,000 manufacturing
jobs that
are vacant right now because
employers are

13:39.218 --> 13:41.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
having trouble finding the right
skilled workers.

13:42.021 --> 13:47.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back when the Carrier
announcement was made
earlier this year, the union
representative

13:47.326 --> 13:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got a phone call from Boeing
saying, hey,
we need 60 skilled workers, are
your guys

13:51.364 --> 13:53.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
available?

13:53.132 --> 13:56.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, very few of those
people had
the skills necessary that Boeing
was looking

13:56.803 --> 13:57.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

13:57.804 --> 13:58.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's
interesting.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Scott Paul, again, same
question.

14:00.840 --> 14:07.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On balance, is something like
this -- if Donald
Trump is talking about tax
reductions for

14:07.480 --> 14:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corporations, talking about
doing away with
a lot of regulations, is that
going to create

14:11.384 --> 14:16.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an environment where many
American companies
will decide not to send jobs
overseas?

14:16.155 --> 14:20.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT PAUL: Yes, I think Greg is
right that
the macro environment is going
to be critically

14:20.526 --> 14:22.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
important here.

14:22.328 --> 14:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a combination of the
corporate tax
code, the strength of the
dollar, which is

14:26.733 --> 14:31.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very important to our exporters,
the work
force, the investments that
we're making in

14:31.504 --> 14:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our infrastructure, because
labor, quite honestly,
is becoming a smaller component
in the cost

14:36.976 --> 14:38.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of manufacturing.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Energy, the materials make a big
difference.

14:40.580 --> 14:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other factor here is
that these countries
compete for business with us by
offering these

14:45.518 --> 14:47.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
subsidies all the time.

14:47.253 --> 14:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they see the United States is
in the game
of this, it could change the
equation.

14:50.723 --> 14:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Scott Paul, Greg
Ip, we thank
you both.

14:55.628 --> 15:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG IP: Thank you.

15:00.266 --> 15:04.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT PAUL: Thank you.

15:04.971 --> 15:10.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
six-week-long battle
for the ISIS-held city of Mosul
has become

15:10.576 --> 15:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an increasingly tough urban war
for the American-backed
Iraqi forces.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Up to a million civilians still
live in the
city.

15:18.985 --> 15:23.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The front lines are often too
dangerous for
international aid workers, but
two young American

15:23.389 --> 15:27.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
volunteers are there saving
lives while risking
their own.

15:27.827 --> 15:32.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
From Mosul, special
correspondent Jane Ferguson
and producer Matt McGarry filed
this report.

15:32.431 --> 15:36.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A warning: Viewers may find some
of the imagery
disturbing.

15:36.169 --> 15:43.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Crying in pain, a
tiny patient
is carried into this basic
treatment center

15:43.709 --> 15:45.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Mosul.

15:45.711 --> 15:48.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His name is Karam.

15:48.881 --> 15:53.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at just 5 years old, the
agony and fear
are too much.

"Hawa" (ph), says his father,
mortar.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His leg was shattered when it
was hit two
weeks ago.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was operated on, and is now
infected.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His father tries to comfort him.

16:06.899 --> 16:15.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For parents, war brings a
terrible fear of
loss.

16:15.074 --> 16:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two American medics are helping
Karam.

16:18.377 --> 16:22.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been at this post for
about a month,
treating civilians injured in
the fighting.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How many of your patients are
children?

16:24.350 --> 16:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETE REED, Volunteer: Too many.

16:25.351 --> 16:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEREK COLEMAN, Volunteer: At
least a quarter.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Injured by?

16:30.289 --> 16:31.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PETE REED: Everything.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEREK COLEMAN: Car bombs,
mortars, snipers.

16:34.026 --> 16:35.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PETE REED: Shot.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Karam is lucky.

16:37.697 --> 16:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He managed to find treatment
from ISIS doctors.

16:41.133 --> 16:45.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's crude, but at least he will
be able to
walk again.

16:45.371 --> 16:48.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He probably won't lose the leg.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is this kind of injury common?

16:49.442 --> 16:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETE REED: The injury, yes.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And actually making it to
surgery was less
common?

16:54.247 --> 16:56.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: So, where would
have gone for
the surgery?

16:56.349 --> 17:00.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETE REED: He went in Mosul.

17:00.052 --> 17:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are still operating
hospitals there.

17:01.621 --> 17:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Inside ISIS
territory?

17:02.822 --> 17:04.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PETE REED: Yes.

17:04.590 --> 17:09.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: These two
American volunteers,
both just 27 years old, are the
first and

17:09.896 --> 17:15.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only point of help civilians and
Iraqi army
soldiers get this close to the
front line

17:15.234 --> 17:19.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of fighting in Mosul.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pete Reed is from Bordentown,
New Jersey.

17:22.808 --> 17:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After two tours in Afghanistan
as a Marine,
he came to Iraq to help.

17:28.314 --> 17:30.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Derek Coleman is from San Diego.

17:30.750 --> 17:36.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was a machinist in a factory
with some
medical training before coming
here as a volunteer.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /DEREK COLEMAN: I don't
have any kids,
girlfriend, wife, nothing like
that.

17:38.958 --> 17:46.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I wanted a little adventure,
and see ISIS
as an evil enemy, and saw good
people fighting

17:46.732 --> 17:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against it, and I thought I
could help somehow.

17:49.068 --> 17:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And medical work seems to be
much more important
than carrying a gun and shooting
at people.

17:57.843 --> 18:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Other charities
are miles back
from the front lines, wary of
putting their

18:03.115 --> 18:04.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
staff in harm's way.

18:04.917 --> 18:11.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because of ISIS suicide car
bombs, the civilians
of Mosul are banned from driving
cars.

18:11.223 --> 18:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of the injured wouldn't
survive if Pete
and Derek were not this close to
the fighting.

18:16.262 --> 18:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEREK COLEMAN: The location is
everything
with what we are doing.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NGOs and other organizations
can't get anywhere
close to where we are.

18:23.602 --> 18:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we are doing is, we are
stopping
bleeding that would kill someone
in five minutes.

18:29.041 --> 18:35.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are stabilizing patients that
hopefully
survive the trip to the closest
hospital.

18:35.247 --> 18:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even with us, the hospitals are
so far away
at this point, that we are
afraid of how many

18:39.919 --> 18:41.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
patients we lose on the road.

18:41.587 --> 18:47.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: But being this
close to the
front puts Derek and Pete at
risk.

18:47.293 --> 18:51.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They are always short on
supplies, so Pete
has gone out to search for any
other medical

18:51.998 --> 18:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stations to ask for more.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Derek just begins telling us
about missing
the holiday.

18:57.903 --> 19:02.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEREK COLEMAN: Thanksgiving was
interesting,
because Thanksgiving was also
when I left

19:02.308 --> 19:03.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
home last year.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I had a turkey sandwich
alone.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNFIRE)

19:06.579 --> 19:10.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEREK COLEMAN: That was a little
close.

19:10.649 --> 19:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Bullets start
flying, and we
have to run for cover.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is normal, this kind of
gunfire going
overhead?

19:18.758 --> 19:19.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEREK COLEMAN: Yes.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, it's pretty normal.

19:21.227 --> 19:24.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our proximity to the front line,
it's bound
to happen.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Derek calls to
warn Pete to
be careful.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The fighting has intensified
around us.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEREK COLEMAN: Hey, buddy.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are you doing?

19:32.838 --> 19:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had quite a few rounds
pass really
close to our CCP here, worse
that yesterday.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I just wanted to give you
guys a warning
as you are pulling up and just
check in with

19:40.646 --> 19:42.515 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

19:42.548 --> 19:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: In the meantime,
Derek prepares
for the next patients, which
will surely come.

19:47.053 --> 19:50.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The conditions here are harsh,
but they have
learned to manage.

19:50.856 --> 19:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEREK COLEMAN: As you can see,
I'm kind of
bloodied here, and I don't
really have time

19:55.661 --> 19:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to always clean it all off.

19:57.296 --> 20:02.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I just try to not look like a
I came out
of a butcher shop as best I can.

20:02.635 --> 20:10.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Pete arrives back
empty-handed,
his search for supplies
unsuccessful, just

20:10.676 --> 20:13.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as more patients are brought in.

20:13.779 --> 20:19.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The center is also the first
point of treatment
for many Iraqi soldiers, their
bodies brutalized

20:19.952 --> 20:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the urban warfare that rages
just down
the road.

20:25.858 --> 20:34.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are not allowed to film the
injured and
dying soldiers who arrived at
the center.

20:34.600 --> 20:39.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi special forces medics are
here too,
some trained by the two young
Americans.

20:39.905 --> 20:46.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They often treat civilians, many
transported
here by the army in
war-weathered Humvees.

20:46.679 --> 20:52.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Soon, one pulls up, and a child
wrapped in
a blanket is lifted from it.

20:52.618 --> 20:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A soldier races her into the
center.

20:55.888 --> 21:03.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Her aunt stays outside,
hysterical with fear
and grief.

21:03.496 --> 21:08.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Hold her (EXPLETIVE
DELETED) head, somebody.

21:08.767 --> 21:13.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The small girl
has been shot
in the head by an ISIS sniper.

21:13.939 --> 21:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Incredibly, she is still alive.

21:19.478 --> 21:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pete and Derek fight hard to
save her life.

21:22.248 --> 21:25.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETE REED: Tell her to stay
still, stay still.

21:25.618 --> 21:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: They manage to
bandage her
head.

21:29.255 --> 21:34.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETE REED: Plaster, plaster.

21:34.894 --> 21:44.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Despite brave
efforts, the
little girl died.

21:44.436 --> 21:50.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think, given what you
have witnessed,
that ISIS are deliberating
targeting civilians?

21:50.376 --> 21:52.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PETE REED: Yes.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are shooting people with
white flags.

21:54.947 --> 21:58.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are shooting kids.

21:58.083 --> 22:02.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, we had two kids in a
row who had
been shot in the neck or the
head by a Da'esh

22:02.188 --> 22:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sniper because they were fleeing
Mosul, not
accidental grazing fire or
anything like that,

22:09.128 --> 22:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proper sniper shots, head and
neck and face.

22:15.834 --> 22:20.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yes, they're -- they're
purposely trying to
kill these people who are
running away.

22:20.706 --> 22:25.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Being in the
crossfire and
tending to death, his family are
worried about

22:25.911 --> 22:27.146 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

22:27.179 --> 22:33.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE REED: Yes, they worry a
lot, probably
for good reason.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who wouldn't worry?

22:34.620 --> 22:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not like, I don't know, a
ski instructor
in Wyoming.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm on the front lines in the
battle for Mosul.

22:41.427 --> 22:43.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are really, really
supportive.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're just terrified of what
I'm doing.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Are you changed?

22:46.232 --> 22:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PETE REED: Am I changed?

22:47.466 --> 22:49.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

22:49.301 --> 22:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can only see so many dead
kids a day so
many days in a row before you
are going to

22:55.174 --> 22:56.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be changed.

22:57.009 --> 23:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People see one dead kid or one
traumatic thing
happen, and it affects them for
the rest of

23:00.546 --> 23:01.614 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their life.

23:01.647 --> 23:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have seen a couple hundred.

23:04.917 --> 23:08.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm doing OK.

23:08.120 --> 23:16.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Inside, spirits
are high, because
Karam, the first child we met,
is feeling

23:16.195 --> 23:17.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
better.

23:17.463 --> 23:20.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A little tenderness and some
candy have helped.

23:20.432 --> 23:24.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has been fortunate to cheat
death in this
violent place.

23:24.770 --> 23:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Mosul, Iraq.

23:37.316 --> 23:46.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:46.759 --> 23:52.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
link between
distrust of government and
crumbling infrastructure;

23:52.231 --> 23:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and an author's take on changing
how society
thinks about marijuana.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first: Today is World AIDS
Day.

24:00.673 --> 24:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the death toll from AIDS
has dropped
dramatically, the virus still
claims over

24:05.344 --> 24:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a million people every year, and
nearly 40
million remain infected.

24:10.316 --> 24:12.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has an update.

24:12.051 --> 24:15.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With the
growing use of
medications to treat and prevent
the spread

24:15.988 --> 24:20.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of HIV, some say ending the AIDS
epidemic
is actually within reach.

24:20.993 --> 24:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But AIDS is still the number one
killer of
reproductive age women, and in
many places,

24:25.497 --> 24:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those lifesaving drugs are
barely available.

24:28.367 --> 24:29.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scientists are also seeking a
vaccine.

24:29.768 --> 24:32.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new trial is under way right
now in South
Africa.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But many remain skeptical.

24:34.773 --> 24:39.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by "Science"
magazine's Jon
Cohen, who's covered this
epidemic for nearly

24:39.211 --> 24:43.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
30 years and was a collaborator
with us on
our recent series about HIV and
AIDS.

24:43.849 --> 24:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jon Cohen, welcome back to the
"NewsHour."

24:46.719 --> 24:49.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start off by talking about
this vaccine
trial in South Africa.

24:49.922 --> 24:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you well know, you wrote the
book about
the hunt for an HIV vaccine.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is happening in South
Africa right now?

24:56.428 --> 24:58.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this as promising as some
think it is?

24:58.330 --> 25:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JON COHEN, "Science": Well, the
AIDS vaccine
is the Holy Grail.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People can come in, get a few
shots, be protected
for life.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the dream.

25:07.005 --> 25:12.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Thailand in 2009, it was
revealed that
a vaccine being studied there
protected people

25:12.678 --> 25:16.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with about a 31 percent
reduction in risk.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not very good.

25:17.383 --> 25:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's extremely low, but it was
something.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was the first glimmer of
hope.

25:21.186 --> 25:25.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vaccine trial in South
Africa is building
off that Thai trial.

25:25.057 --> 25:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The results from the Thai trial
were extremely
controversial.

25:28.093 --> 25:32.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people who wonder why
that vaccine
strategy has moved forward in
South Africa,

25:32.965 --> 25:37.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there are South Africans who
argue very
strongly that this is a great
hope for them,

25:37.870 --> 25:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and even if they get some
protection, in addition
to other protective measures, it
could make

25:41.974 --> 25:42.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a big difference.

25:42.975 --> 25:43.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: OK.

25:43.942 --> 25:45.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now let's talk a little bit more
broadly

25:45.511 --> 25:48.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Where are the successes
currently in the fight
against HIV?

25:48.580 --> 25:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And where are those happening?

25:50.616 --> 25:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN: Well, clearly,
preventing mother-to-child
transmission has been a huge
success all around

25:55.087 --> 25:56.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

25:56.388 --> 25:59.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's one of the easiest things
to do in terms
of prevention.

25:59.758 --> 26:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some countries like South
Africa have
reduced it to below 2 percent of
pregnant

26:04.329 --> 26:06.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women who are infected passing
on the virus.

26:06.965 --> 26:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a great success.

26:08.734 --> 26:12.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Treatment now has scaled up from
basically
being zero in poor countries
around the world

26:12.704 --> 26:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the year 2000 to 18.2 million
of the 36.7
million infected people.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Phenomenal success story.

26:21.980 --> 26:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People who are treated and stay
on treatment
fully suppress the virus and
they rarely transmit

26:26.385 --> 26:27.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to others.

26:27.753 --> 26:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that is leading to hope that
epidemics
can stop petering out.

26:30.722 --> 26:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What about the
remaining
challenges?

26:33.258 --> 26:37.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, there are still
troubling high
rates of HIV among particular
populations

26:38.030 --> 26:39.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the world.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You and I saw that as we
traveled through
Africa and here in the U.S.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are the other big
challenges facing AIDS?

26:44.069 --> 26:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN: So, one big challenge
is that only
half the people who need
treatment are getting

26:49.107 --> 26:50.075 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
treatment.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that's an enormous
challenge.

26:51.977 --> 26:53.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other one, as you
mentioned, is there
are a lot of young people who
are getting

26:53.612 --> 26:54.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
infected.

26:55.013 --> 26:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, 2.1 million people are
still getting
infected every year.

26:58.183 --> 27:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that number isn't changing
very much.

27:00.519 --> 27:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So something needs to be done
particularly
to reach young women in much of
sub-Saharan

27:06.558 --> 27:08.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Africa, who are highly
vulnerable.

27:08.393 --> 27:13.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is really unclear in many
places, like
South Africa, why they're
becoming infected

27:13.966 --> 27:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at such extraordinarily high
rates.

27:15.734 --> 27:19.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: UNICEF
recently put out
a very stark warning, saying
that if prevention

27:19.972 --> 27:25.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
efforts weren't ramped up, we
would see what
they argued was a real spike in
new incidences

27:25.344 --> 27:28.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
amongst adolescents.

27:28.413 --> 27:29.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What can be done to do that?

27:29.715 --> 27:32.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you hopeful that we can
actually nip that
in the bud?

27:32.417 --> 27:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JON COHEN: It's one of the most
vexing problems.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, there are a few
problems.

27:37.256 --> 27:39.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One is adolescents are
risk-takers.

27:39.391 --> 27:42.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any of us who have adolescents
certainly know
that.

27:42.327 --> 27:46.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they don't perceive
themselves as being
in harm's way, even when it's
clear that there

27:46.465 --> 27:48.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a lot of HIV in their
community.

27:48.567 --> 27:52.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other is, some adolescents
are infected
at birth, and they are only
learning about

27:52.404 --> 27:57.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their infection, as you and I
saw in Rwanda,
when they get to be teenagers
and get sick.

27:57.242 --> 28:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they have trouble
staying on medication
because there is a lot of
resentment about

28:00.846 --> 28:04.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that they were infected
and nobody
told them the truth about, let's
say, how

28:04.783 --> 28:06.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their mother died.

28:06.251 --> 28:10.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, both of those things
combined create a
really, really big problem.

28:10.756 --> 28:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there's no easy solution.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly, Jon,
what about
the issue of funding?

28:14.927 --> 28:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we traveled across much of
South Africa,
we heard repeatedly that funding
is an issue.

28:19.965 --> 28:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the trend line looking
in that regard?

28:22.034 --> 28:26.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN: The world is short
about $7 billion
a year, according to UNAIDS'
estimates.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the question is, where is
more money
going to come from?

28:28.774 --> 28:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it going to come donor
wealthy countries
or domestic sources?

28:32.578 --> 28:34.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Both are strapped.

28:34.346 --> 28:38.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's hope that, with evidence
of things
working in countries like Malawi
and Zimbabwe

28:38.083 --> 28:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Zambia, which today report
that they have
had phenomenal success keeping
people suppressed

28:43.922 --> 28:48.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and on treatment, that that will
lead funders
to think this investment is
worth it and let's

28:48.460 --> 28:50.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put some more into control this
thing once
and for all.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Science" magazine's Jon Cohen,
thank you
so much.

28:54.032 --> 28:57.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can find additional
reporting on AIDS
from our series that aired last
summer.

28:58.003 --> 29:05.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

29:06.011 --> 29:18.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now
infrastructure investment
may be moving back front and
center.

29:18.223 --> 29:21.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President-elect Trump plans to
push for it
through the private sector.

29:21.226 --> 29:24.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats in Congress remain
interested in
greater public investment.

29:24.730 --> 29:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
takes a trip on the rails to
look at how attitudes

29:28.734 --> 29:32.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have changed over time, part of
his weekly
series, Making Sense.

29:32.838 --> 29:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: Attention, please,
this is the
last call.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Mid-morning at New
York's Penn
Station.

29:39.911 --> 29:46.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Throngs rush to the 10:00 a.m.
Acela to Washington,
D.C. Ridership is up and these
highish-speed

29:46.918 --> 29:53.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trains are at or near capacity
as business
travelers chug up and down the
Northeast Corridor.

29:53.759 --> 29:55.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Amtrak conductor 2153 to
the heading.

29:55.861 --> 29:58.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All stations are cleared.

29:58.163 --> 30:04.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But they're
hurrying up in an
America of slowed-down
productivity, the amount

30:04.803 --> 30:12.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of output per hour of work
rising at just
1.3 percent a year since 2007,
compared to

30:12.944 --> 30:19.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than double that rate from
1947 to 1973.

30:19.184 --> 30:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One cause, America's crumbling
infrastructure,
like our passenger rail system,
some of which

30:25.891 --> 30:31.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dates to the Civil War, causing
delays that
hamstring the economy.

30:31.930 --> 30:36.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wick Moorman worked his way to
the top of
the Norfolk Southern Freight
Railroad, before

30:36.168 --> 30:43.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retiring last year, returning to
work recently,
at a dollar a year, to steer and
revive Amtrak.

30:43.975 --> 30:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Riding the Acela back to New
York, he insisted
it's not just our railroads that
need work.

30:48.780 --> 30:53.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WICK MOORMAN, CEO, Amtrak: When
you look at
the state of our highway system
today, which

30:53.618 --> 31:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we all get out and drive on
every day, in
terms of congestion, in terms of
the surface

31:01.927 --> 31:04.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conditions, in terms of the fact
that we're
seeing that more and more
bridges have to

31:04.896 --> 31:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be closed to rehabilitate, it
has to be an
economic drag, right?

31:09.534 --> 31:14.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Highway congestion alone costs
this country
an enormous amount of
productivity.

31:14.473 --> 31:18.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, why aren't we
investing in
infrastructure of the kind that
made America

31:18.543 --> 31:25.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
great in the '40s, '50s, '60s,
government
investments that hiked our
economy to unheard-of

31:26.017 --> 31:28.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
heights of productivity?

31:28.220 --> 31:30.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So asks Yale's Jacob Hacker.

31:30.922 --> 31:32.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
His answer?

31:32.858 --> 31:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER, Yale University:
We have forgotten
the incredibly important role
that government

31:35.360 --> 31:37.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plays in our prosperity.

31:37.262 --> 31:43.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And thus the term
"American Amnesia,"
Hacker's new book, subtitled
"How the War

31:43.301 --> 31:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Government Led Us to Forget
What Made America
Prosper," because, in the 19th
and 20th centuries,

31:50.709 --> 31:52.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prosper, we did.

31:52.644 --> 31:57.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: We went from being
from a relatively
poor, relatively undereducated
and relatively

31:57.382 --> 32:04.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unhealthy society to being the
richest, the
most well-educated and the
healthiest society

32:04.222 --> 32:05.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the world had ever seen.

32:05.991 --> 32:11.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After World War II, we see the
blossoming
of this really active investing
state that's

32:11.363 --> 32:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investing on both non-defense
and defense
technology and really sowing the
seeds for

32:17.936 --> 32:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the productivity revolution that
occurs during
this period.

32:21.973 --> 32:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Government outlays
of land for
railroads, say, subsidies for
airports and

32:28.079 --> 32:33.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waterways that helped make the
country one
market, speed goods and labor
from coast to

32:33.919 --> 32:35.353 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coast.

32:35.387 --> 32:38.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think of Republican President
Eisenhower's
interstate highway system.

32:38.723 --> 32:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: The estimates are
that it accounted
for something like a third of
productivity

32:43.295 --> 32:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growth in the U.S. economy in
the late 1950s,
and around a quarter in the
1960s.

32:48.400 --> 32:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And what's true of
hard infrastructure
is true of what were once
America's greatest

32:53.972 --> 32:58.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soft productivity advantages:
health and education.

32:58.109 --> 33:03.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: If you look at
older Americans
in the United States, they're
the most educated

33:03.114 --> 33:04.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
older citizens in the world.

33:04.950 --> 33:10.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you look at younger
Americans, we have
fallen to the high teens in
terms of college

33:10.956 --> 33:12.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
completion rates.

33:12.858 --> 33:19.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in a new economy that's
based much more
on knowledge and technology,
we're not investing

33:19.431 --> 33:23.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adequately or correctly to get
kids through
college the way other countries
are.

33:23.869 --> 33:29.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In short, claims
Hacker, we forgot
what made us great, and instead
adopted a

33:29.975 --> 33:32.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
profound skepticism about
government.

33:32.711 --> 33:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: As we have seen
government become
weaker and lobbyists more
powerful, Americans

33:38.850 --> 33:41.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have also become less trusting
of governments.

33:41.353 --> 33:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And yet, these
days, government
investments may actually be the
most productive

33:46.391 --> 33:48.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ones available.

33:48.159 --> 33:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: If you look at how
our economy
has suffered over the last 15 or
20 years,

33:53.899 --> 33:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's in significant part because
we haven't
done the investments in research
and development

33:58.670 --> 34:03.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and infrastructure and other
public goods
that are necessary for our
growth.

34:04.009 --> 34:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, we're going
to be feeling
that overhang for a long time to
come, because

34:08.914 --> 34:13.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's the investments we made in
the 1950s
and '60s and '70s that result in
some of the

34:13.752 --> 34:16.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
greatest technological
breakthroughs that
we enjoy today.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Such as?

34:17.722 --> 34:19.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: The iPhone.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have an iPhone here?

34:20.191 --> 34:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: I have got one.

34:21.993 --> 34:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB HACKER: Every major
component of your
iPhone is as a result of public
investment

34:27.899 --> 34:29.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and development.

34:29.801 --> 34:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GPS, the memory processors,
touch-screen technology,
originated in public research
projects.

34:37.208 --> 34:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As we neared New
York, the lack
of investment in passenger rail
was hard to

34:42.781 --> 34:43.915 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
miss.

34:43.949 --> 34:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Acela decelerated, cars on
I-95 whizzing
past us.

34:49.654 --> 34:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That prompted a question to
Amtrak's CEO:
Why had we slowed to a crawl?

34:54.826 --> 35:00.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WICK MOORMAN: Because there's a
New Jersey
transit train going into Penn
Station ahead

35:00.131 --> 35:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of us, and we have exactly two
tracks under
that river.

35:04.436 --> 35:07.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and we get this kind of
congestion all the
time.

35:07.772 --> 35:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Moreover, those
rail tunnels,
now more than a century old,
were flooded

35:12.711 --> 35:14.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by Hurricane Sandy four years
ago.

35:15.013 --> 35:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WICK MOORMAN: And I think that
the day is
coming when this nation is just
going to be

35:25.790 --> 35:28.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forced to invest, if we want to,
you know,
maintain our place in the world.

35:28.126 --> 35:33.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: We are
going to fix our inner cities
and rebuild

35:33.598 --> 35:38.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our highways, bridges, tunnels,
airports,
schools, hospitals.

35:38.103 --> 35:47.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to rebuild our
infrastructure,
which will become, by the way,
second to none.

35:47.479 --> 35:53.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: On election night,
president-elect
Donald Trump touted his plan for
rebuilding

35:53.885 --> 36:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America, $137 billion in federal
tax credits
to private investors who would
then be incentivized

36:02.927 --> 36:09.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to finance toll roads, toll
bridges or other
projects that generate their own
revenue,

36:09.167 --> 36:14.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unleashing a hoped-for trillion
dollars of
infrastructure investment over
10 years.

36:14.906 --> 36:18.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, if it works, says Jacob
Hacker, a Democrat:

36:18.309 --> 36:22.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JACOB HACKER: He's the
Nixon-goes-to-China
of infrastructure spending.

36:22.947 --> 36:27.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also think he has a very
good chance
of putting through massive tax
cuts.

36:27.085 --> 36:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to take away a lot
of the public
funds that we need to do that
kind of infrastructure

36:32.057 --> 36:33.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investment.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Furthermore, some
private infrastructure
investments, like toll roads,
have failed

36:37.529 --> 36:39.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in recent years.

36:39.597 --> 36:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As for private investment in
Amtrak?

36:42.267 --> 36:43.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, says its new CEO:

36:44.002 --> 36:45.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WICK MOORMAN: I'm skeptical.

36:45.937 --> 36:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where -- how do you -- you fund
private investment,
as you know, in the highways by
things like

36:53.078 --> 36:54.045 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tolls.

36:54.079 --> 36:55.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

36:55.180 --> 36:56.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WICK MOORMAN: Right?

36:56.748 --> 36:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, that's harder out here.

36:58.483 --> 37:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Not going to have a
toll at Wilmington.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WICK MOORMAN: No.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, every time the train
goes through
with an E-ZPass, and you kind of
click off

37:05.957 --> 37:07.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
another one?

37:07.125 --> 37:09.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just -- it's harder for me
to see right
now.

37:09.694 --> 37:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And you're a guy
who went to
Harvard Business School.

37:12.464 --> 37:17.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're not talking as some kind
of left-wing
Democrat who's always for more
and more spending,

37:17.235 --> 37:18.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more and more taxes.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WICK MOORMAN: No, no, no.

37:20.572 --> 37:27.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm just a person who looks at
the country
and what needs to be done and
says, this is

37:27.278 --> 37:30.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what we do in the business
world.

37:30.415 --> 37:31.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We fix this.

37:31.449 --> 37:32.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why can't you fix it?

37:33.017 --> 37:36.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Good question, to
which we will
all be waiting for the answer.

37:36.221 --> 37:41.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting aboard

37:41.659 --> 37:47.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Amtrak 2168.

37:47.298 --> 38:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United States
and Iran
have been at odds for 37 years,
a standoff

38:02.247 --> 38:07.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that continues even as President
Obama signed
on to a deal this past summer
that sharply

38:07.418 --> 38:10.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
limits Iran's nuclear
development.

38:10.054 --> 38:15.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just today, as we reported, the
U.S. Senate
voted to extend sanctions
against Tehran.

38:15.860 --> 38:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner recently sat
down with Wall
Street Journal reporter Jay
Solomon to discuss

38:20.198 --> 38:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his book, "The Iran Wars: Spy
Games, Bank
Battles, and the Secret Deals
That Reshaped

38:26.538 --> 38:27.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Middle East."

38:27.705 --> 38:29.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the latest addition to the
"NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

38:29.874 --> 38:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Jay Solomon,
welcome.

38:31.809 --> 38:32.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON, Author, "The Iran
Wars: Spy Games,
Bank Battles, and the Secret
Deals That Reshaped

38:32.677 --> 38:34.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Middle East": Great to be
here.

38:34.412 --> 38:36.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: What struck me
about this
book was your portrayal of
President Obama

38:36.948 --> 38:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as obsessed with Iran and with
getting a nuclear
deal really from the beginning.

38:42.587 --> 38:44.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where did that come from?

38:44.389 --> 38:48.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: So, I really think,
when he came
in, he saw the need to stop,
kind of defuse

38:48.593 --> 38:56.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iran weapons program, and
the need to
kind of avert another U.S. war
as converging.

38:56.467 --> 39:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't know at the time that
he was sending
secret letters to the supreme
leader...

39:00.572 --> 39:02.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

39:02.373 --> 39:05.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: ... that he was
really kind of
setting up a diplomatic track
and was just

39:05.843 --> 39:07.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hoping the Iranians would bite.

39:07.712 --> 39:13.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it really was a campaign
issue that became
a driving vision for him in his
first year.

39:13.785 --> 39:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So, President
Obama got his
nuclear deal, but he did pay a
really big

39:18.590 --> 39:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diplomatic price, didn't he, on
many fronts.

39:20.892 --> 39:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: When I was doing
the research,
it really did kind of dominate
so many different

39:25.630 --> 39:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
factions of his policy.

39:28.366 --> 39:34.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The negotiations with the
Iranians started
in secret, which -- basically
behind the backs

39:34.072 --> 39:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Israelis and Arabs, which
really has
continued to this day to serve
as a big source

39:39.444 --> 39:41.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of tension with the Obama
administration.

39:41.212 --> 39:47.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, they say there was no
connection
whatsoever between our Syria
policy and the

39:47.151 --> 39:50.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decision not to use airstrikes
and our Iran
policy.

39:50.788 --> 39:56.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have seen kind of since
2013, when
Obama backed away from
airstrikes, almost

39:56.694 --> 40:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
kind of the U.S. moving
increasingly towards
a policy that's in alignment in
some ways

40:01.499 --> 40:04.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with both the Russians and
Iranians.

40:04.369 --> 40:08.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Obama has sent
messages to the
supreme leader in letters and
through the

40:08.740 --> 40:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pentagon that, basically, we're
not targeting
Assad.

40:11.142 --> 40:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In fact,
Iranian officials
had let the White House know
that that could

40:14.646 --> 40:16.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
completely screw up the talks.

40:16.547 --> 40:21.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: Yes, the diplomats
who were involved
were saying, even if we wanted
to keep this

40:21.085 --> 40:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diplomatic track open, if you
start bombing
the Assad regime, which really
provides Iran

40:26.557 --> 40:31.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strategic depth in the Middle
East and its
closest Arab ally, it will be
difficult for

40:31.462 --> 40:33.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us to continue.

40:33.231 --> 40:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Now, we have
this latest
controversy with what has turned
out to be

40:36.934 --> 40:41.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$1.7 billion that the U.S. in
cash has paid
to Iran in the last few months.

40:41.806 --> 40:49.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about a completely separate
negotiation
at The Hague, but is it or is it
not connected

40:49.047 --> 40:50.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to this nuclear deal?

40:50.281 --> 40:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: Well, I think it
all did kind
of converge.

40:53.484 --> 40:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On January 16, the agreement was
basically
implemented.

40:57.555 --> 41:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the next day, we had a
prisoner swap and
the payment of this money.

41:02.193 --> 41:06.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I do think it was tied to the
nuclear negotiations
in this way.

41:06.998 --> 41:12.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think you have seen a real
cycle of
the Obama administration trying
to put kind

41:12.470 --> 41:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of past conflicts behind that
were brewing
with the Iranians.

41:17.875 --> 41:23.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's also raised a lot of
questions, because,
if you give that much money in
cash to the

41:24.015 --> 41:28.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iranian government, there is a
real fear this
money went to the elite military
unit the

41:28.486 --> 41:30.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Revolutionary Guard.

41:30.321 --> 41:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very hard for them to move
money around
the Middle East to fund
Hezbollah and Lebanon,

41:34.759 --> 41:36.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Assad regime.

41:36.427 --> 41:40.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you give them that much cash,
you can move
that cash to these types of
regimes.

41:40.598 --> 41:44.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's part of the
reason why
this cash payment has become so
controversial

41:44.535 --> 41:45.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and is a political now.

41:45.636 --> 41:47.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And, of course,
it can't
be traced.

41:47.638 --> 41:51.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You spent a lot of time talking
to not only
American officials, but Iranian
officials,

41:51.709 --> 41:53.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and getting to know them well.

41:53.544 --> 42:00.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After these two years, do you
think that any
sort of trust developed in these
negotiations

42:00.118 --> 42:01.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that will survive it?

42:01.886 --> 42:05.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAY SOLOMON: I do think it's
significant that
there was so much engagement
between John

42:05.590 --> 42:09.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kerry and the Iranian foreign
minister, Javad
Zarif.

42:09.060 --> 42:13.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the problem is, Iran is
really in
many ways a dual system.

42:13.264 --> 42:18.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. was talking with very
Western-oriented,
English-speaking diplomats in
the Foreign

42:18.803 --> 42:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ministry, but we know that the
policies are
really driven by the supreme
leader and the

42:23.808 --> 42:25.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Revolutionary Guards.

42:25.810 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is still very much no
contact whatsoever
between the U.S. side and the
kind of hard-line

42:32.383 --> 42:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
camp that really runs the
country.

42:34.485 --> 42:37.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, history will show whether
there was a
narrowing.

42:37.922 --> 42:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the kind of rhetoric
coming out
of the supreme leader has not
softened whatsoever.

42:43.728 --> 42:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that raises questions
whether this is
kind of another transactional
part or it really

42:48.466 --> 42:52.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does lead to some approach
normal -- at rapprochement
on some level.

42:52.270 --> 42:56.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So, future
presidents will
have to deal with it, no doubt.

42:56.073 --> 43:01.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

HARI SREENIVASAN: We will be
back in a moment
with one author's perspective on
the evolving

43:08.119 --> 43:09.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
culture of marijuana.

43:09.454 --> 43:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

43:13.224 --> 43:26.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on

43:36.113 --> 43:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series.

43:42.520 --> 43:52.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This past election, multiple
states legalized
the use of marijuana for
recreation or medicinal

43:52.930 --> 43:54.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
purposes.

43:54.499 --> 44:06.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, author Joe Dolce
provides some historical
context on the substance.

44:06.244 --> 44:16.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE DOLCE, Author, "Brave New

JOE DOLCE, Author, "Brave New
Weed: Adventures
Into the Uncharted World of
Cannabis": When

44:22.326 --> 44:32.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my mother was upset that I was
writing a book
on weed, I pulled this out,
which is an unguent

44:32.370 --> 44:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my mother was upset that I was
writing a book
on weed, I pulled this out,
which is an unguent

44:37.341 --> 44:41.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
made of cannabis.

44:41.245 --> 44:46.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, "Mom, do you have
any pain?"

44:46.284 --> 44:50.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She said, "Yes, my legs are
hurting me."

44:50.221 --> 44:53.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I rubbed some on her.

44:53.190 --> 44:56.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in three minutes, her pain
was gone.

44:56.294 --> 44:59.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was a pretty easy way of
changing her
mind.

44:59.530 --> 45:05.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know why weed gets such a bad
rap: because
the U.S. government, in addition
to many other

45:05.903 --> 45:09.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
governments, has been
disseminating a lot
of negative information about it
for -- since

45:09.974 --> 45:11.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1937, really, so over 70 years.

45:11.876 --> 45:24.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even the name marijuana was an
attempt by
the U.S. government to sort of
racially stigmatize

45:24.555 --> 45:27.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a plant that had here to before
known as cannabis.

45:27.124 --> 45:31.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happened was, there were a
lot of Mexican
workers flooding over the
border.

45:31.862 --> 45:37.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a very clever bureaucrat
named Harry Anslinger
figured out that he could
demonize those workers,

45:37.268 --> 45:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the same time demonize this
weed.

45:39.637 --> 45:45.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what he did is, he actually
changed the
name from cannabis, which was in
medicine

45:45.309 --> 45:48.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chests, to marijuana, which
became known as
loco weed.

45:48.613 --> 45:49.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They demonized it.

45:49.714 --> 45:51.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He passed legislation.

45:51.515 --> 46:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He kept his job going, because
he ran the
Federal Bureau of Narcotics, so
he had something

46:00.391 --> 46:01.592 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

46:01.626 --> 46:03.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he arrested people like
Anita O'Day and
Gene Krupa.

46:03.828 --> 46:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He arrested musicians for
smoking it.

46:07.131 --> 46:11.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The war on drugs in America
started when Richard
Nixon had the very clever idea
of associating

46:11.135 --> 46:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hippies and disorder with
marijuana.

46:13.170 --> 46:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Ronald Reagan came into
office in the
'80s, he turned that war
nuclear.

46:17.875 --> 46:19.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was spraying fields with
paraquat.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was raiding people.

46:21.312 --> 46:22.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was arresting people.

46:22.713 --> 46:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had minimum drug sentencing
laws.

46:24.782 --> 46:37.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we're at a tipping point
right now
at the legalization of cannabis.

46:37.328 --> 46:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Labeling is going to

46:42.800 --> 46:47.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Labeling is going to

52:23.807 --> 52:25.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
change the world of weed.

52:25.743 --> 52:30.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the same way you know that a
shot of spirits
equals a six-ounce glass of wine
equals a

52:30.381 --> 52:33.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
12-ounce bottle of beer, you're
going to be
able to dose.

52:33.083 --> 52:37.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're going to be able to
understand the
standards that we intuitively
understand about

52:37.955 --> 52:39.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
alcohol.

52:39.757 --> 52:42.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As a matter of fact, in
California, where
there's been a medical program
for 20 years,

52:42.259 --> 52:47.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a recent study showed that
parents are more
happy for their children to use
weed than

52:47.164 --> 52:48.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to begin drinking.

52:48.332 --> 52:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's an interesting societal
change.

52:50.067 --> 52:52.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's going to have a
big effect
going forward.

52:52.603 --> 52:56.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My name is Joe Dolce, and this

substance naturally

53:18.362 --> 53:22.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in treating anxiety and
depression in cancer
patients.

53:22.332 --> 53:27.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the FDA approved
