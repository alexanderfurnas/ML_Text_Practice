>> IT WAS SO MUCH FUN, AND WE

00:16.300 --> 00:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE TALKING TO EACH OTHER

00:17.833 --> 00:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGHOUT THAT NIGHT, LIKE WE

00:19.266 --> 00:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE DEFINITELY COMING BACK HERE,

00:20.900 --> 00:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A SPOT FOR VACATION.

00:22.933 --> 00:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WERE SO SET ON COMING BACK

00:24.600 --> 00:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAIN, AND THEN THE GUNSHOTS

00:25.700 --> 00:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTED.

00:28.666 --> 00:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: SHORTLY AFTER 2:00

00:30.133 --> 00:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A.M., OMAR MATEEN ENTERED THE

00:31.566 --> 00:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLUB ARMED WITH A SEMI-AUTOMATIC

00:32.933 --> 00:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIFLE AND A HANDGUN AND BEGAN

00:34.000 --> 00:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRING.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS

00:36.833 --> 00:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUNSHOTS, WE DIDN'T KNOW IF IT

00:37.866 --> 00:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS PART OF THE MUSIC.

00:38.833 --> 00:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL WE WERE DOING WAS FEELING

00:40.133 --> 00:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REACTIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE.

00:41.566 --> 00:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EVERYBODY WAS CHAOTIC.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AT THIS POINT, PEOPLE ARE

00:45.133 --> 00:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST KIND OF JUST RUNNING BACK

00:48.033 --> 00:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FORTH, NOT REALLY KNOWING

00:49.166 --> 00:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT TO DO.

00:51.566 --> 00:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DROPPED TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE I

00:52.600 --> 00:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:54.733 --> 00:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: CARTER, PARKER, AND

00:56.066 --> 00:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MURRAY ENDED UP HIDING TOGETHER

00:57.500 --> 00:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE CLUB'S BATHROOM.

00:58.966 --> 00:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN MINUTES MATEEN WOULD

00:59.833 --> 01:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOLLOW.

01:01.466 --> 01:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE WERE THE LAST FEW TO GET

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THE BATHROOM STALL THAT WE

01:04.000 --> 01:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE IN.

01:04.766 --> 01:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE WAS ALREADY ABOUT

01:06.833 --> 01:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE, WHAT, 17-20 PEOPLE IN

01:10.333 --> 01:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT STALL ALREADY.

01:11.766 --> 01:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE CLOSED THE DOOR, AND THEN

01:12.966 --> 01:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE JUST SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU COULD STILL HEAR PEOPLE

01:19.666 --> 01:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCREAMING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

01:20.533 --> 01:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLUB.

01:22.133 --> 01:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THERE WAS A PERIOD OF

01:23.133 --> 01:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SILENCE.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WALKS IN, YOU COULD HEAR HIS

01:25.733 --> 01:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOOTSTEPS, AND THEN HE STARTS

01:27.133 --> 01:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOOTING INTO OUR BATHROOM.

01:28.966 --> 01:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HIS GUN GOT JAMMED, THAT'S

01:29.833 --> 01:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THE SHOOTING STOPPED.

01:31.666 --> 01:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: CARTER HAD BEEN

01:32.733 --> 01:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOT IN BOTH LEGS.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE LAID ON THE BATHROOM AND

01:35.733 --> 01:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRIED TO STAY QUIET.

01:38.066 --> 01:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT 2:35 A.M., SHE HEARD MATEEN

01:40.000 --> 01:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALL THE POLICE AND PLEDGE

01:40.733 --> 01:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLEGIANCE TO ISIS.

01:49.166 --> 01:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S WHEN IT KIND OF

01:51.333 --> 01:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIRMED FOR ME THAT WE WEREN'T

01:54.000 --> 01:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE,

01:55.233 --> 01:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE HE HAD A MOTIVE, HE WAS

01:57.233 --> 01:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE FOR A REASON, AND HE WAS

01:58.833 --> 02:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO PROVE SOMETHING.

02:00.666 --> 02:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO AT THAT POINT I PRETTY MUCH

02:01.566 --> 02:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST GAVE UP.

02:02.633 --> 02:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: YOU THOUGHT YOU

02:03.566 --> 02:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE NEVER GOING TO GET OUT OF

02:04.433 --> 02:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE?

02:05.566 --> 02:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I ABSOLUTELY THOUGHT I WAS

02:06.433 --> 02:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEVER GOING TO GET OUT.

02:07.266 --> 02:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HONESTLY, YEAH.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I LOST HOPE VERY, VERY QUICKLY.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I JUST STARTED MAKING PEACE

02:14.333 --> 02:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH GOD.

02:17.366 --> 02:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: TWO-AND-A-HALF

02:18.633 --> 02:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOURS LATER, POLICE PLOWED

02:20.066 --> 02:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THE BATHROOM WALL IN AN

02:21.000 --> 02:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARMORED VEHICLE.

02:22.466 --> 02:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT BEFORE THAT, CARTER SAYS,

02:24.166 --> 02:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATEEN CAME INTO THE BATHROOM

02:25.933 --> 02:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STALL WHERE SHE WAS HIDING.

02:28.233 --> 02:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE HAS HIS HANDGUN IN HIS

02:29.333 --> 02:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAND.

02:30.266 --> 02:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THIS POINT, MY FACE IS

02:31.900 --> 02:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURNING TO THE OTHER STALL,

02:33.566 --> 02:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE I REALLY JUST DIDN'T

02:35.666 --> 02:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO GET SHOT IN THE FACE.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I HEARD HIM SAY "HEY, YOU."

02:38.133 --> 02:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SHOT SOMEONE.

02:39.433 --> 02:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SHOT ANOTHER PERSON.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN RIGHT BEFORE THE POLICE

02:42.200 --> 02:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAME IN, HE SHOT THE PERSON THAT

02:44.000 --> 02:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS DIRECTLY BEHIND ME.

02:45.800 --> 02:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHEN THE WALL CAME DOWN,

02:46.966 --> 02:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE POLICE CAME THROUGH THE

02:48.133 --> 02:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALL.

02:49.266 --> 02:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE DEBRIS WAS PRETTY MUCH

02:50.566 --> 02:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL OVER MY FACE, BUT I COULD

02:51.700 --> 02:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THROUGH THIS ONE PEEPHOLE

02:53.666 --> 02:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGHOUT ALL THE DEBRIS, I SAW

02:55.600 --> 02:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LIGHTS, JUST THE SPARKS FROM

02:56.900 --> 02:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM EXCHANGING GUNFIRE WITH ONE

02:57.800 --> 03:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THERE WAS SILENCE.

03:04.633 --> 03:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: CARTER SPENT SIX

03:06.100 --> 03:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAYS IN AN ORLANDO HOSPITAL

03:07.900 --> 03:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERGOING SURGERY ON HER LEGS.

03:09.933 --> 03:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HER FRIEND TIARA PARKER, SHOT IN

PARKER'S COUSIN, AKYRA MURRAY,

03:14.833 --> 03:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID NOT.

03:16.566 --> 03:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARTER RETURNED TO NEW YORK

03:18.066 --> 03:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIVERSITY AND HAS JUST

03:19.700 --> 03:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETED HER JUNIOR YEAR.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE'S LARGELY RECOVERED FROM HER

PHYSICAL INJURIES, BUT NOT HER

03:24.066 --> 03:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMOTIONAL SCARS.

03:26.800 --> 03:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS

03:27.933 --> 03:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL YEAR, I WAS LIMPING TO

03:28.666 --> 03:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLASS.

03:30.366 --> 03:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS LITERALLY DOING THIS AND

03:31.900 --> 03:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING TO CLASS.

03:33.666 --> 03:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NOW I'M JUST WALKING

03:34.766 --> 03:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRAIGHT BY THE END OF THIS

03:35.833 --> 03:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL YEAR.

03:37.433 --> 03:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMOTIONALLY, I THINK, IT'S LIKE

03:39.300 --> 03:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERY DAY IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF

03:40.366 --> 03:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRUGGLE.

03:42.933 --> 03:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME DAYS I'M REALLY UP, AND I'M

03:45.700 --> 03:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HAPPY, LIFE IS GREAT, I'M

03:47.833 --> 03:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCITED ABOUT THIS THING THAT

03:48.833 --> 03:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED, THIS THING THAT

03:49.733 --> 03:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN SOME DAYS I JUST FIND

03:52.066 --> 03:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MYSELF FALLING INTO THIS DARK

03:53.766 --> 03:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE THAT I DON'T WANT TO GO

03:54.600 --> 03:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK TO.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS IN A REALLY DARK PLACE IN

03:57.600 --> 03:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HOSPITAL, AND SOMETIMES I

03:58.900 --> 04:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEEL MYSELF GOING BACK THERE.
