11:03.796 --> 11:06.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY, I VIEW ALI'S INFLUENCE

11:06.699 --> 11:07.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER THE COURSE OF HIS LIFE

11:07.734 --> 11:08.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE PEOPLE

11:08.768 --> 11:10.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MET WITH HIM THAT NIGHT.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE

11:11.838 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT A PRIVATE FUNCTION THAT WERE

11:13.072 --> 11:14.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOWED TO MEET WITH HIM, AND

11:14.140 --> 11:17.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE OF ALL AGES, BOTH

11:17.110 --> 11:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENDERS, MANY DIFFERENT RACES.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EVERYBODY WAS MOVED TO SOME

11:21.581 --> 11:22.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMOTIONAL LEVEL THAT YOU

11:22.649 --> 11:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULDN'T NORMALLY SEE-- TEARS,

11:25.151 --> 11:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAUGHTER, JUST TO SEE THE WAY

11:28.621 --> 11:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE TOUCHED PEOPLE AT THE

11:29.956 --> 11:33.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGE OF 74 AT THE TIME, AND IT

11:33.660 --> 11:34.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS JUST OVERWHELMING.

11:34.794 --> 11:35.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO THINK THAT, REALLY, HE

11:35.662 --> 11:36.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD BEEN OUT OF THE PUBLIC EYE

11:36.663 --> 11:38.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR 20 YEARS AT THAT POINT,

11:38.164 --> 11:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY, EVEN LONGER-- 32 SINCE

11:39.966 --> 11:41.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH

11:41.634 --> 11:42.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARKINSON'S.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I FOUND IT HARD TO WRAP MY ARMS

11:44.404 --> 11:45.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND IT THAT NIGHT AND THAT

11:45.905 --> 11:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A SMALL MICROCOSM OF WHAT

11:47.540 --> 11:49.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS ENTIRE LIFE HAS BEEN.

11:49.976 --> 11:50.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT IS IT

11:50.677 --> 11:52.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT HIM THAT MADE PEOPLE

11:52.712 --> 11:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACROSS GENERATION LOOK UP TO HIM

11:55.448 --> 11:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS A HERO?

11:57.817 --> 12:02.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT HE IS TO PEOPLE

12:02.355 --> 12:03.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALMOST DEPENDS ON WHO THAT

12:03.690 --> 12:05.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSON IS AND HOW OLD THAT

12:05.291 --> 12:07.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSON IS AND WHEN THAT PERSON

12:07.060 --> 12:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ALI,

12:09.362 --> 12:11.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EITHER PERSONALLY OR JUST

12:11.798 --> 12:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH IMAGES ON A TELEVISION

12:12.865 --> 12:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCREEN OR SOMEWHERE ELSE.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK, OBVIOUSLY, TO A

12:15.535 --> 12:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERATION OF BOXING FANS IN THE

12:17.870 --> 12:19.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
60S AND 70s, HE'S ONE OF THE

12:19.238 --> 12:20.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREATEST ATHLETES IN HISTORY.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN

12:22.408 --> 12:24.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY OF THE 60s, HE IS A

12:24.777 --> 12:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPRESENTATION OF THE SOCIAL

12:26.312 --> 12:28.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BATTLE THAT THEY WERE INVOLVED

12:28.548 --> 12:29.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN AT THE TIME AND ARE STILL

12:29.782 --> 12:31.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVOLVED IN TODAY.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PEOPLE THAT ARE ATTUNED TO

12:33.486 --> 12:35.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL SOCIETY IN AMERICA,

12:35.488 --> 12:36.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS STANCE AGAINST THE VIETNAM

12:36.723 --> 12:39.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAR AT THAT SAME TIME WAS HUGELY

12:39.425 --> 12:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT, AND EVENTUALLY

12:40.927 --> 12:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIRMED BY THE SUPREME COURT

12:42.095 --> 12:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF AMERICA.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN I THINK AS ALI GOT

12:44.564 --> 12:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OLDER-- AND, OBVIOUSLY, WAS IN

12:47.300 --> 12:48.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN IMMENSE BATTLE WITH

12:48.968 --> 12:50.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARKINSON'S DISEASE, AND YET

12:50.837 --> 12:52.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFUSED TO SURRENDER TO IT-- I

12:52.672 --> 12:55.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT PEOPLE BECAME

12:55.775 --> 12:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMPATHETIC TO WHAT HE WAS DOING

12:57.644 --> 13:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ADMIRING OF HIS COURAGE

13:00.413 --> 13:03.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HIS DIGNITY IN THE FACE OF A

13:03.049 --> 13:04.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBILITATING ILLNESS THAT IN
