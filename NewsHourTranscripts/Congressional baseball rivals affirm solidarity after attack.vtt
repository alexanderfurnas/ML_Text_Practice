00:02.033 --> 00:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we are now
joined by the managers of the
two congressional baseball

00:03.500 --> 00:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teams that were practicing this
morning in different places.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are Republican
Representative Joe Barton
of Texas, who, as you
just saw, was at this

00:08.900 --> 00:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
morning's Republican baseball
practice, and Democratic
Representative Michael Doyle of

00:14.500 --> 00:15.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pennsylvania.

00:15.733 --> 00:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, welcome
to the program.

00:18.200 --> 00:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Congressman Barton,
to you first.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First of all, we're so glad
that you are all right.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We saw that you were
there with your two sons.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are you doing?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOE BARTON: We're doing fine.

00:28.966 --> 00:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everybody was looking
out for my two sons.

00:31.666 --> 00:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And thank gosh -- God that the
Capitol Police were there and
immediately returning fire,

00:38.700 --> 00:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which diverted the gunman
from attacking the members
who were on the field.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did you
feel there was anything
more that could have
been done this morning?

00:46.733 --> 00:47.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:47.733 --> 00:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOE BARTON: Not really.

00:49.033 --> 00:51.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, we practice
in a public park.

00:51.833 --> 00:53.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's a dog park.

00:53.100 --> 00:56.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's a YMCA by
the baseball field.

00:56.633 --> 00:58.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are joggers.

00:58.700 --> 01:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are -- it's just, you
know, most mornings, there are
people out doing their exercise

01:03.366 --> 01:06.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and walking their dogs.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't make any attempt
to restrict people from
watching the practice.

01:13.033 --> 01:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This individual who did the
shooting, some of the members
think they saw him yesterday,

01:18.500 --> 01:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, while I thought he had
just driven in, apparently, he
had been in the area for some

01:23.233 --> 01:25.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't -- I don't
know how you can function
in an open democracy,
especially in the House

01:32.033 --> 01:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of Representatives,
with 435 members, and
not have public access.

01:38.466 --> 01:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, again, this game has been
played for about over 100 years.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's never been
anything like this before.

01:46.166 --> 01:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Doyle, where were you
when you heard this?

01:51.066 --> 01:52.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what did you think?

01:52.300 --> 01:54.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:54.166 --> 01:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE DOYLE (D), Pennsylvania:
So, we were in the
middle of our practice.

01:56.233 --> 02:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were having batting practice,
and I was standing behind home
plate, you know, instructing

02:01.066 --> 02:02.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our batters.

02:02.666 --> 02:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I got a text message
from one of my staff
saying, are you OK?

02:08.266 --> 02:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I was puzzled by
the -- by the text.

02:10.400 --> 02:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I saw right below it
a news clip saying, shooter
at congressional baseball

02:17.433 --> 02:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
practice, and realized at that
moment that it had to be over
at the Republican practice.

02:23.100 --> 02:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I called my team off the
field, because we didn't have
much information at the time,

02:29.833 --> 02:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get them over in the dugout,
and let them all know what
happened and what I was hearing.

02:35.566 --> 02:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there was sort of a --
I call it a stunned silence
with most of the players.

02:41.033 --> 02:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We just couldn't
believe something like
this was happening.

02:44.133 --> 02:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there wasn't much we
could do where we were.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we basically just huddled up
and started saying some prayers
for our Republican colleagues

02:53.500 --> 02:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they'd be safe and that
nobody would be hurt badly.

02:55.833 --> 03:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, after that, you know, the
reports started to flood into
our phones and we just, you

03:01.966 --> 03:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know, were reading them
like everyone else.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Barton, and, again, we know that
you both were practicing for

03:05.900 --> 03:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this congressional game, annual
congressional game that's
taking place tomorrow night.

03:06.833 --> 03:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're going ahead with it.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is the -- I just asked Lisa
Desjardins this question, our
reporter at the Capitol, and

03:10.900 --> 03:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she said this is -- the reaction
there has been sober, that
people are -- to some extent,

03:12.833 --> 03:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
members may be rethinking
whether things have
gotten too partisan.

03:13.633 --> 03:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you think?

03:14.300 --> 03:16.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:16.366 --> 03:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE BARTON: Well, the reaction
here has been very supportive
of the Republicans on the

03:20.766 --> 03:22.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

03:22.733 --> 03:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congressman Doyle and his
Democratic players have
reached out to us personally.

03:26.366 --> 03:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The speaker and Mrs.
Pelosi, the minority leader,
have talked directly.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody is supportive because,
we are -- we have an R or an
D by our name, but our title

03:40.700 --> 03:45.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - our title is United
States representative.

03:52.700 --> 03:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm very proud to be
a member of the Congress.

03:59.133 --> 04:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm proud to serve with
people like Mike Doyle.

04:01.300 --> 04:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, we feel very
blessed that we're here
to have this interview.

04:08.333 --> 04:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Had the shooter not been
attacked by the Capitol
Hill Police, who risked
their lives -- and

04:15.200 --> 04:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two of them got shot -- had he
gotten inside the fence of the
field and gotten to the first

04:21.966 --> 04:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
base dugout, there were 20,
15 members, and five or six
staffers in that dugout huddled

04:30.200 --> 04:31.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

04:31.966 --> 04:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's actually a lowered,
below-the-field dugout.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there would have been
no place for them to run.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it could have
been much worse.

04:40.033 --> 04:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Doyle, I can see the pain
in both of your faces.

04:44.833 --> 04:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this a time for coming
together in some way and for
rethinking, as we said, some of

04:53.100 --> 04:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the partisanship?

04:54.100 --> 04:55.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:55.633 --> 05:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE DOYLE: I think all of us
are reflecting on that today.

05:02.100 --> 05:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joe and I have been associated
with this game for quite a
while, and we have been friends

05:04.800 --> 05:07.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a long time.

05:07.033 --> 05:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His son Jack is like one of
my nephews, always comes up
and asks me how I'm doing.

05:13.966 --> 05:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I always tries to get
intelligence from Jack on what
his dad is up to, and Jack never

05:18.733 --> 05:19.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gives him up.

05:19.666 --> 05:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So he's a good kid that way.

05:21.066 --> 05:22.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:22.066 --> 05:24.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:24.166 --> 05:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE DOYLE: But I got to tell
you, there was a real feeling
of helplessness on our part

05:28.000 --> 05:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as we stood there in the
dugout reading the reports
that were coming in.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We know -- we know
all these guys.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're our friends.

05:37.066 --> 05:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We may have differences
politically, but they're
our friends, and we care
about them very much.

05:43.800 --> 05:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think all of us are
reflecting on how each one of us
individually can set an example

05:50.700 --> 05:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the country, too, because
when people see their leaders
being uncivil towards one

05:55.366 --> 06:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another, then you start to
see the public being uncivil
towards one another and towards

06:01.000 --> 06:02.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their leaders.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that's
got to change.

06:04.200 --> 06:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So maybe it starts with
us, and maybe this will
change some attitudes here.

06:10.233 --> 06:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Barton, I hear and I see the
affection between the two of

06:12.566 --> 06:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you, and I am seeing and hearing
you say it exists with others.

06:17.466 --> 06:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it's fair to
say, it doesn't always come
across in the news coverage.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:23.733 --> 06:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE BARTON: Well, politics in
Washington is a contact sport.

06:26.133 --> 06:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it shouldn't be a
personal animosity sport.

06:30.433 --> 06:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And with Mike and I and a lot
of other members, it's not.

06:34.066 --> 06:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do want to apologize for
getting emotional a minute ago.

06:38.033 --> 06:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Tom Hanks was the
manager of a women's baseball
team, and, in that movie, he has

06:44.200 --> 06:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the famous line, there's
no crying in baseball.

06:46.333 --> 06:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, there's certainly no
-- shouldn't be any crying
in congressional baseball.

06:50.433 --> 06:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I do apologize for my
emotional outburst a minute ago.

06:56.300 --> 06:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No -- no...

06:56.966 --> 06:57.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

06:57.566 --> 06:59.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:59.633 --> 07:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE DOYLE: I would say
there's lots of members of
Congress that get along.

07:01.566 --> 07:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We tend to not be
the ones the media is
interested in interviewing.

07:04.133 --> 07:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oftentimes, the media's
interested in interviewing
the two that are throwing
the swords at each

07:08.933 --> 07:10.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
other.

07:10.966 --> 07:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, maybe the news media,
too, can reflect a little bit
on that and show some of the

07:16.100 --> 07:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
positive things that
take place down here.

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOE BARTON: That's true.

07:20.233 --> 07:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
something for us to reflect on.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, we so appreciate the two
of you being together right now.

07:23.700 --> 07:26.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And no apology needed,
Congressman Barton.

07:26.500 --> 07:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's entirely understandable
why you would be emotional
at a time like this.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We thank you.

07:33.333 --> 07:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're thankful that
you are all right.

07:34.866 --> 07:37.200 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We thank you for
talking with us.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congressman Doyle, thank you.
