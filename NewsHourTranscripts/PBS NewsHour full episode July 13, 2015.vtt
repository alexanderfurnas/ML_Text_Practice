WEBVTT

00:08.342 --> 00:16.416
GWEN IFILL: A deal is struck, a
Grexit averted -- what Greece
must now do to receive its

00:16.416 --> 00:18.285
third European bailout.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.254
Good evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.656
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:22.656 --> 00:27.394
Also ahead this Monday: A
nuclear agreement again eludes
world powers and Iran. The final

00:27.394 --> 00:30.998
stages of talks drag on.

00:30.998 --> 00:35.369
GWEN IFILL: Plus: doctors on
demand -- the promise of
telemedicine to increase access

00:35.369 --> 00:39.039
to care and cut
health care costs.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.143
DR. RAVEENA RIHAL, Doctor on
Demand: A patient can download
the app on their mobile device,

00:43.143 --> 00:48.916
either laptop, iPhone or tablet.
And if they want to see a
doctor, they just press a
button,

00:48.916 --> 00:53.420
and they will connect to a
doctor that licensed in their
state and can see them over
video.

00:53.420 --> 00:57.858
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the darker
side of one of America's most
moral characters, a look

00:57.858 --> 01:03.196
at racism in Harper Lee's second
book, "Go Set a Watchman."

01:03.196 --> 01:05.465
GWEN IFILL: Those are some of
the stories we're covering on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:05.465 --> 01:07.234
(BREAK)

01:07.234 --> 01:11.638
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greece reached a
debt deal with its European
creditors today after an

01:11.638 --> 01:17.210
all-night emergency summit in
Brussels. It agreed to a strict
timetable for enacting

01:17.210 --> 01:23.183
further unpopular austerity
measures in exchange for a third
international bailout.

01:23.183 --> 01:27.788
Now Greek Prime Minister Alexis
Tsipras must push the
cost-cutting proposals through
his

01:27.788 --> 01:32.592
Parliament over the next two
days. We will take a closer look
at the new accord and get

01:32.592 --> 01:36.763
on-the-ground reaction from
Greece's residents after the
news summary.

01:36.763 --> 01:41.601
GWEN IFILL: U.S. and world
markets rallied today as
investors welcomed the news of
the

01:41.601 --> 01:46.406
Greek bailout agreement. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average climbed more

01:46.406 --> 01:54.381
than 217 points to close above
17977. The Nasdaq rose almost 74
points and the S&P 500

01:54.381 --> 01:57.217
added nearly 23.

01:57.217 --> 02:02.422
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another set of
talks taking place in Europe
over Iran's nuclear program

02:02.422 --> 02:08.362
stretched past yet another
deadline today in Vienna. One
ongoing dispute reportedly

02:08.362 --> 02:13.934
involved Iran's status under a
U.N. arms embargo. There'd been
hope that a final deal would

02:13.934 --> 02:19.539
be announced as the 17th day of
negotiations got under way this
morning.

02:19.539 --> 02:24.044
But, later, Iran's foreign
minister, yelling to reporters
from a hotel balcony, indicated

02:24.044 --> 02:27.180
it wouldn't come today.

02:27.180 --> 02:32.219
Still, in Washington, State
Department spokesman John Kirby
remained cautiously optimistic.

02:32.219 --> 02:36.456
REAR ADM. JOHN KIRBY, Pentagon
Press Secretary: There's been
genuine progress made. I think

02:36.456 --> 02:41.428
Secretary Kerry believes that --
and he's said as much -- that
we're close, but there

02:41.428 --> 02:48.635
still remains some sticking
points, some issues that still
need to be resolved. And so we

02:48.635 --> 02:51.071
will just -- we will see where
they go. But our focus is on
what's going on inside the

02:51.071 --> 02:53.306
negotiating room.

02:53.306 --> 02:57.277
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kirby added that
an interim nuclear agreement,
which has already been

02:57.277 --> 03:02.582
extended three times in two
weeks, can remain in effect for
as long as necessary.

03:02.582 --> 03:06.820
We will have more on the fate of
the Iranian nuclear deal later
in the program.

03:06.820 --> 03:12.159
GWEN IFILL: Iraqi troops and
Shiite militiamen began a
long-awaited large-scale
military

03:12.159 --> 03:17.697
assault against the Islamic
State today. The operation
targeted the western province of

03:17.697 --> 03:22.803
Anbar two months after Islamic
State fighters seized its
capital, Ramadi. A military
spokesman

03:22.803 --> 03:25.872
made the announcement today
on state television.

03:25.872 --> 03:31.545
BRIG. GEN. YAHYA RASOOL, Iraqi
Army: The military operations
for liberating Anbar from I.S.

03:31.545 --> 03:37.651
militants started at 5:00 a.m.
today, dawn. Our armed forces,
along the Shiite militiamen,

03:37.651 --> 03:42.389
special task troops, federal
police and Anbar tribes, are now
waging pitched battles and

03:42.389 --> 03:45.325
advancing toward their
designated targets.

03:45.325 --> 03:49.830
GWEN IFILL: The launch of the
offensive came as the Islamic
State claimed responsibility

03:49.830 --> 03:54.668
for a series of car bombs and
suicide attacks that struck
Baghdad yesterday. The blasts

03:54.668 --> 03:57.404
killed at least 29 people.

03:57.404 --> 04:02.943
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in Yemen, a
Saudi-led coalition airstrike in
the capital, Sanaa,

04:02.943 --> 04:07.948
killed at least 25 civilians and
injured 50 others. Relatives
scrambled to pull victims

04:07.948 --> 04:11.118
from the rubble
early this morning.

04:11.118 --> 04:17.190
The bombing struck multiple
houses in a slum area of the
city, in spite of a
U.N.-brokered

04:17.190 --> 04:21.194
humanitarian truce between
Houthi rebels and the Yemeni
government.

04:21.194 --> 04:26.800
GWEN IFILL: Wisconsin Governor
Scott Walker has become the 15th
Republican to enter the

04:26.800 --> 04:33.173
2016 presidential race. The
second-term governor declared
his candidacy this morning by
tweeting:

04:33.173 --> 04:36.243
"I'm running for president
because Americans deserve a
leader who will fight and win
for

04:36.243 --> 04:38.678
them."

04:38.678 --> 04:44.317
Walker built his national
profile by taking on labor
unions, and surviving a recall
vote

04:44.317 --> 04:48.755
in 2012. He's set to make his
official announcement tonight in
Wisconsin. We will have more on

04:48.755 --> 04:51.525
that later in the program.

04:51.525 --> 04:57.664
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
today commuted the sentences of
46 nonviolent federal prisoners.

04:57.664 --> 05:02.903
The majority of the men and
women were serving time for
offenses involving crack cocaine

05:02.903 --> 05:07.707
or marijuana. The president said
-- quote -- "Their punishments
didn't fit the crime."

05:07.707 --> 05:13.413
He's now issued commutations for
89 convicts during his
presidency. Most were nonviolent

05:13.413 --> 05:17.817
offenders sentenced
for drug crimes.

05:17.817 --> 05:24.057
The Pentagon is preparing to end
its ban on transgender
individuals serving in the U.S.

05:24.057 --> 05:29.729
military. Defense Secretary
Ashton Carter said in a
statement that the policy was
outdated.

05:29.729 --> 05:34.801
He's creating a working group to
conduct a six-month study on the
effects of lifting

05:34.801 --> 05:38.638
the ban. That would give the
military services time to work
through questions like health

05:38.638 --> 05:41.341
care and housing.

05:41.341 --> 05:45.512
GWEN IFILL: And the Boy Scouts
of America took a major step
closer to lifting its ban

05:45.512 --> 05:51.284
on gay adult troop leaders. An
executive committee unanimously
approved a resolution to allow

05:51.284 --> 05:55.689
individual troops to set their
own policies. In May, its
president, former Defense
Secretary

05:55.689 --> 05:59.793
Robert Gates, declared
the ban unsustainable.

05:59.793 --> 06:04.231
The new resolution still must be
ratified at a national executive
board meeting in two

06:04.231 --> 06:11.705
weeks. In 2013, the organization
voted to allow gay youth, but
not adults, in Scouting.

06:11.705 --> 06:18.078
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what a third European bailout
means for Greeks; in Vienna,

06:18.078 --> 06:25.318
Iran nuclear negotiations creep
toward conclusion; when doctors
make virtual house calls on
demand;

06:25.318 --> 06:30.523
the week ahead in politics with
Amy Walter and Tamara Keith; an
incredible escape prompts

06:30.523 --> 06:36.129
a manhunt for one of Mexico's
most notorious drug lords; and a
complicated portrait of

06:36.129 --> 06:40.700
Atticus Finch in the companion
novel to "To Kill a
Mockingbird."

06:40.700 --> 06:56.016
JUDY WOODRUFF: The nation of
Greece and its creditors reached
a preliminary deal to avert

06:56.016 --> 07:01.288
immediate financial collapse,
but it demands that the
struggling country make major
concessions

07:01.288 --> 07:05.091
and means continued sacrifice
and hardship for its people.

07:05.091 --> 07:09.796
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant has this report.

07:09.796 --> 07:14.467
MALCOLM BRABANT: Prime Minister
Alexi Tsipras emerged after a
long night of bitter
negotiations.

07:14.467 --> 07:18.038
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greek Prime
Minister (through translator):
Until the end, we battled to

07:18.038 --> 07:22.008
get an agreement to get the
country back on its feet. We
were faced with a very difficult

07:22.008 --> 07:26.446
decision within hard dilemmas.
We took the responsibility to
decide in order to avert

07:26.446 --> 07:30.450
the most extreme plans by
conservative circles in the
European Union.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.387
MALCOLM BRABANT: German
Chancellor Angela Merkel was one
of those conservatives who

07:34.387 --> 07:39.359
ran a hard bargain with the
Greeks. They seemed ready to
quit until European Council
President

07:39.359 --> 07:43.630
Donald Tusk, who is also
president of Poland, persuaded
them to keep at it.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.266
DONALD TUSK, President, European
Council: The decision gives
Greece the chance to get

07:46.266 --> 07:54.674
back on track with the support
of European partners. It also
avoids the social, economic

07:54.674 --> 07:59.145
and political consequences that
a negative outcome would have
brought.

07:59.145 --> 08:03.983
MALCOLM BRABANT: Meanwhile, in
Athens, pensioners saw no reason
to celebrate, as they queued

08:03.983 --> 08:07.187
up to withdraw money
outside closed banks.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.590
KATERINA MANETI, Greece (through
translator): They're acting
thoughtlessly. Our current

08:10.590 --> 08:13.626
politicians are
experimenting on us.

08:13.626 --> 08:17.197
MAN (through translator):
Tsipras was put in a corner and
he had to make this deal.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.400
We will have to swallow
this and see how it goes.

08:20.400 --> 08:25.505
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
near-bankrupt country will
receive a $95 billion bailout
over three

08:25.505 --> 08:29.676
years, but the deal mandates
tough conditions on Greece, ones
its voters rejected just one

08:29.676 --> 08:32.245
week ago.

08:32.245 --> 08:38.118
The deal calls for streamlined
pensions, raised taxes and
reform to the labor market. Two

08:38.118 --> 08:42.922
hours boat ride from Athens,
dawn broke on the island of
Angistri, with its 1,000
residents

08:42.922 --> 08:47.527
unsure of their future. This has
traditionally been a summer
playground for Athenians, but

08:47.527 --> 08:51.698
cash-poor Greeks have stayed
away over the past five years.

08:51.698 --> 08:57.270
At the small clifftop hotel run
by Nondas Agianozoglou and his
family, there's none

08:57.270 --> 09:01.841
of the tension that exists in
Athens. But this tourist
industry veteran shares his
countrymen's

09:01.841 --> 09:06.613
fury at the perceived harshness
of the measures imposed on
Greece.

09:06.613 --> 09:09.883
NONDAS AGIANOZOGLOU, Owner,
Rosy's Little Village: You can't
force a people that doesn't

09:09.883 --> 09:15.722
make money to cut down his
salaries, his pensions, pay
higher taxes, and pay out his
debt.

09:15.722 --> 09:19.426
MALCOLM BRABANT: But a pensioner
from Holland enjoying the Greek
seaside said his hosts

09:19.426 --> 09:22.128
had long been living
beyond their means.

09:22.128 --> 09:31.938
JAN MEYERS, Dutch Pensioner: A
policeman of 46 years. After 25
years of work, go on pension

09:31.938 --> 09:36.943
with 100 percent of his salary,
it's crazy. There's no country
that can pay that.

09:36.943 --> 09:40.814
MALCOLM BRABANT: The tourist
industry, which is one of
Greece's most important foreign

09:40.814 --> 09:45.685
currency earners, will have to
bear some of the burden of
financing the new bailout
package.

09:45.685 --> 09:50.056
Hotels and restaurants will have
to pay more in sales tax. And
there are fears that this

09:50.056 --> 09:55.061
could drive away vacationers in
what is a highly competitive
Mediterranean market.

09:55.061 --> 09:59.165
MICHALI PANDOU, Chairman,
Angistri Chamber of Commerce:
The other touristic places in

09:59.165 --> 10:04.737
the Mediterranean are already
cheaper than us. And if we try
to increase it, we're going

10:04.737 --> 10:12.245
to get to minimize the tourists
that possibly want to come to
Greece for holidays.

10:12.245 --> 10:16.282
MALCOLM BRABANT: But holidays
are perhaps the last thing on
the minds of many on the

10:16.282 --> 10:21.321
streets of Athens. Left-wing
groups are urging workers to go
on strike in protest against

10:21.321 --> 10:25.024
the bailout deal and they are
organizing demonstrations over
the next coming days.

10:25.024 --> 10:29.929
Their aim is to convince Greek
lawmakers to reject the E.U.
proposal and to trigger Greece's

10:29.929 --> 10:34.801
exit from the Eurozone. The
country's continued presence
within the euro depends on Prime

10:34.801 --> 10:39.572
Minister Tsipras convincing
Parliament to enact emergency
legislation by Wednesday.

10:39.572 --> 10:43.576
He faces a certain revolt from
within his governing coalition,
but he should secure

10:43.576 --> 10:47.547
enough votes to make sure that
Greece remains financially
afloat.

10:47.547 --> 10:51.784
For the "PBS NewsHour," this
is Malcolm Brabant in Greece.

10:51.784 --> 10:54.888
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's zero in on
what Greece and the rest of
Europe have agreed to and

10:54.888 --> 10:58.324
the power dynamics around this.

10:58.324 --> 11:02.795
Eswar Prasad watches all of this
as a professor at Cornell
University and a senior fellow

11:02.795 --> 11:07.100
at the Brookings Institution.
He's also worked for the IMF.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.601
Welcome back to the
program, Eswar Prasad.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.136
ESWAR PRASAD, Professor of Trade
Policy, Cornell University: My
pleasure.

11:10.136 --> 11:13.406
JUDY WOODRUFF: We just heard
some of the conditions the Greek
people are going to have to live

11:13.406 --> 11:18.745
up to in order to make this
agreement work. What do they
really mean for the Greek
people?

11:18.745 --> 11:22.815
ESWAR PRASAD: This is total
capitulation at one extent to
what the Germans and the others

11:22.815 --> 11:25.885
have demanded.

11:25.885 --> 11:29.789
Greece had agreed to do
basically everything that the
Germans and the others in the
Eurozone

11:29.789 --> 11:34.694
feel is necessary to turn around
the Greek economy, make it more
competitive again. And

11:34.694 --> 11:38.932
some of these things will have
to have been done in any case,
because the Greek labor

11:38.932 --> 11:42.368
markets are sort of frozen up,
the product markets aren't very
competitive, which means

11:42.368 --> 11:46.406
that entry into certain
professions is not very easy.

11:46.406 --> 11:52.011
The tax burden is still very
low. The tax administration is
not good. The public
administration

11:52.011 --> 11:56.649
costs too much. So they have
basically agreed to reform all
of these, in the hope that their

11:56.649 --> 12:00.286
economy can become more
competitive. And in the interim,
the deal is that they will get

12:00.286 --> 12:03.656
some money that will get them
through the next three years.

12:03.656 --> 12:07.627
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as you're
suggesting, adjustments in
pensions, higher taxes, what
they're calling

12:07.627 --> 12:10.964
labor market reforms.
What does that mean?

12:10.964 --> 12:14.233
ESWAR PRASAD: That essentially
means that it will be easier to
fire workers. Right now,

12:14.233 --> 12:18.538
it's difficult to shut down
firms, to fire workers.

12:18.538 --> 12:23.009
And the collective bargaining
agreements are not making the
labor market vibrant enough,

12:23.009 --> 12:26.980
which means that firms are very
reluctant to hire workers
because it's very difficult

12:26.980 --> 12:30.383
to fire them. And the wage
structure is also very
complicated and makes it
difficult to

12:30.383 --> 12:34.087
cut wages, although Greek wages
have fallen quite significantly.

12:34.087 --> 12:38.925
So, Greece has actually done a
fair bit in the last few years,
but the problem is not

12:38.925 --> 12:42.996
enough to make the economy
competitive and they still have
a crushing debt burden.

12:42.996 --> 12:46.432
JUDY WOODRUFF: They believe that
this is going to make a
difference, that this is
actually

12:46.432 --> 12:49.736
going to bring down the Greek
debt? They're not getting actual
debt relief, as I understand

12:49.736 --> 12:51.471
it, with this deal.
Is that correct?

12:51.471 --> 12:55.308
ESWAR PRASAD: That's the crucial
issue. The deal on the table
about three weeks ago was

12:55.308 --> 12:58.745
in fact a slightly better one.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.047
And then Prime Minister Tsipras
said he would have a referendum.
The referendum took place

13:01.047 --> 13:07.487
on July 5. And that shattered
the trust that the other
Eurozone countries had in
Greece,

13:07.487 --> 13:10.590
so now they have said you have
to implement some of these
measures and some of these
measures

13:10.590 --> 13:15.194
in fact have to be in
place by this Wednesday.

13:15.194 --> 13:18.765
And then the Greeks will get
some debt relief, again not a
write-down of their debt, but

13:18.765 --> 13:22.068
a longer period over which
they could pay it back.

13:22.068 --> 13:24.303
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why did Prime
Minister Tsipras and the rest of
the Greek leadership agree

13:24.303 --> 13:25.571
to this?

13:25.571 --> 13:28.875
ESWAR PRASAD: At this point,
they really had no choice.

13:28.875 --> 13:34.113
Germany and the other hard-line
countries in Europe had made it
very, very clear that

13:34.113 --> 13:38.117
there was no other deal on the
table, and in fact even this
deal came together only

13:38.117 --> 13:41.788
at the very last minute. So the
alternative would have been to
exit the euro. And the

13:41.788 --> 13:45.158
Germans made it clear that they
were willing to consider this
possibility.

13:45.158 --> 13:49.996
So Tsipras was left with no
options. And now he's had to
accept this deal, which is not

13:49.996 --> 13:54.300
a great one for Greece, because
it may help in some ways in
terms of getting the economy

13:54.300 --> 13:57.837
back on track, but I'm not sure
it ensures the economic
viability of Greece within the

13:57.837 --> 14:00.173
Eurozone still.

14:00.173 --> 14:05.845
JUDY WOODRUFF: What happens,
Eswar Prasad, if Greece is not
able to fulfill these reforms,

14:05.845 --> 14:09.015
not able to carry through on
everything that they say they
will do?

14:09.015 --> 14:11.384
ESWAR PRASAD: It is going to be
a very difficult political slog
to do by Wednesday what they

14:11.384 --> 14:13.920
need to do.

14:13.920 --> 14:18.091
If they can do that, they passes
them past one hurdle. But I
think it's still going to

14:18.091 --> 14:21.627
be very difficult because it is
going to be enormous and
wrenching pain in the Greek
economy,

14:21.627 --> 14:25.364
which is going to lead to social
and political instability.

14:25.364 --> 14:29.936
If all of that happens, I think
a very clear line has been drawn
in the sand that if the

14:29.936 --> 14:33.139
reforms are not implemented,
then Greece is going to have to
exit the Eurozone, and it

14:33.139 --> 14:35.341
may well come to that.

14:35.341 --> 14:38.177
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, if you
look back at the bigger picture
here, what does all

14:38.177 --> 14:42.215
this say about the political
relationship between Greece and
the rest of Europe, the

14:42.215 --> 14:45.485
internal political
dynamics on the continent?

14:45.485 --> 14:49.355
ESWAR PRASAD: It's almost become
a morality play at one level,
with the French view, for

14:49.355 --> 14:53.960
instance, that it's important to
keep the Eurozone together no
matter what the cost,

14:53.960 --> 14:58.064
and the views of the Germans,
the Dutch and the Finns and so
on that if the Eurozone is

14:58.064 --> 15:00.833
to be preserved, all the rules
have to be preserved and
maintained and that giving
Greece

15:00.833 --> 15:04.604
a free pass will not do.

15:04.604 --> 15:09.442
Greece has surrendered some
degree of sovereignty here.
Essentially, it's allowed or
given permission

15:09.442 --> 15:13.579
to the so-called Troika, the
European Commission, the
European Central Bank and the
IMF, to

15:13.579 --> 15:17.917
come back and supervise what the
Greeks are doing. So in that
sense, Greece has basically

15:17.917 --> 15:20.553
said, we are willing to take you
in and you can discipline us and
that we will commit

15:20.553 --> 15:23.156
to do what we are doing.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.793
But Greece essentially has given
away a lot of its political and
economic levers in order

15:26.793 --> 15:29.328
to remain in the Eurozone.

15:29.328 --> 15:32.498
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this has
opened up, you're saying, a
significant divide inside the
European

15:32.498 --> 15:34.333
Union itself.

15:34.333 --> 15:39.438
ESWAR PRASAD: This has exposed
very clear rifts within the
European Eurozone.

15:39.438 --> 15:43.543
And I think no matter what
happens to Greece, that's going
to be very difficult to put
together

15:43.543 --> 15:47.380
right now, because it's clear
that there is going to have to
be a reconsideration of the

15:47.380 --> 15:51.551
political governance structure.
I think many of the countries
that feel that Greece got

15:51.551 --> 15:56.055
a difficult deal here are not
going to, I think, suspect
Germany taking the lead on

15:56.055 --> 16:01.093
these issues anymore. So, it is
going to be a fraught time for
the Eurozone ahead.

16:01.093 --> 16:04.730
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have been
watching it for days. Now we
know the result. But it will

16:04.730 --> 16:05.731
continue.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.700
Eswar Prasad, we thank you.

16:07.700 --> 16:13.439
ESWAR PRASAD: Thank you.

16:13.439 --> 16:26.819
GWEN IFILL: The efforts to reach
an Iran nuclear deal appeared so
close today that Iran's
president

16:26.819 --> 16:31.591
even tweeted about it, calling
it a good beginning. But in no
time at all, that tweet was
deleted

16:31.591 --> 16:34.861
and reports of new
negotiating snags surfaced.

16:34.861 --> 16:39.699
So, the sun set again in Vienna
today with no agreement.

16:39.699 --> 16:44.170
Indira Lakshmanan is covering
the talks for Bloomberg News,
and she joins us now.

16:44.170 --> 16:48.074
Indira, late this afternoon, we
heard there was the announcement
overnight. Then there

16:48.074 --> 16:51.878
wouldn't be an announcement
overnight. This keeps going on.
I wonder what the latest that

16:51.878 --> 16:54.213
you know about why.

16:54.213 --> 17:00.052
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN, Bloomberg
News: Yes, it's deja vu all over
again, Gwen.

17:00.052 --> 17:05.157
And if it's been a roller
coaster for the past 17 days,
we're now going into day 18,

17:05.157 --> 17:09.695
and this has been the most
extreme roller coaster in the
last 24 hours. We thought we

17:09.695 --> 17:14.767
were going to have a deal. Then
Foreign Minister Zarif came out
on his balcony, sort of Evita

17:14.767 --> 17:18.471
Peron style. We all yelled up
him and said, will there be a
deal?

17:18.471 --> 17:24.543
He made a motion with his head,
and indicated, no, there would
not be. We're now after midnight

17:24.543 --> 17:29.482
in Vienna, so the negotiators
have blown past through their
fourth deadline in the last

17:29.482 --> 17:35.488
18 days, but the latest reports
we're getting, our sources are
telling us from four different

17:35.488 --> 17:39.425
delegations that it's very, very
likely that there will be an
announcement of a final deal

17:39.425 --> 17:42.495
in the early hours
of the morning.

17:42.495 --> 17:46.766
So we're talking about possibly
as early as pre-dawn Vienna
time, which might be as early

17:46.766 --> 17:50.202
as before midnight
Washington time.

17:50.202 --> 17:55.441
GWEN IFILL: Boy, that's the
latest possible thing. But what
is it that they're trying

17:55.441 --> 17:58.911
to smooth out? What are these
last-minute hangups which people
keep referring to?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.847
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: Right.

18:01.847 --> 18:07.887
Well, I reported 24 hours ago
that that arms embargo issue
actually had been mostly
smoothed

18:07.887 --> 18:13.693
out, and the issue is that, on
the U.N. side, the Iranians
wanted the arms embargo lifted

18:13.693 --> 18:17.596
right away. Now it looks like it
will be a phased process over
the next two to eight

18:17.596 --> 18:20.633
years for lifting that embargo.

18:20.633 --> 18:25.972
But what they have been arguing
about all day today is language
because language matters,

18:25.972 --> 18:30.843
and we have lawyers from seven
different countries and the
building going over literally
every

18:30.843 --> 18:37.516
comma and every T that's crossed
and I that is dotted in 100
pages of documents. So, again,

18:37.516 --> 18:40.953
we're talking about a
100-page-long document with five
technical annexes that is meant

18:40.953 --> 18:44.190
to last for a long time.

18:44.190 --> 18:49.362
Some elements of this deal will
last 10 years, others for 15,
and yet others for 25. So the

18:49.362 --> 18:53.599
U.S. and Iran, in particular,
are really concerned that they
want to get this exactly right.

18:53.599 --> 18:56.268
No one wants to have to go back.

18:56.268 --> 19:00.573
You can't reopen it and
renegotiate it, so it's really
about getting the language right

19:00.573 --> 19:04.710
the first time. And one thing I
want to remind you when we were
here a couple of months ago

19:04.710 --> 19:09.148
from Lausanne, Switzerland,
having a similar conversation
after midnight, you will
remember

19:09.148 --> 19:13.652
that when they actually released
the deal last time, the
framework agreement, the United

19:13.652 --> 19:15.654
States had one set of talking
points and Iran had a different
set of talking points.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.356
GWEN IFILL: Remember that.

19:17.356 --> 19:19.325
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: And that
really caused some problems in
the last couple of months

19:19.325 --> 19:21.727
when they have been
trying to negotiate.

19:21.727 --> 19:25.898
So what we understand from both
the United States and the
Iranians this time is, there's

19:25.898 --> 19:31.871
going to be one comprehensive
statement that speaks for both
sides. Imagine how hard that

19:31.871 --> 19:36.175
is, Gwen, to do that, because
both the Americans and the
Iranians are trying to show
their

19:36.175 --> 19:40.579
home audiences that they won. So
how do you come up with language
that says you won in

19:40.579 --> 19:43.549
Tehran and also says you won in
Washington when they're both
facing hard-line audiences

19:43.549 --> 19:44.717
at home?

19:44.717 --> 19:47.553
So, I think a lot of it
has been about words.

19:47.553 --> 19:50.623
GWEN IFILL: You mentioned that
they have now blown through four
deadlines. Do deadlines

19:50.623 --> 19:53.692
matter at all anymore?

19:53.692 --> 19:59.832
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: Well, you
know, the deadlines mattered
insofar as the Obama
administration

19:59.832 --> 20:03.636
has said the deadlines are a
forcing mechanism. They force
people to sit down and actually

20:03.636 --> 20:08.774
make a decision. Apparently, in
this case, they didn't force
them to do that much.

20:08.774 --> 20:13.546
But I think, as John Kerry said,
this can't go on forever. They
can't stay at the negotiating

20:13.546 --> 20:19.385
table forever. Iran has sort of
very cleverly taken that and
turned it on its head by saying,

20:19.385 --> 20:23.456
hey, we face no deadlines, we
will stay here as long as it
takes, and if anyone leaves

20:23.456 --> 20:27.026
the negotiations, it's
their fault, not ours.

20:27.026 --> 20:31.597
That of course puts the United
States on the spot because if
negotiations were to collapse,

20:31.597 --> 20:35.835
Iran could easily say, well,
that's America's fault, they
walked out, we didn't walk out.

20:35.835 --> 20:40.039
So we have had all of the
parties really trying to keep
both United States and Iran at
the

20:40.039 --> 20:44.643
table. A funny moment earlier
today was when Sergei Lavrov,
the Russian foreign minister,

20:44.643 --> 20:47.680
walked into a meeting with the
Zarif, the Iranian foreign
minister, who said, how are

20:47.680 --> 20:51.984
you, Mr. Lavrov,
and he said angry.

20:51.984 --> 20:56.755
He was smiling at the time, but
I'm sure there was more than a
little truth to that, because

20:56.755 --> 21:00.593
the Russians, the Europeans, the
Chinese, they are frustrated.
They want the deal to

21:00.593 --> 21:04.330
be done. They feel like they
have already signed off on it,
and they wish that the Americans

21:04.330 --> 21:07.800
and the Iranians would get their
houses in order, get the wording
straight, so everyone

21:07.800 --> 21:13.205
can move on, go home after 18
days of this and really
two-and-a-half years.

21:13.205 --> 21:16.509
GWEN IFILL: Right. Well, Indira,
I know that sleep is overrated
and you're going to be

21:16.509 --> 21:19.278
up again late tonight waiting on
this last shoe to drop. Thank
you so much for joining

21:19.278 --> 21:24.383
us.

21:24.383 --> 21:34.293
JUDY WOODRUFF: Videoconferencing
has become so commonplace that
we have grown comfortable

21:34.293 --> 21:38.797
communicating with one another
through pixels on a screen.

21:38.797 --> 21:44.503
That comfort, combined with
rapid advances in health
monitoring technology, is
fueling

21:44.503 --> 21:51.911
a new boom in telemedicine.
Teladoc, a big player in
providing video and telephone
medical

21:51.911 --> 21:56.115
consults, had an extremely
successful launch when it went
public on the stock market
earlier

21:56.115 --> 22:01.720
this month. It raised more than
$270 million on the first day.

22:01.720 --> 22:07.593
As Hari Sreenivasan explains,
telemedicine is beginning to
transform the way we experience

22:07.593 --> 22:13.766
the medical system. It's the
latest in our Breakthroughs
series on invention and
innovation.

22:13.766 --> 22:19.138
HARI SREENIVASAN: A simple
ritual, like gardening on a hot
summer day, is something Tom and

22:19.138 --> 22:21.440
Trisha Uhrhammer don't
take for granted anymore.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.542
TRISHA UHRHAMMER, Wife of
Tom: Can you use some basil?

22:23.542 --> 22:27.446
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just a year
ago, Tom had a massive stroke.

22:27.446 --> 22:30.015
TOM UHRHAMMER, Suffered Stroke:
I was sitting right next door
here in this room watching

22:30.015 --> 22:38.357
TV. Time to go to bed. So I got
up and walked up the stairs, and
I didn't make it. I collapsed

22:38.357 --> 22:40.893
short of the bed.

22:40.893 --> 22:46.432
HARI SREENIVASAN: The paramedics
took Tom, who was paralyzed on
his left side, to nearby

22:46.432 --> 22:51.704
Mercy General Hospital in
Sacramento. With blood seeping
into his skull, creating
enormous

22:51.704 --> 22:57.243
pressure on his brain, time was
of the essence. That's when a
telestroke robot was deployed

22:57.243 --> 22:59.578
to the E.R.

22:59.578 --> 23:05.050
TRISHA UHRHAMMER: Pretty soon,
this machine came toward me, and
in the screen appeared

23:05.050 --> 23:10.322
a doctor. And he said: "Good
evening. My name is Dr. Nee
(ph). I'm a neurologist and I'm

23:10.322 --> 23:13.459
here to examine your husband."

23:13.459 --> 23:20.799
And, lo and behold, that robot
turned around, went around the
bed to the other side and

23:20.799 --> 23:25.104
started examining Tom.
It was remarkable.

23:25.104 --> 23:30.843
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Nee was
also able to remotely access
C.T. scans and other vital

23:30.843 --> 23:36.915
data need to quickly determine
Tom's surgical needs. Mercy is
one of 43 Dignity Health
hospitals

23:36.915 --> 23:45.024
in the West using the telestroke
robot, and there are others in
use all over the U.S.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.793
We got a demonstration from Dr.
Asad Chaudhary -- he's the one
on the screen -- and nurse

23:47.793 --> 23:50.129
Eleanor Vigilante.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.964
ELEANOR VIGILANTE, Director of
Emergency Department, Sequoia
Hospital: It's faster for us to
always

23:51.964 --> 23:57.469
use teleneurology, because our
physicians are not 24 hours a
day in the building. So,

23:57.469 --> 24:00.973
we can actually get a physician
to the bedside of a patient
within three to six minutes.

24:00.973 --> 24:04.410
HARI SREENIVASAN: And three to
six minutes is the difference
between what?

24:04.410 --> 24:06.945
ELEANOR VIGILANTE: Every minute
that we waste is potentially
more brain function that's

24:06.945 --> 24:09.148
lost.

24:09.148 --> 24:14.153
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stroke is the
leading cause of serious
long-term disability in the
United

24:14.153 --> 24:22.194
States. Widespread use of
telemedicine for stroke care is
improving patient outcomes.

24:22.194 --> 24:27.599
Hoping to build on its success
in hospitals, the telehealth
industry is now focused on

24:27.599 --> 24:33.572
bring more basic health care
services directly to patients
wherever they may be.

24:33.572 --> 24:39.044
From the comfort of her San
Francisco home, Dr. Raveena
Rihal is diagnosing and treating

24:39.044 --> 24:44.216
patients for primary care
ailments like sinusitis, pink
eye and bladder infections.

24:44.216 --> 24:48.821
DR. RAVEENA RIHAL, Doctor on
Demand: A patient can download
the app on their mobile device,

24:48.821 --> 24:55.094
either laptop, iPhone or tablet.
And if they want to see a
doctor, they just press a
button,

24:55.094 --> 24:58.230
and they will connect to a
doctor that licensed in their
state and can see them over
video.

24:58.230 --> 25:02.735
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rihal works
for Doctor on Demand, one of a
handful of companies connecting

25:02.735 --> 25:05.404
patients with physicians
almost instantaneously.

25:05.404 --> 25:10.109
DR. RAVEENA RIHAL: Hi there. I'm
Dr. Rihal with Doctor on Demand.
Welcome.

25:10.109 --> 25:14.079
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the day we
visited, Rihal took a call from
Carmen Crandell and her
11-year-old

25:14.079 --> 25:16.448
daughter, Alyksandra McKaymick
(ph), from Naples, Florida.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.951
DR. RAVEENA RIHAL: If you feel
here, do you feel any lumps or
bumps?

25:18.951 --> 25:23.155
CHILD: It feels a little swollen
in here, just a little bit.

25:23.155 --> 25:25.357
DR. RAVEENA RIHAL: And now I
want you to bring the camera
real close to your mouth and say

25:25.357 --> 25:25.591
ah.

25:25.591 --> 25:26.959
CHILD: Can we see?

25:26.959 --> 25:32.364
DR. RAVEENA RIHAL: Yes. I got a
good look there. It looks red,
but I don't see any white

25:32.364 --> 25:34.133
patches.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.803
You can point the camera in the
back of your throat and get a
really good look at tonsils.

25:37.803 --> 25:41.774
It's surpassed my expectations,
the technology piece of it, and
I think the future holds

25:41.774 --> 25:43.809
even more with all of the
wearable devices and all the
information we're going to be

25:43.809 --> 25:46.311
able to transmit soon.

25:46.311 --> 25:51.617
HARI SREENIVASAN: By the end of
a 13-minute exam, which cost
$40, Alyksandra was diagnosed

25:51.617 --> 25:56.889
with viral sinusitis and her
prescriptions were sent to a
nearby pharmacy electronically.

25:56.889 --> 26:00.092
Why did you choose this service?
Why not just go to a doctor
that's in Naples?

26:00.092 --> 26:02.594
CARMEN CRANDELL, Mother: You
can't get an appointment. If
your child is sick and you

26:02.594 --> 26:07.266
call them, they say they can't
see them until the next week.
It's pointless. Then you end

26:07.266 --> 26:13.505
up at the emergency care clinic
and that costs $100 for your
co-pay. So why not pay $40 and

26:13.505 --> 26:16.575
do it right then?

26:16.575 --> 26:20.112
HARI SREENIVASAN: Beyond the
convenience factor, Doctor on
Demand's chief medical officer,

26:20.112 --> 26:24.716
Dr. Pat Basu, says the cost
savings on a large scale add up.

26:24.716 --> 26:26.151
DR. PAT BASU, Chief Medical
Officer, Doctor on Demand: In
the United States, there's a

26:26.151 --> 26:33.025
total of about 1.3 billion total
cases where people walk in to
see a doctor. Of the type

26:33.025 --> 26:36.829
that Doctor on Demand is ideal
for, you're talking about 300
million to 500 million that

26:36.829 --> 26:39.198
we can treat.

26:39.198 --> 26:44.736
HARI SREENIVASAN: At a rate of
$40 per telemedicine visit vs.
an average of $1,000 for a trip

26:44.736 --> 26:49.541
to the emergency room or about
$300 for urgent care, Basu says
the potential savings are

26:49.541 --> 26:51.376
enormous.

26:51.376 --> 26:56.748
DR. PAT BASU: Right off the bat,
that would save $25 billion to
the U.S. health care system.

26:56.748 --> 27:01.553
HARI SREENIVASAN: Such figures
have caught the attention of
insurance companies. In April,

27:01.553 --> 27:05.991
UnitedHealthcare, the largest
private insurer in the U.S.,
launched a partnership with
three

27:05.991 --> 27:11.230
telemedicine companies,
NowClinic, American Well and
Doctor on Demand, to cover
video-based

27:11.230 --> 27:17.002
physician visits just as it
covers in-person visits.

27:17.002 --> 27:20.472
Health industry observers say
it's the strongest sign yet that
telemedicine is entering the

27:20.472 --> 27:22.140
mainstream.

27:22.140 --> 27:28.347
DR. PAT BASU: Now we have over
20 million patients who have
access to Doctor on Demand

27:28.347 --> 27:33.986
through insurance. On the
government side, Medicaid and
Medicare, that progression has

27:33.986 --> 27:37.890
still not fully occurred, but we
are in conversations with state
Medicaid agencies and national

27:37.890 --> 27:41.827
Medicare to cover this.

27:41.827 --> 27:47.099
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Abraham
Verghese, vice chair of
Stanford's School of Medicine,
applauds

27:47.099 --> 27:51.203
the efficiencies and cost-saving
telemedicine will bring, but
he's concerned about preserving

27:51.203 --> 27:54.106
the doctor-patient relationship.

27:54.106 --> 27:56.241
DR. ABRAHAM VERGHESE, Vice
Chair, Stanford School of
Medicine: A very important, I
would

27:56.241 --> 28:02.347
say ministerial, function of
being a physician is to be
attentive, is to be present, is
to

28:02.347 --> 28:08.253
listen to that story, is to
locate the symptoms on that
person of that patient, not on
some

28:08.253 --> 28:11.423
screen, not on some lab
result, but on them.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.559
HARI SREENIVASAN: Do you ever
feel like the you're missing
something by not being able

28:13.559 --> 28:15.561
to touch the patient?

28:15.561 --> 28:19.865
DR. RAVEENA RIHAL: No. If I was
taking care of heart failure and
diabetes and things like

28:19.865 --> 28:25.737
that, I think I would feel
really uncomfortable doing that
over video. But the more common

28:25.737 --> 28:29.174
things that I'm taking care of,
I feel good about what I'm
doing, and I feel like I
actually

28:29.174 --> 28:31.910
connect with the
patients really well.

28:31.910 --> 28:36.214
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even though
Doctor on Demand chooses not to
allow its home-based doctors

28:36.214 --> 28:41.019
to treat serious illnesses,
outdated regulations don't
necessarily prevent them from
doing

28:41.019 --> 28:44.823
that. Verghese says the industry
needs some clear national
guidelines.

28:44.823 --> 28:50.996
DR. ABRAHAM VERGHESE: I have no
doubt that we're going to learn
a lot more about the

28:50.996 --> 28:54.967
blessings and pitfalls of
telemedicine as more and more
people start to do it. And I

28:54.967 --> 28:59.871
suspect we're going to realize
that it's very good for some
things. And there will be a

28:59.871 --> 29:04.710
fairly hazardous tiny little
live-wire area that perhaps we
will develop guidelines that

29:04.710 --> 29:07.112
you don't go near.

29:07.112 --> 29:12.084
HARI SREENIVASAN: National
regulation won't be easy, as all
50 states have their own unique

29:12.084 --> 29:17.189
laws governing the practice of
telemedicine, something Christa
Natoli, associate director

29:17.189 --> 29:21.393
of the Center for Telehealth and
e-Health Law, spends her time
studying.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.562
CHRISTA NATOLI, Associate
Director, Center for Telehealth
and e-Health Law: States really

29:23.562 --> 29:28.734
focus a lot on the
physician-patient relationship
and physical examination, but
states that

29:28.734 --> 29:34.072
are clear will say and define
what an appropriate examination
looks like.

29:34.072 --> 29:39.011
States that are vague do not
define what appropriate means in
any context. It's in the gray
area

29:39.011 --> 29:45.017
where states are silent on these
issues that could potentially
lead to patient harm.

29:45.017 --> 29:49.621
HARI SREENIVASAN: As
policy-makers determine how to
define and regulate the
industry, there

29:49.621 --> 29:55.594
are a growing number of patients
who've experienced virtual
medicine firsthand.

29:55.594 --> 29:59.464
In the year since his stroke,
Tom Uhrhammer has fully
recovered. He and his wife,
Trisha,

29:59.464 --> 30:02.534
are grateful to be back
to their normal routine.

30:02.534 --> 30:08.774
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan in Northern
California.

30:08.774 --> 30:19.017
GWEN IFILL: And then there were
15 -- Republican candidates for
president, that is.

30:19.017 --> 30:25.257
So, as the 2016 campaign begins
to take final shape, we look at
the personalities, the policy,

30:25.257 --> 30:30.128
and of course, the purse strings
this Politics Monday with Tamara
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter

30:30.128 --> 30:33.432
of The Cook Political Report.

30:33.432 --> 30:36.401
Let's start by looking at the
money, the most important part
of this, right, in some
respects.

30:36.401 --> 30:37.936
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: Yes.

30:37.936 --> 30:42.040
GWEN IFILL: The top four
candidates in terms of money
raised, super PAC money as well
as

30:42.040 --> 30:49.481
nonprofits in one case, and just
regular money over the transom,
Jeb Bush with $114 million.

30:49.481 --> 30:56.254
This is just since they
announced for president. Hillary
Clinton with $60.6 million, Ted
Cruz

30:56.254 --> 31:00.792
$47 million, and Marco
Rubio with $43.8 million.

31:00.792 --> 31:05.130
Of course, as we just mentioned,
there are 11 others now in the
race. But as these four

31:05.130 --> 31:08.100
line up, where is the money
coming from and what is this
telling us about the race?

31:08.100 --> 31:13.305
AMY WALTER: In almost every
case, the super PAC is more than
the candidates actually raise.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.240
In fact, Hillary Clinton is the
only candidate who has raised
more as a candidate than her

31:15.240 --> 31:17.843
super PAC raised.

31:17.843 --> 31:22.948
It's going to bring up a couple
of issues. The first is, there
used to be the thing in

31:22.948 --> 31:26.585
politics where you dropped out
of the race after your money ran
out, and your money would

31:26.585 --> 31:30.922
run out because you weren't
winning enough, you didn't have
enough momentum. Now there

31:30.922 --> 31:34.159
are super PACs very flush with
cash that can keep candidates
going long after maybe their

31:34.159 --> 31:34.993
expiration date.

31:34.993 --> 31:35.460
(CROSSTALK)

31:35.460 --> 31:35.927
GWEN IFILL: Individuals,
they can keep...

31:35.927 --> 31:38.130
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

31:38.130 --> 31:41.733
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Ted Cruz has really three
good friends or three super

31:41.733 --> 31:45.504
PACs that can keep him going.

31:45.504 --> 31:50.208
And, you know, it used to be
that there was the dollar
primary and you could look at,

31:50.208 --> 31:54.679
well, whose fund-raising dollars
were the highest? It's hard to
even know what to make

31:54.679 --> 31:59.251
of these numbers, because some
rich person could come out of
nowhere, create a nonprofit,

31:59.251 --> 32:03.421
we wouldn't even know where the
money came from, and blow
everybody else out of the water.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.290
AMY WALTER: But there is one
really interesting component to
this, and that's why 2016 will

32:05.290 --> 32:08.059
be fascinating to watch.

32:08.059 --> 32:13.431
The amount of money that Jeb
Bush has coming from his super
PAC is about $103 million.

32:13.431 --> 32:18.303
That's where -- the bulk of that
114 is coming from super PAC.
They cannot coordinate with

32:18.303 --> 32:21.840
Jeb Bush. They are going to be
making decisions that normally a
campaign will be making.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.308
(CROSSTALK)

32:23.308 --> 32:26.645
AMY WALTER: Now, super PACs have
been very good at doing one
thing, which is they're

32:26.645 --> 32:32.284
a destroying machine. Right?
They're there to like eat up
their opponents.

32:32.284 --> 32:37.856
Can they be a pro-Bush entity as
well and do the sorts of things
that a campaign normally

32:37.856 --> 32:40.358
does? We don't know yet.
We have never seen it.

32:40.358 --> 32:43.228
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's talk
about someone who is not in the
top four, but could well

32:43.228 --> 32:48.066
be because of the beneficence of
at least a couple of very rich
people who are keeping

32:48.066 --> 32:51.169
an eye on him, and we just a
little bit reported earlier that
Scott Walker, even as we speak,

32:51.169 --> 32:53.371
has announced he's
running for president.

32:53.371 --> 32:57.442
Let's listen in a little bit
about he said today in Waukesha,
Wisconsin, his hometown,

32:57.442 --> 33:00.111
introducing himself to voters.

33:00.111 --> 33:04.516
GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R-WI),
Presidential Candidate: We need
new, fresh leadership,
leadership

33:04.516 --> 33:08.653
with big, bold ideas from
outside of Washington, the kind
of leadership that knows how to
get

33:08.653 --> 33:11.323
things done, like we have
done here in Wisconsin.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.526
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

33:14.526 --> 33:21.099
GOV. SCOTT WALKER: Since I have
been governor, we took on the
unions and we won.

33:21.099 --> 33:23.602
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

33:23.602 --> 33:27.906
GWEN IFILL: Scott Walker, king
of the Midwest., another
governor getting into the race.
What

33:27.906 --> 33:30.242
do we know about him and how
does he fit into this field,
Tamara?

33:30.242 --> 33:34.145
TAMARA KEITH: He's definitely
here pointing to his executive
experience. He won three

33:34.145 --> 33:40.252
elections in four years in what
he likes to remind everyone is a
blue state.

33:40.252 --> 33:46.558
Although, right now, he is
gunning for Iowa and he's all
about winning Iowa, he also
likes

33:46.558 --> 33:51.630
to paint himself as someone who
could bring people together at
some point, though, right

33:51.630 --> 33:57.502
now, his message in the speech
is very, very conservative, a
red meat kind of speech.

33:57.502 --> 34:00.772
GWEN IFILL: Yet his wife and his
sons have been giving interviews
in which they have

34:00.772 --> 34:03.608
been sounding a little bit more
moderate, at least on one key
social issue that we have

34:03.608 --> 34:06.244
been talking a lot about
lately, which is gay marriage.

34:06.244 --> 34:09.414
AMY WALTER: Gay marriage. In
fact, his sons gave an interview
where they said, we have

34:09.414 --> 34:12.017
talked to our father about the
fact that we're in different
places on this issue.

34:12.017 --> 34:14.386
GWEN IFILL: Which a lot
of American families are.

34:14.386 --> 34:18.223
AMY WALTER: Well, that's exactly
what I was going to say, is that
that is exactly where

34:18.223 --> 34:21.860
the American family is right
now, where you have younger
generations saying, this isn't

34:21.860 --> 34:25.430
a big deal, older generations
still saying they don't really
particularly like the idea,

34:25.430 --> 34:28.300
they're not comfortable with it.

34:28.300 --> 34:33.104
It actually mirrors very much
where America is on this issue,
even though he personally,

34:33.104 --> 34:37.175
Scott Walker, is to the right of
the majority of Americans on
this issue.

34:37.175 --> 34:40.512
GWEN IFILL: Another big issue
which has completely consumed
this race in the last week or so

34:40.512 --> 34:46.151
is immigration, but immigration
as seen through eyes of one
Donald Trump.

34:46.151 --> 34:50.655
Hillary Clinton gave a big
speech just today about the
economy and what she plans to do

34:50.655 --> 34:55.193
as president, but she also spoke
this afternoon to the National
Council of La Raza, an activist

34:55.193 --> 34:59.431
Hispanic group, and this is what
she had to say about Donald
Trump's -- Donald Trump's

34:59.431 --> 35:01.633
words on immigration.

35:01.633 --> 35:06.638
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: I have
just one word for Mr. Trump.
Basta.

35:06.638 --> 35:07.939
Enough.

35:07.939 --> 35:12.477
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

35:12.477 --> 35:22.988
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And to
all the other Republicans
running for president, why did

35:22.988 --> 35:28.393
it take weeks for most of you to
speak out? You're normally such
a talkative bunch.

35:28.393 --> 35:29.761
GWEN IFILL: OK.

35:29.761 --> 35:31.963
AMY WALTER: She's
just loving it.

35:31.963 --> 35:32.397
GWEN IFILL: She is loving it.
And that's the point, right?

35:32.397 --> 35:35.600
AMY WALTER: She is
loving it. Right.

35:35.600 --> 35:39.137
Her campaign had said early on,
long before she announced her
candidacy, that part of

35:39.137 --> 35:42.073
the reason they were holding out
on announcing was they said, we
want the Republicans to

35:42.073 --> 35:45.243
fight amongst themselves, the
attention won't be on us, it
will be on them.

35:45.243 --> 35:50.515
Well, that didn't happen until
now. And Donald Trump has become
-- he's a powder keg, and

35:50.515 --> 35:55.286
the closer you get to him, the
more likely it is that he is
going to explode. And she's

35:55.286 --> 35:58.323
hoping that he explodes and does
some collateral damage to the...

35:58.323 --> 35:59.424
GWEN IFILL: Powder
keg. Loose cannon.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.259
(CROSSTALK)

36:01.259 --> 36:03.695
TAMARA KEITH: Lindsey Graham
called him a wrecking ball for
the Republican Party.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.263
GWEN IFILL: Yes, wrecking ball.
The euphemisms are just flying.

36:05.263 --> 36:08.666
TAMARA KEITH: There are many
terms that are being used.

36:08.666 --> 36:12.137
GWEN IFILL: But what does that
say for Republicans? I mean, we
know the Democrats love this,
but

36:12.137 --> 36:14.739
are the Republicans loving it?

36:14.739 --> 36:19.744
TAMARA KEITH: Well, I think the
people who showed up for Donald
Trump's event in Arizona,

36:19.744 --> 36:24.149
4,000 people packed into an
arena -- he said it was 10,000
-- but, you know, they support

36:24.149 --> 36:26.484
him.

36:26.484 --> 36:33.491
He is speaking to, certainly, an
undercurrent that is very
concerned about illegal
immigration,

36:33.491 --> 36:39.230
and he is saying exactly what
they want to hear. I don't know
what it means for the Republican

36:39.230 --> 36:43.601
field. I think that this is this
identity crisis that they're
dealing with, where they

36:43.601 --> 36:47.705
want to win Latino voters. There
are some that want immigration
reform, there are some

36:47.705 --> 36:50.442
that absolutely don't want it,
and he is just, like, putting
that family feud right out into

36:50.442 --> 36:52.410
the open.

36:52.410 --> 36:57.515
GWEN IFILL: Does that affect the
behavior or the immediate
actions of new candidates

36:57.515 --> 37:03.288
like John Kasich or like Scott
Walker, who we saw get in the
race today? Do they have

37:03.288 --> 37:09.327
to calibrate their introduction
to the American voter based on
this loose cannon piece?

37:09.327 --> 37:12.564
AMY WALTER: Well, it sure
doesn't seem like Scott Walker
did. He came out making the case

37:12.564 --> 37:17.469
that he's been making and wants
to continue to make for the
campaign, which is, I'm an

37:17.469 --> 37:20.939
executive, I have won in a blue
state, and taking a very
conservative position on almost

37:20.939 --> 37:24.909
every social, cultural
and economic issue.

37:24.909 --> 37:28.813
So they're hoping just to ignore
him, because the problem with
Donald Trump is, if you engage

37:28.813 --> 37:33.651
him, it will only make things
worse. It's like -- it's a
little bit what you were taught

37:33.651 --> 37:37.889
as a kid to not engage the
bully, because they will
continue to pick on you.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.524
GWEN IFILL: And immigration,
however, is going to continue to
be an issue. It's how the party

37:39.524 --> 37:40.725
deals with it.

37:40.725 --> 37:43.194
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

37:43.194 --> 37:47.632
And Democrats feel like this is
an issue where they have
strength. And certainly Hillary

37:47.632 --> 37:52.604
Clinton very early on in her
campaign came out strongly in
favor of the president's
executive

37:52.604 --> 37:57.509
actions, in part because she was
trying to set a trap, trying to
get Republicans to have

37:57.509 --> 38:01.513
to talk about thing that they
don't really agree on, whereas
on the Democratic side,

38:01.513 --> 38:06.251
it's pretty well agreed there is
a Democratic orthodoxy and move
right ahead.

38:06.251 --> 38:09.154
GWEN IFILL: Well, we're going to
watching all of that and also
what the labor unions

38:09.154 --> 38:11.289
do now that Scott Walker is in
the case. That is going to
crystallize that issue.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.090
But we will talk about
that next week.

38:12.090 --> 38:12.457
AMY WALTER: Yes.

38:12.457 --> 38:13.758
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

38:13.758 --> 38:16.461
GWEN IFILL: Amy Walter, Tamara
Keith, thank you both very much.

38:16.461 --> 38:23.334
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

38:23.334 --> 38:30.141
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mexican officials
have launched a nationwide
manhunt, after that country's

38:30.141 --> 38:36.347
most-infamous drug lord escaped
from a maximum security prison
on Saturday. The escape
triggered

38:36.347 --> 38:40.852
a wave of criticism that
authorities had let public enemy
number one in Mexico's drug war

38:40.852 --> 38:42.487
get away.

38:42.487 --> 38:45.590
William Brangham has the latest.

38:45.590 --> 38:50.061
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This abandoned
house is where Mexican
authorities say drug kingpin

38:50.061 --> 38:55.433
Joaquin Guzman, known as El
Chapo, escaped to freedom.

38:55.433 --> 38:59.837
Guzman was being held in this
maximum security prison, but on
Saturday night, he reportedly

38:59.837 --> 39:05.143
walked into a shower stall, and
never came out. Officials
discovered a long narrow tunnel

39:05.143 --> 39:10.582
had been dug under the prison
that ran nearly a mile away to
the empty house.

39:10.582 --> 39:15.954
Guzman is the most notorious
drug lord in Mexico, and
possibly the world. He runs the

39:15.954 --> 39:22.894
Sinaloa Cartel, a global network
that traffics marijuana, heroin,
cocaine, and methamphetamines.

39:22.894 --> 39:26.164
They're also responsible for
thousands of killings in
Mexico's brutal near-decade-old

39:26.164 --> 39:29.567
drug war.

39:29.567 --> 39:34.639
This was Guzman's second escape
from a Mexican prison. He
escaped in 2001, but was
recaptured

39:34.639 --> 39:41.346
in 2014. That arrest was held up
as proof by Mexican President
Enrique Pena Nieto that

39:41.346 --> 39:47.085
his nation was finally cracking
down on the cartels and reining
in the violence. But this

39:47.085 --> 39:49.787
second escape was seen as
particularly damaging for the
president, who was on a state
visit

39:49.787 --> 39:52.924
to France when the news broke.

39:52.924 --> 39:58.663
ENRIQUE PENA NIETO, Mexican
President (through translator):
I am deeply shocked by what
happened.

39:58.663 --> 40:02.967
This is undoubtedly an affront
to the Mexican government, but I
am also confident that Mexican

40:02.967 --> 40:07.105
institutions will rise to the
challenge, with the strength and
determination to recapture

40:07.105 --> 40:08.973
this criminal.

40:08.973 --> 40:12.377
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: U.S. officials
had long wanted to extradite
Guzman to the United States

40:12.377 --> 40:16.381
to stand trial, but Mexican
authorities resisted the
transfer.

40:16.381 --> 40:20.251
Today, White House spokesman
Josh Earnest said the U.S. is
helping in the search.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.721
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: He faces very serious
crimes, not just in

40:23.721 --> 40:26.958
Mexico, but he's been charged
with some very serious crimes in
the United States as well.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.961
The United States will support
the efforts of the Mexican
government to bring him to

40:29.961 --> 40:31.796
justice.

40:31.796 --> 40:35.466
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Back in
Mexico, officials are still
investigating the details of El

40:35.466 --> 40:39.504
Chapo's escape and questioning
dozens of prison employees. In
the meantime, a massive manhunt

40:39.504 --> 40:42.507
continues.

40:42.507 --> 40:46.244
For more on that manhunt and the
importance of Guzman to the drug
trade, I'm joined now

40:46.244 --> 40:50.915
by Alfredo Corchado, Mexico
bureau chief for The Dallas
Morning News.

40:50.915 --> 40:55.820
Alfredo, drug kingpins don't get
any bigger than El Chapo. Mexico
celebrated when they

40:55.820 --> 41:00.858
first caught him. The U.S.
wanted to extradite him. So, now
he is free, he is on the loose.

41:00.858 --> 41:03.528
How big a deal is this?

41:03.528 --> 41:05.963
ALFREDO CORCHADO, Mexico Bureau
Chief, The Dallas Morning News:
It's a huge deal, especially

41:05.963 --> 41:10.702
-- I mean, this is the worst
nightmare for Enrique Pena
Nieto, the Mexican president.

41:10.702 --> 41:14.472
It's the worst nightmare for
U.S.-Mexico cooperation.

41:14.472 --> 41:20.478
I have been talking to officials
for the last couple of days and
they're just -- they're

41:20.478 --> 41:24.782
still in shock. Even though,
when he was arrested, when he
was taken to a Mexican prison,
they

41:24.782 --> 41:29.287
kept warning of this
possibility, this very
possibility. So I think people
on both sides,

41:29.287 --> 41:32.023
it's sort of like the air has
been sucked out of them.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.759
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I wonder if
you could just tell us a little
bit about the elaborateness

41:34.759 --> 41:38.062
of this breakout, how
he actually got out.

41:38.062 --> 41:41.065
ALFREDO CORCHADO: Well, the
reports of it -- and it's too
early to know the whole story,

41:41.065 --> 41:44.736
but the reports we're hearing is
that the plan started almost
immediately after he was

41:44.736 --> 41:46.804
arrested.

41:46.804 --> 41:53.544
It was an escape tunnel very
much like the ones he's built
throughout the Mexico-Sonora

41:53.544 --> 42:01.686
border, elaborate, had air
conditioning. It had -- there
was even a motorcycle rail. You

42:01.686 --> 42:06.591
talk to officials and they say
there is no way to explain that
this was a sole act. How

42:06.591 --> 42:11.396
do you dig that much dirt
out and not make any noise?

42:11.396 --> 42:16.634
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And also how
did authorities not know this?
As you say, this was a --
building

42:16.634 --> 42:21.038
tunnels was a trademark of the
cartel that he used to run. How
could they not know a

42:21.038 --> 42:24.475
mile-long tunnel was being built
into a maximum security prison?

42:24.475 --> 42:28.980
ALFREDO CORCHADO: At this point,
30 people have been arrested and
are being questioned.

42:28.980 --> 42:33.151
The real question is, how
high does the corruption go?

42:33.151 --> 42:38.890
I mean, who knew at not just the
prison level, but the state
government, the federal
government

42:38.890 --> 42:42.760
-- who were the people involved?
Again, it's too early to answer
those questions, but there

42:42.760 --> 42:46.564
is plenty of suspicion, there is
plenty of names that are going
back and forth. I think

42:46.564 --> 42:50.802
we're in for a really tough
time for the next few months.

42:50.802 --> 42:54.906
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk a
little bit more about those
ripple effects between Mexico

42:54.906 --> 42:58.943
and the U.S. We have a long
relationship trying to fight the
drug war between our two
countries.

42:58.943 --> 43:01.746
What does this do to
that relationship?

43:01.746 --> 43:06.684
ALFREDO CORCHADO: In talking to
people today and yesterday, they
said this sets back the

43:06.684 --> 43:12.857
relationship five, 10 years. I
mean, Mexico is not Canada. You
don't have that natural

43:12.857 --> 43:17.428
sense of cooperation, the level
of trust. They have been working
very hard at it, especially

43:17.428 --> 43:22.133
with -- during the Merida
Initiative -- the Merida
Initiative, which is the U.S.
way of

43:22.133 --> 43:26.070
helping Mexico
attack the cartels.

43:26.070 --> 43:32.944
But it was also a way for both
sides to come together to build
more intelligence-sharing.

43:32.944 --> 43:36.781
And that's one of the big
questions today, is how much did
the U.S. government, how much

43:36.781 --> 43:43.087
did the Mexican government share
with the Guzman side as they try
-- as they were preparing

43:43.087 --> 43:46.357
to judge him or to extradite him
to the United States? How much
does he know? How much more

43:46.357 --> 43:49.126
does he know? Who's at
risk at this point?

43:49.126 --> 43:54.165
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president
of Mexico obviously made a big
show of this arrest and

43:54.165 --> 43:59.036
other actions he'd taken showed
he was being tough on the
cartels. Now that El Chapo is

43:59.036 --> 44:02.240
out, what does this do to his
administration and his ability
to govern?

44:02.240 --> 44:07.111
ALFREDO CORCHADO: Well, at the
time, this worked very, very
nicely with the Mexican

44:07.111 --> 44:10.047
narrative, that things were
looking up for Mexico, that
there were all these economic

44:10.047 --> 44:15.152
reforms and that he
was turf on cartels.

44:15.152 --> 44:20.758
Who better than to make that
point than going after the
biggest drug lord in the world,

44:20.758 --> 44:28.165
El Chapo Guzman? I think that is
really the biggest hit. This is
an incredible blow, a

44:28.165 --> 44:32.303
humiliation to the Mexican
president and an embarrassment
to the Mexican president.

44:32.303 --> 44:35.806
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is there any
sense, now that El Chapo is on
the outside, how quickly

44:35.806 --> 44:40.211
he could be back in control and
calling shots with the cartel?

44:40.211 --> 44:44.815
ALFREDO CORCHADO: That's
unknown, but it's -- there's
been a big fight, internal fight

44:44.815 --> 44:47.718
within the Sinaloa Cartel.

44:47.718 --> 44:53.090
It will be interesting to see
how that works out. The Mexican
government has been saying

44:53.090 --> 44:58.262
that the cartels are now down to
two, two major cartels, the
Sinaloa Cartel, another

44:58.262 --> 45:02.500
cartel from Jalisco. It will be
interesting to see how --
whether he -- El Chapo can just

45:02.500 --> 45:05.102
come in and take over.

45:05.102 --> 45:09.840
I think it will still be a big
fight. His goal is to try to
control the Sinaloa Cartel,

45:09.840 --> 45:12.410
but more than a
year has gone by.

45:12.410 --> 45:14.612
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Alfredo Corchado of The Dallas
Morning News, thank you very

45:14.612 --> 45:16.914
much for joining us.

45:16.914 --> 45:23.621
ALFREDO CORCHADO:
Thanks, William.

45:23.621 --> 45:29.360
GWEN IFILL: It has been treated
as one of the major literary
events of the year: the

45:29.360 --> 45:32.530
publication of Harper
Lee's second novel.

45:32.530 --> 45:34.231
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

45:34.231 --> 45:34.365
JEFFREY BROWN: The first
surprise was the existence of
the book itself. That brought

45:34.365 --> 45:33.331
huge national interest. And
bookstores across the country
have fielded record pre-orders

45:33.331 --> 45:34.365
and many are planning
release parties.

45:34.365 --> 45:33.598
It also raised questions along
the way about whether longtime
reclusive author Harper Lee,

45:33.598 --> 45:35.032
now 89, had the mental acuity
to approve publication.

45:35.032 --> 45:34.031
In a film that aired on PBS'
"American Masters," her
publisher, Michael Morrison,
described

45:34.031 --> 45:34.832
the moment he was first
given the manuscript.

45:34.832 --> 45:35.066
MICHAEL MORRISON, HarperCollins:
I didn't tell anybody about it.
I locked it in my drawer.

45:35.066 --> 45:34.966
At the end of the day, I put it
in an interoffice envelope and
carried it home and kept
thinking,

45:34.966 --> 45:34.665
please God, don't let this be
the day I get hit by a bus or
mugged. Went home that night,

45:34.665 --> 45:34.899
read the whole thing, and just
fell in love with it from the
first sentence.

45:34.899 --> 45:35.199
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, with its
release comes a new surprise:
the portrayal of Atticus Finch,

45:35.199 --> 45:34.899
beloved in "To Kill a
Mockingbird" and indelibly
played by Gregory Peck in the
film, as a lawyer

45:34.899 --> 45:33.297
defending a black man from false
rape allegations in a deeply
segregated Alabama town in the

45:33.297 --> 45:34.865
1930s.

45:34.865 --> 45:34.966
In "Go Set a Watchman," the
character Atticus, now 72 years
old, is a man who's attended

45:34.966 --> 45:34.298
Klan meetings and says to his
daughter: "Do you want Negroes
by the carload in our schools

45:34.298 --> 45:34.999
and churches and theaters? Do
you want them in our world?"

45:34.999 --> 45:34.865
"Watchman," while set 20 years
after "Mockingbird," was
actually written first. Lee's
editors

45:34.865 --> 45:34.332
encouraged her to transform the
story about the adult Jean
Louise Finch into one narrated

45:34.332 --> 45:35.333
by the character's younger
self, known as Scout.

45:35.333 --> 45:39.437
And we're joined now by Wayne
Flynt, professor emeritus at
Auburn University and a close

45:39.437 --> 45:44.141
personal friend of Harper Lee,
and Natasha Trethewey, who read
and reviewed the new book

45:44.141 --> 45:47.845
for The Washington Post.
"NewsHour" viewers will, of
course, remember Natasha for the

45:47.845 --> 45:50.648
stories she did with us during
her tenure as poet laureate.

45:50.648 --> 45:53.217
So, welcome back, Natasha.

45:53.217 --> 45:56.887
Let me start with you and ask,
before we get into larger
meanings and readings, were you

45:56.887 --> 45:59.657
surprised by what you found?

45:59.657 --> 46:03.260
NATASHA TRETHEWEY, Former U.S.
Poet Laureate: Well, I was
surprised, Jeff.

46:03.260 --> 46:09.100
I was surprised by the way that
we were getting a different kind
of depth of character of

46:09.100 --> 46:12.837
Atticus than we'd seen before in
"Mockingbird" and surprised
about what kind of character

46:12.837 --> 46:14.505
that was.

46:14.505 --> 46:17.875
JEFFREY BROWN: And in what
way? What did you see?

46:17.875 --> 46:22.713
NATASHA TRETHEWEY: Well, we get
to know him, I think, with more
contradictions and complexities,

46:22.713 --> 46:27.518
which, of course, I think
makes him more human to us.

46:27.518 --> 46:34.392
We get to see that, even as he
is the person that we know from
"Mockingbird" who believes

46:34.392 --> 46:39.864
in justice for all and making
sure that people get a fair
trial, that he also can maintain

46:39.864 --> 46:44.769
some deeply ingrained and
unexamined notions of racial
difference.

46:44.769 --> 46:49.540
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Wayne Flynt,
the novel is a woman who, like
Harper Lee herself, comes

46:49.540 --> 46:55.346
back to visit her small town
from living in New York. It's
been speculated that Atticus

46:55.346 --> 47:00.484
Finch is based on her father.
What light can you shed on that
and how we see this new
portrayal?

47:00.484 --> 47:07.091
WAYNE FLYNT, Auburn University:
I think all fiction to some
degree is autobiographical.

47:07.091 --> 47:14.065
And I certainly think Coleman
Lee is the prototype. And I also
think perhaps in some ways, he's

47:14.065 --> 47:21.238
the prototype of what we have in
"Go Set a Watchman." Fathers are
perfect between 6 and

47:21.238 --> 47:27.511
9. At 26, for most of us,
they're not so perfect anymore.

47:27.511 --> 47:32.183
JEFFREY BROWN: Did the portrayal
ring true to you, ring true to
your own experience or

47:32.183 --> 47:34.719
the experience you
knew with Harper Lee?

47:34.719 --> 47:37.388
WAYNE FLYNT: Absolutely.

47:37.388 --> 47:43.461
I was 17 in 1956, when she wrote
this book. And I was having the
same kind of problems

47:43.461 --> 47:50.234
with my father. I, like her, had
slipped the bonds in terms of my
culture in terms of race,

47:50.234 --> 47:55.773
also partly for the same reason
she had. She'd read the Bible
too much and she felt the
Southern

47:55.773 --> 48:01.479
church was terribly flawed in
its understanding of race.

48:01.479 --> 48:08.385
So, processing all that racial
change between '49 and '56 in
New York City, I think she

48:08.385 --> 48:13.524
had real problems with her
father, who wasn't moving on
race nearly as quickly as Harper

48:13.524 --> 48:17.194
and her sister Alice
in Monroeville were.

48:17.194 --> 48:22.500
JEFFREY BROWN: Natasha
Trethewey, you wrote in your
review, we have this far more
complicated

48:22.500 --> 48:30.508
now of a beloved American
figure, character in culture.
You saw resonances up to today,

48:30.508 --> 48:31.442
right?

48:31.442 --> 48:34.445
NATASHA TRETHEWEY: That's right.

48:34.445 --> 48:42.153
You know, I agree very much with
Wayne, too. I know experiencing
that disillusionment of

48:42.153 --> 48:48.092
my own father over the years.
And so reading "Mockingbird" and
"Go Set a Watchman" just

48:48.092 --> 48:52.930
made that personal experience
vivid for me all over again.

48:52.930 --> 48:59.937
But I saw, also, in it, because
she was writing the book in the
aftermath of the Brown decision,

48:59.937 --> 49:10.114
a lot of conversation about the
courts making the Brown decision
and the South feeling dominated

49:10.114 --> 49:16.020
yet again, being told what to
do, the issue of states' rights,
the way that we're talking

49:16.020 --> 49:22.126
about the issue of the flag, the
Confederate Flag, because, of
course, in states like Georgia

49:22.126 --> 49:28.265
and South Carolina, the flag was
raised or incorporated into the
state flag in order

49:28.265 --> 49:32.770
to protest that Brown decision
and the courts and the federal
government's enforcement of

49:32.770 --> 49:34.972
the new law.

49:34.972 --> 49:41.312
JEFFREY BROWN: And, Wayne Flynt,
what about there in Alabama, the
resonance up to today?

49:41.312 --> 49:49.553
WAYNE FLYNT: Well, I think there
are still the vestiges of racism
that are here, I think

49:49.553 --> 49:54.592
the differences between those
who voted for Barack Obama and
those who voted for his
opponent.

49:54.592 --> 49:59.630
Alabama had the sharpest racial
divide of any state in the
union, so I think the vestiges

49:59.630 --> 50:06.203
are still there. And -- but we
process this through family,
community. We have to decide

50:06.203 --> 50:09.773
whether we're going to make our
separate peace and go someplace
else, where we don't have

50:09.773 --> 50:14.979
to bother with all these issues,
or whether we stay here and
fight to make Alabama better.

50:14.979 --> 50:20.351
And I think that was her -- the
issue for her. It's interesting
that her sister Alice

50:20.351 --> 50:26.023
stayed and fought and tried to
integrate Monroeville Methodist
Church and change her
denomination.

50:26.023 --> 50:29.860
Nelle decided to give up on
Alabama and left. And I
understand both those options.

50:29.860 --> 50:33.631
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me just stay
with you, Wayne Flynt. I have to
ask you the question

50:33.631 --> 50:39.637
about everything that was raised
when this all came out about
what Harper Lee, what she

50:39.637 --> 50:44.275
agreed to, how much she
understood about what is going
on. What can you tell us?

50:44.275 --> 50:50.014
WAYNE FLYNT: One of her
wonderful lines was, "Same damn
town, same damned people as I
wrote

50:50.014 --> 50:51.315
about in 'Mockingbird.'"

50:51.315 --> 50:54.385
JEFFREY BROWN: Meaning what?

50:54.385 --> 50:59.323
WAYNE FLYNT: Meaning that there
is a lot of provincialism, a lot
of small-mindedness.

50:59.323 --> 51:05.562
They don't much like Nelle's
lawyer, who is the ultimate
outsider. She's Catholic. Her

51:05.562 --> 51:12.903
grandfather fought in the Union
army against the Confederacy.
She didn't belong.

51:12.903 --> 51:17.641
And I'm afraid, Jeff, that the
greatest concentration of
neurologists in the United
States are in

51:17.641 --> 51:21.078
Monroeville, and they can all
diagnose dementia without ever
having met Nelle or talked to

51:21.078 --> 51:23.547
her in the last five years.

51:23.547 --> 51:28.018
JEFFREY BROWN: Nelle, of course,
is the name of Harper Lee,
right, that she goes by. You

51:28.018 --> 51:29.053
all know her as Nelle.

51:29.053 --> 51:29.787
WAYNE FLYNT: Yes, correct.

51:29.787 --> 51:30.287
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

51:30.287 --> 51:32.189
WAYNE FLYNT: Correct.

51:32.189 --> 51:35.459
JEFFREY BROWN: Natasha, let me
ask you just what about in the
new book? What does the

51:35.459 --> 51:41.198
new book tell us about her as a
writer? What can readers take
from it?

51:41.198 --> 51:46.136
NATASHA TRETHEWEY: Well, I mean,
the first thing that we can take
from it is getting

51:46.136 --> 51:51.141
to see something about the
process that a writer goes
through, creating a first draft

51:51.141 --> 51:55.946
and then working toward changing
that first draft into the book
that it later becomes,

51:55.946 --> 52:00.150
and, in this case, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel.

52:00.150 --> 52:07.091
So, getting to see the draft,
something that began it, is
exciting, because you know that

52:07.091 --> 52:14.631
it didn't begin perfectly, the
way that it ended up. I think it
also lets us see the

52:14.631 --> 52:20.704
way that she was timely in her
concerns, that she was trying to
write a book in the moment

52:20.704 --> 52:25.142
that was contending with what
was happening all across South.

52:25.142 --> 52:28.746
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, a new
take on an American classic.

52:28.746 --> 52:30.981
Natasha Trethewey, Wayne
Flynt, thank you both so much.

52:30.981 --> 52:33.517
GWEN IFILL: Amazing story.

52:33.517 --> 52:34.818
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Gwen Ifill.

52:34.818 --> 52:37.221
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:37.221 --> 52:40.657
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow evening. For all
of us at the "PBS NewsHour,"

52:40.657 --> 52:40.824
thank you, and good night.
