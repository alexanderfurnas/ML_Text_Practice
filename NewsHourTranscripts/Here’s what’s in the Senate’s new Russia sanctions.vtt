JUDY WOODRUFF: As we
reported earlier in the
program, the Senate today
overwhelmingly passed

00:03.866 --> 00:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new sanctions against Iran.

00:06.033 --> 00:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But a key amendment makes
that bill even broader.

00:08.733 --> 00:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It now includes sanctions
aimed at Russia.

00:11.066 --> 00:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is five months after U.S.
intelligence agencies made
public that Russian President

00:15.833 --> 00:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Vladimir Putin ordered
cyber-interference
in the 2016 election.

00:20.533 --> 00:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins has
been following the vote,
and she joins me now.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Lisa, tell us what
these Russia sanctions are.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: These are
not just symbolic, Judy.

00:27.933 --> 00:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are significant sanctions.

00:29.133 --> 00:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's take a quick look.

00:31.033 --> 00:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, they target
Russian industries,
especially the energy sector.

00:34.066 --> 00:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those sanctions would include
things limiting U.S. companies,
prohibiting them from working

00:38.966 --> 00:41.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Russian firms, say,
exploring the Arctic.

00:41.466 --> 00:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a big deal.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also, this would target
individuals working in
defense or intelligence,
individual Russians.

00:47.433 --> 00:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are some new
powers in here.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Treasury would get
access to U.S. bank records
of Russian oligarchs.

00:52.400 --> 00:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, $250 million for
a countering Russia
influence fund that would
focus on cyber-security,

00:58.566 --> 01:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but also could be
some U.S. propaganda.

01:00.600 --> 01:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, separately,
the Senate passed an amendment
to this that affects the

01:04.866 --> 01:05.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about that.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: This
is remarkable, Judy.

01:09.066 --> 01:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a Republican Congress
asserting power with a
Republican president in office.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's look at exactly
how that would work.

01:15.666 --> 01:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If this president wanted
to roll back any of these
sanctions, he would have to give

01:19.466 --> 01:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Congress 30-day notice
under this amendment.

01:23.033 --> 01:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress could then
disapprove and ultimately
block the president from
rolling back sanctions

01:27.700 --> 01:29.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with a two-thirds vote.

01:29.700 --> 01:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Essentially, Judy, what the
Senate is saying here is, we
think Congress should set Russia

01:32.966 --> 01:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
policy now, not the president.

01:34.700 --> 01:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
what is the White House
saying about all this?

01:37.533 --> 01:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The White
House today said it's
reviewing these sanctions.

01:40.266 --> 01:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No secret the president is in
a very tricky position here,
not just because of this Russia

01:44.200 --> 01:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation, but because he
and his secretary of state have
said they don't think this is

01:48.600 --> 01:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a good time to increase
sanctions on Russia.

01:50.866 --> 01:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They think it could backfire.

01:52.933 --> 01:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's interesting, Judy, the
Senate attached these Russia
sanctions to an Iran sanctions

01:58.733 --> 02:00.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bill that the president
wants to sign.

02:00.800 --> 02:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Democrats are worried
about the Iran sanctions,
worried that that could cause

02:04.500 --> 02:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
problems with the Iran deal,
which leaves the president
deciding, does he swallow these

02:09.366 --> 02:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia sanctions that go with
an Iran deal he likes at a time
of the Russia investigation?

02:13.733 --> 02:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to wait and see.

02:15.766 --> 02:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in two
seconds, if the president were
to veto this, the assumption

02:18.200 --> 02:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is, it would be overridden?

02:19.200 --> 02:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's correct.

02:20.433 --> 02:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It passed with 98
votes in the Senate.

02:21.866 --> 02:23.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Absolutely, they would
override that veto.

02:23.866 --> 02:25.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa
Desjardins, thank you.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.
