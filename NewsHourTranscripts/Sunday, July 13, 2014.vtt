WEBVTT

00:01.433 --> 00:02.900
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS AT
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:02.967 --> 00:05.933
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:06.000 --> 00:06.933
GOOD EVENING.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:09.067 --> 00:11.967
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND
HAMAS CONTINUES TO ESCALATE.

00:12.033 --> 00:16.000
LAST NIGHT ISRAELI COMMANDOS
CONDUCTED A RAID IN NORTHERN GAZA

00:16.067 --> 00:20.000
AND TODAY DURING A CABINET
MEETING PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN

00:20.067 --> 00:22.000
NETANYAHU APPEALED FOR SUPPORT
FOR WHAT HE SAID COULD PROVE TO

00:22.067 --> 00:25.000
BE AN EXTENDED MILITARY
OPERATION.

00:25.067 --> 00:28.000
Translator: WE DON'T KNOW WHEN
THIS OPERATION WILL BE OVER.

00:28.067 --> 00:29.933
IT MAY TAKE A LONG TIME AND WE
NEED YOUR SUPPORT AND ALSO YOUR

00:30.000 --> 00:32.967
DISCIPLINE.

00:33.033 --> 00:37.933
FOR THE LATEST WE ARE JOINED
ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT VIA SKYPE FROM

00:38.000 --> 00:43.933
JERUSALEM BY JOSEF FEDERMAN.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.867
YOUR STORY TODAY WAS ABOUT THE
PEOPLE FLEEING GAZA.

00:48.933 --> 00:50.900
Reporter: YES.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.900
OVERNIGHT WARNING LEAFLETS WERE
DROPPED OUT FROM THE SKY

00:53.967 --> 00:56.900
TELLING PEOPLE IN THE NORTHERN
GAZA STRIP TO CLEAR OUT.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.900
ISRAEL IS PLANNING HEAVY
BOMBARDMENT.

00:58.967 --> 01:00.333
WE'VE SEEN A FEW AIRSTRIKES
ALREADY.

01:00.400 --> 01:05.067
IN THE MEANTIME SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN 15 AND 20,000 RESIDENTS
OF

01:05.133 --> 01:07.000
THAT AREA HAVE CLEARED OUT ON
THEIR WAY TO SHELTERS AND U.N.

01:07.067 --> 01:11.033
SCHOOLS IN SAFER AREAS OF GAZA.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.067
WE HEARD ABOUT THE COMMANDO RAID
OPERATION INSIDE GAZA,

01:13.133 --> 01:14.000
BUT WE'D ALSO HEARD THERE WAS A
POLICE CHIEF'S HOUSE THAT WAS

01:14.067 --> 01:16.000
BOMBED.

01:16.067 --> 01:18.067
Reporter: YES.

01:18.133 --> 01:20.067
THESE WERE TWO SEPARATE
INCIDENTS.

01:20.133 --> 01:22.067
THE COMMANDO RAID TOOK PLACE
OVERNIGHT.

01:22.133 --> 01:24.000
IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT ISRAEL
HAS SENT GROUND FORCES INTO

01:24.067 --> 01:26.067
GAZA.

01:26.133 --> 01:28.033
IT WAS A VERY BRIEF PINPOINT-
TYPE OPERATION.

01:28.100 --> 01:31.067
THEY WENT AFTER OR THEY SAY THEY
WENT AFTER A ROCKET LAUNCHING

01:31.133 --> 01:35.033
SITE THAT COULDN'T BE REACHED
THROUGH AERIAL ATTACKS.

01:35.100 --> 01:37.000
SO THEY SENT IN A SMALL TEAM OF
NAVAL COMMANDOS.

01:37.067 --> 01:39.067
THEY WERE IN AND OUT.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.967
THERE WAS SOME LIGHT INJURIES
ACTUALLY ON THE ISRAELI SIDE.

01:42.033 --> 01:45.967
AS FOR THE POLICE CHIEF THAT WAS
NEAR STRIKE LAST NIGHT,

01:46.033 --> 01:50.967
THIS WAS CONSIDERED A SENIOR
TARGET BY ISRAEL.

01:51.033 --> 01:52.067
HE WAS THE HAMAS POLICE CHIEF OF
GAZA.

01:52.133 --> 01:56.000
THE AIRSTRIKE HIT THE HOME WHERE
HE WAS STAYING.

01:56.067 --> 01:58.000
17 MEMBERS OF THE MAN'S FAMILY
WAS KILLED,

01:58.067 --> 01:59.967
BUT THE POLICE CHIEF IS STILL
ALIVE.

02:00.033 --> 02:05.033
WHAT ABOUT ON THE DIPLOMATIC
FRONT OF, ANY NEWS, ANY PROGRESS?

02:05.100 --> 02:06.300
--FRONT, ANY NEWS, ANY PROGRESS?

02:06.367 --> 02:08.033
Reporter: THERE SEEMS TO BE A
LOT OF BEHIND THE SCENES

02:08.100 --> 02:10.100
MOVEMENT.

02:10.167 --> 02:12.100
IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS
GOING ON.

02:12.167 --> 02:13.067
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY IS
IN VIENNA MEETING WITH HIS

02:13.133 --> 02:23.133
COUNTERPARTS,

02:23.200 --> 02:26.033
CALLED PRIME MINISTER SEPARATE
NETANYAHU -- PRIME MINISTER

02:26.100 --> 02:30.067
NETANYAHU TODAY.

02:30.133 --> 02:32.133
EGYPT PUT OUT A STATEMENT.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.133
THEY'RE IN TOUCH WITH THE U.N.
SECRETARY GENERAL.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.067
OTHER PLAYERS RANGING FROM
QATAR, TURKEY, FRANCE, TUNISIA,

02:36.133 --> 02:39.133
THEY'RE ALL INVOLVED.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.000
IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
EXACTLY IS GOING ON.

02:42.067 --> 02:45.033
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.067
JOSEF FEDERMAN OF THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS, THANKS SO MUCH.

02:48.133 --> 02:55.133
TURNING NOW TO UKRAINE WHERE
TODAY IN THE EASTERN CITY TODAY

02:55.200 --> 03:03.133
GOVERNMENT TROOPS -- TODAY
GOVERNMENT TROOPS ROUTED THE
REBELS.

03:03.200 --> 03:06.200
IN A SEPARATE INCIDENT TODAY TWO
HOMES INSIDE RUSSIA WERE

03:06.267 --> 03:10.167
REPORTEDLY HIT BY SHELLS FIRED
ACROSS THE BORDER IN UKRAINE.

03:10.233 --> 03:14.200
ONE RUSSIAN MAN WAS KILLED AND
TWO OTHER RUSSIANS WERE WOUNDED.

03:14.267 --> 03:18.133
THE RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTRY
BLAMED THE UKRAINIAN ARMY AND

03:18.200 --> 03:19.133
WARNED THAT THE EVENT COULD LEAD
TO WHAT IT CALLED

03:19.200 --> 03:22.167
IRREVERSIBLE CONSEQUENCES.

03:22.233 --> 03:25.167
IN IRAQ TODAY LAWMAKERS ONCE
AGAIN FAIL TO REACH AN AGREEMENT

03:25.233 --> 03:28.200
ON A DEAL THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE
CREATION OF A NEW GOVERNMENT.

03:28.267 --> 03:31.200
THEY WILL MEET AGAIN TUESDAY TO
TRY TO FILL THE POSTS OF PRIME

03:31.267 --> 03:35.167
MINISTER, PRESIDENT AND
PARLIAMENTARY SPEAKER.

03:35.233 --> 03:37.100
THE UNITED NATIONS WARNED OF
CHAOS IF THE POLITICAL IMPASSE IS

03:37.167 --> 03:39.167
NOT BROKEN SOON.

03:39.233 --> 03:42.133
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON IRAQ LATER IN
THE BROADCAST.

03:42.200 --> 03:46.133
IN VIENNA TODAY SECRETARY OF
STATE JOHN KERRY MET WITH THE

03:46.200 --> 03:49.100
FOREIGN MINISTER OF GERMANY AS
THEY AND OTHER DIPLOMATS GATHER

03:49.167 --> 03:52.167
FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF TALKS ABOUT
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.067
BOTH WESTERN AND IRANIAN
OFFICIALS SAY MAJOR DISPUTES
REMAIN

03:54.133 --> 03:57.100
TO BE RESOLVED.

03:57.167 --> 04:00.067
DAVID SANGER IS COVERING THE
STORY FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES AND

04:00.133 --> 04:03.233
JOINS US NOW VIA SKYPE.

04:03.300 --> 04:05.200
SO WHAT ABOUT THE INTERIM
AGREEMENT WE REACHED LAST FALL?

04:05.267 --> 04:08.233
WHAT DID THAT BUY US?

04:08.300 --> 04:15.267
Reporter: WHAT IT BOUGHT US WAS
SOME TIME AND REDUCED THE

04:15.333 --> 04:22.233
THREAT IRAN COULD COMPLETE A
WEAPON.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.200
THE IRANIANS QUIT USING THE FUEL
THAT IS CLOSE TO BOMB GRADE

04:24.267 --> 04:27.233
FUEL.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.233
SO THE UNITED STATES AND
EUROPEANS CLAIM THEY'VE ALREADY

04:29.300 --> 04:32.267
ACCOMPLISHED A FAIR BIT EVEN IF
IT WAS TEMPORARY.

04:32.333 --> 04:35.267
THAT AGREEMENT CALLED FOR A
FINAL AGREEMENT TO BE PUT
TOGETHER

04:35.333 --> 04:36.200
IN SIX MONTHS WITH A POSSIBLE
EXTENSION UP TO ANOTHER SIX

04:36.267 --> 04:38.267
MONTHS.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.200
THEY'RE RUNNING INTO THE
DEADLINE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS
BY

04:40.267 --> 04:42.167
NEXT SUNDAY.

04:42.233 --> 04:45.167
WHAT ABOUT INSPECTIONS THAT HAVE
OCCURRED DURING THIS TIME?

04:45.233 --> 04:46.133
Reporter: THE IRANIANS HAVE BEEN
VERY GOOD ABOUT LETTING THE

04:46.200 --> 04:50.200
INSPECTORS IN,

04:50.267 --> 04:53.167
BUT FOR INSPECTIONS TO WORK FOR
A MUCH BROADER PERMIT

04:53.233 --> 04:56.200
AGREEMENT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE
FAR, FAR BROADER.

04:56.267 --> 04:58.133
THEY WOULD HAVE TO ALLOW THE
INSPECTORS TO GO VIRTUALLY ANY

04:58.200 --> 05:01.167
PLACE IN THE COUNTRY.

05:01.233 --> 05:04.267
THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST VITAL
ISSUES BECAUSE IRAN HAS A HISTORY

05:04.333 --> 05:07.267
OF HIDING FACILITIES.

05:07.333 --> 05:13.333
THIS COMES IN THE WAKE OF
AYATOLLAH HOMENI SAYING HE WANTS

05:13.400 --> 05:19.333
10 TIMES THE AMOUNT OF NUCLEAR
POWER IN IRAN GOING FORWARD.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.267
Reporter: WHAT HE SAID WAS HE
WANTS 10 TIMES THE AMOUNT OF

05:21.333 --> 05:24.333
NUCLEAR FUEL PRODUCED FOR FUTURE
REACTORS,

05:24.400 --> 05:28.333
BUT REMEMBER THEY DON'T HAVE
THOSE REACTORS BUILT RIGHT NOW

05:28.400 --> 05:30.300
AND YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES
TO BUILD THE REACTORS IN THE

05:30.367 --> 05:33.333
UNITED STATES UNDER IDEAL
CONDITIONS.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.233
THE IRANIANS HAVE NEVER REALLY
DONE THIS BEFORE EXCEPT FOR ONE

05:35.300 --> 05:38.233
RUSSIAN REACTOR.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.300
THEY GET THEIR FUEL FROM RUSSIA.

05:40.367 --> 05:44.267
SO THE QUESTION WAS, WAS HE
LAYING OUT A LONG TERM GOAL THAT

05:44.333 --> 05:48.267
REALLY WON'T GET IN THE WAY OF
THIS OR INSTEAD WAS HE

05:48.333 --> 05:53.233
BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE A SET OF
NEEDS THAT RUNS COMPLETELY

05:53.300 --> 05:54.167
CONTRARY TO WHAT IRAN WOULD HAVE
TO DO IF IT WAS TO REACH AN

05:54.233 --> 05:58.200
AGREEMENT WITH THE WEST?

05:58.267 --> 06:01.333
THE WEST, OF COURSE,

06:01.400 --> 06:03.333
WANTS TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT THAT
IRAN PRODUCES NOW,

06:03.400 --> 06:05.367
NOT INCREASE IT BY 10-FOLD.

06:05.433 --> 06:09.333
ARE THERE ANY CONSEQUENCES TO
MISSING THIS JULY 20th DEADLINE?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.367
Reporter: NOT MANY.

06:11.433 --> 06:17.367
INITIALLY ISRAEL WAS QUITE
CONCERNED THAT IRAN WOULD BE ABLE

06:17.433 --> 06:18.333
TO GET FAR MORE SANCTIONS RELIEF
THAN THE UNITED STATES AGREED

06:18.400 --> 06:21.333
TO.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.333
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED.

06:24.400 --> 06:28.400
SO THE PRESSURE ON THE U.S.

06:28.467 --> 06:31.400
TO CONCLUDE THE AGREEMENT IF
IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE

06:31.467 --> 06:34.400
LOOKING FOR BY NEXT SUNDAY IS
PRETTY LOW.

06:34.467 --> 06:36.333
DAVID SANGER OF THE NEW YORK
TIMES, THANKS SO MUCH.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.300
Reporter: THANK YOU.

06:38.367 --> 06:41.400
BACK IN THE U.S.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.300
TEXAS GOVERNOR RICK PERRY TODAY
CALLED ON PRESIDENT OBAMA TO

06:43.367 --> 06:47.300
DEPLOY THE NATIONAL GUARD ALONG
THE U.S.

06:47.367 --> 06:48.233
/MEXICO BORDER TO STOP THE SURGE
OF MINORS CROSSING INTO THE

06:48.300 --> 06:50.333
UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY.

06:50.400 --> 06:53.333
THEY NEED TO BE RIGHT ON THE
RIVER.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.300
THEY NEED TO BE THERE AS A SHOW
OF FORCE BECAUSE THAT'S THE

06:56.367 --> 06:59.400
MESSAGE THAT GETS SENT BACK VERY
QUICKLY TO CENTRAL AMERICA.

06:59.467 --> 07:04.433
MORE THAN 50,000 MINORS HAVE
MADE THE CROSSING SINCE LAST
FALL.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.400
THE PRESIDENT RECENTLY ASKED
CONGRESS FOR $3.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.400
7 BILLION TO ADDRESS THE
PROBLEM.

07:08.467 --> 07:09.367
A MEDICAL NO.

07:09.433 --> 07:12.467
,

07:12.533 --> 07:13.400
NEW RESEARCH BEING PRESENTED AT
AN INTERNATIONAL GATHERING OF

07:13.467 --> 07:16.467
--NOTE,

07:16.533 --> 07:17.400
NEW RESEARCH BEING PRESENTED AT
AN INTERNATIONAL GATHERING OF

07:17.467 --> 07:21.433
ALZHEIMER'S EXPERTS,

07:21.500 --> 07:24.433
ONE A NONINVASIVE EYE EXAM AND A
COMMON SCRATCH AND SNIFF TEST

07:24.500 --> 07:27.467
COULD HELP IDENTIFY THE ONSET OF
THE DISEASE.

07:27.533 --> 07:29.400
ALZHEIMER IS USUALLY IDENTIFIED
THROUGH COSTLY SPINAL TAPS AND

07:29.467 --> 07:31.433
BRAIN IMAGING.

07:31.500 --> 07:36.433
AN ESTIMATED 5 MILLION AMERICANS
NOW LIVE WITH THE DISEASE.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.400
CONDUCTOR LORIN MAAZEL WHO
CONDUCTED THE VIENNA STATE OPERA

07:39.467 --> 07:42.333
AND PHILHARMONIC HAS DIED.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.367
HE WAS 84 YEARS OLD,

07:44.433 --> 07:47.400
A CHILD PRODIGY SAID TO HAVE
CONDUCTED WHEN HE WAS 9.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.333
OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST IAN THORP
REVEALED TODAY THAT HE WAS GAY

07:49.400 --> 07:52.367
IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW.

07:52.433 --> 07:56.400
THE 31-YEAR-OLD AUSTRALIAN
SWIMMER SAID HE HAD TIRED OF WHAT

07:56.467 --> 08:01.433
HE CALLED THE BIG LIE IN HIS
LIFE,

08:01.500 --> 08:05.467
A LIE HE SAID THAT HAD
CONTRIBUTED TO DEPRESSION AND
DRINKING.

08:05.533 --> 08:08.533
THORP WON FIVE GOLD MEDALS.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.500
IN VIRGINIA TODAY AN UNMANNED
131-FOOT TALL ROCKET CARRYING A

08:11.567 --> 08:14.500
CARGO SHIP SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED
INTO SPACE.

08:14.567 --> 08:21.500
THE SHIP IS EXPECTED TO DOG WITH
THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE

08:21.567 --> 08:27.533
STATION WEDNESDAY MORNING --
DOCK WITH THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE

08:27.600 --> 08:31.467
STATION WEDNESDAY MORNING
DELIVERING FOOD AND SCIENCE
PROJECTS

08:31.533 --> 08:37.533
TO THE ASTRONAUTS ON BOARD.

08:37.600 --> 08:43.533
NOW MORE ABOUT THE SITUATION IN
IRAQ,

08:43.600 --> 08:46.500
YESTERDAY I INTERVIEWED ANTHONY
CORDESMAN OF THE CENTER FOR

08:46.567 --> 08:51.533
STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL
STUDIES.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.533
I BEGAN BY ASKING HIM ABOUT THE
OFFERS OF MILITARY AID FROM

08:54.600 --> 08:57.533
IRAN, THE UNITED STATES AND
RUSSIA.

08:57.600 --> 09:02.667
THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS THAT
MILITARY AID PROVIDING MORE

09:02.733 --> 09:07.667
EQUIPMENT AND MORE WEAPONS CAN
HAVE A VERY LIMITED EFFECT.

09:07.733 --> 09:13.633
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF CLAIMS
BEING MADE ABOUT AIR POWER,

09:13.700 --> 09:20.667
BUT THEY'RE REALLY ONLY FLYING A
HANDFUL OF EXCURSIONS A DAY.

09:20.733 --> 09:24.600
MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAVE NO
ABILITY TO TARGET OR ASSESS THE

09:24.667 --> 09:27.667
DAMAGE AND PROVIDING MORE
WEAPONS TO ANTHEM HAS BASICALLY A

09:27.733 --> 09:30.667
POLITICAL STRUCTURE --AN ARMY
THAT HAS BASICALLY A POLITICAL

09:30.733 --> 09:34.667
STRUCTURE TIED TO THE PRIME
MINISTER THAT'S DEEPLY CORRUPT,

09:34.733 --> 09:37.667
OFTEN A HOLLOW FORCE WITH
OFFICERS THAT AREN'T DOING THEIR
JOB

09:37.733 --> 09:42.500
OR SIMPLY AREN'T THERE, THE
PROBLEM IS NOT WEAPONS.

09:42.567 --> 09:44.567
THE PROBLEM ISN'T SUPPLY.

09:44.633 --> 09:48.600
THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT OUTSIDE
ADVISORS CAN REALLY DO.

09:48.667 --> 09:52.600
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE IRAQI
ARMY HAS IMPROVED,

09:52.667 --> 09:53.500
IT BASICALLY IS IT HAS NOW
FALLEN BACK ON SOME OF THE MORE

09:53.567 --> 09:56.600
EFFECTIVE UNITS.

09:56.667 --> 09:57.533
IT HAS A FRIENDLY POPULATION IN
SHIITE AREAS AND IT HAS SHIITE

09:57.600 --> 10:02.633
VOLUNTEERS,

10:02.700 --> 10:06.600
BUT THAT DENT MAKE IT AN
EFFECTIVE FORCE -- DOESN'T MAKE
IT AN

10:06.667 --> 10:07.533
EFFECTIVE FORCE OR ONE THAT CAN
DEFEAT THE ISLAMIC STATE IN

10:07.600 --> 10:10.667
THE NORTH AND WEST.

10:10.733 --> 10:13.567
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF
DISPLACING THE ISLAMIC STATE
GROUP?

10:13.633 --> 10:18.500
THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP PRESENTS
A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR ITSELF.

10:18.567 --> 10:20.567
IT ISN'T SIMPLY AN IRAQ.

10:20.633 --> 10:26.567
IT'S FIGHTING OTHER ISLAMIC
GROUPS IN SYRIA AT THE SAME TIME.

10:26.633 --> 10:31.600
SO IT NEEDS TIME TO BUILD UP
CONTROL OVER THE AREAS IT'S TAKEN

10:31.667 --> 10:33.567
IF IT CAN DO SO BECAUSE IT DOES
SAY STRONG RIVALS AND

10:33.633 --> 10:37.567
CERTAINLY A LOT OF TRIBAL
RESISTANCE.

10:37.633 --> 10:40.533
WHAT ABOUT THE IMPENDING REFUGEE
CRISIS INTO NEIGHBORING

10:40.600 --> 10:43.500
COUNTRIES?

10:43.567 --> 10:49.500
WELL, THERE ALREADY IS A REFUGEE
CRISIS RADIO.

10:49.567 --> 10:53.500
YOU'VE SEEN AT LEAST 1 --
REFUGEE CRISIS.

10:53.567 --> 10:58.533
YOU'VE SEEN AT LEAST 1 MILLION
PEOPLE MOVE OUT.

10:58.600 --> 11:03.633
IT'S GONE INTO LEBANON, TURKEY,
JORDAN AND OTHER AREAS.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.600
WE ALSO SEE TROOPS AMASSING
ALONG THE BORDERS OF NEIGHBORING

11:05.667 --> 11:08.633
COUNTRIES.

11:08.700 --> 11:09.567
IS THERE CONCERN IRAQ CANNOT
STAY TOGETHER AS A SINGLE COUNTRY

11:09.633 --> 11:11.667
ANYMORE?

11:11.733 --> 11:12.600
I THINK EVERYONE IS CONCERNED
IRAQ MAY NOT STAY TOGETHER AS A

11:12.667 --> 11:16.667
SINGLE COUNTRY,

11:16.733 --> 11:19.667
BUT THE MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM IS
THAT HAVING A SINGLE COUNTRY

11:19.733 --> 11:20.600
WHERE YOU HAVE SECTARIAN AND
ETHNIC GROUPS THAT HATE EACH

11:20.667 --> 11:24.633
OTHER,

11:24.700 --> 11:28.667
THAT DRIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE
MIGHT BE OUT OF THEIR HOMES

11:28.733 --> 11:29.600
OR KILL --MINORITY OUT OF THEIR
HOMES OR KILL THEM IS NOT A

11:29.667 --> 11:31.667
FORM OF UNITY.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.600
IT DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE ANY
BASIS FOR STABILITY AND

11:33.667 --> 11:35.667
DEVELOPMENT.

11:35.733 --> 11:37.667
THERE ALSO IS THE FACT THIS IS
NOT ONE WAR.

11:37.733 --> 11:40.633
IT'S DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE
SYRIAN CIVIL WAR AND AT LEAST

11:40.700 --> 11:45.567
IN TERMS FOR THE ISLAMIST
EXTREMIST MOVEMENT,

11:45.633 --> 11:49.600
YOU HAVE VOLUNTEERS COMING IN AS
EXTREMISTS FROM PLACES AS FAR

11:49.667 --> 11:54.567
AWAY AS BRITAIN AND CHINA AND
THE UNITED STATES.

11:54.633 --> 11:59.667
THAT'S REALLY WHY THE JORDANIAN
AND SAUDI FORCES AND TO A

11:59.733 --> 12:03.733
LESSER EXTENT THE LEBANESE
FORCES AND THE NORTH OF LEBANON
AND

12:03.800 --> 12:07.700
TURKISH FORCES HAVE BUILT UP ON
THE BORDER.

12:07.767 --> 12:09.667
IT ISN'T TO TRY TO UNIFY THE
COUNTRY.

12:09.733 --> 12:13.733
IT'S TO STOP THE FLOW OF
EXTREMISTS AND TERRORISTS AND ANY

12:13.800 --> 12:14.633
EXPANSION OF EITHER THE ISLAMIC
STATE OR THE FIGHTING INTO

12:14.700 --> 12:17.733
OTHER COUNTRIES.

12:17.800 --> 12:20.733
ARE THESE COUNTRIES CONCERNED
THAT THE ISLAMIC STATE GROUP

12:20.800 --> 12:24.633
COULD SPILL OVER INTO JORDAN OR
SAUDI ARABIA?

12:24.700 --> 12:26.700
IT'S NOT JUST THE ISLAMIC STATE.

12:26.767 --> 12:28.667
IT'S THE ISLAMISTS IN MANY OTHER
MOVEMENTS,

12:28.733 --> 12:31.733
AT LEAST TWO OTHERS IN IRAQ,

12:31.800 --> 12:35.733
SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT DIFFERENT
MOVEMENTS OF DIFFERENT SIZES IN

12:35.800 --> 12:38.733
SYRIA AND THIS IS A KEY REASON
WHY COUNTRIES LIKE THE UNITED

12:38.800 --> 12:41.733
ARAB EMIRATES AND SAUDI ARABIA
JUST CHANGED THEIR TERRORIST

12:41.800 --> 12:45.600
LAWS BECAUSE THEY SEE THIS AS
VERY SERIOUS.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.567
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN COUNTERTERRORISM IN

12:47.633 --> 12:51.667
EUROPE AND IN THE UNITED STATES,

12:51.733 --> 12:54.667
YOU HAVE A WHOLE NEW FOCUS ON
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE VOLUNTEERS

12:54.733 --> 12:57.667
THAT HAVE BEEN GOING INTO IRAQ
AND SYRIA WHEN THEY COME BACK.

12:57.733 --> 13:03.733
THIS IS AN ISSUE VIRTUALLY
EVERYWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

13:03.800 --> 13:04.733
THANKS SO MUCH.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.767
MY PLEASURE.

13:06.833 --> 13:11.800
TODAY ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC
HOLDER ALSO EXPRESSED ALARM ABOUT

13:11.867 --> 13:13.800
THE POSSIBILITY OF WESTERNERS
TRAINED BY TERRORISTS IN SYRIA

13:13.867 --> 13:16.800
AND IRAQ RETURNING HOME
UNDETECTED.

13:16.867 --> 13:18.733
IS THIS A CLEAR AND PRESENT
DANGER?

13:18.800 --> 13:20.767
I THINK IT IS.

13:20.833 --> 13:28.767
IN SOME WAYS IT'S MORE
FRIGHTENING THAN ANYTHING

13:28.833 --> 13:37.733
I THINK I'VE SEEN AS ATTORNEY
GENERAL.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.767
NOW TO OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

13:41.833 --> 13:43.700
THE GROWING DANGER TO THE PUBLIC
FROM THE THEFT OF METAL FROM

13:43.767 --> 13:44.667
THINGS LIKE MANHOLE COVERS,
TELEPHONE LINES,

13:44.733 --> 13:48.733
POWER LINES AND SUBSTATIONS.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.733
THE ATTORNEYS GENERAL FROM
MISSISSIPPI, ARKANSAS,

13:51.800 --> 13:54.700
TENNESSEE AND LOUISIANA MET
RECENTLY TO TRY TO DEVISE A

13:54.767 --> 13:55.667
COORDINATED STRATEGY TO COPE
WITH THE PROBLEM WHICH IS

13:55.733 --> 13:58.700
ACTUALLY NATIONAL IN SCOPE.

13:58.767 --> 14:01.767
OHIO'S ANSWER IS TO REGULATE THE
SCRAPYARDS WHERE THE THIEVES

14:01.833 --> 14:04.833
CASH IN.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.800
NEWSHOUR'S SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
RICK CARR WENT THERE RECENTLY

14:07.867 --> 14:10.833
AND FILED THIS REPORT.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.800
Reporter: ANGELA DAY'S LANDLINE
KEPT GOING DEAD IN 2012.

14:12.867 --> 14:15.800
NOT WORKING.

14:15.867 --> 14:18.867
Reporter: SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CELL
PHONE TO USE BECAUSE CELL

14:18.933 --> 14:21.833
COVERAGE IS SPOTTY IN THE
APPALACHIAN REGION OF OHIO WHERE
SHE

14:21.900 --> 14:24.867
LIVES AND AT THE HOUSE WHERE SHE
WAS LIVING WITH HER DAUGHTER

14:24.933 --> 14:27.867
AND HER PARENTS THERE'S NO CELL
SIGNAL AT ALL.

14:27.933 --> 14:30.800
SO WHENEVER SHE HAD TO BE AWAY
FROM HOME SHE WORRIED,

14:30.867 --> 14:34.867
ESPECIALLY ABOUT HER FATHER.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.800
HE HAD A HEART CONDITION AND HE
HAD HAD SEVERAL OPEN HEART

14:36.867 --> 14:38.800
SURGERIES.

14:38.867 --> 14:40.933
HE HAD TRIPLE BYPASS SURGERY.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.733
Reporter: A FEW DAYS AFTER
CHRISTMAS HE SAID HE WASN'T
FEELING

14:42.800 --> 14:45.767
WELL.

14:45.833 --> 14:48.733
HE CALLED OVER TO TALK TO THE
NURSE AND HE WAS HAVING PROBLEMS

14:48.800 --> 14:52.800
WITH THE PHONE.

14:52.867 --> 14:54.733
Reporter: FINALLY HE SAID HE
NEEDED AN AMBULANCE AFTER HIS

14:54.800 --> 14:56.733
CONDITION DETERIORATED.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.800
THE FAMILY CALLED 911,

14:59.867 --> 15:01.867
BUT THE LINE WAS SO BAD THAT
THEY FINALLY GAVE UP AND DAY'S

15:01.933 --> 15:02.867
BROTHER RUSHED THEIR FATHER TO
THE DOCTORS,

15:02.933 --> 15:04.867
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

15:04.933 --> 15:06.300
HE DIED THAT EVENING.

15:06.367 --> 15:10.933
IT WAS REALLY FRUSTRATING
BECAUSE THE WHOLE WEEK AFTERWARDS
WE

15:11.000 --> 15:12.867
COULDN'T EVEN CALL OUT TO PLAN
THE FUNERAL OR CALL TO TELL

15:12.933 --> 15:16.933
PEOPLE THAT HE HAD PASSED.

15:17.000 --> 15:17.833
I HAD TO USE THE PHONE AT MY
WORKPLACE TO USE THE PHONE TO

15:17.900 --> 15:19.933
CALL THE FUNERAL.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.867
Reporter: THIEVES WERE STEALING
TELEPHONE WIRES ALL OVER THE

15:21.933 --> 15:23.933
COUNTY.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.867
IT'S ONE OF THE POOREST IN OHIO
AND THE COPPER IN THE LINES

15:25.933 --> 15:27.900
WAS VALUABLE.

15:27.967 --> 15:30.867
THERE COULD BE HUNDREDS OF
DOLLARS WORTH IN THE CABLE STRUNG

15:30.933 --> 15:33.900
BETWEEN TWO UTILITY POLES.

15:33.967 --> 15:34.833
AT THE TIME THIEVES WERE
STEALING ALL KINDS OF METAL

15:34.900 --> 15:38.933
THROUGHOUT OHIO,

15:39.000 --> 15:40.867
PARTS FROM FARM EQUIPMENT AND
ELECTRICAL SUBSTATIONS,

15:40.933 --> 15:43.833
MANHOLE COVERS, GRAVE MARKERS.

15:43.900 --> 15:46.800
FOR FIVE YEARS RUNNING THE STATE
HAS LED THE NATION IN METAL

15:46.867 --> 15:49.933
THEFTS.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.800
FROM ONE CORNER OF OHIO TO
ANOTHER THIEVES HAVE PUT THE
PUBLIC

15:51.867 --> 15:54.867
IN DANGER.

15:54.933 --> 15:58.867
ACCORDING TO POLICE HERE IN
AKRON,

15:58.933 --> 16:02.967
THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT ON THAT
INTERSTATE HIGHWAY BEHIND ME

16:03.033 --> 16:04.900
BECAUSE OF AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL
COPPER WIRE FROM THE HIGH

16:04.967 --> 16:08.000
TENSION LINES BEYOND IT.

16:08.067 --> 16:12.000
THE WOULD BE THIEVES CLIMBED UP
AND CUT THE LINE SO IT DANGLED

16:12.067 --> 16:15.933
UNDER THE INTERSTATE UNDER
THOUSANDS OF VOLTS OF TENSION.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.967
WHEN AN SUV GOT TOO CLOSE,

16:20.033 --> 16:20.933
THERE WAS A BRIGHT FLASH TO BLEW
OUT THE WINDSHIELD AND

16:21.000 --> 16:23.967
KNOCKED THE DRIVER UNCONSCIOUS.

16:24.033 --> 16:27.033
THE DRIVER SURVIVED, BUT THIEVES
THEMSELVES AREN'T SO LUCKY.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.967
I'M STRUCK BY THE IDEA OF
SOMEONE CLIMBING UP A UTILITY
POLE

16:29.033 --> 16:32.000
AND CARRYING SOMETHING LIKE THIS
DOWN.

16:32.067 --> 16:34.967
THIS IS GOING TO BE CARRYING A
LOT OF JUICE.

16:35.033 --> 16:36.933
IT'S A DANGEROUS CRIME TO
COMMIT.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.967
LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ON THIS.

16:40.033 --> 16:43.900
WE HAVE PEOPLE DYING REGULARLY
FOR THIS.

16:43.967 --> 16:46.867
COMMANDER BOB MEEDER HAS DEALT
WITH METAL THEFT OVER TWO

16:46.933 --> 16:50.867
DECADES AS A COLUMBUS COP.

16:50.933 --> 16:52.900
METAL PRICES HAS COME DOWN,

16:52.967 --> 16:55.900
BUT COPPER IS STILL TWICE AS
VALUABLE AS A DECADE AGO.

16:55.967 --> 16:57.867
IN 2007 COLUMBUS BECAME THE
FIRST CITY IN THE STATE TO CRACK

16:57.933 --> 17:00.933
DOWN ON METAL THEFT.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
POLICE COULDN'T KEEP AN EYE ON
EVERY PIECE OF METAL THIEVES

17:02.067 --> 17:06.067
MIGHT STEAL,

17:06.133 --> 17:08.067
BUT THE CITY COULD MAKE IT
HARDER FOR THEM TO SELL IT.

17:08.133 --> 17:12.067
WE KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO GO TO
THE CENTER OF THE CITY AND PUT

17:12.133 --> 17:16.033
A SIGN OUT AND SAY I HAVE SCRAP
METAL FOR SALE.

17:16.100 --> 17:21.067
THERE'S ONE LOCATION IN THE
STATE OF OHIO AND THROUGHOUT THE

17:21.133 --> 17:27.033
UNITED STATES TO GET MONEY FOR
IT AND THAT IS A SCRAPYARD.

17:27.100 --> 17:31.067
COLUMBUS ENACTED LAWS WHERE
SCRAP DEALERS HAVE TO CHECK EVERY

17:31.133 --> 17:35.033
CUSTOMER'S ID AGAINST AN ONLINE
DATABASE OF CONVICTED THIEVES

17:35.100 --> 17:39.067
WHO MIGHT BE TRYING TO SELL WHAT
THEY'VE STOLEN.

17:39.133 --> 17:42.967
DEALERS HAVE TO RECORD EVERY
DETAIL OF EVERY PURCHASE THEY

17:43.033 --> 17:47.967
MAKE SO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN
INVESTIGATE THEFT.

17:48.033 --> 17:50.933
COLUMBUS OFFICIALS SAY ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE RULES

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
HAVE CUT DOWN ON METAL THEFT.

17:55.067 --> 17:57.933
OHIO LEGISLATORS USED THE CITY
ORDINANCE AS THE BASIS OF A NEW

17:58.000 --> 18:00.967
STATE LAW.

18:01.033 --> 18:06.100
OHIO SCRAP DEALER JOSH JOSEPH
SAID WHEN COLUMBUS CRACKED DOWN,

18:06.167 --> 18:11.133
THIEVES WENT TO OUTSIDE THE CITY
LIMITS.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.100
NOW THAT THE WHOLE STATE IS
CRACKING DOWN,

18:13.167 --> 18:15.033
THEY'LL JUST GO ACROSS THE STATE
LINE.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.133
FOR SOMEONE TO STEAL IT,

18:17.200 --> 18:19.100
DRIVING ACROSS THE STATE AND
SELLING IT,

18:19.167 --> 18:23.067
IS A REALLY EASY THING TO
HAPPEN.

18:23.133 --> 18:25.100
THE UNIFORMITY OF THE LAW,

18:25.167 --> 18:28.133
UNIFORMITY OF THE WAY IT IS
ENFORCED FROM AN INDUSTRY

18:28.200 --> 18:31.100
PERSPECTIVE WE SEE AS PARAMOUNT
TO THE SUCCESS OF THE LAW.

18:31.167 --> 18:35.067
JOSEPH HAS A LOT OF OTHER
CONCERNS ABOUT THE LAW.

18:35.133 --> 18:38.133
FOR ONE THING,

18:38.200 --> 18:40.100
HE WORRIES ABOUT WHAT THE COST
OF COMPLYING WITH IT WILL DO TO

18:40.167 --> 18:42.133
FAMILY-OWNED SMALL BUSINESSES IN
THE INDUSTRY.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.067
IT'S ANYWHERE FROM PROBABLY 20
OR $30,000 UP TO HUNDREDS OF

18:45.133 --> 18:48.100
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.

18:48.167 --> 18:51.133
WE HAVE SPENT SIX FIGURES TO
MAINTAIN,

18:51.200 --> 18:55.100
UPGRADE AND TRAIN OUR PEOPLE IN
ORDER TO BE COMPLIANT.

18:55.167 --> 19:00.133
AND TRAINING MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH
TO KEEP SOME EMPLOYEES HONEST.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.200
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE THAT IF
SOMEBODY STEALS SAY A BUNCH OF

19:02.267 --> 19:05.267
COPPER WIRE, BRINGS IT IN,

19:05.333 --> 19:10.267
FLIPS ONE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES 100
BUCKS,

19:10.333 --> 19:13.233
HOW DO YOU INSURE YOUR EMPLOYEE
IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO THAT?

19:13.300 --> 19:16.333
I WOULD SAY THAT OUR EMPLOYEES
ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THAT.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.200
WE THINK WE'VE HAD SOME
INSTANCES OF THAT HAPPENING IN
THE

19:17.267 --> 19:19.200
PAST.

19:19.267 --> 19:20.167
HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO FIRE
ANYBODY?

19:20.233 --> 19:22.233
WE HAVE.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.167
THERE COULD ALSO BE CONSEQUENCES
TO THE ENVIRONMENT ACCORDING

19:24.233 --> 19:27.200
TO SCRAP DEALERS.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.533
THEY'RE IN THE RECYCLING
BUSINESS.

19:28.600 --> 19:32.200
THE METAL THEY TAKE IN GETS
MELTED DOWN AND REACH USED.

19:32.267 --> 19:37.233
THE LAW IN OHIO MAKES IT A CRIME
FOR SCRAP DEALERS TO BUY

19:37.300 --> 19:41.267
CERTAIN ITEMS UNLESS SELLERS CAN
PROVE SOMETHING IS THEIRS TO

19:41.333 --> 19:46.167
SELL, ELECTRICAL LINES, FOR
INSTANCE, AND TELEPHONE CABLES,

19:46.233 --> 19:52.167
BUT THE LIST ALSO INCLUDES ITEMS
HOMEOWNERS MIGHT BRING IN AND

19:52.233 --> 19:58.200
THAT COULD END UP IN A LEFT HAND
FILL IF A SCRAP DEALER

19:58.267 --> 20:00.200
REFUSES IT TO STAY ON THE SAFE
SIDE OF THE LAW ACCORDING TO

20:00.267 --> 20:05.200
ROBIN WEINER WHO RUNS THE TRADE
GROUP.

20:05.267 --> 20:07.133
THE MEMBERS ASK FOR PROOF OF
OWNERSHIP AND THEY DON'T HAVE

20:07.200 --> 20:09.200
THAT.

20:09.267 --> 20:11.167
THEY WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING
AND RECYCLE.

20:11.233 --> 20:14.167
JOSH JOSEPH'S FAMILY HAS BEEN IN
THE SCRAP BUSINESS FOR FOUR

20:14.233 --> 20:18.200
GENERATIONS AND DOESN'T LIKE HIS
BUSINESS BEING COMPARED TO A

20:18.267 --> 20:21.200
PAWN SHOP AND HE'S NOT SURE HIS
INDUSTRY SHOULD HAVE TO BEAR

20:21.267 --> 20:25.167
THE BURDEN OF CRACKING DOWN ON
METAL THIEVES.

20:25.233 --> 20:27.133
THIEVES WILL KEEP STEALING METAL
ACCORDING TO ANGELA DAY AS

20:27.200 --> 20:29.167
LONG AS IT'S VALUABLE.

20:29.233 --> 20:33.200
A COUPLE MONTHS AFTER HER FATHER
DIED POLICE ARRESTED TWO MEN

20:33.267 --> 20:37.200
WHO WERE CHARGED WITH STEALING
PHONE LINES INCLUDING THE ONE

20:37.267 --> 20:39.100
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS
SAY AFFECTED THE CALL TO 911

20:39.167 --> 20:43.133
THE DAY HER FATHER DIED.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.067
SHE'D KNOWN ONE OF THE MEN AS A
KID AND SHE UNDERSTANDS WHAT

20:45.133 --> 20:48.133
MOTIVATED THE CRIMES.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.067
GROWING UP HERE YOU REALIZE HOW
DESPERATE PEOPLE ARE AND HOW

20:51.133 --> 20:54.133
MUCH IN NEED THIS AREA IS.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.100
I MEAN THERE'S NOT A LOT OF
RESOURCES.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.067
THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE
STEALING THING.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.133
THAT'S JUST A PART OF LIFE.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.267
I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU LIVE IN
THE UNITED STATES.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.200
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THEFT IF
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE PEOPLE

21:05.267 --> 21:08.233
DESPERATE, STEALING TO SURVIVE.

21:08.300 --> 21:11.200
BOTH MEN ARE SERVING PRISON TERM
FOR STEALING THE TELEPHONE

21:11.267 --> 21:15.267
LINES.

21:15.333 --> 21:22.200
LEARN MORE ABOUT THE MARKET FOR
SCRAP METAL.

21:22.267 --> 21:31.200
VISIT NEWSHOUR.PBC.ON.

21:31.267 --> 21:35.200
-- VISIT NEWSHOUR.PBS.ORG.

21:35.267 --> 21:37.267
THIS IS NEWSHOUR PBS SUNDAY.

21:37.333 --> 21:44.167
IN AN OPINION PIECE PUBLISHED
THIS WEEKEND IN THE OBSERVER

21:44.233 --> 21:51.200
DESMOND TUTU SIGNALED HIS
SUPPORT FOR DIGNITY WHEN DYING.

21:51.267 --> 21:52.133
RECENTLY THE FORMER ARCHBISHOP
OF CANTERBURY EMBRACED THE SAME

21:52.200 --> 21:54.167
CAUSE.

21:54.233 --> 22:01.200
Reporter: FOR 11 YEARS HE WAS
HEAD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AS

22:01.267 --> 22:05.300
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY LORD
CAREY HAS CHANGED HIS MIND TO

22:05.367 --> 22:11.333
APPROVE LEGALIZING DEATH FOR THE
DYING.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.333
HE SAID THE OLD PHILOSOPHICAL
CERTAINTIES COLLAPSED IN THE

22:13.400 --> 22:16.267
FACE OF REALITY OF NEEDLESS
SUFFERING.

22:16.333 --> 22:20.267
IN STRICTLY OBSERVING THE
SANCTITY OF LIFE THE CHURCH COULD

22:20.333 --> 22:26.267
NOW ACTUALLY BE PROMOTING
ANGUISH AND PAIN,

22:26.333 --> 22:31.333
THE VERY OPPOSITE OF A CHRISTIAN
MESSAGE OF HOPE.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.267
LORD CAREY WAS DEEPLY MOVED
AFTER A SICK MAN WAS DENIED THE

22:34.333 --> 22:38.333
LEGAL RIGHT TO DIE.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.267
HIS WIDOW TODAY WELCOMED LORD
CAREY'S SWITCH.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.333
THIS IS HUGELY SIGNIFICANT.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.267

OPINION WITHIN THE CHURCH WAS

22:53.333 --> 22:56.233
