JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: As
Republicans on Capitol Hill
try to repeal and replace the

00:04.600 --> 00:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Affordable Care Act, we're
going to spend the next couple
of nights hearing what patients

00:09.300 --> 00:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and health care providers
think should be done.

00:12.100 --> 00:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our team visited West Virginia
and Virginia, which made very
different decisions about

00:17.700 --> 00:19.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Medicaid.

00:19.300 --> 00:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
West Virginia did commit
to expanding Medicaid
through Obamacare.

00:22.500 --> 00:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But Virginia is one of
19 states that didn't.

00:26.133 --> 00:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
The state's
Republican-controlled
legislature voted
against expanding the
program to 400,000

00:32.300 --> 00:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more citizens because
of concerns over costs.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we visit a clinic
providing free care in the
western corner of Virginia, a

00:41.466 --> 00:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
region that strongly supported
the election of President Trump.

00:43.700 --> 00:45.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

00:45.333 --> 00:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAULA HILL, Family
Nurse Practitioner: My
name is Dr. Paula Hill.

00:47.233 --> 00:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a family nurse practitioner
and clinical director
here at the Health Wagon.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are at the Smiddy
Clinic in Wise, Virginia.

00:53.700 --> 00:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We actually say that we're
the forgotten Virginia,
because we're down in
the corner with Tennessee

00:58.433 --> 01:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Kentucky borders.

01:00.566 --> 01:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're very rural, very
mountainous and very isolated
from the rest of Virginia and

01:05.833 --> 01:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of ways the
rest of the country.

01:08.066 --> 01:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a high rate of heart
disease, diabetes, and it's
because of the economics here.

01:15.200 --> 01:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE CAMPBELL, Virginia:
All the mines and stuff
have just about closed down.

01:19.866 --> 01:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there really isn't
any jobs around here.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Joyce Campbell.

01:24.566 --> 01:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm from Wise, Virginia.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, I get $800 a month.

01:29.200 --> 01:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I am fortunate I do
have an income coming in,
with my Social Security.

01:36.833 --> 01:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the time you pay your rent,
your electric, your water, your
gas, you either have a choice

01:43.433 --> 01:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of whether you want to
buy your medicine or
whether you want to eat.

01:46.166 --> 01:48.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAULA HILL: The Affordable Care
Act, when it was enacted, it
did help a lot of Virginians.

01:51.533 --> 01:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Down here in this part of the
state, in far Southwestern
Virginia, we didn't benefit as

01:57.966 --> 02:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much because there are such
dire economic constraints here.

02:01.533 --> 02:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our patients couldn't afford
the Affordable Care Act.

02:04.733 --> 02:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They couldn't afford $400
a month for a family plan.

02:08.433 --> 02:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Virginia didn't
expand Medicaid.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We actually didn't benefit any.

02:13.566 --> 02:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would have helped if
we had expanded Medicaid.

02:16.100 --> 02:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would have helped
some of our residents
anyway, because there's
a dire amount of poverty.

02:22.400 --> 02:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's people dying every
day, and dying senseless
deaths, because they don't have

02:27.100 --> 02:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
equal right to health care.

02:28.333 --> 02:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TINA BEAN, Virginia:
My name is Tina Bean.

02:30.133 --> 02:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm 59, and I'm from
Haysi, Virginia.

02:36.466 --> 02:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I had congestive
heart failure twice.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I didn't have insurance.

02:40.333 --> 02:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's when I started
coming to Paula, or coming
to the Health Wagon.

02:44.133 --> 02:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Without the medicines and stuff,
I probably wouldn't be here.

02:46.933 --> 02:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I heard about the Obamacare
a few years ago and checked
it and stuff, you could tell

02:51.266 --> 02:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
then that it wasn't
going to work.

02:52.666 --> 02:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People can't afford it.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOYCE CAMPBELL: They call
it Affordable Care Act.

02:56.266 --> 02:57.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But it's not.

02:57.700 --> 03:00.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they said you could
keep your doctors.

03:00.466 --> 03:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You couldn't because your
doctors wouldn't take the thing.

03:04.400 --> 03:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said you could go
to the same hospital, but a
lot of it was built on lies.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you really want to know the
truth, I think - - and I think
somebody one of these days

03:13.633 --> 03:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is going to give
an account for it.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF TILLER, Virginia:
My name is Jeff Tiller.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm 47 years old.

03:17.666 --> 03:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I have worked in the
coal mines for 29 years.

03:23.566 --> 03:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They diagnosed me
for black lung.

03:26.333 --> 03:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They done a chest X-ray.

03:32.466 --> 03:36.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They also have found
some nodules in my lung.

03:39.133 --> 03:40.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULA HILL: We are overwhelmed
here at the Health Wagon.

03:42.666 --> 03:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have went to over almost
9,000 patients, and we have
a staff of less than 20.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every year, we have an
outreach clinic event
called Remote Area Medical.

03:54.633 --> 03:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will see them standing
in line for dental care, for
medical care, for vision.

03:59.833 --> 04:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have found people with
dissecting aortic aneurysms
that's had to be flown out.

04:06.466 --> 04:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had patients have stroke
right there in front of us
at these Remote Area Medical

04:08.533 --> 04:11.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
events.

04:11.033 --> 04:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had brain
tumors that have been
discovered, lung cancers
that have been discovered.

04:14.033 --> 04:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And every year, it's like this.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We keep thinking, well, is
it ever going to get better?

04:18.366 --> 04:21.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is anybody going to help
these forgotten people?

04:21.633 --> 04:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're like something you would
see in a Third World country.

04:24.733 --> 04:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOYCE CAMPBELL: The Obamacare
could have helped some people.

04:28.633 --> 04:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I say it needs to be replaced.

04:30.133 --> 04:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TINA BEAN: I hope that
they can replace it.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know it's not going to be
something they can do overnight,
because the mess didn't

04:36.833 --> 04:38.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come overnight.

04:38.833 --> 04:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF TILLER: When I first
started hearing that Obama
getting ready for health care,

04:44.466 --> 04:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obamacare, I thought
that was great.

04:47.266 --> 04:49.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We tried it.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We got it.

04:51.533 --> 04:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does it have faults?

04:52.533 --> 04:53.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, it does.

04:53.866 --> 04:55.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it working?

04:55.266 --> 04:57.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, it is.

04:57.300 --> 05:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know right there in my
hometown of people that's got
insurance through the Affordable

05:02.566 --> 05:03.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

05:03.866 --> 05:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you reverse it, they
lose their insurance.

05:07.533 --> 05:11.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: If all of this
goes through, I probably
won't have anything.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know how I'm
going to get covered.

05:13.166 --> 05:14.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

05:14.666 --> 05:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULA HILL: Because of the
preexisting conditions?

05:15.833 --> 05:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Yes, right.

05:16.866 --> 05:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I have had it for years.

05:17.866 --> 05:19.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

05:19.900 --> 05:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAULA HILL: If the Senate
plan actually passes, there
will be deep cuts to Medicaid.

05:22.566 --> 05:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even though Virginians didn't
expand, what they are paying out
is going to be even -- subjected

05:28.300 --> 05:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to even more cuts.

05:30.333 --> 05:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then you have the preventive
care that's being discussed that
they're not going to be paying

05:35.233 --> 05:37.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for anymore.

05:37.266 --> 05:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just because it wasn't a
perfect plan, it doesn't mean
do away with the whole thing.

05:41.133 --> 05:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why can't we build on it and
repair it, not take it away and
then start over with another

05:47.233 --> 05:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plan that's not
perfect and not ideal?

05:49.300 --> 05:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE CAMPBELL: It helped the
insurance company, because they
made all kind of money off of

05:54.066 --> 05:56.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

05:56.033 --> 05:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as far as helping
a lot of poor people, it
didn't, and it still isn't.

05:58.600 --> 06:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, we cannot afford the high
cost like Obama had there.

06:05.133 --> 06:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There's no way that
people in Southwest
Virginia can handle it.

06:07.766 --> 06:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, maybe up Washington,
or way up where there's
money and jobs, you could.

06:13.966 --> 06:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there's neither
money nor jobs here.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TINA BEAN: They need to
do something to help it.

06:18.800 --> 06:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, hopefully, the
administration now, maybe
they will do something.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOYCE CAMPBELL: Washington,
come to Southwest Virginia.

06:24.933 --> 06:26.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

06:26.433 --> 06:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAULA HILL: Come down here
and look in their eyes.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And don't forget
where you came from.

06:30.833 --> 06:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don't forget who put you in
the position that you're in.

06:33.533 --> 06:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOYCE CAMPBELL:
Check the people.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look at them.

06:36.333 --> 06:38.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Go sit on the streets.

06:38.033 --> 06:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Go bring your car and
park it and look at the
people that are hurting.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then, if you have
got a heart, you will
know what it needs.
