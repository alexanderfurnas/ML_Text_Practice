Presidential candidates
descend on South Carolina and
Nevada before

latest from
the trail.

00:17.818 --> 00:23.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also ahead: growing
anti-Semitism in Denmark
and Sweden, where Jewish
families are increasingly

00:23.957 --> 00:25.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under attack.

00:25.959 --> 00:31.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how slow Internet speeds
slow learning
for Mississippi high school
students.

PAM ODOM, Teacher: There's a
large portion

of a 60-mile

00:35.102 --> 00:43.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

technology
is slow, I can't expose them to
anything.

00:44.077 --> 00:53.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on

GWEN IFILL: President Obama
vowed today to
nominate someone -- quote --
"indisputably

01:05.832 --> 01:10.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
qualified" to replace the late
Supreme Court
Justice Antonin Scalia.

01:10.737 --> 01:15.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Republicans are insisting
he forego
a nomination fight in this
election year.

01:15.709 --> 01:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after a Southeast Asian
summit in California,
Mr. Obama said he intends to do
his job, and

01:22.215 --> 01:24.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
senators should do theirs.

01:24.117 --> 01:27.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
There are a lot of Republican
senators who

01:27.454 --> 01:31.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to be under a lot of
pressure from
various special interests and
various constituencies

01:31.124 --> 01:41.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and many of their voters to not
let any nominee
go through, no matter who I
nominate.

01:42.069 --> 01:46.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's not how the system's
supposed to
work. That's not how our
democracy is supposed

01:46.506 --> 01:48.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to work.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Separately, court
officials announced
Justice Scalia will lie in

Saturday.

From the Gulf Coast to New
England, a winter
storm system whipped up trouble
overnight.

02:01.054 --> 02:05.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Millions along the Eastern
Seaboard faced
a treacherous morning commute,
after freezing

02:05.559 --> 02:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rain coated roads with ice. The
same front
sent tornadoes ripping through
parts of the

02:10.630 --> 02:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gulf Coast late Monday, damaging
homes in
the Florida Panhandle and
Mississippi. But

02:17.371 --> 02:22.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the West, California and
Arizona faced
another day of record heat.

02:22.476 --> 02:27.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. and Cuba signed a deal
today to resume
commercial air traffic for the
first time

02:27.781 --> 02:34.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 50 years. It's the latest
step in normalizing
relations. As early as this
fall, American

02:34.521 --> 02:40.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carriers could offer 110 flights
a day between
the U.S. and Cuba.

In Mexico, Pope Francis urged
clergy to battle
the drug violence that's
devastated the country.

02:46.333 --> 02:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took that message to Morelia,
capital of
a southwestern state ravaged by
decades of

02:51.772 --> 02:58.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gang warfare. Speaking to a
packed stadium,
Francis exhorted priests and
nuns not to give

02:58.345 --> 03:02.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in to moral paralysis, what he
called the
devil's favorite weapon.

03:03.016 --> 03:07.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): What temptation can
come to us

03:07.921 --> 03:13.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from places often dominated by
violence, corruption
and drug trafficking in the face
of suffering

03:13.193 --> 03:18.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and vulnerability? What
temptation might we
suffer over and over again when
faced with

03:18.265 --> 03:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this reality? I think we can sum
it up in
one word: resignation.

GWEN IFILL: This was the
second-to-last day

The U.N.'s Human Rights Office
sharply criticized
China today for an ongoing
crackdown on dissent.

03:37.417 --> 03:43.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It urged Beijing to release more
than 250
human rights lawyers and
activists arrested

03:43.256 --> 03:48.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since July. The office also
pointed to the
disappearance of five Hong Kong
publishers

03:48.762 --> 03:51.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who opposed the Chinese
government.

03:51.364 --> 03:56.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four U.S. journalists arrested
in Bahrain
have been released. They were
detained Sunday,

03:56.636 --> 04:02.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
covering the anniversary of the
2011 Shiite
uprising. Today, the Americans
were formally

04:02.776 --> 04:08.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charged with joining an illegal
gathering.
Later, they flew out of the
island nation,

04:08.215 --> 04:11.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after the U.S. Embassy
intervened.

04:11.184 --> 04:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heavy fighting in Northwestern
Syria clouded
prospects for a temporary truce
today. Government

04:16.823 --> 04:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces and allied groups backed
by Russian
airstrikes kept pounding away
near the nation's

04:22.496 --> 04:24.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
largest city.

04:24.397 --> 04:29.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alex Thomson of Independent
Television News
filed this report, including
some images that

04:29.536 --> 04:32.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
may be disturbing.

04:32.405 --> 04:41.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: The suburbs of
northern Aleppo,
cluster bombs from aircraft. The
closer we

04:41.915 --> 04:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get to any proposed cease-fire
on Friday,
the less likely it looks.

04:52.526 --> 04:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Across the battlefield, the
Russia-Syrian-Iranian
forces have never had it so
good. Why talk

04:59.666 --> 05:04.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
peace when maybe, just maybe,
you can wrap
up the entire war?

05:04.838 --> 05:09.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, President of
Syria (through
translator): They say they want
a cease-fire

05:09.776 --> 05:14.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within a week. Well, who is able
to assemble
all these conditions or
requirements within

05:14.781 --> 05:20.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a week? No one. Who will talk to
the terrorists
if the terrorist organizations
refuse a cease-fire?

05:21.054 --> 05:22.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who will hold them accountable?

05:23.056 --> 05:30.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: No wonder Assad
talks war, because
across Northern Syria, from Homs
to the country's

05:30.964 --> 05:36.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most populous city, Aleppo, the
Syrian army,
with Russian air support and
Iranian-backed

05:36.203 --> 05:41.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
militias, wants to surround and
take all of
Aleppo whilst moving north to
seal off the

05:41.341 --> 05:46.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border to Turkey to cut rebel
support lines.

05:46.313 --> 05:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rebel fighters in Aleppo, but
for how much
longer? Down in Damascus, the
U.N. talked

05:51.651 --> 05:56.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today about getting humanitarian
aid into
some areas tomorrow. Well, they
talked about

05:57.023 --> 06:02.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. Aleppo is unlikely to see it
happening.

06:02.495 --> 06:14.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, they dug a baby alive
from his obliterated
family home there. Then they
found his elder

06:14.641 --> 06:18.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brother, also somehow still
living.

06:18.411 --> 06:25.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Amid the fighting,
Syrian Kurds
advanced near the Turkish
border. But fearing

06:25.318 --> 06:31.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they plan to seize Turkish
territory as well,
Turkey shelled the Kurdish
fighters.

An Egyptian diplomat who rose to
U.N. secretary-general
died today. Boutros
Boutros-Ghali served as

06:37.864 --> 06:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world body's first chief
from Africa from
1992 to 1996. His term was
marked by tension

06:45.005 --> 06:50.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the U.S. and then-President
Bill Clinton,
as well as criticism of the U.N.
response

06:50.910 --> 06:58.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to genocides in Rwanda and
Bosnia. Boutros
Boutros-Ghali was 93 years old.

06:58.251 --> 07:03.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four major oil producers pledged
today to

support prices.

07:03.590 --> 07:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and Qatar
said they'd limit output for the
year to the

07:10.030 --> 07:15.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
levels of last month if other
countries follow
suit. It's unclear if Iran will
agree. The

07:15.535 --> 07:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamic republic wants to ramp
up oil exports
now that sanctions have eased.

07:20.940 --> 07:26.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street rallied for a second

07:26.846 --> 07:29.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to close near 16200. The Nasdaq

more.

JEB BUSH (R), Presidential

he think he can use his real
estate skills

08:38.451 --> 08:44.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

W. Bush,

09:15.622 --> 09:19.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

last night.

DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential

Ever ask yourself why his

SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Barack Obama,
at the risk
of repeating myself, knows
exactly what he's

10:05.772 --> 10:07.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing. Was Obamacare an accident
or on purpose?

10:07.974 --> 10:09.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: On purpose.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Was Dodd-Frank
an accident
or on purpose?

10:12.846 --> 10:14.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: On purpose.

10:14.714 --> 10:18.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrats
today? A different
theme. In Columbia, Bernie
Sanders made his

10:18.418 --> 10:22.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case to black voters, who form a
majority
of the state's Democrats.

10:22.322 --> 10:26.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Change takes place from the
bottom on up when

10:27.060 --> 10:28.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people begin to stir.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

10:30.196 --> 10:35.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Dr. King
was clearly
one of the great leaders in
American history.

10:35.335 --> 10:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it wasn't him alone. It was
thousands
and thousands of
African-Americans and their

10:43.009 --> 10:44.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
white allies.

10:44.911 --> 10:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Hillary Clinton
too was courting
black voters, but in New York.
She sat down

10:49.048 --> 10:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with leaders of the National
Urban League.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
My campaign really is about
breaking every

10:54.921 --> 11:00.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
barrier, because I believe
absolutely that
America can't live up to its
potential unless

11:01.094 --> 11:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every single person has the
chance to live
up to theirs.

11:04.964 --> 11:09.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Notably,
neither of the Democrats
made a stop today in Nevada,
even though that's

11:09.736 --> 11:15.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where their next contest will
be, this Saturday.
It's the same day that
Republicans vote in

11:15.174 --> 11:16.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South Carolina.

11:16.943 --> 11:20.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

11:20.880 --> 11:35.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The official
unemployment rate
may have just fallen to under 5
percent, but

11:35.795 --> 11:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
food stamps remain a pivotal
part of daily
life for millions of Americans;
46 million

11:41.834 --> 11:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, or about one of every
seven Americans,
receive food stamps.

11:45.805 --> 11:50.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the government wants to
steer them toward
healthier food choices. The USDA
plans to

11:50.910 --> 11:57.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
require retailers who accept
food stamps to
stock more fresh fruits,
vegetables, meat,

11:57.317 --> 12:03.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poultry and fish. The stores
would have to
stock at least 168 items the
government considers

12:03.856 --> 12:05.058 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
healthy.

12:05.158 --> 12:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But would healthier options
necessarily change
behavior?

12:08.761 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We explore this with Yael
Lehmann, executive
director of The Food Trust in
Philadelphia,

12:13.433 --> 12:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a not-for-profit organization
that works to
ensure healthier eating
alternatives.

12:18.304 --> 12:19.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, Ms. Lehmann.

12:20.073 --> 12:24.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why -- what is the reasoning
behind forcing
retailers to stock healthier
foods?

12:24.377 --> 12:29.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YAEL LEHMANN, Executive
Director, The Food
Trust: Well, I think the USDA
has good intentions

12:29.349 --> 12:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here and it's a good goal,
right? We want
all people, including low-income
people who

12:33.152 --> 12:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are on SNAP, or formally called
food stamps,
to have access to affordable and
nutritious

12:39.626 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
foods.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to make sure oranges are
just as accessible
to them as orange soda, for
example, when

12:45.031 --> 12:49.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they go to the convenience
store. But we want
to make sure -- we also want to
make sure

12:50.003 --> 12:54.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that we're supporting the
retailers in this
case, so that they learn how to
stock these

12:54.374 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
items. And we know it can be
possible. It
can be done. We just want to
make sure it's

12:58.211 --> 13:03.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done in a way that there is no
unintended
harmful consequences to the
retailer or to

13:03.983 --> 13:05.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the customer.

13:05.852 --> 13:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, when you say
stock these items,
do these retailers get a list of
the kinds

13:09.188 --> 13:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of items or the specific items
they should
have in stock at all times?

13:13.459 --> 13:17.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
YAEL LEHMANN: That's my
understanding, is
that USDA would offer a list.

13:17.230 --> 13:24.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a -- again, this is a
proposed policy
change, and I think that, over
our many years,

13:24.270 --> 13:29.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have worked for over 10 years
now to help
folks who run convenience stores
to stock

13:29.542 --> 13:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
healthier items. We know it can
be done, but
that they need assistance, they
need training

13:36.049 --> 13:37.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in some cases.

13:38.017 --> 13:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some cases, they're not
familiar with stocking
certain items like produce. So,
yes, if we

13:42.722 --> 13:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give them a list, let's make
sure that we
can help them be successful and
be able to

13:46.392 --> 13:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pick the items on that list that
are going
to sell and are going to be
popular with their

13:50.530 --> 13:52.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
customers.

13:52.365 --> 13:55.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: As a business
proposition, is
this something that's
sustainable for the

13:55.435 --> 14:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corner grocery store, the corner
bodega, which
may not even have the storage
space or the

14:02.442 --> 14:05.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refrigeration for those kinds of
items?

14:05.411 --> 14:09.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAEL LEHMANN: It's true there
are certain
challenges, and that's another
thing that

14:09.248 --> 14:14.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we want to think about when
we're considering
this proposed change that USDA
has put out

14:14.620 --> 14:16.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

14:16.556 --> 14:21.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the retailers don't have
refrigeration
or they don't have the place to
stock these

14:21.127 --> 14:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certain items. At The Food
Trust, the organization
that I'm the executive director
of, we work

14:26.466 --> 14:34.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the retailers to help them
find refrigerators
and to show them how to stock
these foods.

14:34.207 --> 14:39.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to make sure, again,
that they have
the proper ways to stock these
items and to

14:39.645 --> 14:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make them look attractive and to
be stored
correctly, you know, so that --
and priced

14:46.052 --> 14:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correctly, so that it's as
accessible and
affordable as possible and
attractive as possible

14:53.426 --> 14:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to their customers, so that they
can be successful.

14:56.229 --> 15:02.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know it can be done. We
have seen retailers
over the years do very well with
this, but

15:02.335 --> 15:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they need some help out of the
gate.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, so the onus is
put on the
retailer.

15:06.172 --> 15:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What about the behavior of the
consumer? How
do you know that just merely
putting the oranges

15:11.410 --> 15:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the shelf won't make the
person who's buying
with food stamps reach for
orange soda if

15:17.216 --> 15:20.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the food stamps will cover it?
What changes
the behavior?

15:20.453 --> 15:25.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAEL LEHMANN: Well, I think
there's a number
of things. You know, we can talk
to -- there

15:25.625 --> 15:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is people who are more educated
on this than
I am, but when it -- as you
know, when you

15:30.696 --> 15:37.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
walk into any store, whether
it's a grocery
store or a corner store, the way
that items

15:37.103 --> 15:42.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are placed, if it looks
attractive, if it's
priced the right way, if it's in
the eye level,

15:42.675 --> 15:46.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of these different things
can make an
impact on what you choose.

15:46.712 --> 15:51.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also know that even -- that
by having marketing
materials or sometimes even by
having the

15:51.484 --> 15:55.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retailer behind the counter, the
guy saying
behind the counter, hey, have
you tried the

15:55.288 --> 15:56.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
oranges, can even have an
impact.

15:57.089 --> 16:03.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's lots of different ways
that you can
influence consumer buying
habits. But, for

16:03.830 --> 16:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most part, you want to make
sure it's
priced right, it looks good, it
tastes good,

16:08.434 --> 16:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that you can see it, it's
right there
in front of you.

16:10.603 --> 16:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But what if what you
see in front
of you is pre-packaged noodles,
freeze-dried

16:16.943 --> 16:24.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
food, and right next to it is
perhaps the
more expensive fresh noodles?
What about this,

16:24.817 --> 16:29.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially since you're still
trying to stretch
your food stamp buck, will
encourage you to

16:29.388 --> 16:33.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
buy the fresher stuff, if it's
cheaper, if
you get more with your food
stamps?

16:33.593 --> 16:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YAEL LEHMANN: No, it's a very
good point you're
bringing up.

16:36.996 --> 16:41.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Price is incredibly important,
especially
when you're on a very, very
tight budget.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And price is going to matter
when you're making
your decisions of what you're
going to buy

16:44.570 --> 16:47.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when you're in the store,
whether it's the
convenience store or the grocery
store.

16:47.673 --> 16:53.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is where it's critical to
have other
programs. There's incentive
programs, for

16:53.613 --> 16:59.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
example, different programs that
are called
things like Double Up Food
Bucks, for example,

16:59.652 --> 17:05.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are advocated by groups
like Wholesome
Wave and Fair Food Network and
The Food Trust

17:05.324 --> 17:07.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and others.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's a way that you can
stretch your food
stamp dollars, so that when you
are buying

17:09.695 --> 17:15.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that healthy item, it's at an
even better
price point. So, we do want to
think about

17:15.468 --> 17:20.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how can we make sure that the
prices are good,
what additional incentives can
we offer to

17:20.806 --> 17:26.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the customer to make sure that
the fresh noodle
is priced the same as the
processed, maybe

17:27.079 --> 17:28.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not as healthy noodle.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Yael Lehmann,

17:31.984 --> 17:32.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

18:35.047 --> 18:39.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insist on living our peaceful
life. And that
is perhaps the most important
message we can

18:39.452 --> 18:42.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
send here today, that we will
never -- we
will never give in. We will

18:46.792 --> 18:48.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vulnerable?

18:48.728 --> 18:51.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARS LOKKE RASMUSSEN: Yes, I
realize that.
And for that reason, we are in
close cooperation

18:51.764 --> 18:57.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Jewish community and
will do our
utmost to protect them. We
insist to live

18:58.070 --> 18:59.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
side by side in a peaceful
manner.

18:59.972 --> 19:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Denmark's new
reality required
heavily armed police at a
basketball match

19:05.077 --> 19:10.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to celebrate Dan Uzan's life. He
loved the
game and his face adorned the
uniforms of

19:10.850 --> 19:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the predominantly Jewish teams.
Dan's father,
Sergeot, has always insisted
that hate shouldn't

19:18.090 --> 19:19.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
prevail.

19:20.059 --> 19:25.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEOT UZAN, Father of Dan
Uzan: The most
important message is that we
have to be together

19:26.098 --> 19:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to fight terrorism together.
Evil will
not win and with power. We have
to win it

19:38.744 --> 19:40.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with goodness.

19:40.613 --> 19:45.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Hannah Bentow
was the girl
Dan Uzan died protecting. Her
bar mitzvah,

19:45.284 --> 19:50.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or coming of age party, was in
full swing
when the terrorists attacked the
synagogue.

19:51.023 --> 19:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every week, before the Jewish
Sabbath, her
mother, Mette, has a special
ritual, lighting

19:55.561 --> 20:02.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a candle for Dan Uzan. Mette
Bentow's high
profile has made her a target
for anti-Semitic

20:02.268 --> 20:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behavior. Since the shooting,
she's received
numerous threats via social
media, and in

20:07.773 --> 20:10.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
broad daylight in central
Copenhagen.

20:10.109 --> 20:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
METTE MIRIAM BENTOW, Mother: He
spat at me.
So, I did get a little yelling,
but it was

20:14.280 --> 20:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mainly the spitting at me that
was very uncomfortable.

20:17.516 --> 20:22.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Mette Bentow
believes that,
these days, anti-Semitism comes
predominantly

20:22.288 --> 20:28.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Muslims. But she's trying
to maintain
a sense of idealism and
friendship with Niddal

20:28.260 --> 20:30.663 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
El Jabri.

20:30.763 --> 20:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
El Jabri, a Palestinian whose
family hails
from Hebron on the West Bank,
was instrumental

20:41.340 --> 20:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in organizing a peace ring
around the synagogue
following last year's attack.

20:45.878 --> 20:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIDDAL EL JABRI, Palestinian:
It's all about
the kids for me and it's always
been about

20:50.049 --> 20:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kids for me. We want to make
this society
safe for them. I keep saying
that the Jewish

20:55.521 --> 21:01.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school here in Copenhagen is one
of the biggest
examples of how humanity has
failed in this

21:01.927 --> 21:06.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, that you have to have
armed forces,
you have barbed wire around the
school, you

21:07.099 --> 21:08.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have cameras all over.

21:08.934 --> 21:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When that is the situation,
adults need to
sit down and really think about
what this

21:15.274 --> 21:17.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country is doing to its
children.

21:17.243 --> 21:20.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Mette Bentow
could not bear
to be in Denmark on the
anniversary. She took

21:21.046 --> 21:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her daughter to Israel, to which
she's increasingly
drawn.

21:23.949 --> 21:28.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
METTE MIRIAM BENTOW: My
children's future
is not in Denmark. No, it's not.
If they want

21:29.054 --> 21:35.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to live a Jewish life, it's not
in Denmark.
No. My future for the time being
is in Denmark,

21:35.961 --> 21:39.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and then we will see.

21:39.265 --> 21:44.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Historically in
Europe, anti-Semitism
has come from the right wing,
but most Jewish

21:44.970 --> 21:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders believe the greatest
threat now emanates
from the continent's growing
Muslim population.

21:50.576 --> 21:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a gathering of the
extreme Islamist
political party Hizb ut Tahrir
last year,

21:55.915 --> 21:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not long after the Copenhagen
attacks.

21:58.250 --> 22:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hizb ut Tahrir wants a worldwide
caliphate.
It's banned in several European
countries,

22:04.990 --> 22:09.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but not in Denmark. Its
spokesman is Elias
Lamrabet.

22:09.128 --> 22:12.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is your message to the Jews
of Copenhagen
who feel especially vulnerable?

22:12.698 --> 22:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIAS LAMRABET, Hizb Trump
Tahrir: I don't
feel responsible to have a
specific message

22:17.836 --> 22:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Jews of Copenhagen. And
I'm not certainly
that they in fact are especially
vulnerable

22:24.977 --> 22:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compared to many other people.
So, I don't
really have any comment to that
question.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: How can you say
they are
not vulnerable when...

22:30.349 --> 22:32.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIAS LAMRABET: I said I don't
have a comment
to that question.

22:32.151 --> 22:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Is that because
it's too
difficult for you?

22:33.819 --> 22:36.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIAS LAMRABET: No, not at all.
It's because
I think this interview is over.

22:36.822 --> 22:42.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: After the
synagogue attack,
Copenhagen's chief rabbi, Jair
Melchior, says

22:42.561 --> 22:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that dialogue with local Muslim
leaders has
intensified and improved, and
claims that

22:47.800 --> 22:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Denmark is safer for Jews than
France, where
thousands are leaving.

22:51.270 --> 22:54.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RABBI JAIR MELCHIOR, Copenhagen:
The majority
of the Jews leaving France, they
leave from

22:54.907 --> 23:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very specific neighborhoods.
They are usually
Jews who emigrated, or their
parents emigrated

23:01.614 --> 23:04.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to France. They emigrated to
live in a better
place.

23:04.283 --> 23:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if they live in a bad
neighborhood with
a very big percentage of Muslim
population,

23:09.989 --> 23:12.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then they can find themselves --
leave.

23:12.725 --> 23:17.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: After a machete
attack on
a Jewish teacher last year in
the southern

23:17.363 --> 23:22.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
French port of Marseille, the
city's chief
rabbi urged his community not to
go out in

23:22.201 --> 23:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public wearing Jewish symbols
such as the
kippa. He was quickly criticized
for what

23:27.373 --> 23:29.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was called his defeatist
attitude.

23:29.275 --> 23:35.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here in Scandinavia, such
discretion has
become essential, across the
bridge to Malmo,

23:35.781 --> 23:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whose large Muslim population
has expanded
drastically during Sweden's
short-lived open-door

23:40.919 --> 23:47.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugee policy. At the Jewish
kindergarten,
they're preparing traditional
Sabbath bread.

23:47.493 --> 23:52.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The numbers of children
attending have dropped
sharply since the Copenhagen
attacks. We weren't

23:52.431 --> 23:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allowed to show their faces for
security reasons.

23:55.501 --> 24:01.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the Jewish community
numbers just 500,
a quarter of its size a
generation ago. Its

24:01.840 --> 24:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
acting head is Freddy Gellberg.

24:03.742 --> 24:07.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FREDDY GELLBERG, Jewish
Confederation: It's
essential for the Jewish
community in this

24:07.846 --> 24:14.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city. If we don't have any kids,
no future.
Our, what should I as you know,
biggest enemy

24:14.420 --> 24:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is assimilation, in a way,
traditions and
culture, which are most
important for most

24:20.926 --> 24:25.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of us, maybe not the Jewish
religion.

24:25.998 --> 24:30.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FREDRIK SIERADZKI, Jewish
Information Center:
Why can't we dress the way we
want to dress

24:30.336 --> 24:32.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
without risking being attacked?

24:32.271 --> 24:36.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Fredrik
Sieradzki is running
a new information center that's
part of a

24:36.475 --> 24:41.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rear-guard action to give this
ever-shrinking
minority a more powerful voice.

24:41.313 --> 24:46.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDRIK SIERADZKI: Most Jews are
wary about
wearing symbols, Jewish symbols,
of course.

24:46.752 --> 24:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Young Jewish kids are very -- I
know, are
very careful not to walk around
with Star

24:54.093 --> 24:57.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of David or other kind of -- or
a yarmulke
on their head, a kippa.

24:57.996 --> 25:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: If anyone
understands the
situation, it's Siavosh
Derakhti, who's been

25:02.101 --> 25:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feted by President Obama for
urging Muslims
to resist anti-Semitism and to
integrate.

25:07.806 --> 25:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A young Swede of Iranian Muslim
heritage,
his peacemaking efforts have put
him on the

25:12.878 --> 25:14.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
same front line as the Jews.

25:14.780 --> 25:18.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIAVOSH DERAKHTI, Activist:
Every day, I get
the threats that I'm a traitor,
I'm a Jewish

25:19.017 --> 25:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lover, I'm a pig, I have to die,
they're going
to kill me.

25:22.187 --> 25:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm here in Sweden because my
family flew
from Iran and from the
dictatorship. What

25:26.458 --> 25:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we see in Malmo in Sweden, that
this democracy,
that we cannot live side by
side. And I want

25:32.531 --> 25:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make that happen.

25:34.466 --> 25:40.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Nima Gholam Ali
Pour's parents
fled from Iran in 1988 to avoid
his brother

25:40.205 --> 25:45.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being conscripted as a child
soldier. He belongs
to the right-wing Sweden
Democrat Party and

25:46.011 --> 25:50.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fears anti-Semitism will
increase as a result
of the country's open-door
policy.

25:50.115 --> 25:54.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIMA GHOLAM ALI POUR, Political
Scientist:
My worry is that if you see the
infrastructure

25:54.319 --> 26:00.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among some migrants here in
Sweden, if you
see the mosques, what they are
saying, what

26:00.592 --> 26:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of language they are using,
and if you
see the language that today
exists, the migrants

26:07.499 --> 26:14.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are coming, they are coming
to a society
where anti-Semitism is normal
among some migrants,

26:14.940 --> 26:16.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and it will strengthen.

26:16.975 --> 26:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDRIK SIERADZKI: We hope that
the influx
of new -- of immigrants here,
refugees, immigrants,

26:24.750 --> 26:33.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won't increase the tensions. And
we try to
work together with the city
council and with

26:33.258 --> 26:39.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other organizations, immigrant
organizations,
to bring down the tension.

26:39.665 --> 26:46.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Jewish
communities believe
that, if these children are to
have a future,

26:46.972 --> 26:50.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
newcomers must leave behind the
conflicts
of the Middle East and accept
the European

26:51.009 --> 26:54.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aspirations of tolerance and
peaceful coexistence.

26:54.813 --> 27:00.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But critics say that Sweden has
a poor integration
record. So, is that an
impossible challenge?

27:00.686 --> 27:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Scandinavia.

27:08.494 --> 27:18.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

27:18.604 --> 27:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
schools with
the slowest Internet in
Mississippi; how the

27:23.909 --> 27:30.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Black Panthers sparked a
revolution that continues
today; and why a chef says you
should never

27:30.582 --> 27:32.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pass up dessert.

27:32.484 --> 27:38.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, last week marked
five years since
longtime Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak

27:38.690 --> 27:43.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was removed from power after the
so-called
18 days of revolution.

27:43.795 --> 27:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the path forward has been
tumultuous.
Our coverage of these 5 Years On
concludes

27:49.001 --> 27:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a conversation with a man
who's often
called the Jon Stewart of Egypt.

27:54.139 --> 27:55.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our story.

27:56.008 --> 28:01.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As revolution
swept through
Egypt in 2011, Bassem Youssef
and several

28:01.747 --> 28:07.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friends started a political
satire show on
YouTube broadcast from his
laundry room.

28:07.986 --> 28:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nine episodes and five million
views later,
Youssef was offered a weekly
show on an Egyptian

28:13.358 --> 28:19.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television network. With his
caustic wit and
ironic takedowns, he lampooned
the successive

28:19.498 --> 28:26.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
government of the Muslim
Brotherhood's Mohammed
Morsi and the military's Abdel
Fattah El-Sisi.

28:26.271 --> 28:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Honors and trouble followed. In
2013, he recognized
as one of "TIME" magazine's 100
most influential

28:33.579 --> 28:39.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people and received a Press
Freedom Award
by the Committee to Protect
Journalists. But

28:39.384 --> 28:44.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that same year, he was
investigated and interrogated
by the Morsi government on
charges of insulting

28:44.823 --> 28:46.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the president.

28:46.692 --> 28:50.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The military government that
deposed Morsi
in a coup was no more friendlier
to Youssef's

28:50.762 --> 28:57.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brand of political humor. His
show was canceled
in 2014 and he left Egypt.

28:57.336 --> 29:02.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Youssef now lives in Dubai. I
reached him
on a recent visit to this
country. And when

29:02.107 --> 29:07.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I asked him how he would
describe the political
situation in Egypt today, he
began in full

29:07.679 --> 29:09.414 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
satirical mode.

29:09.514 --> 29:12.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BASSEM YOUSSEF, Egyptian
Humorist: Oh, it's
perfect. It's so democratic. We
absolutely

29:12.451 --> 29:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have no problem. Political
satire shows like
mine are still going on, on the
air. There

29:19.291 --> 29:24.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is absolutely no crackdown on
freedom of speech.
Everything is lovey-dovey and
it's beautiful.

29:24.696 --> 29:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And everything
you just said
is completely untrue, right?

29:28.400 --> 29:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I -- your words,
not mine.
Everything is -- it's perfect.

29:32.638 --> 29:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, five years
later, do you
think that people wonder -- do
you yourself

29:36.742 --> 29:41.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wonder what happened or even
whether it was
all worth it?

29:41.146 --> 29:43.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Well, here's the
thing.

29:43.148 --> 29:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in a day and age of
instant gratification
and instant retweets and shares
and likes,

29:51.223 --> 29:55.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people think that things come
easily. But
they don't. If you look at
revolutions and

29:56.061 --> 30:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change all over history and
other parts of
the world, change didn't come in
18 days,

30:01.466 --> 30:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which we are -- we and the rest
of the world
was basically naive, think that
we can actually

30:05.971 --> 30:08.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get rid of a dictatorship in 18
days.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A revolution is not an event.
It's a process.
And it takes its time.

30:11.977 --> 30:16.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In your own work,
you came
up against two very powerful
forces in Egyptian

30:16.581 --> 30:18.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life, right, religion and the
military.

30:18.950 --> 30:27.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Well, religion
and nationalism
is basically flip sides of the
same coin.

30:27.926 --> 30:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are stuff that are always
used in order
to push back on the dissent and
opposition

30:33.498 --> 30:38.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and criticism. And I was accused
during the
Muslim Brotherhood of being an
infidel, of

30:38.904 --> 30:45.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone who doesn't like Islam,
or who have
some sort of a -- I want to
insult religion.

30:45.444 --> 30:51.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, afterwards, I was accused
of insulting
the army, insulting the
military.

30:51.316 --> 30:57.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these are the stuff that is
extremely
sensitive. And people wouldn't
even go into

30:57.723 --> 31:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a discussion of what I actually
said and they
would assume that I actually
meant to insult

31:02.794 --> 31:04.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
religion or insult the army.

31:04.696 --> 31:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you were
hugely popular.
You were reaching a lot of
people. Yet you

31:08.400 --> 31:13.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still felt you had to stop and
leave the country,
out of fear for yourself and
your family?

31:13.138 --> 31:16.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Well, at the end
of the day,
when you have -- you need a
window.

31:16.942 --> 31:23.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that window or the windows,
broadcast
channels and networks, at the
end of the day,

31:23.548 --> 31:29.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are also under a lot of
pressure. And
you could continue -- you cannot
continue

31:29.788 --> 31:32.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the pressure being
overwhelming on everybody.

31:32.491 --> 31:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why I chose -- I opted
for the choice
of safety for me and my family
and people

31:40.165 --> 31:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around me, because even --
sometimes, they
don't even come and touch you.
They -- some

31:44.169 --> 31:49.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other people that will be hurt
because of
what you say. People are not
even related

31:49.708 --> 31:54.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the show, but, like, related
to you. So,
I need to think on the bigger
picture.

31:54.780 --> 31:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Looking back,
what role did
satire play, and what role might
it still

31:59.718 --> 32:01.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
play in Egypt?

32:01.186 --> 32:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Well, satire
will continue
to exist after the show.

32:05.524 --> 32:12.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't invent satire. I didn't
come up with
it. And it will continue to be a
very powerful

32:12.764 --> 32:19.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tool to disrupt political taboos
and social
taboos and religious taboos,
because those

32:19.604 --> 32:26.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
taboos are always used to
control and to curb
people's way of creativity and
thinking, by

32:26.945 --> 32:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making them feel guilty because
they want
to make a change.

32:31.817 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Satire liberates you from all of
these restrictions.
And it's still used by young
people on the

32:39.591 --> 32:43.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Internet and online. And it will
not stop.

32:43.662 --> 32:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about the
limits of satire?
Have you come to think that
people perhaps

32:47.866 --> 32:51.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expect too much of it and its
ability to effect
change?

32:52.003 --> 32:53.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Yes.

32:53.905 --> 32:57.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's true in all parts
of the world,
but, at the end of the day, a
satirist or

32:57.375 --> 33:02.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a comedian only has his voice.
We just bring
it up to the people for
discussion. And if

33:02.113 --> 33:06.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people don't make a change, you
cannot continue
to operate in a vacuum.

33:06.985 --> 33:13.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is -- and so that's why
people have this
sort of slacktivism, not
activism even. They're

33:14.025 --> 33:18.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just, like, protected by a --
behind their
keyboards and by their screens.
And they think

33:18.897 --> 33:21.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that, like, laughing at
something will solve
things.

33:21.967 --> 33:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They need to move and do the
change themselves.
At the end of the day, a
satirist or a comedian

33:26.872 --> 33:28.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has a very, very limited role.

33:28.506 --> 33:32.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you, is it
still possible
to live and work in Egypt now?

33:32.244 --> 33:37.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BASSEM YOUSSEF: I am not there
right now.
And that is my answer.

33:37.382 --> 33:40.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Bassem Youssef,
thank you so
much.

33:40.285 --> 33:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BASSEM YOUSSEF: Thank you very
much.

33:46.024 --> 33:58.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to the digital
divide in public
education.

33:58.536 --> 34:04.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Nearly 10 percent of all
students attend rural
schools, where the simple act of
going online

34:04.809 --> 34:07.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can hamper their ability to
learn.

34:07.445 --> 34:12.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Education Week, which partners
with the "NewsHour,"
visited schools in Mississippi
with the slowest

34:12.817 --> 34:14.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Internet in the state.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent John
Tulenko reports
on the problem, and what's being
done to fix

34:18.957 --> 34:24.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, part of our weekly education
coverage
we call Making the Grade.

34:24.496 --> 34:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Calhoun County in
Northeast
Mississippi covers nearly 600
care miles,

34:31.670 --> 34:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most of it farmland dotted by a
few small
downs like Vardaman.

34:35.874 --> 34:45.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
C.J. WEDDLE, Student: Vardaman
is about as
small-town country as it gets.
And everybody

34:45.617 --> 34:47.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
knows everybody. And most
everybody is kin
to everybody.

34:47.919 --> 34:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: This is sweet
potato country,
home to 17-year-old Clemi Jean
(ph) Weddle,

34:53.959 --> 34:55.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who goes by C.J.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
C.J. WEDDLE: If you count the
work I have
put in this summer, I would be a
fifth-generation

34:59.030 --> 35:00.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sweet potato farmer.

35:00.932 --> 35:06.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: C.J. is doing well
in high school
and she's planning ahead.

35:06.137 --> 35:12.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
C.J. WEDDLE: I see myself
graduating from
a four-year college and a degree
I want where

35:12.177 --> 35:18.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I can have multiple job
opportunities and
not be confined to one.

35:18.383 --> 35:25.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: But standing
between C.J. and
her college dreams is a major
problem, the

35:25.323 --> 35:27.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Internet at her school.

35:27.192 --> 35:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
C.J. WEDDLE: The Internet is
very contrary
at Vardaman High School. You
have good, you

35:33.331 --> 35:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have bad days, but at Vardaman,
you have more
bad than good.

35:36.668 --> 35:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Schools here have
the slowest
Internet service in all of
Mississippi.

35:40.472 --> 35:45.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
C.J. WEDDLE: History classes are
limited to
books and worksheets. Well, you
don't do research

35:45.243 --> 35:52.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on significant figures in
history or significant
figures the government now, and
that -- I

35:52.650 --> 35:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that's really going to
hurt us later.
You know, why be limited to
that, when there's

35:58.390 --> 36:02.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a whole world at your fingertips
or potentially
could be?

36:02.360 --> 36:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: The Internet here
is slow because
it comes via old copper wires
running for

36:08.666 --> 36:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
miles underground. Even though
high-speed
cables have been laid by a phone
company on

36:15.173 --> 36:21.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one side of the district, on the
other side,
a second company has said
upgrading its service

36:21.279 --> 36:25.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is too expensive.

36:25.517 --> 36:30.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without those new cables, there
is no high-speed
Internet for schools and
students like Pam

36:30.121 --> 36:32.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Odom's sixth graders.

36:32.123 --> 36:36.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM ODOM, Teacher: These are
rural children.
Most of them have never been
outside Mississippi.

36:36.361 --> 36:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a large portion of them
that have
never been out of a 60-mile
radius of this

36:41.399 --> 36:48.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
town. And if our technology is
slow, I can't
expose them to anything.

36:48.206 --> 36:53.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Meanwhile, the
rest of the state
is racing ahead.

36:53.545 --> 36:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMANDA REISER, Teacher: Make
sure you have
all that copied down.

36:56.481 --> 37:01.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Amanda Reiser
teaches sixth
grade in Oxford, Mississippi, a
more affluent

37:01.719 --> 37:04.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
college town just 30 minutes
away.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How hard is it for you to go
online?

37:06.791 --> 37:10.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA REISER: It's not hard at
all. They
can get online and do research
anytime throughout

37:10.929 --> 37:14.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the day really with any teacher
has a cart
or a computer is available.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: And that's just
the start.

37:16.468 --> 37:20.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA REISER: Our curriculum is
100 percent
online, so quizzes, homework and
tests are

37:21.072 --> 37:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all completed online. We can add
enrichment
lessons or we can have an
intervention lesson

37:26.377 --> 37:32.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or we can add more practice on a
certain topic
or a certain lesson and kind of
make sure

37:32.117 --> 37:35.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they understand those
fundamental basics before
we move on.

37:35.787 --> 37:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Looking around, it
suddenly
hit us. Something was missing.

37:39.224 --> 37:41.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you have any books in this
room?

37:41.292 --> 37:43.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMANDA REISER: I do have some
books, six books
available.

37:43.761 --> 37:45.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN TULENKO: Where?

37:45.130 --> 37:47.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

JOHN TULENKO: Back in Calhoun
County, they're
still using textbooks every day.

37:55.406 --> 38:00.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while computers and Internet
access are
no guarantee of a better
education, without

38:00.445 --> 38:07.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them, students are at an unfair
disadvantage.
It's a problem in rural
districts across the

38:07.252 --> 38:11.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
country. Some 20 percent
currently lack access
to high-speed fiber.

38:11.890 --> 38:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But help could come from new
changes to the
$4 billion federal E-Rate
program, which helps

38:18.530 --> 38:20.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
schools pay for Internet
service.

38:20.398 --> 38:24.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM WHEELER, Chairman, Federal
Communications
Commission: What we did was, we
said, OK,

38:24.869 --> 38:30.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
schools, if you're not being
provided service
or not being provided service at
a reasonable

38:31.042 --> 38:36.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate by your local provider, you
can build
it yourself.

38:36.548 --> 38:41.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Tom Wheeler, who
heads the Federal
Communications Commission, led
an effort to

38:41.119 --> 38:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overhaul the E-Rate program, in
part by giving
districts like Calhoun County
the option to

38:46.591 --> 38:51.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use federal funds to build fiber
networks
of their own, pressuring local
telecoms to

38:51.496 --> 38:53.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offer better deals.

38:53.398 --> 38:56.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TOM WHEELER: School
administrators say, I'm
not going to put up with it
anymore, that

38:57.001 --> 39:01.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm being told it's too
expensive, or I'm
being told it can't be built.
But you actually

39:01.606 --> 39:07.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can take the situation, and the
SEC will help
you take that situation in your
hand by funding

39:07.845 --> 39:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it, that's a game-changer.

39:09.747 --> 39:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: Recently, Calhoun
County became
the test case, one of the first
districts

39:15.520 --> 39:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to seek federal funds to build a
new fiber
network that included the option
of a build-out

39:20.658 --> 39:22.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of its own.

39:22.126 --> 39:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mike Moore is superintendent of
schools.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE MOORE, Superintendent,
Calhoun County
Schools: All of these providers
and all start

39:26.598 --> 39:31.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
popping up and saying, well,
maybe we can
do this, and maybe we can do
that. But I don't

39:31.803 --> 39:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think -- until we talked about
really building
our own line and putting the
bids out, I don't

39:36.507 --> 39:38.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really think they were serious.

39:38.376 --> 39:42.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: As it has turned
out, schools
here won't have to build their
own network.

39:42.213 --> 39:48.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By inviting outside companies to
bid on the
job or come in with their own
fiber, the district

39:48.253 --> 39:53.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was able to secure a more
attractive contract
from its local providers to
complete the job.

39:53.691 --> 39:59.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it will take some time,
maybe a year,
hopefully not too late for C.J.
Weddle, who

39:59.964 --> 40:01.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will be a senior.

40:01.866 --> 40:05.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
C.J. WEDDLE: I'm a very
competitive person.
I'm not a sore loser, but I
don't like to

40:05.403 --> 40:06.771 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lose.

40:06.871 --> 40:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN TULENKO: No one said fixing
this problem
was going to be easy.

similar problems
and decided to outfit its school

41:01.626 --> 41:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight on PBS stations. It
traces the group's
origins and influence on U.S.
politics and

41:08.266 --> 41:10.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

MAN: Black Panthers were
absolutely unique.

41:13.404 --> 41:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Police jump on you, beat
you up. This
is what we were going through on
a daily basis.

41:18.943 --> 41:21.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

not going
to turn the other cheek.

41:21.579 --> 41:25.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

going to drive you pigs out.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We don't hate those guys
because of their
color. We hate oppression.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: We wanted the entire
community to follow.

back with his
conversation with the film's
award-winning

41:36.127 --> 41:37.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
director, Stanley Nelson.

41:37.962 --> 41:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Stanley Nelson,
welcome to
you.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON, Director, "The
Black Panthers:
Vanguard of the Revolution":
Thank you.

41:41.866 --> 41:47.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did this begin
for you from
a sense that the Black Panthers
were misunderstood,

41:47.638 --> 41:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not well-remembered, forgotten
altogether?
What's the beginning?

41:50.475 --> 41:52.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: I think it was
that they were
misunderstood.

41:53.010 --> 41:57.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that the Panthers are
well-remembered,
but I think that people don't
understand who

41:58.082 --> 42:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Panthers were and don't
understand how
the Panthers were thought of
back then in

42:04.522 --> 42:07.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the '60s. So, I thought that it
was really
ripe for a new telling.

42:07.692 --> 42:12.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, given the
controversy
back then to this day, right,
and it's such

42:12.764 --> 42:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of -- there's a lot of
history to get
your arms around. How did you --
how much

42:16.567 --> 42:18.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
did you think you could tell?

42:18.436 --> 42:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: You know, I
think it started
out as a three-hour project, and
we realized

42:22.573 --> 42:24.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that two hours was about the
limit.

42:25.042 --> 42:30.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, we knew that we
couldn't tell
every single thing, and we knew
that we had

42:30.114 --> 42:35.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to stop and start somewhere, so
the film really
begins with the beginning of the
Panthers

42:35.319 --> 42:39.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 1966 and goes kind of through
their height,
their heyday, and ends in 1973.

42:40.057 --> 42:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And misunderstood
in the sense
that -- which part did you feel
you most needed

42:46.364 --> 42:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to -- I don't know if correct is
the right
word.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: I think the
Panthers are really
interesting because they're both
demonized

42:53.738 --> 42:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they're mythologized at the
same time.

42:57.041 --> 43:03.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that both groups get
it wrong.
And I think that, a lot of
times, it's oversimplified,

43:03.247 --> 43:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were bad or they were
great. And there's
a lot of nuance to the Panthers'
story, and

43:08.386 --> 43:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we wanted to really get that out
in this film.

43:10.288 --> 43:13.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And so you're
showing -- you're
certainly showing the social
programs that

43:13.791 --> 43:17.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were involved in, but at
the same time,
of course, it begins with guns,
with young

43:17.895 --> 43:20.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
black men and women in the
streets of Oakland.

43:20.331 --> 43:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: Well, it began
as a way of,
as the Panthers would have put
it, to kind

43:25.703 --> 43:28.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of defend the community against
the brutality
of the police.

43:28.940 --> 43:34.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that point, the Oakland
Police Department
was notoriously brutal. And the
Panthers,

43:34.779 --> 43:38.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was a quirk in the law, an
open-carry
law in California that kind of
nobody knew

43:38.749 --> 43:42.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it, but it said that you
could carry
a loaded weapon as long as you
carried it

43:42.920 --> 43:44.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out in the open.

43:44.822 --> 43:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Panthers said, OK, well,
we will police
the police. We will follow the
police and,

43:48.192 --> 43:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they put it, make sure that
no brutality
occurs when the police stop
somebody.

43:52.630 --> 43:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, I have
a -- we have
a short clip I want to show.
This is a little

43:56.400 --> 44:00.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- catching a little bit of the
spirit of
the times. Right? OK. Let's take
a look at

44:00.538 --> 44:01.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

44:01.606 --> 44:04.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STANLEY NELSON: OK.

44:04.909 --> 44:21.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: This brother here,
myself, all of us
were born with our hair like
this, and we

44:21.292 --> 44:23.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just wear it like this. The
reason for it,
you might say, is like a new
awareness among

44:23.594 --> 44:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black people that their own
natural appearance,
physical appearance, is
beautiful. Black people

44:29.967 --> 44:42.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are aware now. They're proud of
it. It's pleasing
to them. Isn't it beautiful? All
right.

44:42.346 --> 44:44.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:44.649 --> 44:58.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: You're talking about
people who were
teenagers 17, 18, 19, 20. That's
the bulk

44:58.429 --> 45:03.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Panthers are teenagers.
So the fact
that we were so young and the
fact that this

45:03.534 --> 45:09.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hadn't happened before, I'm not
certain that
we recognized how startling it
looked to other

45:09.740 --> 45:10.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

45:10.741 --> 45:12.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How startling it
looked.

45:12.577 --> 45:17.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you cannot tell the
story of the Black
Panthers without reminding us of
the feel

45:17.882 --> 45:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the time, right, through the
music, through
the pictures and all.

45:21.018 --> 45:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: Yes, I think
that that was
really important to us making
the film, is

45:24.055 --> 45:29.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you had to understand the
times a little
bit. We had to get you back
there to understand

45:29.894 --> 45:33.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Panthers at all, or else it
doesn't make
any sense.

45:33.297 --> 45:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that one of the
things that we
were able to use was music, you
know, the

45:37.435 --> 45:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
music of the times, the music
where the songs
are, "Am I Black Enough For You"
or "All Power

45:43.708 --> 45:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the People." You know, those
-- that was
the music and that kind of sets
a base, I

45:48.646 --> 45:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think, for what comes later in
the film.

45:52.016 --> 45:57.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, inevitably,
you have to
tell the storm that they cause,
the opposition,

45:57.955 --> 46:02.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the aggression, notably most of
all from the
FBI and J. Edgar Hoover.

46:03.094 --> 46:05.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: Yes, I mean, I
think that's
really important.

46:05.730 --> 46:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was always this idea, you
hear rumors
about the FBI setting out to
destroy the Panthers.

46:11.769 --> 46:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we were able to obtain FBI
memos and we
used J. Edgar Hoover's own words
where he

46:16.841 --> 46:23.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says very clearly that -- he
tells his agents,
do anything you can to destroy
the Panthers.

46:23.614 --> 46:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just don't let it get back that
it's the FBI
doing it. These are memos that
we use in the

46:29.120 --> 46:31.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
film.

46:31.122 --> 46:33.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, of course,
the personalities
within the party, the
leadership, right, Huey

46:34.058 --> 46:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Newton, Bobby Seale, Eldridge
Cleaver, clashing
almost the get-go.

46:39.964 --> 46:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: Yes, these were
volatile personalities.

46:42.733 --> 46:49.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we show that. I
think the film
is warts and all. It's kind of a
sober, I

46:49.373 --> 46:55.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope, assessment of the Black
Panther Party,
of these personalities that are
clashing,

46:55.413 --> 47:01.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also the FBI is setting them
against each
other. They're writing letters,
you know,

47:01.485 --> 47:07.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretending to be Huey Newton
writing to Eldridge,
and writing letters that are
supposedly Eldridge

47:07.191 --> 47:10.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
writing to Huey, and kind of
spurring this
conflict on.

47:11.062 --> 47:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The times, there
are some things
about that, I look at and it
feels very much

47:17.034 --> 47:18.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
set in your time.

47:18.969 --> 47:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, of course, there are
other things,
as you are watching the film,
you can't help

47:21.539 --> 47:23.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but think not that much has
changed. Right?

47:23.874 --> 47:25.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: Right. Right.

47:25.710 --> 47:29.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is what makes
the film so
relevant. The Panthers started
because of

47:29.814 --> 47:36.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police brutality. We're dealing
with that
over and over again today. The
Panthers have

47:36.387 --> 47:41.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a 10-point program where they
call for certain
changes, you know, better
education, better

47:41.459 --> 47:46.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care, those kind of
things. You know,
we're still fighting for those
in the African-American

47:46.363 --> 47:48.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

47:48.299 --> 47:50.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think there is this
resonance, you know
to, what's happening today. And
that's what

47:50.634 --> 47:55.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
makes the story in some ways
really important,
you know, because it's not -- it
doesn't exist

47:55.439 --> 48:00.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only in this historical bubble.
It's not this
thing that you can say, oh, that
was interesting

48:00.144 --> 48:04.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back then. But it has real
relevance to what's
happening today. And I think
that's what we

48:04.315 --> 48:06.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wanted the film to talk about
and to do.

48:06.751 --> 48:10.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask just
you, finally,
about yourself, thinking about
this film in

48:10.721 --> 48:14.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the context of all the films you
have made.
And I have seen many of them.

48:14.725 --> 48:21.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, is it -- do you see it as a
kind of continuation
of a mission that you're on in
filmmaking?

48:21.398 --> 48:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what is that mission?

48:22.833 --> 48:25.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: Well, I'm not --
hopefully,
I'm not on a mission.

48:25.736 --> 48:31.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know -- so, I guess,
sometimes, I
am. I think there is this
continuity. The

48:32.076 --> 48:38.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
film that we did right before
this, "Freedom
Summer," you know, it ends in
1964 with Stokely

48:38.415 --> 48:41.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carmichael yelling, you know,
"Black power,
black power, black power."

48:41.485 --> 48:43.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, leading
right to this
next one.

48:43.654 --> 48:48.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: And this film
starts again
almost with the same clip of
Stokely yelling

48:49.059 --> 48:50.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Black power, black power, black
power."

48:50.961 --> 48:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, sometimes, people
want to look
at the Black Panthers and the
Black Panther

48:56.901 --> 49:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
movement as kind of outside the
civil rights
movement. I think that it was
part of the

49:01.939 --> 49:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civil rights movement. And I
think that whether
you agree with them or not, I
think that it's

49:07.778 --> 49:12.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time for a reassessment of the
Panthers, and
to look at them in a new light.

49:12.817 --> 49:16.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
film is "The
Black Panthers: Vanguard of the
Revolution."

49:16.253 --> 49:18.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Stanley Nelson, thanks so much.

49:18.522 --> 49:26.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STANLEY NELSON: Thank you so
much.

49:26.897 --> 49:32.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight, an
ode to desserts.

49:32.770 --> 49:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Daniel Boulud is a James Beard
Award-winning
chef with restaurants around the
world. Tonight,

49:38.309 --> 49:47.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he celebrates a meal's sweet
spot, dessert,
and explains why we should never
go without.

49:47.484 --> 50:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BOULUD, Chef: A meal is a
crescendo.
And the crescendo wouldn't be
complete without

50:02.800 --> 50:04.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the dessert.

50:04.702 --> 50:11.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last impression I think you
want to leave,
a long lingering, sort of,
dreamy feel of

50:11.475 --> 50:17.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the end of a meal. And I think
dessert, it
energizes you, the sugar. I
think you get

50:17.815 --> 50:19.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a little bit of the sugar rush.

50:19.149 --> 50:21.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The best part of it is
you soak it
in a lot of rum.

50:21.552 --> 50:24.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL BOULUD: That's Ghaya, our
pastry chef.

50:24.722 --> 50:29.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, right now, we're doing a
baba au rhum.
It's an old classic dessert
where it's maybe

50:29.960 --> 50:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not a children-driven dessert,
but, you know,
once you start to grow up, you
love baba au

50:35.933 --> 50:40.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rhum because that's the only
chance you have
to have a little bit of alcohol
in your dessert.

50:40.237 --> 50:46.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for us, we take this classic
idea of the
baba au rhum, but we make a
delicate baba,

50:46.810 --> 50:55.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is soaked in an aged white
rum, 3-years-old
white rum with vanilla. And then
we have pistachio,

50:55.219 --> 50:58.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a crust of pistachio on top.

50:58.155 --> 51:04.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we serve that with a
pistachio whip cream,
and the crunch of the little
pistachio, and

51:04.328 --> 51:11.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then on the side, also, is a
salad of citrus,
so there's grapefruit, there is
orange, there

51:11.502 --> 51:15.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a little bit of kumquat
confit in sugar
and all that.

51:15.339 --> 51:21.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the citrus is there to sort
of play with
the rum, play with the baba,
cool off a little

51:21.512 --> 51:28.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit the rum. The cream is there
to give richness
to either the baba or the
citrus. And the

51:29.019 --> 51:36.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sweet together, it's still a
very light, refreshing
dessert, and yet a very classic
French baba

51:36.226 --> 51:38.629 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
au rhum.

51:38.729 --> 51:47.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Dessert is very artistic.
Dessert is sort
of an expression of art in a
very natural

51:47.838 --> 51:55.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
way and in a very sort of
decadent way as
well. In cooking, yes, it's a
little bit more

51:55.145 --> 52:01.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like jazz, I mean, where you can
jam a little
bit. You can take -- you can be
spontaneous.

52:01.685 --> 52:10.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With pastry, it, I think, goes a
little bit
more like classical music. The
repertoire

52:10.227 --> 52:18.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is set, and it's a question of
just creating
the layers of intensity. The
texture, we respect

52:18.168 --> 52:23.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the taste. I don't think dessert
is really
the problem in a diet of people.

52:23.841 --> 52:28.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to eat dessert with
moderation, but
I think it's important to
continue to keep

52:28.746 --> 52:35.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yourself and your soul happy
with a bit of
sweetness. And I'm having
chocolate every

52:35.686 --> 52:43.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night at home. I have always bar
of chocolate.
And I break a little piece, and
I suck on

52:43.260 --> 52:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slowly and feel like, ah that's
so good. OK,
that chocolate, maybe we should
do something

52:49.533 --> 52:52.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with it tomorrow.

52:52.569 --> 53:07.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
