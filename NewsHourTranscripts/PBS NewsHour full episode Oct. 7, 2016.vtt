JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.074 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
death toll
in Haiti from Hurricane Matthew
soars and

00:11.812 --> 00:17.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the storm thrashes Florida's
East Coast, knocking
out power for half-a-million
people.

00:17.951 --> 00:23.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: The Obama administration
accuses the
Russian government of hacking
the Democratic

00:23.323 --> 00:26.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Committee and other
political organizations.

00:26.860 --> 00:30.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then: returning home after ISIS.

00:30.664 --> 00:36.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqis take back Fallujah, only
to find an
abandoned city gutted by two
years of war.

00:36.336 --> 00:41.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: In order to take
back Fallujah
city, the Iraqi military had to
completely

00:41.408 --> 00:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
empty the city, and the fighting
that happened
afterwards destroyed everything
that the eye

00:47.214 --> 00:49.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can see.

00:49.082 --> 00:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And while the
candidates prepare
for the second presidential
debate, we take

00:52.920 --> 00:57.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on this week in politics with
Mark Shields
and Michael Gerson.

00:57.257 --> 01:04.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.298 --> 01:07.134 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:07.167 --> 01:17.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been a day
to hunker down
along the Atlantic shores of
Florida.

01:17.477 --> 01:22.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hurricane Matthew plowed north
with winds
of 110 miles an hour, and there
were late

01:22.449 --> 01:26.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reports of heavy damage in the
state's northeastern
corner.

01:26.486 --> 01:32.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the storm's wake, the tragedy
in Haiti
only deepened, with more than
800 people dead.

01:32.826 --> 01:37.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan is in New
Smyrna Beach, Florida,
and he begins our coverage.

01:37.097 --> 01:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Three days
after the hurricane
struck Haiti, the water is
receding, and survivors

01:42.636 --> 01:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are finding bodies by the
hundreds.

01:44.438 --> 01:48.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ingrid Arnesen is a freelance
journalist who's
been out for a first-hand look.

01:48.375 --> 01:52.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INGRID ARNESEN, Freelance
Journalist: The
south is in a catastrophic
situation.

01:52.679 --> 01:58.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hurricane flattened the two
main cities,
destroyed the main roads
connecting each three

01:58.618 --> 02:02.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
departments, pretty much a third
of Haiti,
destroyed bridges.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, reaching the south is
impossible

02:05.025 --> 02:09.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The death toll
is expected
to rise sharply as teams enter
remote areas

02:09.196 --> 02:11.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the hard-hit southwestern
peninsula.

02:11.665 --> 02:16.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, one official
working in mountainous
Beaumont, on the outskirts of
Jeremie, says

02:16.870 --> 02:22.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his group found more than 80
bodies that had
not yet been recorded by the
government.

02:22.142 --> 02:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The storm blasted Haiti with
winds of 145
miles an hour and several feet
of rain, and

02:28.315 --> 02:32.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
left utter devastation in one of
the world's
poorest countries.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
have big problems
here.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are almost no houses left
standing.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have food, nor a
hospital to get
health care.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
have nothing.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The hurricane took shirts from
our backs.

02:43.530 --> 02:48.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tens of
thousands are now
homeless, and their crops have
been destroyed.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But relief efforts are gearing
up.

02:50.837 --> 02:55.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. military expects to
deliver food
and water to hard-hit areas.

02:55.242 --> 02:58.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and international aid groups are
appealing
for donations.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Margaret Traub is with the
International Medical
Corps.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET TRAUB, International
Medical Corps:
Right now, I would say the
Haitian people

03:01.915 --> 03:03.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need food, shelter, clean water,
some medical
supplies.

03:03.717 --> 03:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are on Ile-a-Vache, which is
an island
about a 45-minute boat ride from
Les Cayes.

03:14.061 --> 03:27.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In one of the hospitals where
they reported
some cholera patients, they
didn't have cleaning

03:27.607 --> 03:31.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supplies, they didn't have
antibiotics.

03:31.411 --> 03:35.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're very worried about,
while people
may have survived the storm,
they're going

03:35.682 --> 03:37.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to not survive the disease.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
people along
Florida's Atlantic Coast spent
this day waiting

03:38.218 --> 03:39.953 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out Matthew.

03:39.986 --> 03:44.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The eye of the storm stayed just
off shore,
and may have spared the state a
catastrophic

03:44.224 --> 03:45.625 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
blow.

03:45.659 --> 03:48.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Rick Scott repeatedly
made clear
the danger had not passed.

03:48.595 --> 03:49.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:49.763 --> 03:50.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK SCOTT (R), Florida: There's
no victory
lap here.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The victory lap is when the
storm leaves our
state.

03:54.134 --> 03:57.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope it doesn't hit
Georgia, South and
North Carolina.

03:57.871 --> 04:02.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The city of
Jacksonville
may get the worst of it, as the
hurricane

04:02.075 --> 04:03.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
passes this evening.

04:03.944 --> 04:08.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From there, it will push north
along Georgia
and the Carolinas, keeping
hundreds of miles

04:08.615 --> 04:13.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of coastline under threat for 15
inches of
rain and a nine-foot storm
surge.

04:13.987 --> 04:18.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The governors of South Carolina
and Georgia
warned today that time is
running out.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

04:20.127 --> 04:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY (R), South Carolina:
This is the
last time you will see me before
we are actually

04:23.797 --> 04:24.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in storm mode.

04:25.031 --> 04:25.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, please evacuate.

04:26.032 --> 04:27.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

04:27.801 --> 04:31.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN DEAL (R), Georgia:
There's nothing
certain about this other than
the danger,

04:31.638 --> 04:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we should pay due heed to
the warnings
that have been given.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Washington,
President
Obama met with the head of the
Federal Emergency

04:38.845 --> 04:41.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Management Agency, and repeated
his own warning.

04:41.348 --> 04:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The potential for storm surge,
flooding, loss

04:45.519 --> 04:51.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of life and severe property
damage continues
to exist, and people continue to
need to continue

04:52.025 --> 04:58.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to follow the instructions of
their local
officials over the course of the
next 24,

04:58.665 --> 05:00.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
48, 72 hours.

05:00.567 --> 05:04.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thousands
along the Florida
coast did heed those warnings
from authorities

05:04.137 --> 05:06.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to evacuate and move further
inland.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They found themselves in places
like Orlando
in Central Florida.

05:10.710 --> 05:14.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For them, today was a long day
of watching
and waiting.

05:14.214 --> 05:18.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gloria and David Floyd live in
Satellite Beach,
southeast of Orlando.

05:18.785 --> 05:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their home and yard took some
damage, but
they said it could have been
much worse.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even so, they headed to a hotel
on higher
land.

05:25.592 --> 05:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FLOYD, Florida: Once it
got to be a
Category 4, I knew that it could
get really

05:29.629 --> 05:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ugly, and that is when I knew
that I decided
I had better leave.

05:31.831 --> 05:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The McChrystal
family waited
out the storm at the same hotel.

05:34.734 --> 05:36.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LIZ MCCHRYSTAL, Florida: I'm a
little nervous.

05:36.536 --> 05:41.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think today will be a long
day, until we
can get back tomorrow and see
what -- you

05:41.174 --> 05:42.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
know, what the results are.

05:42.709 --> 05:46.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But most likely, a lot of people
in the neighborhoods
local are lucky so far.

05:46.746 --> 05:49.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I'm going to feed off the
good luck.

05:49.082 --> 05:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Others may not
be so lucky,
and there's economic disruption
as well.

05:53.787 --> 05:58.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coastal businesses and tourism
are shut down,
and airlines have canceled
thousands of flights

05:58.291 --> 06:00.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through tomorrow.

06:00.126 --> 06:06.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The entire last half-hour on the
drive out
to New Smyrna Beach here in
Florida, the power

06:06.066 --> 06:09.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been out, businesses have
been shut down,
and people are slowly starting
to creep back

06:09.502 --> 06:13.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, trying to figure out how
they are going
to try to get things back to
normal, and that's

06:13.073 --> 06:14.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not even the worst of it.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The northeast corner of Florida
has gotten
it much worse -- Judy.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hari, tell us
more about what
you have seen.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think you started in Orlando.

06:22.148 --> 06:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been making your way to
where you
are now, in New Smyrna Beach.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tell us about what you have
seen.

06:28.021 --> 06:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, just a
little while
ago, we were at kind of one of
the central

06:32.359 --> 06:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
park areas in New Smyrna.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Huge trees.

06:35.795 --> 06:40.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A woman that was passing by
said, look, these
trees take 100 years to grow,
100 years to

06:40.867 --> 06:45.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
die, and this is an just
unbelievable sight
just to see so many trees down
all over the

06:45.305 --> 06:46.606 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a boatyard or a drydock
where people
keep their boats.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The roofs have been peeled off.

06:50.543 --> 06:53.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Boats have been kind of tossed
around inside
it as if they were toys.

06:53.713 --> 06:58.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The force of this hurricane, it
depends on
which house you look at, which
street you

06:58.718 --> 07:02.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look down, whether there is
debris, whether
there is walls and fences that
have been pulled

07:02.989 --> 07:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down, whether there is water
that is slowly
inundating around these
low-lying areas.

07:06.926 --> 07:11.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hari, I think a
lot of people
don't appreciate what storm
surge means, but

07:11.731 --> 07:15.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the water is lethal in a storm
like this.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's right.

07:17.570 --> 07:23.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In St. Augustine and further
north here in
Florida and also in Savannah,
Georgia, and

07:23.443 --> 07:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charleston, the real big concern
is what a
two-foot or an eight-foot storm
surge could

07:29.382 --> 07:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do, because so many of these
cities are low-lying.

07:32.218 --> 07:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these storm surges just
really push.

07:34.688 --> 07:38.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost imagine like a wave
taking that last
bit of water right onto land.

07:38.825 --> 07:43.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Hari, from
what you can
tell, most of the people along
this coastal

07:43.430 --> 07:45.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
area did evacuate?

07:45.365 --> 07:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes, I think
that was the
sort of silver lining to this is
that a lot

07:51.004 --> 07:52.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of people heeded the warnings.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They didn't put first-responders
at risk.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Authorities were relatively
happy about that.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are, of course, people who
decided to
try and ride out the hurricane.

07:59.212 --> 08:05.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we won't know until
everybody gets back
what the damage was, but most
people heeded

08:05.285 --> 08:09.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the warnings from the local and
national authorities
who said get out of the way.

08:09.522 --> 08:13.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now people are very anxious,
of course,
to see what the state of their
property is

08:13.460 --> 08:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like, how everything fared
through the storm.

08:16.363 --> 08:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hari Sreenivasan
reporting
for us from New Smyrna Beach,
Florida.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hari, we want you to get
someplace where you
are dry and safe.

08:23.603 --> 08:26.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Judy.

08:26.139 --> 08:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
United States formally charged
that Russia

08:31.111 --> 08:37.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
organized the hacking of
Democratic political
sites and state election
systems.

08:37.083 --> 08:41.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Department of Homeland
Security and the
director of national
intelligence said it's

08:41.921 --> 08:45.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an effort to interfere with the
election process.

08:45.258 --> 08:48.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We get more now from David
Sanger of The New
York Times.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David, thanks for being with us.

08:50.764 --> 08:55.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's the significance of this
and the fact
that it comes, what, almost four
months after

08:55.034 --> 08:56.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we first heard about these
hacks?

08:56.936 --> 09:00.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANGER, The New York
Times: That's right,
Judy, and we reported in late
July that the

09:00.807 --> 09:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government and intelligence
agencies already
had high confidence that it was
Russia.

09:05.211 --> 09:09.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What was interesting about this
statement,
there's sort of three big
things.

09:09.516 --> 09:13.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first is that the White
House decided
to formally do this.

09:14.020 --> 09:21.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, President Obama has
been very reluctant
to name foreign actors who were
believed to

09:21.060 --> 09:23.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be behind big hacks.

09:23.663 --> 09:29.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They named North Korea in the
Sony hack two
years ago, but declined to name
China in the

09:29.869 --> 09:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hack of more than 20 million
security files
from the Office of Personnel
Management, and

09:36.810 --> 09:41.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't name Russia when they
hacked into the
State Department White House and
Joint Chiefs

09:41.481 --> 09:44.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Staff e-mails, mostly
unclassified e-mails.

09:44.250 --> 09:49.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in this case, I think they
felt that
it was getting too close and
that they had

09:49.155 --> 09:54.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to issue a warning to the
Russians not the
mess around on November 8 with
voter rolls

09:54.427 --> 09:56.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or other elements.

09:56.229 --> 10:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a second important part
of it, Judy,
is that, by naming them, the
president has

10:00.700 --> 10:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now got to announce what he's
going to do
about it.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they haven't said that.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He could do economic sanctions.

10:06.973 --> 10:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He could take overt action.

10:08.975 --> 10:14.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is always a worry in
cyber that
you get into an escalation
issue, where we

10:14.514 --> 10:17.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do something, they do something
back, and
it can get much bigger.

10:17.884 --> 10:23.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Then I think the third
interesting point is
that they said the Russian
leadership itself

10:23.089 --> 10:25.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had to be behind some of the DNC
hacks.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It couldn't have just been done
at a lower
level.

10:27.193 --> 10:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I noticed
they identified
-- they said most senior
officials.

10:32.131 --> 10:37.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what are the options, David,
for the administration
to do something in response?

10:37.036 --> 10:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID SANGER: Well, there are a
few, Judy.

10:39.005 --> 10:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is simply to say, by issuing
a warning,
they have put them on notice,
we're watching,

10:44.644 --> 10:47.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we know what you're doing, so
don't mess around
a month from now.

10:47.914 --> 10:53.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Option number two would be to
make the use
of new presidential directive
that President

10:53.453 --> 10:59.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama signed after the Sony
hacks -- I think
it was signed in April of 2015
-- that basically

10:59.959 --> 11:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would allow them to do economic
sanctions,
the way you do against terrorism
suspects

11:05.965 --> 11:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or nuclear proliferators.

11:08.001 --> 11:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The third option would be to
issue a finding,
a presidential intelligence
finding, which

11:13.473 --> 11:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, by its nature, secret, and
authorize the
National Security Agency and
U.S. Cyber Command

11:20.346 --> 11:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take countervailing action
against Web
sites or servers inside Russia
or to do something

11:28.655 --> 11:35.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else that would show the Russian
government
and particularly President Putin
that we can

11:35.828 --> 11:37.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
play this game, too.

11:37.597 --> 11:42.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as I said, that's risky,
because, you
know, you never know where that
stops, and

11:42.068 --> 11:46.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're on the same kind of
escalation ladder
you are in any other conflict or
in nuclear

11:46.439 --> 11:48.308 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
theory.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, finally,
David, this certainly
signals that the administration
believes,

11:51.377 --> 11:56.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if the Russians have the
capacity to do this,
they must have the capacity to
do other damage.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.518 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID SANGER: Well, they do.

11:58.551 --> 12:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you don't know what other
leaks come from
the Russians, but just this
evening, just

12:04.591 --> 12:10.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as all of this was happening, we
saw leaked
e-mails posted on WikiLeaks that
were written

12:10.930 --> 12:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in communications with John
Podesta, who helped
run Mrs. Clinton's campaign,
that, if it turns

12:17.403 --> 12:23.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out to be like the other
material given to
WikiLeaks or other groups, could
turn out

12:23.242 --> 12:26.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be that the Russians are
already spreading
more of this around.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't have the attribution on
that yet.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it
certainly does seem
to be a new -- we have reached a
new level

12:32.952 --> 12:37.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in outside governments'
involvement in American
politics.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID SANGER: We certainly have.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Sanger --
David Sanger,
we thank you.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID SANGER: Thank you, Judy.

12:41.828 --> 12:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meantime, Russia
moved today
to keep its troops in Syria
indefinitely.

12:46.966 --> 12:51.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The State Duma ratified a treaty
with Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad.

12:51.771 --> 12:57.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It permits Russia to use a major
air base
on Syria's coast for as long as
it wants.

12:57.410 --> 13:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in Washington, Secretary of
State John
Kerry said Russia and Syria
should be investigated

13:03.282 --> 13:07.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for war crimes, for attacking
hospitals and
other civilian targets.

13:07.487 --> 13:12.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: They're
beyond the accidental now, way
beyond, years

13:12.091 --> 13:14.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
beyond the accidental.

13:14.594 --> 13:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a targeted strategy to
terrorize civilians
and to kill anybody and
everybody who's in

13:22.735 --> 13:24.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way of their military
objectives.

13:24.971 --> 13:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.N. Security
Council votes
tomorrow on a resolution urging
a truce in

13:30.443 --> 13:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aleppo, and an end to all
airstrikes on the
city.

13:34.681 --> 13:37.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia signaled that it will
veto the proposal.

13:37.784 --> 13:43.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Philippines is putting joint
military
exercises with the U.S. on hold
in the South

13:43.089 --> 13:44.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
China Sea.

13:44.857 --> 13:49.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country's new president,
Rodrigo Duterte,
said today that he wants a
current ongoing

13:49.262 --> 13:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exercise to be the last during
his six-year
term.

13:53.466 --> 13:58.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In a speech, he warned
Washington -- quote
-- "Do not treat us like a
doormat, because

13:58.137 --> 13:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you will be sorry for it.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can always go to China" -- end
quote.

14:02.975 --> 14:07.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The pace of hiring in the U.S.
economy slowed
a little in September.

14:07.146 --> 14:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's Labor Department report
tells the
story: Employers added a net of
156,000 jobs,

14:14.220 --> 14:19.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
despite the fact manufacturers
cut their work
force for a second month.

14:19.125 --> 14:24.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unemployment rate ticked up
a 10th of
a point to 5 percent, as more
people started

14:24.597 --> 14:26.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
looking for work.

14:26.666 --> 14:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street: The Dow
Jones industrial
average lost 28 points to close
at 18240.

14:33.005 --> 14:36.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 14 to close at
5292.

14:36.075 --> 14:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the S&amp;P 500 slipped seven.

14:39.445 --> 14:45.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All three indexes were down for
the week,
after three straight weeks of
gains.

14:45.084 --> 14:50.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the surprising
recipient of this year's Nobel
Peace Prize;

14:50.890 --> 14:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi families returning to
what's left of
their liberated city; setting
the stage for

14:56.195 --> 15:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the second presidential debate;
and much more.

15:10.276 --> 15:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The recipient of the Nobel Peace
Prize was
announced this morning, its
laureate chosen

15:15.081 --> 15:18.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from a record 376 nominees.

15:18.050 --> 15:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as in years past, the Nobel
Committee
had both a surprise and a
message to convey.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner reports.

15:27.894 --> 15:33.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS, Colombian
President (voice-over):
I don't receive this in my name,
but in the

15:33.432 --> 15:37.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
name of all Colombians,
especially the millions
of victims from this conflict we
have been

15:37.804 --> 15:39.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suffering for more than 50
years.

15:39.605 --> 15:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The new Nobel
Peace Prize
laureate, Colombian President
Juan Manuel

15:44.110 --> 15:51.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Santos, met the news by vowing
to ensure that
this hemisphere's longest war
will finally,

15:51.617 --> 15:53.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
officially be ended.

15:53.419 --> 15:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS (through
translator): To
this cause, I will dedicate my
efforts for

15:58.925 --> 16:00.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the remainder of my days.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks to God, peace is near.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Together, together, as a nation,
we will construct
it.

16:05.832 --> 16:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The Nobel
announcement came
just five days after Colombian
voters narrowly

16:10.336 --> 16:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rejected a peace deal negotiated
between Santos'
government and the FARC rebel
group.

16:16.342 --> 16:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in Oslo, Norway, the Peace
Prize Committee
voiced hope.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KACI KULLMANN FIVE, Chair,
Norwegian Nobel
Committee: The fact that the
majority of the

16:22.348 --> 16:31.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters said no to the peace
accord doesn't
necessarily mean that the peace
process is

16:31.791 --> 16:33.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dead.

16:33.526 --> 16:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the no-side rejected wasn't
the desire
for peace, but a specific peace
agreement.

16:40.533 --> 16:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In a break with
Nobel tradition
honoring leaders who settle
conflicts, Santos'

16:46.739 --> 16:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
counterpart in the peace talks,
FARC leader
Rodrigo Londono wasn't
recognized by the committee.

16:52.778 --> 16:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, on Twitter today, Londono
congratulated
Santos and said: "The only prize
to which

16:58.551 --> 17:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we aspire is that of peace with
social justice
for Colombia, without
paramilitarism, without

17:05.224 --> 17:07.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
retaliation, nor lies."

17:07.827 --> 17:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A prominent former captive of
the FARC, Ingrid
Betancourt, said the rebels
should share the

17:13.866 --> 17:15.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
prize.

17:15.601 --> 17:19.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was kidnapped in 2002 as she
campaigned
for the Colombian presidency
herself, and

17:19.805 --> 17:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was held hostage for six years.

17:21.741 --> 17:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INGRID BETANCOURT, Former FARC
Captive: It's
hard for me to say it, but I
have to be just.

17:25.811 --> 17:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though they were my
captors and I
suffered in their hands, I think
that it's

17:31.550 --> 17:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
true that they transformed
themselves.

17:35.154 --> 17:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This wouldn't have been possible
eight years
ago, when I was abducted.

17:39.425 --> 17:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Ironically,
even as President
Santos is recognized
internationally, he is

17:44.330 --> 17:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facing a political headwinds at
home.

17:47.066 --> 17:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His approval ratings plummeted
below 30 percent
early this year, amid rising
food prices and

17:53.306 --> 17:56.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
dissatisfaction with his
handling of the peace
talks.

17:56.342 --> 18:01.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is unclear if today's honor
will make any
difference in his standing.

18:01.914 --> 18:07.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many Colombians, after a war
that claimed
more than 220,000 lives, felt
the peace agreement

18:07.320 --> 18:09.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was overly generous to the FARC.

18:09.322 --> 18:13.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For some, the Nobel may do
little to change
their minds.

18:13.526 --> 18:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
think it is a
farce that that man has won the
prize.

18:18.397 --> 18:20.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it is a farce.

18:20.333 --> 18:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Yet the Peace
Prize appeared
to energize others who have
backed the Colombian

18:24.670 --> 18:26.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANUEL ECHEVARRIA, Peace Accord
Supporter
(through translator): This
international support

18:29.408 --> 18:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to apply pressure on
all involved
parties in the negotiation.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We think this helps.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They all have to understand that
the world,
too, wants peace in Colombia.

18:38.851 --> 18:43.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: When Santos
himself sat down
with the "NewsHour" in February,
he acknowledged

18:43.789 --> 18:49.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the difficulties ahead,
especially reintegrating
thousands of former fighters
into society.

18:49.528 --> 18:55.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: Kids that
only know how
to shoot, they were born in the
guerrilla

18:55.835 --> 18:56.802 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
camps.

18:56.836 --> 19:00.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these have to be retrained
and reeducated.

19:00.506 --> 19:01.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there's a process.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's cumbersome, it's difficult,
but it's
necessary.

19:04.076 --> 19:08.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But then, the
prospects of
an accord that the people would
accept seemed

19:08.981 --> 19:10.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
promising.

19:10.182 --> 19:13.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS: A peace
agreement is never
perfect.

19:13.652 --> 19:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Always, you have people from one
side or the
other criticizing it.

19:17.656 --> 19:23.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Now both sides
have to renegotiate,
even as a cease-fire with the
FARC formally

19:23.596 --> 19:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expires at the end of this
month.

19:26.699 --> 19:32.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

19:32.905 --> 19:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the final
report in
our three-part series this week,
The Fight

19:44.750 --> 19:46.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Iraq.

19:46.619 --> 19:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The coming battle to reclaim
Mosul from ISIS
will be the capstone in the
campaign to drive

19:51.757 --> 19:53.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the extremists from Iraq.

19:53.793 --> 19:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the hard work after the guns
go silent
of repairing both the city and
relations with

19:59.398 --> 20:01.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the people there is as
important.

20:01.400 --> 20:06.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, again with the support
of the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting,
special correspondent

20:06.939 --> 20:13.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jane Ferguson and producer Jon
Gerberg report
from one city reclaimed from
ISIS where the

20:13.212 --> 20:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fighting was only half the
battle.

20:15.481 --> 20:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Now an empty
concrete ghost
town, Fallujah was once a
populous city, just

20:21.921 --> 20:24.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an hour's drive west from
Baghdad.

20:24.690 --> 20:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS quickly took this city two
years ago,
when they swept into Iraq from
Syria and seized

20:30.629 --> 20:32.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
land across the country.

20:32.731 --> 20:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They ruled the city and its
people until the
Iraqi army pushed them out in
June.

20:37.503 --> 20:43.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In order to take back Fallujah
City, the Iraqi
military had to completely empty
the city,

20:43.342 --> 20:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the fighting that happened
afterwards
destroyed everything that the
eye can see.

20:48.714 --> 20:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now the atmosphere in this still
largely empty
city is incredibly eerie.

20:54.620 --> 20:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Khalil Abass is looking forward
to rebuilding.

20:59.158 --> 21:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is getting his family ready
to go back
to their village on the
outskirts of Fallujah.

21:04.330 --> 21:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All their belongings have once
again been
packed, including even chickens
for food.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is optimistic.

21:12.004 --> 21:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHALIL ABASS, Iraq (through
translator): I'm
happy I'm going back to my home
with my family

21:17.209 --> 21:19.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to live a stable, normal life.

21:19.845 --> 21:23.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If God wills it, we will get our
old lives
back.

21:23.048 --> 21:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Not everyone can
do that.

21:26.185 --> 21:31.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only a small handful of families
have been
able to return to Fallujah City
so far.

21:31.457 --> 21:36.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands of others are crammed
into camps
like this one, not yet allowed
to return.

21:36.662 --> 21:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many have not been cleared by
the security
forces.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These people are trying to get
home.

21:43.869 --> 21:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They ran from the intense
fighting when the
Iraqi army recaptured Fallujah
City from ISIS.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now they want to return.

21:51.210 --> 21:56.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a sorting center outside the
city, they
hope to be given government
permissions to

21:56.415 --> 21:58.317 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go home.

21:58.350 --> 22:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first they will have to
persuade the men
inside here they are not ISIS
members in disguise.

22:03.689 --> 22:04.657 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
BRIG.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.625 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAMZA AL MOHAMMED, Iraqi Army
(through translator):
All of the government security
branches are

22:08.661 --> 22:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
here, national security,
intelligence, anti-terrorism,
military intelligence and police
intelligence.

22:14.099 --> 22:19.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Each of those
groups has a
list of suspected ISIS members,
and everyone

22:19.471 --> 22:24.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who applies to return to
Fallujah has to be
checked they are not wanted.

22:24.143 --> 22:28.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When names are read out, the men
here answer
black or white.

22:28.314 --> 22:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anyone on the black list is
arrested.

22:29.915 --> 22:30.883 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
BRIG.

22:30.916 --> 22:32.718 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

22:32.751 --> 22:35.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAMZA AL MOHAMMED (through
translator): This
is a family that wants to return
to Fallujah.

22:35.454 --> 22:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This family is under the name of
someone,
right?

22:38.857 --> 22:40.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His name is Ahmad.

22:40.426 --> 22:41.393 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
White?

22:41.427 --> 22:44.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We screened the name of the head
of the family.

22:44.997 --> 22:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The rest are women and children.

22:47.833 --> 22:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The word in
Arabic for white,
abyad, means they are free to
go.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only then are they given the
permit to return
home.

22:55.975 --> 23:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are also given a free SIM
card with some
credit, and then they head up
the road to

23:00.713 --> 23:02.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Fallujah.

23:02.915 --> 23:06.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For those who do return, this is
what greets
them.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The streets are now silent.

23:09.622 --> 23:14.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the time the gunfire finally
finished in
Fallujah City, most of those
living here had

23:14.893 --> 23:16.962 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fled.

23:16.996 --> 23:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every highway, avenue and
neighborhood is
now smashed and scarred by war.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are few signs of life.

23:24.903 --> 23:29.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
According to the local
government, only about
5 percent of the pre-ISIS
population has so

23:30.009 --> 23:32.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
far returned to the city.

23:32.444 --> 23:35.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Many houses are still
booby-trapped, says
the government.

23:35.247 --> 23:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will take a huge cleanup
effort to make
every street safe again.

23:40.286 --> 23:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some families are missing
relatives, picked
up by the army as they fled the
city.

23:45.457 --> 23:50.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Security forces detained
Fallujans as they
evacuated, checking for ISIS
fighters.

23:50.629 --> 23:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those they let go were sent to
camps like
this.

23:53.999 --> 24:00.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hamad Khalaf was detained with
his four grown
sons, but only he and two of
them were released.

24:00.839 --> 24:05.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was four months ago, and he
has heard
nothing of his other two sons.

24:05.244 --> 24:09.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAMAD KHALAF, Iraq (through
translator): They
kept them.

24:09.682 --> 24:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Someone came and said, "I saw
this one with
ISIS."

24:12.251 --> 24:13.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My son is normal.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is not with ISIS.

24:15.788 --> 24:20.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: In many cases, he
says, this
came down to personal grudges.

24:20.893 --> 24:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The process was often arbitrary,
as neighbor
turned on neighbor.

24:25.664 --> 24:31.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HAMAD KHALAF (through
translator): It happened
to thousands of people, not just
my sons.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are innocent.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know they are innocent.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are being held without
explanation.

24:35.874 --> 24:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If a person hates another, he
will tell the
police this person is with ISIS.

24:39.645 --> 24:44.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Hamad's wife,
Fatima, is distraught
at not knowing where they are.

24:44.450 --> 24:49.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATIMA KHALAF, Iraq (through
translator):
I feel that they might not
release them to

24:49.121 --> 24:52.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me or they might keep them for
another month
or two.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I might not see them.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I might die and never see them
again.

24:56.695 --> 25:03.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Americans fought
two battles
for Fallujah in 2004, and were
never able

25:03.135 --> 25:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to free the city from the grip
of the Sunni
extremists, al-Qaida in Iraq.

25:08.540 --> 25:12.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sunnis here rejected the
toppling of Saddam
Hussein and the rise of a Shia
government

25:12.578 --> 25:17.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Baghdad, and many welcomed
al-Qaida in
Iraq as their defenders.

25:17.683 --> 25:23.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The legacy of that bloodshed
means some people
in this camp still hold bitter
memories of

25:23.188 --> 25:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American involvement in their
country.

25:25.157 --> 25:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJID SALEH, Iraq (through
translator): I
lost 31 family members to the
Americans.

25:31.797 --> 25:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of them, my sister's son was
four months old.

25:35.334 --> 25:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My sister's son, his sister and
their father,
they were all killed.

25:39.571 --> 25:41.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What more can I say?

25:41.473 --> 25:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: After the U.S.
military withdrawal
from Iraq, policies of the
Shia-led Baghdad

25:47.212 --> 25:49.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
government became more
sectarian.

25:49.982 --> 25:54.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sunni people in areas like
Fallujah were left
feeling disenfranchised.

25:54.086 --> 25:59.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many initially welcomed ISIS, a
new, more
ambitious version of al-Qaida in
Iraq.

25:59.992 --> 26:06.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sohaib Al-Rawi, governor of
Fallujah's Anbar
Province, and a Sunni himself,
saw that sectarian

26:06.165 --> 26:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
strife firsthand.

26:07.933 --> 26:11.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOHAIB AL-RAWI, Governor of
Anbar Province
(through translator): The Sunni
community

26:11.637 --> 26:13.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
faced injustice.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many leaders were killed or
driven from the
country.

26:15.340 --> 26:17.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, the community feels
oppressed.

26:17.843 --> 26:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do not excuse the Sunni
extremists, but
this is what inflamed the
political and security

26:22.481 --> 26:24.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
situation in the Sunni
provinces.

26:24.550 --> 26:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Today, the Iraqi
government's
attempts to restore Fallujah
include mass

26:29.888 --> 26:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security and intelligence
screening of all
of its residents.

26:33.959 --> 26:40.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that won't give Fallujans
back the lives
they once had, which now only
live in memory.

26:40.199 --> 26:45.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAJID SALEH (through
translator): What else
can we say about Fallujah?

26:45.771 --> 26:48.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We used to have livestock and
tasty food.

26:48.907 --> 26:50.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now we eat the food of
livestock.

26:50.809 --> 26:52.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Fallujah is gone.

26:52.511 --> 26:54.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's lost.

26:54.313 --> 26:56.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Fallujah is lost.

26:56.648 --> 27:02.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Fallujah has been
destroyed
by war before, and rebuilt.

27:02.588 --> 27:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The repeated explosions of
violence here are
unlikely to end until its people
feel like

27:08.193 --> 27:11.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a real part of today's Iraq.

27:11.763 --> 27:21.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Fallujah, Iraq.

27:21.707 --> 27:29.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
Georgia's
changing demographics are also
changing elections;

27:35.320 --> 27:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plus, Mark Shields and Michael
Gerson analyze
the week's news.

27:39.858 --> 27:45.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: The twists and turns
keep coming
in the race for the White House
just two days

27:45.664 --> 27:50.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton meet
in their second presidential
debate.

27:50.802 --> 27:51.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

27:51.970 --> 27:55.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Late today, a new
storm around
Trump.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Hello.

27:57.142 --> 27:58.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How are you?

27:58.143 --> 27:59.912 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hi.

27:59.945 --> 28:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Washington Post
released a
2005 videotape in which Trump is
heard talking

28:03.482 --> 28:07.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in vulgar terms about trying and
failing to
seduce a woman.

28:07.586 --> 28:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: When you're a
star, they let
you do it.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can do anything.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILLY BUSH, "Access Hollywood":
Whatever you
want.

28:12.224 --> 28:12.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Grab them by the
(EXPLETIVE
DELETED).

28:12.925 --> 28:13.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:13.926 --> 28:15.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: You can do
anything.

28:15.827 --> 28:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It comes as Hillary
Clinton has
been blasting Trump for his
treatment of women,

28:19.531 --> 28:23.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Trump has been threatening
to make an
issue out of Bill Clinton's
infidelities.

28:23.468 --> 28:29.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, Trump apologized
and said
the tape was "locker room
banter, a private

28:29.741 --> 28:31.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conversation.

28:31.043 --> 28:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bill Clinton has said far worse
to me on the
golf course.

28:34.613 --> 28:36.682 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not even close."

28:36.715 --> 28:40.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Campaigning in Las Vegas,
Democratic running
mate Tim Kaine reacted to the
tape.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:42.487 --> 28:44.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
It's just -- I mean, it makes me
sick to my

28:44.389 --> 28:46.158 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stomach.

28:46.191 --> 28:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't like to even say the
words that he's
used in the past when he calls
women pigs,

28:49.661 --> 28:52.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dogs and -- I should be
surprised and shocked.

28:52.230 --> 28:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm sad to say that I'm not.

28:54.099 --> 28:58.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Earlier, Trump fired
a new broadside
on a signature issue,
immigration, as he met

28:58.604 --> 29:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with a Border Patrol unit that
endorsed him.

29:01.273 --> 29:05.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He charged agents are being
told, in effect,
to look the other way as
Election Day approaches.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: They're letting
people pour
into the country, so they can go
and vote.

29:08.714 --> 29:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: They want to hurry up and
fast-track
them, so they can go ahead and
be able to

29:13.018 --> 29:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vote for these elections.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And these are the
professionals.

29:16.788 --> 29:19.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are the people that are on
the border.

29:19.191 --> 29:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You hear a thing like that, it's
-- it's a
disgrace.

29:21.493 --> 29:25.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Running mate Mike
Pence vowed that
he and Trump will end illegal
immigration

29:25.697 --> 29:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
once and for all.

29:27.866 --> 29:33.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even with current controversies
swirling around
him, Trump weighed in on an old
one, a racially

29:33.505 --> 29:37.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
charged 1989 rape case.

29:37.209 --> 29:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five teenagers, all minorities,
were convicted
of assaulting a white banker in
Central Park,

29:43.315 --> 29:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exonerated by DNA evidence and
then paid $41
million in a settlement with New
York City.

29:50.422 --> 29:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Trump told CNN: "They
admitted they were
guilty.

29:54.292 --> 30:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that that case was
settled with so
much evidence against them is
outrageous."

30:00.799 --> 30:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton was off the trail today
preparing
for Sunday's debate.

30:04.169 --> 30:08.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The campaigns are also watching
the impact
of Hurricane Matthew.

30:08.774 --> 30:13.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Florida Governor Rick Scott, a
Republican
who is backing Trump, rejected a
Clinton campaign

30:13.545 --> 30:19.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
request to extend voter
registration beyond
next Tuesday's deadline.

30:19.217 --> 30:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, there could be
troubles with
the millions of mail-in ballots
that went

30:23.622 --> 30:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out this week, just as hundreds
of thousands
of voters in that toss-up state
were told

30:28.694 --> 30:30.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to evacuate.

30:30.495 --> 30:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, President Obama took
advantage
of a fund-raising trip to
Chicago to cast

30:35.500 --> 30:37.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his vote.

30:37.302 --> 30:43.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite prodding from reporters,
he wouldn't
violate the sanctity of his
secret ballot,

30:43.675 --> 30:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the expression on his face
left little
doubt who he voted for.

30:48.413 --> 30:50.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

30:50.982 --> 30:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you have
heard a lot
in this election year about
changing demographics

30:55.620 --> 31:01.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in some states, rising numbers
of minority
voters who are scrambling the
calculus for

31:01.226 --> 31:02.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the candidates and the parties.

31:02.894 --> 31:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one of the places with the
most dramatic
change under way is Georgia.

31:07.265 --> 31:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It hasn't voted Democratic in 24
years, but
is giving Hillary Clinton reason
to hope this

31:12.971 --> 31:13.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

31:13.972 --> 31:17.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I flew there this past weekend.

31:17.242 --> 31:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the Sweet Auburn Festival on
Saturday,
neighbors and tourists showed up
to eat, drink,

31:22.814 --> 31:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and enjoy local musicians.

31:26.284 --> 31:30.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this Atlanta neighborhood,
known as the
historic heart of the civil
rights movement

31:30.956 --> 31:33.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here, some are clear who they're
voting for.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm looking forward to
there being
a female president.

31:35.694 --> 31:37.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And also I like the way she --
her campaign
is run.

31:37.863 --> 31:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I like the way she speaks.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think she will do well to
getting this
world back into the order.

31:43.001 --> 31:48.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Voters like this
are exactly
what Hillary Clinton must have
to turn Georgia

31:48.206 --> 31:53.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
blue for the first time since
1992, says Emory
University's Andra Gillespie.

31:54.012 --> 31:58.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDRA GILLESPIE, Emory
University: You need
African-Americans to turn out in
record numbers,

31:58.116 --> 32:00.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just as they did in 2008 and
2012.

32:00.552 --> 32:04.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suspect that Hillary Clinton
is going to
do extremely well in the state
amongst blacks

32:04.222 --> 32:05.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who do turn out to vote.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We should expect that they're
going to make
up about 30 percent of the
electorate here

32:08.894 --> 32:10.796 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Georgia.

32:10.829 --> 32:16.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In fact, due to
dramatic demographic
changes, growing numbers of
blacks and other

32:16.401 --> 32:19.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
minorities, Clinton is relying
on voters like
33-year-old Charisse Price.

32:19.905 --> 32:24.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARISSE PRICE, Georgia: I'm
voting for her
because I feel that she's the
candidate that

32:24.876 --> 32:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most aligns with my values and
the issues
that are important to me.

32:28.480 --> 32:33.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm excited about what she
offers as the
most qualified candidate in
history.

32:33.685 --> 32:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats also
hope to capitalize
on negative feelings toward
Donald Trump among

32:38.557 --> 32:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Latino community that has
more than doubled
since 2000.

32:43.795 --> 32:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Latinos make up just under 10
percent of the
population in Georgia, but they
are now less

32:49.267 --> 32:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than 3 percent of registered
voters.

32:52.103 --> 32:59.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Omar Rodriguez Esparza is a
naturalized U.S.
citizen from Mexico, who says he
cannot support

32:59.377 --> 33:01.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

33:01.112 --> 33:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OMAR RODRIGUEZ ESPARZA, Georgia:
It really
did bother me when he started to
offend my

33:03.682 --> 33:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community, calling us different
things that
were obscene and derogatory.

33:09.221 --> 33:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for me to stand behind a
person that speaks
that way about our community, I
just can't

33:13.658 --> 33:14.826 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it.

33:14.860 --> 33:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's like turning my back
against my own
community.

33:17.262 --> 33:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Georgia
Republicans say
they are not ready to simply
cede minority

33:22.801 --> 33:24.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
voters to the Democrats.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEO SMITH, Georgia GOP: I think
what they're
underestimating is the number of
African-Americans

33:28.006 --> 33:32.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who are now saying, I am
independent in my
thinking about politics.

33:32.844 --> 33:37.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Leo Smith is the
Georgia GOP's
minority engagement director.

33:37.916 --> 33:43.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LEO SMITH: The Georgia
Republican Party decided
in 2013 that we would embrace a
strategy to

33:43.088 --> 33:47.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
target, micro-target
demographics that we
have not been successful with.

33:47.125 --> 33:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we developed a strategy
to make sure
that we connected with blacks,
that we connected

33:51.663 --> 33:55.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Latin Americans, Latino
Americans, that
we connected with Asian
Americans.

33:55.767 --> 34:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In 2008, 98
percent of blacks
who voted went Obama.

34:02.240 --> 34:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, this year, Democrats say
the key is not
the percentage, but the number
of African-Americans

34:08.146 --> 34:09.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who vote.

34:09.915 --> 34:11.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STACEY ABRAMS (D), Georgia House
Minority
Leader: So, you're just now
starting the real

34:11.116 --> 34:12.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
push.

34:12.951 --> 34:15.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrat Stacey
Abrams is the
minority leader in the Georgia
State House

34:15.887 --> 34:17.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Representatives.

34:17.822 --> 34:21.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STACEY ABRAMS: Most of the
pre-work that happens
in elections is persuading
people to believe

34:21.860 --> 34:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that your candidate has the
right belief set,
that they are the right person.

34:26.631 --> 34:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where we are now is convincing
people that
they need to turn out and do
something about

34:30.101 --> 34:31.069 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

34:31.102 --> 34:32.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have six weeks.

34:32.604 --> 34:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's going to be -- it's a
heavy lift,
but it's a very doable lift.

34:35.707 --> 34:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Doable, but with
a special
challenge among younger voters.

34:39.711 --> 34:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STACEY ABRAMS: She has a problem
particularly
amongst young African-Americans
who appear

34:42.981 --> 34:44.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be soft on her.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it doesn't mean that they're
going to
defect and vote for Donald
Trump.

34:46.751 --> 34:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the questions is, do
they stay home
or do they vote for somebody
like Gary Johnson?

34:50.755 --> 34:54.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHAIDAH EHEHOSI, College
Student: For me,
voting for her would be like
settling.

34:54.292 --> 34:56.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I don't want to settle.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would rather, like, stay
single, right?

34:58.830 --> 35:03.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Shaidah Ehehosi,
a sophomore
at Georgia State University,
says she feels

35:03.835 --> 35:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pressure to back Clinton, but,
as of now,
doesn't think she can do that.

35:08.373 --> 35:12.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAIDAH EHEHOSI: She's so
sneaky, and she's
just not honest.

35:12.077 --> 35:19.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump is openly
racist, you know,
openly ridiculous, basically.

35:19.851 --> 35:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Hillary is so covert with
her actions,
that that scares me as well.

35:25.890 --> 35:28.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's just so -- it's tough.

35:28.893 --> 35:34.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In this state,
with a population
in transition, Clinton's
challenge is not

35:34.199 --> 35:40.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only to turn out the Democratic
base, especially
African-Americans, but also to
turn out more

35:40.038 --> 35:45.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
white voters than Democrats have
won in the
past five presidential
elections.

35:45.910 --> 35:52.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thanks to the controversial
candidacy of Donald
Trump, the key could be white
women like Jessica

35:52.283 --> 35:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mayer, who voted for Mitt Romney
last time,
but says Trump is out of the
question.

35:59.224 --> 36:00.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's considering Clinton.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JESSICA MAYER, Georgia: I don't
know if I
want to vote for her or not.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I like her.

36:04.062 --> 36:06.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't dislike her, but I like
Gary Johnson
a lot, too.

36:06.631 --> 36:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't want to vote for it just
because she's
a woman, even though I'm -- I
feel like I'm

36:10.101 --> 36:13.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaning that way, because it'd
be nice to
have a woman in the White House.

36:13.705 --> 36:18.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The support of
voters like
Jessica is essential to a
long-shot Democratic

36:19.010 --> 36:22.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
victory here, says strategist
Gordon Giffin.

36:22.113 --> 36:24.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON GIFFIN, Democratic
Strategist: To win
a state like Georgia, you have
got to appeal

36:24.849 --> 36:27.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a broad cross-section of
genders.

36:27.585 --> 36:30.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't just go after one
gender.

36:30.822 --> 36:35.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Broad cross-section of all parts
of our citizenry.

36:35.126 --> 36:39.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to win here, Hillary Clinton
would have
to get a substantial part of the
white vote,

36:40.031 --> 36:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not just the minority vote.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Again, Andra
Gillespie:

36:43.201 --> 36:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: In the context
of the first
debate performance, and Donald
Trump's lashing

36:48.173 --> 36:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out at Alicia Machado for her
weight and other
kinds of things, these are the
kinds of messages

36:52.577 --> 36:57.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that could play well to suburban
white voters
who are on the fence about
Trump, and maybe

36:58.016 --> 36:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she can convince them to come to
her side.

36:59.851 --> 37:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Young Georgia
Republicans like
Jake Evans acknowledge Trump's
weakness among

37:05.557 --> 37:07.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women who would normally lean
right.

37:07.859 --> 37:13.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAKE EVANS, Georgia: Millennials
overall are
a generation of equality on the
gender side,

37:13.198 --> 37:25.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on the race side, and he
undoubtedly leads
some people to believe that he
doesn't fully

37:25.310 --> 37:27.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
further gender equality motives.

37:27.612 --> 37:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even so, Evans
himself backs
Trump, albeit without
enthusiasm.

37:33.418 --> 37:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAKE EVANS: I will vote for
Donald Trump because
I think he aligns more with my
personal ideologies,

37:39.924 --> 37:43.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
less government, lower taxes,
less regulation.

37:43.661 --> 37:47.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe, personally, that's
what's best
for the country, but I will do
it reluctantly.

37:47.699 --> 37:51.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's an election
of the lesser
of two evils, to be honest with
you, for a

37:51.970 --> 37:53.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lot of millennials.

37:53.771 --> 37:58.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton
supporters say she
can win that argument, if her
campaign targets

37:58.376 --> 38:00.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the voters who are turned
off by Trump.

38:01.012 --> 38:06.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON GIFFIN: If 30 percent of
the white
vote in Georgia votes for
Hillary Clinton,

38:06.918 --> 38:08.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she will carry the state of
Georgia.

38:08.720 --> 38:13.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We also found
that, even among
Clinton backers here, there is
concern that

38:13.358 --> 38:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the deep divisions in the
country will undermine
her if she's elected.

38:17.795 --> 38:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRAN MARSHALL, Georgia: I think
that she is
going to have as difficult a
time as President

38:24.269 --> 38:27.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obama had as far as
congressional support.

38:27.705 --> 38:33.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope that they do not meet
secretly the
night that she is elected and
decide that

38:33.378 --> 38:39.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are going to vote no for
everything that
she may present to Congress.

38:39.150 --> 38:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's a
snapshot right
now of Georgia, where new voter
registration

38:44.889 --> 38:47.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ends next Tuesday, October 11.

38:47.992 --> 38:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also the moment we turn to
the analysis
of Shields and Gerson.

38:51.462 --> 38:56.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
Washington Post columnist
Michael Gerson.

38:56.935 --> 38:57.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
David Brooks is away.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, welcome.

38:59.737 --> 39:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there was a lot of news that
we learned
about late this afternoon that
has to do with

39:03.274 --> 39:04.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this campaign.

39:04.742 --> 39:07.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Mark, I do want to start
quickly with
a question about Georgia.

39:07.178 --> 39:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The very fact -- and you heard
to some of
the voters we talked to -- the
very fact that

39:10.181 --> 39:14.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a state that Mitt Romney won by
eight points
four years ago, where it's close
-- I mean,

39:15.019 --> 39:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's still uphill for Hillary
Clinton, but
it's close because of what we
talked about.

39:18.656 --> 39:19.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

39:19.657 --> 39:21.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, it is.

39:21.559 --> 39:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Defined -- the interviews
defined the enthusiasm
gap.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It isn't just on one side.

39:26.397 --> 39:27.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's on both sides.

39:27.465 --> 39:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's minimal excitement.

39:29.667 --> 39:34.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for Hillary Clinton, I
think what came
through in your piece is, it's
not a question

39:34.339 --> 39:38.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the percentage of the
African-American
vote, in addition trying to get
30 percent

39:38.209 --> 39:41.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the white vote, but it's
numbers.

39:41.045 --> 39:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She could get high percentages,
but if you
don't get numbers in the turnout
-- but the

39:44.749 --> 39:50.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope, obviously, is that Georgia
can move
eventually, if not this time,
into the category

39:50.555 --> 39:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Virginia, North Carolina,
states that have
changed, Colorado and Nevada.

39:55.893 --> 39:56.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael.

39:56.894 --> 39:58.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

39:58.263 --> 40:01.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that the Republican fear
is exactly
the Virginia example.

40:01.532 --> 40:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Barack Obama won it in his
first term,
it was the first time Virginia
had gone Democratic

40:07.472 --> 40:08.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since 1964.

40:08.473 --> 40:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

40:09.474 --> 40:12.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: And now it's not
even close.

40:12.777 --> 40:17.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's because -- Hillary Clinton
is ahead by
about eight points in Virginia.

40:17.849 --> 40:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state has gotten more
diverse, more Hispanics
and Asians, more
college-educated people.

40:23.421 --> 40:27.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's gone in a certain direction
that I think
Republicans fear for a couple of
these states

40:27.292 --> 40:29.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that region.

40:29.060 --> 40:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as we said at
the outset,
there's been a blizzard of news
late this

40:33.097 --> 40:39.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afternoon, Mark, starting with
the Obama administration
naming Russia, saying high
officials in Russia

40:39.437 --> 40:44.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were behind these hacks against
the Democratic
Party and other Democratic
figures.

40:44.609 --> 40:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then you had WikiLeaks coming
out soon after
with information about John
Podesta, who is

40:50.381 --> 40:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's campaign
chairman, and some
e-mailed exchanges over nuclear
energy, and

40:55.086 --> 41:03.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then the Washington Post story,
which I think
I want to start with that,
essentially releasing

41:03.227 --> 41:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the audiotape -- and you heard
it in John
Yang's report -- showing --
videotape showing

41:11.703 --> 41:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump's lewd remarks
about women about
10 years ago.

41:16.074 --> 41:19.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, let's get
one thing straight.

41:19.344 --> 41:21.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not locker room talk.

41:21.946 --> 41:27.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is not a preteen,
adolescent finding
dirty words.

41:27.985 --> 41:36.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a 60-year-old man being
obscene, obscene
toward -- in discussing women,
boasting, bragging

41:36.928 --> 41:40.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the worst and most offensive
way.

41:40.531 --> 41:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just think the political
implications
are profound.

41:44.836 --> 41:50.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican
in New Hampshire,
has said she would vote for
Donald Trump,

41:50.108 --> 41:51.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but will not endorse him.

41:51.976 --> 41:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a debate this past week, she
was asked,
do you consider Donald Trump to
be an appropriate

41:56.414 --> 41:59.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
role model for the children of
New Hampshire?

41:59.083 --> 42:02.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Absolutely" was the end of her
answer, was
immediately pounced on.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.554 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She apologized.

42:03.588 --> 42:05.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cut a spot.

42:05.390 --> 42:08.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every Republican candidate in
the country
who is in a competitive race is
going to be

42:08.893 --> 42:13.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asked in the next week, whether
in a debate
or where else, by opponents or
by the press,

42:13.765 --> 42:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do you consider Donald Trump to
be an appropriate
role model for the children of
our state?

42:21.205 --> 42:26.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it just -- as far as the
women's vote
you just reported on in Georgia,
it makes

42:26.377 --> 42:29.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it so, not simply difficult.

42:29.347 --> 42:35.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It makes it almost impossible
for somebody
with self-respect, who has a
mother or sister

42:35.353 --> 42:41.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
or a daughter, you know,
somebody like this
in Abraham Lincoln's chair.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael, how do
you assess
this?

42:43.561 --> 42:47.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, I think
the problem
here is not just bad language,
but predatory

42:47.665 --> 42:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
language, abusive language...

42:48.766 --> 42:50.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: It is.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: ... demeaning
language.

42:52.170 --> 42:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That indicates something about
someone's character
that is disturbing, frankly,
disturbing in

42:58.042 --> 43:00.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a case like this.

43:00.077 --> 43:03.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think evangelicals have a
particular
problem right now.

43:03.948 --> 43:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they are the people who
argued, many
of whom, leaders, argued that
character counts

43:10.087 --> 43:12.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during the Bill Clinton years.

43:12.957 --> 43:15.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now character apparently
doesn't count
at all.

43:15.827 --> 43:18.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think there's a deep
tension here.

43:18.396 --> 43:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Trump's
response was to
say, well, Bill Clinton has used
far worse

43:21.899 --> 43:26.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
language than you heard here on
the golf course,
he said.

43:26.571 --> 43:27.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

43:27.572 --> 43:29.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a hell of a defense.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing he said was
just more
disparaging remarks he made
earlier that it

43:33.778 --> 43:36.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was just entertaining or
amusing.

43:36.547 --> 43:38.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Michael makes a central
point here.

43:39.016 --> 43:43.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republicans have, with some
pride -- George
W. Bush won the White House by
promising to

43:43.821 --> 43:46.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restore dignity to the Oval
Office.

43:46.324 --> 43:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were or presented
themselves as the
family -- the party of family
values.

43:55.399 --> 44:01.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is impossible to say that
today about the
Republican standard-bearer in
any way.

44:01.339 --> 44:06.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just have to say that
we're forgetting
moral values.

44:06.277 --> 44:08.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're just -- we're talking
about the Supreme
Court.

44:08.446 --> 44:09.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Character doesn't count.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only thing that counts is
the Supreme
Court, apparently.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: And there will
be a question
on Sunday night, certainly.

44:13.818 --> 44:18.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are women in the audience
who are going
to be asking questions during
the debate.

44:18.422 --> 44:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There will be a question saying,
why should
I support this disgusting boor?

44:23.327 --> 44:28.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, we're told
-- we learned
today this is a group of
uncommitted voters

44:28.633 --> 44:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Saint Louis area who have
been put
together by the Gallup
Organization.

44:33.971 --> 44:39.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Michael, turning to the
other -- one
of the other stories of this
afternoon, the

44:39.911 --> 44:44.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration announcing after
four months
of saying they weren't ready to
say whether

44:44.882 --> 44:50.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was Russia officially behind
these hacks
-- they're now saying it was
Russian -- top

44:50.288 --> 44:53.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian officials who were
hacking the Democratic
National Committee.

44:53.858 --> 44:55.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

44:55.726 --> 45:01.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has all the appearance of a
foreign power
trying to undermine structures
of legitimacy

45:01.299 --> 45:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of an American election.

45:02.466 --> 45:05.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is a serious matter.

45:05.036 --> 45:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would -- if I were the media,
I would be
wary of using anything that came
out of these

45:10.274 --> 45:13.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
document dumps which serves the
purpose of
a foreign power.

45:13.778 --> 45:16.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, at the very least,
Americans have to
discount this.

45:16.847 --> 45:22.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is an attempt to hijack and
change American
democracy by a foreign power.

45:22.753 --> 45:24.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It can't be accepted.

45:24.088 --> 45:26.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I mean, I
agree.

45:26.457 --> 45:32.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The presidential option of
economic sanctions
are on the table and, you know,
what the retaliation

45:32.730 --> 45:33.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will take.

45:33.931 --> 45:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I would say it's the end of
the reset
with China.

45:35.399 --> 45:36.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's for certain.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the conclusion, the
statement that only...

45:38.402 --> 45:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reset with
Russia.

45:39.403 --> 45:40.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: With Russia.

45:40.404 --> 45:41.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Excuse me.

45:41.405 --> 45:43.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

45:43.174 --> 45:45.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Only -- only
Russia's senior-most
officials could have authorized,
said the

45:45.710 --> 45:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
director of intelligence and the
Homeland
Security Department.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is pretty profoundly
serious.

45:51.482 --> 45:56.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And seemingly
hand in hand,
or at least the timing is -- may
be more than

45:56.253 --> 45:57.221 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coincidental.

45:57.254 --> 46:00.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WikiLeaks released the John
Podesta e-mails.

46:00.191 --> 46:03.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he's, of course, Hillary
Clinton's campaign
chairman.

46:03.761 --> 46:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's run his own lobbying firm
in Washington
for a number of years.

46:08.032 --> 46:12.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we haven't really seen much
of that yet,
but it's supposed to be having
to do with

46:12.370 --> 46:13.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nuclear energy and...

46:13.838 --> 46:15.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

46:15.606 --> 46:20.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, it's -- New York Times had a
big story
last year, front-page story,
about the sale

46:20.144 --> 46:25.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of that uranium company that was
authorized
by the United States government
to Russia,

46:25.349 --> 46:27.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Russia controlling it.

46:27.251 --> 46:31.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the allegations are that
there were contributions
made to the Clinton Foundation
which were

46:31.555 --> 46:33.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kept from the Obama White House.

46:33.991 --> 46:37.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, whether in fact that's
confirmed, that's
pretty serious.

46:37.628 --> 46:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's going to cause some real
tensions,
understandably, if that's the
case, within

46:42.133 --> 46:43.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Democratic family.

46:43.834 --> 46:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm sure
reporters are
going to continue to pore over
this.

46:47.371 --> 46:49.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Exactly.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Michael, we
have got -- we
do have the second presidential
debate coming

46:50.841 --> 46:53.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up Sunday night in Saint Louis.

46:53.477 --> 46:54.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Right.

46:54.478 --> 46:56.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is a different
format.

46:56.180 --> 46:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is one or the other -- we have
talked about
all the news that may or may not
be asked

46:59.550 --> 47:00.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

47:00.918 --> 47:05.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But does this format benefit one
or the other
of these two people?

47:05.222 --> 47:06.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: I think so.

47:06.290 --> 47:10.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a format that doesn't
reward aggression.

47:10.227 --> 47:13.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It rewards empathy, explanation.

47:13.164 --> 47:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are not Trump strong
points.

47:16.367 --> 47:22.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has not done a run-through, a
full run-through
of this, according to his own
campaign, in

47:22.673 --> 47:24.408 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
private.

47:24.442 --> 47:28.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had an event in New Hampshire
last night
which was supposed to be like a
-- this sort

47:28.846 --> 47:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of event, and he did terribly.

47:30.614 --> 47:35.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is quite possible that he
will have a second
miserable performance.

47:35.720 --> 47:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think that will make
Republicans
denounce him broadly.

47:39.757 --> 47:44.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will mean just that the
balloon is out
of Republican morale completely.

47:44.628 --> 47:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will start looking at
2020, knowing
that they don't have a competent
candidate.

47:50.534 --> 47:51.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
this debate?

47:51.836 --> 47:53.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:53.104 --> 47:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Half the questions
will be from
the audience...

47:55.005 --> 47:56.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Moderators.

47:56.307 --> 47:58.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: ... and half from
the moderator,
and from people.

47:58.876 --> 48:04.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem with these debates
like this is
that you can't really prepare
for them, because

48:04.215 --> 48:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the questions are so individual
and personal
or even idiosyncratic.

48:07.785 --> 48:14.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it does -- Secretary
Clinton has a lot
richer and deeper experience in
doing these,

48:14.258 --> 48:16.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
obviously, than Donald Trump.

48:16.060 --> 48:21.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the people at home, you
can't -- I can't
attack you, Michael, if we're
doing a town

48:21.732 --> 48:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meeting or a town format.

48:23.634 --> 48:26.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to answer the question
that is asked.

48:26.070 --> 48:31.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what people at home are
gauging, Judy,
is, how does this candidate
respond to the

48:31.776 --> 48:32.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
questioner?

48:32.777 --> 48:34.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do they show respect to the
questioner?

48:35.012 --> 48:38.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do they try to understand why
the questioner
is asking that?

48:38.115 --> 48:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do they respond to the question?

48:39.850 --> 48:42.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is really what -- I mean,
is there empathy?

48:42.720 --> 48:46.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there a human connection
between the two?

48:46.257 --> 48:51.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's where Barack Obama beat
Mitt Romney in
2012.

48:51.195 --> 48:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lost the voters on who was a
stronger leader,
who had a vision for the future,
but on who

48:56.200 --> 48:59.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cares about people like me, he
trounced Mitt
Romney.

48:59.637 --> 49:02.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that will be a gauge
of this Sunday
night.

49:02.840 --> 49:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it sort of
faded into
the back of the news today,
Michael, but it

49:09.213 --> 49:13.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was just three or four nights
ago that we
had the vice presidential debate
between Mike

49:13.918 --> 49:15.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Pence and Tim Kaine.

49:15.686 --> 49:20.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of conversation about that
in the day
or so after it, but did that
have a lingering

49:20.858 --> 49:23.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effect on this election of any
kind?

49:23.060 --> 49:27.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Very marginal
temporary moral
boost for Republicans, who were
looking for

49:27.164 --> 49:29.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any good news after a pretty
disastrous week.

49:29.800 --> 49:35.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you analyze it, Mike
Pence could
only defend Donald Trump in some
circumstances

49:35.773 --> 49:42.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by projecting an image of
himself, as though
he were -- that Trump held his
views on Russia

49:42.580 --> 49:44.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or his views on Syria.

49:44.081 --> 49:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's really not true.

49:45.616 --> 49:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it was a weird way to defend
the person
at the top of your ticket.

49:50.187 --> 49:51.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think that was noticed.

49:51.722 --> 49:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a good point.

49:53.824 --> 49:58.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought Mike Pence, upon
reflection to me,
came across a little bit like
your favorite

49:58.696 --> 50:07.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aunt who refuses, in spite of
first-person
evidence that grandpa has been
drunk and disorderly

50:07.371 --> 50:11.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in public, that, says, no, no,
grandpa would
never do that, even though
grandpa is being

50:11.976 --> 50:13.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taken off in handcuffs.

50:13.210 --> 50:14.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:15.012 --> 50:18.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, Donald
would never say
those things about our good
neighbors to the

50:18.449 --> 50:19.416 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
south.

50:19.450 --> 50:20.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: When he did.

50:20.451 --> 50:21.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

50:21.952 --> 50:23.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald would never say that
about our good
co-religious Muslim friends.

50:23.787 --> 50:28.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the Democrats did a
terrible disservice,
the Clinton campaign did, to Tim
Kaine.

50:28.158 --> 50:33.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tim Kaine had the earned
reputation of being
one of the most respected and
well-liked,

50:33.530 --> 50:37.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not cheap partisan members
of the United
States Senate.

50:37.801 --> 50:39.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they turned him into an
attack dog.

50:39.737 --> 50:40.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

50:40.771 --> 50:42.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He didn't come
across authentic.

50:42.339 --> 50:44.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It wasn't good.

50:44.108 --> 50:49.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was -- it just really --
I think, for
short-term benefit, I think they
tarnished

50:49.446 --> 50:51.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the brand, which is an awfully
good brand.

50:51.482 --> 50:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last thing I want
to ask you
two about very quickly is the
Libertarian

50:55.185 --> 50:57.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidate for president, Gary
Johnson.

50:57.421 --> 51:05.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He -- if this is a close
election, Michael
and Mark, he could -- his --
whatever he gets

51:05.195 --> 51:06.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could make a difference.

51:07.031 --> 51:14.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen him this week
talking more about
foreign policy and saying he --
it's OK not

51:14.204 --> 51:16.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have an opinion about it.

51:16.473 --> 51:19.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just in 10 seconds, how much of
a factor is
he?

51:19.443 --> 51:24.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Marginally hurts
Hillary Clinton,
but probably not a big factor.

51:24.214 --> 51:28.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Less today than he
did last
week, and perhaps less tomorrow
than he did

51:29.019 --> 51:30.321 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

51:30.354 --> 51:33.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
Michael Gerson,
we thank you both.

51:33.791 --> 51:37.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we hope you will be sure to
join us right
here on this Sunday for special
live coverage

51:37.995 --> 51:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of that presidential debate.

51:39.196 --> 51:48.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It starts at 9:00 p.m. Eastern.

51:48.305 --> 51:57.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week,"
which airs later this evening --
Gwen.

51:57.581 --> 52:02.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We are in the middle
of debate
season, as the candidates take
each other

52:02.319 --> 52:05.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on up close, as well as from a
distance.

52:05.356 --> 52:10.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's also the season of
real-life consequences,
as voters begin to decide how to
pick not

52:10.461 --> 52:14.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only a president, but also
senators and members
of the House.

52:14.164 --> 52:19.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We assess the choices and
preview Sunday's
second presidential face-off
tonight on "Washington

52:19.970 --> 52:20.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Week" -- Judy.

52:20.971 --> 52:22.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
watching.

52:22.940 --> 52:28.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on "PBS NewsHour" Saturday:
Hari Sreenivasan
continues our on-the-ground
coverage of Hurricane

52:28.512 --> 52:30.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matthew and its aftermath --
Hari.

52:30.714 --> 52:36.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tonight we
brought you information
from New Smyrna Beach, Florida,
but, as you

52:36.487 --> 52:40.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, Hurricane Matthew is
working its way
up the Eastern Seaboard from
Florida across

52:40.424 --> 52:42.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Georgia and South Carolina.

52:42.292 --> 52:47.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will continue to provide the
latest information
on this hurricane and the damage
that it's

52:47.931 --> 52:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
causing all weekend long.

52:49.266 --> 52:51.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can watch on the broadcast

Thanks for watching.

52:57.875 --> 52:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be

52:59.643 --> 53:01.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

debate.

53:04.982 --> 53:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:06.083 --> 53:07.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
