JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.833 --> 00:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.833 --> 00:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.333 --> 00:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
I am canceling the last
administration's completely

00:13.700 --> 00:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one-sided deal with Cuba.

00:15.533 --> 00:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:17.600 --> 00:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
rolls back some of Obama's
efforts to normalize U.S.-Cuba

00:23.166 --> 00:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
relations, reviving
travel restrictions to
the communist nation.

00:26.466 --> 00:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, I sit down with retired
General David Petraeus to ask
about the Trump administration's

00:33.433 --> 00:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military strategy, including
reports that it will send 4,000
more troops to Afghanistan.

00:38.266 --> 00:40.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

00:40.366 --> 00:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID PETRAEUS, Former
Commander, U.S. Central
Command: We need to
recognize that we went

00:42.433 --> 00:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there for a reason, and we
have stayed for a reason, to
ensure that Afghanistan is not

00:45.500 --> 00:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once again a sanctuary for
al-Qaida or other transnational
extremists, the way it was when

00:49.966 --> 00:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the 9/11 attacks
were planned there.

00:51.900 --> 00:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:53.933 --> 00:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze the latest in the
Russia investigation, the state

00:58.366 --> 01:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of partisanship in our
country, plus the rest
of the week's news.

01:03.033 --> 01:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:05.300 --> 01:09.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.700 --> 01:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is now apparently acknowledging
he is under investigation for

01:22.833 --> 01:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
possible obstruction of justice.

01:25.366 --> 01:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tweeted today about
news reports that special
counsel Robert Mueller
has expanded his probe

01:31.166 --> 01:33.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Russian meddling
in the election.

01:33.166 --> 01:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president said: "I am being
investigated for firing the
FBI director by the man who

01:39.133 --> 01:41.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
told me to fire
the FBI director."

01:41.900 --> 01:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That would be Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein.

01:45.366 --> 01:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He authored a memo criticizing
James Comey before Comey
was fired last month.

01:52.866 --> 01:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rosenstein now oversees
Mueller, but several news
outlets reported today
that he, Rosenstein,

01:57.300 --> 02:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
may yet recuse himself.

02:00.500 --> 02:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Late today, the president
released his most recent
financial disclosure.

02:04.733 --> 02:08.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It covers January 2016
through this spring.

02:08.566 --> 02:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it does not
list exact income.

02:11.100 --> 02:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It does say that he resigned
from more than 500 business
positions, many of them one day

02:16.966 --> 02:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before the inauguration.

02:18.966 --> 02:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He listed at least $315
million in liabilities,
about the same as last year.

02:25.833 --> 02:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump spent much of this
day in Miami rolling back some
of President Obama's opening

02:31.300 --> 02:33.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to Cuba.

02:33.366 --> 02:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The new policy seeks to reduce
the flow of U.S. dollars to
businesses controlled by the

02:37.566 --> 02:39.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cuban military.

02:39.033 --> 02:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have a full report
later in the program.

02:42.233 --> 02:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In London, anger over an
apartment tower fire boiled over
today, as officials raised the

02:48.466 --> 02:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
death toll to 30, with
dozens still missing.

02:52.166 --> 02:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jackie Long of
Independent Television
News filed this report.

02:55.900 --> 03:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACKIE LONG: As the days
pass, the anger grows.

03:01.766 --> 03:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is raw and it is visceral.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Shame on you!

03:05.300 --> 03:07.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Shame on you!

03:07.833 --> 03:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE LONG: This
afternoon, family and
friends of the victims and
others from across London

03:13.333 --> 03:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
took that anger to the local
council, storming the town hall.

03:20.633 --> 03:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier, a more subdued
response as the queen and
duke of Cambridge visited
one of the makeshift

03:30.300 --> 03:33.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relief centers set up in
a local sports center.

03:33.366 --> 03:36.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They met residents
and volunteers.

03:36.133 --> 03:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The queen praised the bravery of
firefighters, with a desperate
father in the crowd holding

03:42.000 --> 03:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a picture of his children.

03:43.033 --> 03:44.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Please.

03:44.033 --> 03:45.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Come here.

03:45.033 --> 03:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Come here, please.

03:46.433 --> 03:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE LONG: The duke
promised, "I will come back."

03:48.933 --> 03:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: I will be back.

03:50.633 --> 03:52.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will come back.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will come back.

03:54.100 --> 03:57.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JACKIE LONG: The prime
minister today announced
a five million-pound
emergency relief fund,

03:57.966 --> 04:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it wasn't enough to
assuage the anger of some.

04:02.033 --> 04:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Criticized yesterday for
visiting, but failing to talk to
residents, she came back today

04:09.333 --> 04:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and was met with this.

04:11.166 --> 04:12.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Murderer!

04:12.900 --> 04:13.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Murderer!

04:13.900 --> 04:15.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Murderer!

04:15.933 --> 04:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE LONG: Also today, in
a recent statement, the prime
minister assured residents that

04:21.300 --> 04:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the government is there for all
the victims of this tragedy.

04:24.766 --> 04:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jackie Long of
Independent Television News.

04:28.166 --> 04:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Guardian newspaper reported
today that renovations to
the apartment tower used a

04:32.933 --> 04:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cheaper exterior paneling,
instead of a flame-resistant
version that's more expensive.

04:39.866 --> 04:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, is charging
that new sanctions approved by

04:45.700 --> 04:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the U.S. Senate violate
the 2015 nuclear deal.

04:48.466 --> 04:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The sanctions are aimed at
Tehran's missile program.

04:51.333 --> 04:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a senior adviser
to Khamenei said they
are unquestionably a
breach of both the spirit

04:57.466 --> 04:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the letter of the
nuclear agreement.

04:59.933 --> 05:04.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The spokesman promised
that Iran will respond.

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia's military says that
it may have killed Abu Bakr
al-Baghdadi, the Islamic State's

05:09.800 --> 05:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leader, in an airstrike.

05:11.866 --> 05:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Defense Ministry in Moscow
said today the strike happened
late last month in Syria.

05:17.733 --> 05:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It said it is still
verifying the claim.

05:19.600 --> 05:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. officials say they have
seen no evidence that it's true.

05:23.966 --> 05:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. Refugee Agency warned
today that 100,000 Iraqi
civilians remain trapped behind

05:30.133 --> 05:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Islamic State lines
in Western Mosul.

05:32.966 --> 05:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The officials say that
ISIS militants are
using the civilians as
human shields, as they

05:37.800 --> 05:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
continue to lose ground.

05:39.766 --> 05:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The announcement came in Geneva.

05:41.800 --> 05:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: If you put yourself in
their situation, you know, when
you may have a fighter on top

05:48.233 --> 05:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of your roof, attracting the
artillery fire, you can imagine
in which condition of penury

05:53.800 --> 05:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and panic they live, being
unable to flee and knowing
that, if they try to flee, if

06:00.733 --> 06:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they are caught,
they will be killed.

06:02.900 --> 06:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

for urging her boyfriend
to commit suicide.

Michelle Carter sent hundreds
of text messages to Conrad Roy.

06:21.333 --> 06:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In July of 2014, Roy
filled his truck with
deadly carbon monoxide,
then got out, contacted

06:28.433 --> 06:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Carter, and told
her he was scared.

06:30.633 --> 06:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She responded: "Get back in."

06:33.000 --> 06:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She could get as much
as 20 years in prison.

after being shot this week.

06:44.800 --> 06:49.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

when a gunman opened
fire at a congressional
Republican baseball

06:49.666 --> 06:51.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
practice.

06:51.766 --> 06:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scalise is still in critical
condition, and is expected
to have additional surgery.

fight in Afghanistan; new

much more.

08:18.466 --> 08:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

He commanded American and

08:47.200 --> 08:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We spoke a short time ago.

08:49.266 --> 08:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I started by asking him
about reports that the Trump
administration will soon send

08:53.266 --> 08:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
4,000 additional U.S. troops
to Afghanistan, and whether
he thinks it is a smart move.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

09:01.633 --> 09:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS (RET.),
Former Commander, U.S.
Central Command: I think
it is, and it's heartening.

09:03.633 --> 09:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what we need to get to
in Afghanistan is a sustainable,
measuring the expenditure

09:08.300 --> 09:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of blood and treasure,
a sustainable,
sustained commitment.

09:11.533 --> 09:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to recognize that we
went there for a reason and we
stayed for a reason, to ensure

09:15.733 --> 09:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Afghanistan is not
once again a sanctuary
for al-Qaida or other
transnational extremists,

09:20.533 --> 09:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way it was when the 9/11
attacks were planned there.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's why we need to stay.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also have a very useful
platform there for the regional
counterterrorist effort.

09:30.566 --> 09:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, we have greatly
reduced the capabilities of
al-Qaida's senior leaders

09:34.766 --> 09:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in that region, including,
of course, taking
out Osama bin Laden.

09:38.866 --> 09:40.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this is a
generational struggle.

09:40.733 --> 09:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not something that is
going to be won in a few years.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not going to take
a hill, plant a flag, go
home to a victory parade.

09:46.966 --> 09:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need to be there for
the long haul, but in a way
that is, again, sustainable.

09:51.200 --> 09:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been in Korea
for 65-plus years because
there is an important
national interest for

09:57.400 --> 09:59.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were in Europe for a very
long period of time, still
there, of course, and actually

10:01.966 --> 10:06.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with a renewed emphasis
now, given Russia's
aggressive actions.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's the way
we need to approach this.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, to be sure, the forces...

10:10.300 --> 10:12.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:12.300 --> 10:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you
saying we may need to stay in
Afghanistan 60, 70, 80 years?

10:14.466 --> 10:16.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: I wouldn't say
60, but I think we shouldn't
approach this as a year-on-year

10:19.733 --> 10:20.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mission.

10:20.966 --> 10:22.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that was
actually harmful.

10:22.966 --> 10:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it gave all of the
Afghan leaders and so forth were
-- basically get the jitters.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those who are investing money
consider every year whether
to keep it there or whether to

10:32.533 --> 10:34.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go to Dubai.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this is an important
interest, and I think we ought
to have a sustained commitment,

10:38.333 --> 10:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but at a level that
is sustainable.

10:40.433 --> 10:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think a few more, 3,000
to 5,000 more troops, are
very sustainable, but also we

10:46.700 --> 10:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should relax the remaining
restrictions on the use of our
airpower to support our Afghan

10:51.033 --> 10:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
partners who have shown that
they are willing to fight and
die for their country against

10:54.900 --> 10:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
al-Qaida, the insurgents of
various types and so forth.

10:58.833 --> 11:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, of course,
the reason I'm asking, as
Americans look at Afghanistan,

11:02.133 --> 11:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you say we may need to
stay decades and decades.

11:04.700 --> 11:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have been there, the
United States, 15 years.

11:06.733 --> 11:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At times, we have had over
100,000 U.S. troops there.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That didn't turn
back the Taliban.

11:12.833 --> 11:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why should 3,000 or 4,000?

11:13.833 --> 11:15.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: It did
actually turn back the Taliban.

11:16.433 --> 11:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You will remember I
was the commander.

11:17.666 --> 11:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But
not permanently.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

11:19.133 --> 11:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: Not permanently.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As I said, we are not going
to permanently win this.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keep in mind, there's a huge
difference between Afghanistan
and even Iraq when we did the

11:26.633 --> 11:28.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
surge there.

11:28.700 --> 11:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't pressure the leaders
of the Afghan Taliban, the
Haqqani Network, and even some

11:34.166 --> 11:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the other insurgent
groups, because they're
out of our reach.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're in sanctuaries
inside Pakistan.

11:38.700 --> 11:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, indeed, there should be
a regional effort there to try
to get our Pakistani partners

11:45.466 --> 11:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do more to deny this
sanctuary to those elements that
are making life so difficult

11:50.933 --> 11:53.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for Afghans and the
Afghan government.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other
comment being made, General
Petraeus, though, is
that the administration

11:56.500 --> 12:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has not laid out what its
strategy is for Afghanistan.

12:00.966 --> 12:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
General Mattis himself said this
week, we're still working on it.

12:03.933 --> 12:04.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: They are.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, indeed, I understand
there have been a number of
meetings at the principals level

12:09.200 --> 12:10.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and so forth.

12:10.433 --> 12:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The national security
team is working on that.

12:12.500 --> 12:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do think you can anticipate
an integrated strategy.

12:18.666 --> 12:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Again, the troops are
just a part of this.

12:20.666 --> 12:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're an important part,
because, without them, without
halting the erosion of security

12:26.800 --> 12:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that has characterized
Afghanistan over the
last year or more, then
you're going to have

12:31.100 --> 12:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a serious problem on your hands.

12:33.066 --> 12:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk
about ISIS in Syria - - you
mentioned Syria -- and in Iraq.

12:36.600 --> 12:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are told progress is being
made against ISIS on the
battlefield, but the coalition

12:43.666 --> 12:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airstrikes, we are now told,
these Strikes are resulting
in hundreds and hundreds of

12:48.366 --> 12:50.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
civilian deaths.

12:50.433 --> 12:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that the price that
Americans should be prepared
to pay to get ahead of ISIS?

12:54.566 --> 12:56.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

12:56.633 --> 13:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: We should
absolutely minimize the civilian
deaths, and there's no question

13:01.766 --> 13:03.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that there will
be more of these.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This does happen in wartime.

13:05.366 --> 13:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There will be far fewer than
certainly what the extremists,
these very barbaric Islamic

13:11.866 --> 13:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
State forces, have done.

13:13.733 --> 13:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is an enemy
that's literally sheltering
among the civilians.

13:17.866 --> 13:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what's making it so
difficult to take this last
remnant of the Islamic State in

13:22.600 --> 13:23.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mosul.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is now old
Mosul, the Old City.

13:25.900 --> 13:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, remember, I spent a year
there as a two-star when we were
in charge of Northern Iraq with

13:29.966 --> 13:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 101st Airborne.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a rabbits warren.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's very tight.

13:34.233 --> 13:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very difficult.

13:36.266 --> 13:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the enemy has literally just
-- literally barricaded itself
in there with snipers, with

13:40.266 --> 13:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suicide bombers, with
explosives, rooms
and houses rigged,
surrounding themselves with

13:45.866 --> 13:48.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
civilians.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is the most
diabolically difficult
challenge, even for the very
skilled counterterrorism

13:52.600 --> 13:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
forces of the Iraqi army.

13:55.133 --> 13:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what's really
slowed this down.

13:56.933 --> 13:59.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can expect some
of that in Raqqa.

13:59.133 --> 14:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That operation has
now began in Syria.

14:01.133 --> 14:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That was until recently
presumably the Islamic
State headquarters.

14:08.166 --> 14:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are reports that some of
these leaders have already led
and moved town the Euphrates

14:12.133 --> 14:15.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
River Valley further
to Deir el-Zour.

14:15.933 --> 14:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's going to be a tough
fight, but it's a much
smaller city compared
to the two million,

14:20.200 --> 14:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
let's say, of probably a quarter
or less the size of Mosul.

14:23.766 --> 14:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm moving us
through some very difficult
areas very quickly, but I now

14:27.866 --> 14:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to turn now to Saudi
Arabia, the Gulf nations.

14:31.100 --> 14:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump was there just
very recently trying to put
-- present a united front with

14:38.533 --> 14:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Saudis and these
other countries, mainly
against Iran, but it
turns out they are -- they

14:43.200 --> 14:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have turned against Qatar, and
the president has signaled that
he has problems with Qatar's

14:51.333 --> 14:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support for
terrorist activities.

14:53.533 --> 14:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, his
administration has said,
we hope these countries
can work together.

14:58.133 --> 15:02.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What is the strategy,
the approach that the
United -- that we should
expect, that we should

15:02.833 --> 15:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understand as Americans
about the administration's
policy there?

15:06.133 --> 15:08.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

15:08.100 --> 15:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID PETRAEUS: Well,
Secretary of State Tillerson
is taking charge of this now.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's trying to get the
temperature down some.

15:12.533 --> 15:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clearly, there's been a
frustration that boiled
over with the Emiratis,
our close partners

15:19.433 --> 15:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Emiratis and the
Saudis, against our other
close partners the Qataris.

15:23.266 --> 15:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, it's the Central
Command forward headquarters.

15:25.900 --> 15:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My forward headquarters
is inside -- outside Doha
at Al Udeid Air Base.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They gave us $100
million for that.

15:31.900 --> 15:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have to say, at times,
I went there and said, look,
you're giving us all this

15:36.666 --> 15:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
money for our forward
headquarters, and then
Al-Jazeera is hammering
us every day in the

15:41.500 --> 15:42.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is something
not right here.

15:44.800 --> 15:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And similar frustrations have,
again, just boiled over, also,
the allegations of support

15:50.066 --> 15:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of political Islam.

15:52.066 --> 15:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to understand that,
for the Emiratis especially,
there is more worry about Muslim

15:57.933 --> 16:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brotherhood kind of activity
than there actually is with
Iran or even the Islamic State.

16:03.700 --> 16:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed
will explain, we can see the
extremists, we can see the

16:07.233 --> 16:08.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Iranians.

16:08.633 --> 16:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The insidious creep of political
Islam is more difficult.

16:11.200 --> 16:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Qatar has allowed the heads
of Hamas, Muslim Brothers, other
political Islam organizations

16:17.533 --> 16:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the region to locate there.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These are all three our
friends, our partners.

16:23.566 --> 16:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope would be that, in
this case, Secretary of
State Tillerson can indeed
get the temperatures

16:30.300 --> 16:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down, get talking going on
behind closed doors, rather than
out as visibly as it has been,

16:35.900 --> 16:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because that makes it very
difficult, and you start to back
different friends into corners.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But it's hard.

16:42.333 --> 16:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States, in some
respects, needs to avoid being
engaged in a beauty contest,

16:46.133 --> 16:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where we have to say which
is the fairest of them all.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not fair to us and
it's not fair to them.

16:51.433 --> 16:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think that this
is resolvable, but it's
not going to be easy.

16:55.333 --> 16:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: General
David Petraeus, thank you
very much for stopping by.

16:59.466 --> 17:00.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

17:00.733 --> 17:05.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID PETRAEUS:
Pleasure, as always.

17:07.633 --> 17:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we reported
earlier, President Trump took
steps to roll back some parts of

17:15.133 --> 17:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Obama administration's
opening to Cuba, which began
two-and-a-half years ago.

17:21.566 --> 17:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang reports now on what's
out and what stays in effect.

17:27.966 --> 17:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump
made the announcement
in Miami's Little Havana
before an enthusiastic

17:32.100 --> 17:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crowd in a packed auditorium.

17:34.066 --> 17:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: Effective
immediately, I am canceling the

17:37.833 --> 17:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last administration's completely
one-sided deal with Cuba.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

17:46.300 --> 17:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: While the president's
action falls short of canceling,
he said it fulfills a

17:49.500 --> 17:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
campaign promise to
undo President Obama's
re-engagement with Cuba.

17:54.133 --> 17:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, Former President
of the United States: Today,
the United States of America

17:56.733 --> 17:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is changing its relationship
with the people of Cuba.

17:59.633 --> 18:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In December 2014, Mr.
Obama restored diplomatic ties
with the island nation, after

18:05.500 --> 18:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than 50 years of hostility.

18:08.800 --> 18:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In March 2016, he became the
first U.S. president to visit
Cuba in nearly a century.

18:15.733 --> 18:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump says his
focus is halting the flow of
U.S. dollars to the communist

18:20.600 --> 18:22.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Our policy will
seek a much better deal for
the Cuban people and for the

18:25.800 --> 18:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
United States of America.

18:27.900 --> 18:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We do not want U.S. dollars to
prop up a military monopoly that
exploits and abuses the citizens

18:34.600 --> 18:36.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of Cuba.

18:36.666 --> 18:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The new policy bans
transactions with enterprises,
including hotels and other

18:40.433 --> 18:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tourist-related businesses,
ultimately owned by
the Cuban military.

18:44.700 --> 18:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump is also reinstating
a rule that restricts
individual travel, and requires

18:49.633 --> 18:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most visits to Cuba to be
in group tours organized
by American companies.

18:56.666 --> 19:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the policy continues
direct commercial flights
between the two countries.

19:02.233 --> 19:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The administration will also
maintain the U.S. Embassy
in Havana, but still with no

19:05.766 --> 19:07.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ambassador.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In Havana today, Cubans reacted.

19:09.600 --> 19:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Trump's words simply
seem a bit ambiguous.

19:13.066 --> 19:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the governments want the
best for both the Cuban and
American people, they have to

19:17.300 --> 19:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look out for the common things
that exist between the two.

19:20.300 --> 19:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): If
definitely feels like a huge
setback in the relationship

19:25.100 --> 19:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between Cuba and
the United States.

19:27.166 --> 19:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see what happens, but,
right now, I think it's like
going back to the Cold War.

19:31.366 --> 19:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: None of the
changes will take effect
until the U.S. Treasury
and Commerce Departments

19:37.533 --> 19:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issue new regulations,
which could take months.

19:41.166 --> 19:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on the revised policy,
and how it's being understood
in Cuba, we turn to Alan

19:45.700 --> 19:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gomez of USA Today, who
joins us from Havana.

19:49.266 --> 19:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alan, thanks for being with us.

19:51.766 --> 19:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard in the tape
piece a little smattering
of some reaction from
the streets of Havana,

19:57.033 --> 19:59.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but I know you have been
out reporting today.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are you hearing
from average Cubans in
Havana about this change?

20:02.400 --> 20:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ, USA Today: I mean,
it's been a level of confusion,
of sadness, of disgust,

20:06.966 --> 20:07.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of anger.

20:07.966 --> 20:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know, just imagine.

20:10.033 --> 20:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These people have lived here for
decades without any interaction
with the United States, with

20:16.266 --> 20:18.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the U.S. just treating
them as an enemy and
closing off to them.

20:18.233 --> 20:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, two-and-a-half years
ago, they get this opening, and
they talk about this period,

20:22.333 --> 20:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already in the past tense, as
this glorious period where they
were able to have more Americans

20:27.233 --> 20:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down here, interact with them
more, and visit the U.S. more.

20:30.333 --> 20:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now Trump has taken it
not all away, but has really
cut that back significantly.

20:34.966 --> 20:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, yes, there's a lot of anger
here right now and a lot of
confusion over why it's being

20:40.466 --> 20:42.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How have they
talked about how their lives
have changed, what difference

20:45.366 --> 20:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this past two years
has been to them?

20:47.466 --> 20:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: Well, understand,
Cuba, the state-run economy, you
only get a certain salary from

20:52.133 --> 20:53.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the government.

20:53.533 --> 20:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You only get certain
benefits from the government.

20:55.300 --> 20:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So what they rely on so heavily
across the board is tourism.

20:59.233 --> 21:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what it's done is infused a
whole lot of Americans down here
over these past two-and-a-half

21:04.700 --> 21:06.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you think about everybody
from private restaurant owners,
to private taxies, to tour

21:10.033 --> 21:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guides, all these people that
interact with Americans, they're
all the ones that are getting

21:13.900 --> 21:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that benefit directly.

21:15.900 --> 21:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump talked a lot
today about how all of the money
that's been going down over

21:19.733 --> 21:24.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
these last couple of
years is going straight
to the Cuban government.

21:24.100 --> 21:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I can tell you, from being
down here quite a bit over the
last couple of years and talking

21:27.233 --> 21:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to folks today, that
they are saying that,
no, they get a lot of it.

21:30.800 --> 21:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, of course some of it goes
to the government, but they're
upset that, to punish the Cuban

21:35.700 --> 21:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government, they're the ones
that are getting hurt as well.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: How
will they get hurt?

21:39.066 --> 21:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How will life change for them
under these changed rules?

21:43.166 --> 21:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Well, it's
a combination of things.

21:45.866 --> 21:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's, quite simply, fewer
American tourists are going to
be able to make the trip because

21:49.300 --> 21:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the way that the Trump
administration is going
to change the visa system.

21:53.600 --> 21:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is going to be a lot
harder for American tourists
now to get to the U.S.

21:57.233 --> 22:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, if you're an
American and want to come down
to Cuba, hop online, you can

22:01.633 --> 22:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figure out your trip, and you
can pretty much get your visa
at the airport counter on your

22:05.466 --> 22:07.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way down here.

22:07.533 --> 22:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now they are going to go back
to the old way, where you have
to apply beforehand to the

22:10.300 --> 22:12.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
federal government, get
approval to go down.

22:12.700 --> 22:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the people down
here in Cuba are just
expecting that that torrent
of American visitors

22:18.733 --> 22:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is going to dry up.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then there's another aspect.

22:21.900 --> 22:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are just all these
private business owners that
have had a lot of interaction

22:23.933 --> 22:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the last few years, going
to the United States, working
with U.S. businesspeople,

22:27.866 --> 22:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting training in the
United States and bringing
those lessons back to Cuba.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so they're worried that that
is going to be limited as well.

22:33.500 --> 22:36.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Alan, in the
less than a minute we
have left, I want to ask
you about a development

22:36.666 --> 22:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on your regular beat,
which is immigration.

22:39.366 --> 22:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Trump administration
announced last night
that they were going to
keep the program that

22:44.233 --> 22:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protects from deportation
undocumented immigrants
who came as children.

22:51.300 --> 22:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president during the
campaign said he was going do
away with that, he was going

22:54.566 --> 22:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to change that Obama policy.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you make of this,
deciding to keep this?

22:59.900 --> 23:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: What the
president did was pretty
much eliminate a program
that would have protected

23:03.533 --> 23:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their parents from deportation.

23:05.700 --> 23:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That program, there's
no immediate effect of
that, because all --
that program had been

23:09.833 --> 23:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on hold in the courts
for some time now.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But what it does is, it
means that those parents
are never going to get
any sort of legal status

23:16.866 --> 23:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under this president.

23:18.933 --> 23:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, more than that, it means
that those children that have
been protected from deportation

23:22.000 --> 23:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under the Deferred Action for
Childhood Arrivals program, now
they are worried that they are

23:25.766 --> 23:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to have that
taken away from them.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Although, in the
president's announcement,
or the administration
announcement last night,

23:30.633 --> 23:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they specifically said that
that program would remain,
would remain in place.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Alan Gomez of USA Today
from Havana, Cuba,

ALAN GOMEZ: Thank you.

23:46.233 --> 23:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:52.566 --> 23:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
the long road to recovery
after staying in the ICU; Mark

23:59.133 --> 24:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shields and David Brooks take
on the week's news; and an
author explains why she went

24:04.866 --> 24:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
against her friends'
advice and followed her
boyfriend to a new city.

24:10.733 --> 24:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: It was a shooting
that captured the nation's
attention last summer, at the

24:14.333 --> 24:18.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
same time it was already
grappling with tensions
over police shootings.

24:18.366 --> 24:22.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, today, the jury
reached a verdict in the
trial of the officer.

24:22.633 --> 24:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the latest.

24:24.700 --> 24:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Philando
Castile was shot when his car
was pulled over for a traffic

24:28.700 --> 24:30.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stop last July.

24:30.700 --> 24:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His girlfriend was in the car,
and live-streamed the aftermath
on Facebook moments later.

24:37.166 --> 24:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officer Jeronimo Yanez said
at the time that he believed
Castile was reaching for a gun.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Castile's family and
girlfriend disputed that.

24:44.833 --> 24:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yanez had been charged with
second-degree manslaughter
and endangering safety.

24:51.566 --> 24:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This afternoon, a jury acquitted
him of all charges after
five days of deliberations.

24:56.566 --> 24:58.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Soon after, his mother
and sister came out
and spoke to reporters.

24:58.533 --> 25:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALERIE CASTILE, Mother of
Philando Castile: My son was
murdered, and I will continue to

25:03.466 --> 25:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say murdered, because where
in this planet do you tell
the truth, and you be honest,

25:10.433 --> 25:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you still be murdered by
the police of Minnesota, while
you have your seat belt on

25:18.633 --> 25:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you're in the company
with a woman and a child?

25:22.633 --> 25:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My son would never jeopardize
anyone else's life.

25:25.900 --> 25:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLYSZA CASTILE, Sister of
Philando Castile: The system
really is wrong, and they really

25:29.733 --> 25:31.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
failed us.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They really failed us,
once again, because my
brother was a good man.

25:37.133 --> 25:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You never even heard
him raise his voice.

25:39.733 --> 25:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You never even heard him yell.

25:42.533 --> 25:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for that man to get on the
stand and lie, he got caught
in three, four, five different

25:49.566 --> 25:52.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lies.

25:52.033 --> 25:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was
the most recent example
of an officer being
acquitted in a high-profile

25:55.533 --> 25:56.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shooting.

25:56.933 --> 25:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The jury had been
deadlocked in recent days.

25:58.966 --> 26:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tim Nelson of Minnesota
Public Radio has been covering
the trial and joins me now.

26:02.533 --> 26:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tim, first, you were
in the courtroom.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The reaction?

26:05.966 --> 26:10.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TIM NELSON, Minnesota
Public Radio: It was
swift and shocking.

26:10.300 --> 26:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Castile family was
sitting in the courtroom.

26:12.533 --> 26:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The judge had asked people to
be quiet while the verdicts
were read, but as soon as the

26:16.133 --> 26:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not-guilty verdict for the
manslaughter account was
returned, Valerie Castile
-- that's Philando's

26:22.966 --> 26:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mother -- got up and
started shouting profanity
in the courtroom.

26:26.133 --> 26:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She had been -- the people in
the court had been told to wait
until all the verdicts were

26:30.833 --> 26:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
read before they left, and
she pushed her way out, was
joined by many of her friends

26:37.800 --> 26:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and family, visibly upset,
very, very angry about
the verdict here today.

26:42.933 --> 26:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other side, the friends
and family, some of the fellow
officers of Jeronimo Yanez

26:48.566 --> 26:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
were weeping as well,
clearly relieved that
this ordeal is over.

26:52.633 --> 26:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been going on
almost a year now.

26:54.733 --> 26:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was charged in November.

26:56.966 --> 27:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, a lot of angst
initially in the courtroom.

27:00.833 --> 27:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tim, the
county attorney when he was
bringing these charges said no

27:04.033 --> 27:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
reasonable officer
would have used deadly
force in this situation.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why wasn't he able
to convince a jury?

27:09.200 --> 27:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIM NELSON: Well, I think there
were three real factors here.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of them was, we saw for
the first time the squad car
video, the perspective of the

27:16.666 --> 27:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officer, or at least
from his dash-cam.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what we saw was, this
happened very quickly.

27:22.433 --> 27:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you could feel the emotion,
you could feel the tension in
this situation as it happened.

27:29.366 --> 27:30.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's confounding.

27:30.766 --> 27:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't see what was
actually going on in the car.

27:33.266 --> 27:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that that
left some doubt there.

27:35.900 --> 27:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing is, the defense
continued to return to the
THC found in Mr. Castile's

27:42.233 --> 27:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blood after he died.

27:44.300 --> 27:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They continued to suggest that
he had been smoking marijuana,
and that may have clouded

27:48.700 --> 27:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his judgment when he told the
officer that pulled him over
that he had a gun, that he

27:53.366 --> 27:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may not have done it in a way
that lessened the risk that
they both faced in this case.

28:00.466 --> 28:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the third thing
in this case was Officer Yanez
actually taking the stand last

28:04.300 --> 28:06.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Friday.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was near tears as he talked
about the fear he felt, the
tension he felt, the thoughts

28:09.933 --> 28:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his family running through
his mind as he encountered
Philando Castile for those

28:18.533 --> 28:21.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first few seconds
of this incident.

28:21.400 --> 28:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it, I think, may have left
some doubt in the jury's mind.

28:28.400 --> 28:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, there are some
Supreme Court cases, Graham vs.
Connor, that give the benefit

28:32.166 --> 28:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the doubt in a lot of these
cases to a police officer.

28:35.966 --> 28:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They urge the jury to think
about it from the officer's
perspective in the moment, not

28:41.833 --> 28:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in perfect 20/20 hindsight.

28:43.933 --> 28:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tim, we
learned in this process that
Mr. Castile had a permit for

28:46.433 --> 28:47.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that weapon.

28:47.900 --> 28:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what's the level of concern
or anger in your community?

28:50.200 --> 28:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember, right after this
incident, there were protests
on your streets for days and

28:53.933 --> 28:55.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TIM NELSON: Not
just on our streets.

28:57.800 --> 29:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They closed an interstate
between the two cities in what
authorities later called a

29:03.266 --> 29:04.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
riot.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were police officers
injured in that incident.

29:08.033 --> 29:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The protesters occupied
the front of the governor's
mansion for weeks here.

29:11.633 --> 29:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, you remember,
this happened just after the
shooting in Louisiana and had

29:15.966 --> 29:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been -- it sort of added
to the tension there.

29:20.466 --> 29:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We haven't seen those kinds of
protests lately, but as soon as
I walked out of the courtroom

29:24.033 --> 29:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, as soon as I walked out
of the courthouse, there were
people with hand-lettered signs

29:27.300 --> 29:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shouting, making their
voices, their unhappiness
about this verdict.

29:32.233 --> 29:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's clear there are some
people who are very angry
about this, and we may see some

29:38.100 --> 29:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more of that coming up soon.

29:40.100 --> 29:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Tim Nelson of Minnesota
Public Radio, thanks so much.

29:47.700 --> 29:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More than five
million Americans are admitted
into hospital intensive care

29:58.600 --> 30:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
units, or ICUs, each year.

30:00.933 --> 30:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Undoubtedly, they are a crucial
component of the health care
system for treating seriously

30:07.100 --> 30:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ill patients and
preventing deaths.

30:09.033 --> 30:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some patients also
eventually leave the ICU with
new complications and problems.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Jackie
Judd looks at those concerns
and an effort to make sure

30:19.066 --> 30:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
patients are getting
the right interventions.

30:21.466 --> 30:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Well, as soon as we get
this ultrasound done, we are
going to get your lights on and

30:27.733 --> 30:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your windows open, OK?

30:29.733 --> 30:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Every year, almost
six million patients land in
an intensive care unit, and,

30:35.533 --> 30:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through often heroic
efforts, lives are saved.

30:38.833 --> 30:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many of those survivors,
that period of time becomes
a bright line in their lives

30:44.733 --> 30:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of before and after.

30:46.833 --> 30:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL TURPIN, Was Admitted to
ICU: I am very aware that I am
not the same person who went

30:51.800 --> 30:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into the hospital with sepsis.

30:54.166 --> 30:56.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I am just not.

30:56.333 --> 30:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: In what ways?

30:59.033 --> 31:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL TURPIN: Well,
my personality.

31:01.733 --> 31:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm shorter-tempered, mood
change, mild depression.

31:04.933 --> 31:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Paul Turpin,
an endocrinologist
who lives outside of
Nashville with his wife,

31:11.100 --> 31:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mary Lou, spent a
month in an ICU.

31:14.300 --> 31:19.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was two-and-a-half
years ago.

31:21.266 --> 31:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richard Langford's first ICU
stay was a decade ago, and he
has not lived on his own since.

31:27.233 --> 31:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD LANGFORD, Was
Admitted to ICU: Mom is the
one who takes care of me.

31:30.133 --> 31:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, my mother is 88 years old.

31:33.733 --> 31:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Psychologist Jim
Jackson leads this support
group, and is part of a team

31:40.666 --> 31:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Vanderbilt University Medical
Center that helped identify
a constellation of symptoms

31:46.633 --> 31:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mimicking PTSD, post-traumatic
stress disorder.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They call it post-intensive
care syndrome, or PICS.

31:54.400 --> 31:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JIM JACKSON, Vanderbilt
University Medical
Center: They don't have
a traumatic experience

31:58.133 --> 32:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the way that a combat veteran
or a rape survivor would,
so they're not referred to

32:04.000 --> 32:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a mental health professional.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They really fall
through the cracks.

32:06.700 --> 32:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
With all of these gaps, there
just is a lack of awareness.

32:09.733 --> 32:11.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How do you feel?

32:11.666 --> 32:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Dr. Wes Ely
has studied this phenomenon
for almost 20 years.

32:18.566 --> 32:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says the risk factors are
clear: powerful sedatives and
prolonged use of ventilators,

32:23.233 --> 32:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which can trigger delirium.

32:25.433 --> 32:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Some ICU patients need
those interventions,
but not all of them do.

32:29.233 --> 32:31.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES ELY, Vanderbilt University
Medical Center: We had to tie
people down, so they wouldn't

32:33.433 --> 32:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pull lines and tubes out, but
we also chemically restrained
them with these deep sedatives.

32:38.566 --> 32:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we got comfortable pummeling
people's brains with gargantuan
amounts of benzodiazepines,

32:42.900 --> 32:45.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
propofol, and other
types of sedation.

32:45.700 --> 32:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We put them in this cocoon,
but it wasn't a safe one.

32:49.700 --> 32:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when we started measuring
delirium, and then started
measuring physical immobility,

32:54.400 --> 32:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it unveiled this issue of PICS.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Hi, sweetie.

32:59.633 --> 33:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you open your eyes?

33:01.700 --> 33:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: A substantial
number of patients leave the ICU
with newly-acquired problems,

33:08.200 --> 33:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ranging from dementia,
to depression, to muscle
and nerve disease.

33:12.166 --> 33:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Ely has been following
some of them for six years,
and will soon release a study.

33:19.100 --> 33:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Preliminary data show one-third
of patients improve and get
back to normal cognitive and

33:23.966 --> 33:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
functioning levels.

33:25.933 --> 33:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One-third remain the same as
the day they left the hospital.

33:29.366 --> 33:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And one-third
decline even further.

33:31.900 --> 33:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We should talk about
whether we should move the tube
to the neck, OK, because that

33:38.400 --> 33:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
will allow us to
decrease the amount of
sedation that you're on.

33:41.300 --> 33:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: So, leaders
in acute care developed a
different ICU treatment.

33:48.800 --> 33:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When possible, they keep
patients out of the cocoon
by reducing the use of
drugs and ventilators,

33:52.500 --> 33:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and by getting patients moving.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES ELY: Turning off of sedation
every day and turning off
the ventilator every day gets

33:58.333 --> 34:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people out of the hospital
sooner, it decreases
cost of care and it
helps improve survival.

34:02.900 --> 34:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Hospitals across
the country have been slow
to adopt the practices in use

34:07.433 --> 34:10.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here at Vanderbilt.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been more than four
years since the Society
of Critical Care Medicine
issued new treatment

34:15.566 --> 34:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guidelines for controlling pain
and delirium in the ICU, and,
yet today, the organization

34:21.400 --> 34:23.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
describes compliance
as mediocre.

34:23.866 --> 34:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: We're going to
get you every day up
as much as we can, OK?

34:27.066 --> 34:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Coaxing patients
out of bed to exercise takes
a lot more staff time than

34:32.666 --> 34:34.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sedating them.

34:34.166 --> 34:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And getting doctors to change
what has long been done is hard.

34:37.733 --> 34:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES ELY: A lot of it has
to do with people in long
white coats, the doctors.

34:41.433 --> 34:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The doctors are used
to how they do things.

34:44.166 --> 34:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't want to be told
to do it a different way,
and they're late adopters.

34:48.566 --> 34:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have early adopters in life,
and we have late adopters,
and the doctors think, well,

34:52.366 --> 34:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is an invisible problem.

34:53.633 --> 34:54.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't see it.

34:54.866 --> 34:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't see it as
an issue anyway.

34:56.933 --> 35:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can't even necessarily
envision what it is that
could happen so much better.

35:02.633 --> 35:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Vanderbilt used
to release patients from
the ICU with no follow-up.

35:09.433 --> 35:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now it is one of a handful of
hospitals with post-ICU clinics.

35:15.566 --> 35:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a way station
for patients at risk.

35:17.900 --> 35:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The goal is to be a bridge to
a medical world with little
awareness of the syndrome.

35:24.066 --> 35:26.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dr. Carla Sevin is
one of the founders.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

35:28.133 --> 35:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLA SEVIN, Vanderbilt
University Medical Center: The
main purpose of the clinic is

35:30.200 --> 35:33.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to sort of bridge this
million-dollar intensive
care time to this
outpatient status, which

35:35.600 --> 35:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not set up to take care of
the multipronged problems that
people experience after the

35:41.733 --> 35:42.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ICU.

35:42.966 --> 35:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RICHARD LANGFORD: That
might be permanent.

35:45.100 --> 35:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The clinic also
organizes the support group
where Richard Langford is a

35:49.433 --> 35:51.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regular.

35:51.433 --> 35:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD LANGFORD: It helps
give me a structure for why I'm
feeling the way I do, and that

35:57.866 --> 36:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not going crazy.

36:00.533 --> 36:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This anxiety, it is -- is not
something that will kill me.

36:07.600 --> 36:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's not something that
I have to worry about,
and keep worrying about
worrying about worrying.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL TURPIN: Thank you,
lord, for this nice day.

36:14.633 --> 36:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: As for Paul Turpin,
he is happily back practicing
medicine, and still managing

36:21.433 --> 36:24.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
emotional ups and downs,
including a lingering
sense of terror, which
is common among ICU

36:27.133 --> 36:28.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patients.

36:28.366 --> 36:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL TURPIN: Fear of
ever being in an ICU.

36:34.333 --> 36:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: What is
that fear rooted in?

36:37.800 --> 36:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL TURPIN: Being back in
those circumstances, being out
of control, being wrapped up in

36:42.033 --> 36:43.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that cocoon.

36:43.700 --> 36:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: Is it what
you fear the most in
your life at the moment?

36:46.600 --> 36:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL TURPIN: Probably.

36:48.433 --> 36:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WES ELY: You know, you're
an inspiration to us.

36:51.866 --> 36:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Dr. Ely, who
travels worldwide to spread the
word about PICS, says he senses

36:58.500 --> 37:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a momentum to shift ICU
care in order to reduce
the harm it can cause.

37:04.933 --> 37:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES ELY: People were built to
be vertical and moving around,
not lying in a bed 24/7.

37:10.333 --> 37:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we're trying to get back to
the humanness of critical care.

37:14.000 --> 37:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Even so, he
predicts it will be at least
five years before what happens

37:21.033 --> 37:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this ICU becomes the norm for
patients being treated at the
most vulnerable and frightening

37:27.766 --> 37:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time of their lives.

37:29.800 --> 37:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jackie Judd in
Nashville, Tennessee.

37:39.166 --> 37:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.

37:46.400 --> 37:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

37:50.733 --> 37:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, gentlemen, it's been
another tumultuous week,
on top of several others.

37:57.766 --> 38:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had the attorney general
of the United States testifying
before the Senate Intelligence

38:00.333 --> 38:02.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

38:02.400 --> 38:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we learned, I guess
in the last 48 hours, Mark,
that the investigation by the

38:06.133 --> 38:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
special counsel into the
Russia meddling in the election
has been expanded to include

38:12.633 --> 38:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
whether or not the
president committed
obstruction of justice.

38:15.333 --> 38:18.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is this a one-alarm
crisis, two-alarm?

38:18.566 --> 38:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are we making too
big a deal of this?

38:21.233 --> 38:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, based
on what the president
- - how the president's
reacting, Judy, I don't

38:25.266 --> 38:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think we're making
too big a deal of it.

38:27.300 --> 38:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the president, having
acted briefly presidential after
the tragedy of the shooting

38:33.966 --> 38:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Steve Scalise and the others
at the baseball field, has
reverted to form and gone back

38:41.266 --> 38:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to, as you reported at the
outset, now the man who told
me to fire the FBI director is

38:49.433 --> 38:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after me because -- is
investigating me because
of firing of the FBI
director, which is totally

38:56.366 --> 39:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contradictory to what the
president said to Lester Holt
on NBC, that the recommendation

39:02.500 --> 39:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Rod Rosenstein had nothing
to do with his decision to fire
James Comey as FBI director,

39:08.800 --> 39:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it was based solely on
Donald Trump's desire, as he
expressed to the Russians the

39:11.666 --> 39:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
next day in the Oval
Office, to get the Russian
investigation behind him.

39:18.700 --> 39:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I just think that he is
behaving like a man who really
wants to fire Robert Mueller

39:23.766 --> 39:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, you know, who didn't live
through October 20, 1973, when
President Nixon ordered Elliot

39:30.800 --> 39:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richardson to fire Archibald
Cox and the independent counsel,
and he refused and resigned.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And William Rucklehaus,
his deputy, resigned.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we had a
constitutional crisis.

39:41.366 --> 39:43.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it led to
impeachment hearings.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president is
calling it a witch-hunt, David.

39:45.266 --> 39:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House is saying
he didn't -- isn't going to
fire the special counsel.

39:49.433 --> 39:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it isn't clear.

39:50.566 --> 39:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There have been
reports out about that.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, it
may be a witch-hunt, but
he's acting like a witch.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:56.966 --> 39:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: To me, we have
had this -- the idea that there
has been collusion between

39:59.966 --> 40:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russians and the
Trump campaign has been
investigated for a long time.

40:04.933 --> 40:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so far, we have had no
really serious evidence that
they did collude, and everything

40:09.533 --> 40:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
else seems to be leaking out.

40:11.600 --> 40:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I begin to be a
little suspicious -- and
maybe I'm wrong -- we
will see over the long

40:14.600 --> 40:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
term -- whether there was
any actual act of collusion.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There were certainly
conversations maybe
about some building and
some investment, but so

40:21.166 --> 40:23.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
far, no evidence of
an underlying crime.

40:23.533 --> 40:25.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this, to me, is
not a criminal story.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a psychological story.

40:27.266 --> 40:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's a story about
a president who seems to
be under more pressure,
under more threat,

40:31.533 --> 40:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lashing out in ways that are
painfully self-destructive,
but also extremely
disturbing to anybody around

40:37.533 --> 40:39.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

40:39.633 --> 40:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so whether it's the North
Korean Cabinet hearing that
he held recently, where they

40:42.366 --> 40:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all had to praise him, or the
tweets as late as this morning,
this is not a president who

40:48.266 --> 40:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is projecting mental stability.

40:50.833 --> 40:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea that he will
fire somebody, whether
it's Mueller or anybody
else, seems very plausible.

40:57.000 --> 40:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, to me, if there is
something really damaging here,
it's something that has not

40:59.100 --> 41:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet happened caused by
the psychological pressure
that he apparently feels.

41:03.100 --> 41:05.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is.

41:05.166 --> 41:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are referring, are
reflecting back, Mark, to the
Whitewater investigation, the

41:09.066 --> 41:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Watergate investigation, that
what happened after the original
alleged crime made whatever

41:16.633 --> 41:18.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happened in the first
place much worse.

41:18.866 --> 41:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, the two
iron rules of Washington
scandals, Judy, is, it's never

41:23.733 --> 41:24.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the act itself.

41:24.900 --> 41:27.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Rule one, it's
always the cover-up.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And rule two is, everybody
always forgets rule one.

41:30.266 --> 41:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's -- but I think we
have got -- I'm not ready for
the clean bill of health yet.

41:37.300 --> 41:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got the transition to
go through and The New York
Times' Matt Apuzzo and Michael

41:41.100 --> 41:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Schmidt's story this week that
suggested that Robert Mueller
was looking at money laundering,

41:48.133 --> 41:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this would have been the
way, through the Russians, that
had been -- the beneficiaries

41:51.633 --> 41:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had received their payments
through offshore banks.

41:55.766 --> 42:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This kind of opened up a
new avenue that's reported
in The New York Times.

42:02.766 --> 42:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I just think that,
Judy, the abject lack, absence
of curiosity on the part of

42:09.533 --> 42:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the president in his
nine conversations with
the FBI correct or any
other -- anybody else,

42:17.066 --> 42:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and with the attorney
general before the Senate
Intelligence Committee,
abject lack of curiosity

42:21.500 --> 42:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in how the Russians did it.

42:23.966 --> 42:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you would come in
and you say 17 intelligence
agencies have concluded
the Russians tried

42:29.100 --> 42:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to sabotage the American
electoral process, and
there's not a single
question about, what

42:34.633 --> 42:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did they do, how did they
do it, how can we avoid it,
what can we do in the future?

42:38.100 --> 42:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Geez, no, let's go, let's
find the three million
people who were illegally
voting in California

42:43.566 --> 42:44.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
instead.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will appoint a
commission for that.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, Mark
does have a point, David, that
when the attorney general was

42:49.033 --> 42:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked about the -- a number
of things, one of the things
he said was that he had not

42:52.833 --> 42:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been briefed at all on
the Russia meddling.

42:55.266 --> 42:56.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

42:56.733 --> 42:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's in part why
it's a psychological issue.

42:58.900 --> 43:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every contact we know where
Donald Trump had conversations
about the Russia thing, he saw

43:03.500 --> 43:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through the prism of his
own victory and would he
get credit for the victory.

43:07.966 --> 43:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's perfectly plausible for
a normal human being to think,
well, I won the presidency,

43:11.766 --> 43:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the Russians also did
seriously endanger interests,
the American political system,

43:16.533 --> 43:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and, therefore, I'm
going to go after that.

43:18.800 --> 43:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so he -- but he's incapable
of seeing that second part.

43:21.433 --> 43:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's just, am I getting
full credit for what
I think I achieved?

43:24.400 --> 43:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's the intellectual
insecurity that I think
is overshadowing all else.

43:28.700 --> 43:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, by definition, can
spill -- this is why it's a
little different than Whitewater

43:32.833 --> 43:34.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Watergate.

43:34.833 --> 43:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nixon has his own psychological
complexities, but he was
someone who acted at least maybe

43:38.366 --> 43:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Machiavellian ways, but in
straightforward, linear ways.

43:41.066 --> 43:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, certainly, that
was true of Clinton.

43:43.700 --> 43:45.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
With this team, no.

43:45.700 --> 43:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the second thing to
be said is, Clinton had very
competent people around him, and

43:51.166 --> 43:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so did Richard Nixon.

43:52.100 --> 43:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not the case here.

43:54.233 --> 43:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you talked to the people
in the Clinton White House, it
was hell to be in that White

43:57.533 --> 43:59.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House.

43:59.700 --> 44:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They tried to build
these Chinese walls, so
they could do their jobs
while the investigation

44:01.233 --> 44:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was going on, and it was
super tough for them.

44:03.333 --> 44:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I imagine, especially when you
have got tweetstorms coming out,
it's near impossible to do your

44:09.733 --> 44:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job right now in any corner
of the Trump administration.

44:11.166 --> 44:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tweetstorms
from the president.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Just two
quick points, Judy.

44:13.833 --> 44:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is, Richard
Nixon was no Donald Trump.

44:16.433 --> 44:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Richard Nixon had
served four years in the United
States Navy as an officer, 14

44:20.366 --> 44:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
years in the House and
the Senate, eight years
as vice president, and
was a constant reader

44:24.966 --> 44:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of history and biography, may
have been the best-prepared
president in terms of experience

44:29.933 --> 44:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the history of the
nation, and has a record
of achievement that --
amply documented character

44:37.733 --> 44:42.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
defects and criminal
activity, but a historic
record of achievement,
whether it's OSHA or

44:43.566 --> 44:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EPA or whatever else.

44:45.533 --> 44:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two things that David's
mentioned, of that Cabinet
meeting, it was the most awkward

44:49.666 --> 44:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
event I have seen in 50 years.

44:51.800 --> 44:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is when
he went around the table and
asked each Cabinet member...

44:54.000 --> 44:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: To tell how
wonderful you were, not what I
did -- not only what I did on my

44:57.666 --> 45:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vacation, but how
wonderful you are.

45:00.366 --> 45:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there wasn't a single
member of that Cabinet,
with the exception of
Jim Mattis, the secretary

45:04.100 --> 45:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of defense, who escaped with
his or her self-respect intact.

45:07.500 --> 45:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, it was:
You're wonderful.

45:10.600 --> 45:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They love you in Mississippi.

45:11.833 --> 45:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're doing a great job.

45:13.400 --> 45:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody's better.

45:14.400 --> 45:15.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The economy is better.

45:15.400 --> 45:16.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything is terrific.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, this was just
-- this was scary.

45:18.700 --> 45:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the final thing was,
yesterday, he goes after Hillary
Clinton again, crooked Hillary.

45:23.533 --> 45:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he's trying to
rerun that 2016 election.

45:26.866 --> 45:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, all
this takes place, David,
in a week when, as you
both have mentioned,

45:31.533 --> 45:34.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the shooting happened.

45:34.033 --> 45:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans are practicing
for their annual
baseball game against the
Democrats in Congress,

45:40.000 --> 45:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and this man comes into
town from Illinois.

45:42.500 --> 45:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He ends up being killed,
grievously wounds
Congressman Steve Scalise,
still in the hospital

45:47.900 --> 45:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in critical condition.

45:49.366 --> 45:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
After this, we see a coming
together of the parties.

45:52.633 --> 45:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I wanted to show a picture.

45:54.666 --> 45:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is from the baseball game
last night, where you had --
or two nights ago -- where

45:58.100 --> 46:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you had the four leaders of
Congress there for once -- I
don't think we have ever seen

46:02.700 --> 46:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a picture like this -- coming
together looking like they at
least can tolerate each other.

46:09.466 --> 46:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

46:11.433 --> 46:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the thing that's symptomatic
of me -- for me is, I used
to think polarization was a

46:14.066 --> 46:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington phenomenon, that
the people on Capitol Hill
were polarized, but the country

46:17.800 --> 46:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was sort of still
a moderate nation.

46:20.033 --> 46:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think there is little
evidence to support that now.

46:22.266 --> 46:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a polarized country.

46:24.800 --> 46:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And most of the politicians
I know, members of Congress,
hate the system they're in.

46:28.566 --> 46:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're stuck in a much
more polarized world than
they wish they were in.

46:31.966 --> 46:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's out of the country.

46:33.366 --> 46:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that doesn't say the
shooter is any way symptomatic.

46:35.400 --> 46:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If anything, he's
an atypical nutcase.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it is a sign on the fringes.

46:40.500 --> 46:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have seen a ratcheting
up of violence.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We saw it, I thought, at the
conventions on both sides.

46:44.333 --> 46:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We saw it at the Trump
rallies on both sides.

46:47.300 --> 46:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the people on the fringes
of society, we have just
seen a ratcheting up in their

46:51.066 --> 46:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
feeling of justification
that they can resort
to violent means.

46:54.333 --> 46:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this guy apparently
had a list of people,
according to what's being
reported this afternoon,

46:59.266 --> 47:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of people he wanted to shoot.

47:01.900 --> 47:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's weaponizing
mentally disordered people
through the process of
political extremism.

47:09.100 --> 47:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this
coming together at all, Mark?

47:12.833 --> 47:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you see any enduring --
any endurance of that, or is
that just -- is it just going

47:17.600 --> 47:20.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be a blip?

47:20.133 --> 47:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: You hope,
Judy, but to David's
point, both parties --
according to Pew Research,

47:25.566 --> 47:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in both parties, what drives
the most activist wing is not
support and energy and advocacy

47:30.833 --> 47:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of their own side.

47:32.066 --> 47:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's loathing of the other side.

47:34.166 --> 47:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the gauge as to whether
you're going to be politically
involved, you're going to

47:37.533 --> 47:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote, and whether you're going
to contribute, how much do you
loathe the other party, how

47:40.833 --> 47:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much do you hate them.

47:42.866 --> 47:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there was a time, I will
be very blunt, when I came to
Washington, when the legitimacy

47:47.600 --> 47:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of your opponent was
never questioned.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You questioned their judgment.

47:52.000 --> 47:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You questioned their opinions
or their arguments, but
you never their legitimacy.

47:54.666 --> 47:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that changed.

47:56.533 --> 47:58.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it changed.

47:58.633 --> 48:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And one of the reasons
it changed is that a
man was elected from
the state of Georgia

48:03.966 --> 48:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who ran on the book, and the
book was, you use these words.

48:07.566 --> 48:09.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You use sick.

48:09.566 --> 48:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You refer pathetic, traitor,
liar, corrupt, shame,
enemy of normal Americans.

48:16.600 --> 48:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was Newt Gingrich's bible.

48:18.033 --> 48:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't an idea of a policy.

48:19.800 --> 48:21.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It wasn't a program.

48:21.266 --> 48:23.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He used it and he
became successful.

48:23.233 --> 48:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He became speaker of the House.

48:25.033 --> 48:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is a
clone of Newt Gingrich.

48:28.100 --> 48:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump used, Donald Trump,
lying Ted, and lightweight
Bobby Jindal, and Mitt Romney

48:35.400 --> 48:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
choked like a dog, and
used that language.

48:39.100 --> 48:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you're right.

48:41.100 --> 48:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The left has used similar
language and there has been a
response and almost a premium on

48:45.300 --> 48:47.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going after Trump in the
same sort of language.

48:47.933 --> 48:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there's been no punishment.

48:50.200 --> 48:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no political
downside for this tactic.

48:53.300 --> 48:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 45 seconds.

48:54.866 --> 48:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is one side more
responsible than another?

48:56.966 --> 49:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And are we going to
see any of this coming
together last, or is it...

49:01.433 --> 49:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, to me,
in 1970, people were asked,
would you mind it if your son

49:05.733 --> 49:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or daughter married someone
of the opposing party?

49:08.033 --> 49:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And 5 percent would mind.

49:10.100 --> 49:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now 40 percent mind, because
people think your political
affiliation is a sign of your

49:13.933 --> 49:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
worth, your values,
your philosophy, your
culture, your lifestyle.

49:16.833 --> 49:18.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's everything.

49:18.933 --> 49:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of a sudden, we have been
reduced to politics and we have
made politics into the ultimate

49:21.900 --> 49:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
source of our souls.

49:23.433 --> 49:25.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's -- it's
just -- that's not
what it should bearing.

49:25.166 --> 49:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just about arguments
about tax rates.

49:27.100 --> 49:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not everything.

49:28.266 --> 49:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS:
That's a good point.

49:30.133 --> 49:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields, thank you both.

49:31.700 --> 49:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

49:39.500 --> 49:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: New college
graduates are making
their way out into the
world with new rules,

49:48.800 --> 49:51.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
social circles and
morning alarms.

50:01.700 --> 50:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
peers were raised to believe.

CAROLINE KITCHENER, Author,
"Post Grad: Five Women and Their
First Year Out of College":

50:05.700 --> 50:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was a kid, Dr. Barbie was
the only Barbie in my closet,
and Disney princess movies

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always prompted the same
conversation with my mother:
Happy endings absolutely do not

50:17.400 --> 50:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
require a Prince Charming.

50:19.466 --> 50:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the adult women in my life
had to fight against the same
expectations: Get married,

50:25.400 --> 50:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have kids, let someone
else make money.

50:27.700 --> 50:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so they were intent
on creating a new set
of expectations for me.

50:34.700 --> 50:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the years, I became more
and more convinced: Marriage,
even a serious relationship, was

50:41.633 --> 50:43.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a kind of weakness.

50:43.700 --> 50:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Strong women didn't need anyone.

50:45.833 --> 50:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While I was in college, my
female friends and I were
pressured to lean in and strive

50:52.833 --> 50:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for one particular kind
of success: the best, most
fulfilling career possible.

50:59.400 --> 51:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For high-achieving women my
age, romantic relationships
were supposed to be far less

51:03.633 --> 51:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important, put on the back
burner until we were well on
our way to a corner office.

51:08.633 --> 51:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was where my values
started to clash with real life.

51:15.666 --> 51:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After graduation, I was going
to write a book, and all of my
writing contacts were in New

51:19.266 --> 51:21.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
York.

51:21.833 --> 51:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There, I would have a
much stronger professional
network than I would
living in any other city.

51:25.233 --> 51:27.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But my boyfriend
got a job in D.C.

51:27.800 --> 51:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I started telling people
that I was moving to D.C. to be
with Robert, they all gave me

51:34.000 --> 51:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this sort of sad, pitying look.

51:36.233 --> 51:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They said things like: "Really?

51:38.933 --> 51:42.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you're so young."

51:42.566 --> 51:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spent my first year after
graduation shadowing four
of my female classmates
and writing about

51:47.066 --> 51:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their transition from
college to real life.

51:50.166 --> 51:52.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a rough year.

51:52.700 --> 51:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our entire lives, we'd
been surrounded by this
big, supportive community,
parents, teachers,

51:58.800 --> 52:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a group of friends our own age.

52:01.733 --> 52:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
When all that went away,
we felt more alone than
we ever had before.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We wanted to lean on a partner.

52:09.400 --> 52:13.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that made us feel
intensely guilty.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, though, relationships
can help us find our footing
in an entirely new world.

52:20.533 --> 52:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My point isn't that all women
should prioritize relationships
after graduation, just that

52:25.533 --> 52:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those of us who do shouldn't
be demonized for it.

52:29.400 --> 52:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Guys who follow their
girlfriends don't get
the same judgment.

52:33.700 --> 52:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Instead, they're often
celebrated for being
progressive or modern.

52:40.133 --> 52:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People say, that's so sweet,
or, wow, he really loves her.

52:45.933 --> 52:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we should ask ourselves why
those different reactions exist,
and why young women continue

52:52.500 --> 52:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be judged for making
the same decisions as men.

52:56.833 --> 53:00.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A
lesson for all of us.

53:00.433 --> 53:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And a news update before we go.

53:02.433 --> 53:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A U.S. Navy destroyer, the
Fitzgerald, has collided with
a merchant ship off Japan.

53:09.600 --> 53:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The destroyer suffered
damage and some flooding,
but is now sailing back
to port in Yokosuka.

53:13.900 --> 53:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Seventh Fleet says that
one sailor was injured.

53:16.633 --> 53:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Another Navy destroyer and two
tugs are being sent to help.

53:20.000 --> 53:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The merchant vessel
is sailing to Tokyo.

53:23.500 --> 53:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Robert Costa is preparing
for "Washington Week."

53:25.733 --> 53:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bob, what's on tap?

53:27.733 --> 53:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Well, Judy, in
the wake of this week's shooting
at a GOP baseball practice,

53:31.100 --> 53:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats are reaching
out to Republicans to work
together on health care.

53:35.033 --> 53:38.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Could it be the first
step toward bipartisan
action in Congress?

53:38.533 --> 53:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's tonight on
"Washington Week" -- Judy.

53:40.066 --> 53:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
we will be watching.

53:42.133 --> 53:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday with a look ahead to
the most expensive congressional

53:46.266 --> 53:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
race in U.S. history:
Georgia's special election.

53:49.200 --> 53:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the "NewsHour"
for tonight.

53:51.066 --> 53:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:52.066 --> 53:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:53.066 --> 53:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
