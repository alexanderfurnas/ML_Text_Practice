INTERNATIONAL MEDIATORS, THERE

17:27.446 --> 17:28.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SO RESOLVING THE KURDISH ISSUE

17:34.387 --> 17:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD PUT TURKEY BACK ON THE

RIGHT TRACK, COORDINATING MORE

GOOD JUDGMENT WHEN IT COMES TO

18:21.534 --> 18:23.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO AGREE WITH WHAT DAVID JUST

18:23.502 --> 18:24.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE WOULD HOPE THAT IT WOULD BE

18:26.605 --> 18:28.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBLE TO DO THE THINGS AND IT

18:28.841 --> 18:30.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THAT DAVID SUGGESTED AS AN

18:36.882 --> 18:39.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DIRECTION IN WHICH HE IS MOVING

18:40.586 --> 18:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK DAVID'S CORRECT, I

18:43.356 --> 18:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A
