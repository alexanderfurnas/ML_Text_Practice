JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.539 --> 00:06.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.208 --> 00:11.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
are set to

00:11.378 --> 00:17.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go head to head in the first
presidential
debate amid a virtual tie in the
public opinion

00:17.684 --> 00:19.453 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
polls.

00:19.486 --> 00:23.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Monday, we sit
down with the vice president of
South Sudan

00:23.257 --> 00:26.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to talk corruption scandals in
the world's
youngest nation.

00:26.526 --> 00:38.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
the modern tale off star-crossed
lovers.

00:38.338 --> 00:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rob Kapilow deconstructs the
iconic song "Maria"
from Leonard Bernstein's "West
Side Story."

00:44.645 --> 00:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW, Composer: One of
the great things
about Bernstein was that he
moved so effortlessly

00:49.116 --> 00:54.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the worlds of serious
music and popular
music, and he spoke both
languages absolutely

00:54.888 --> 00:56.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as if they were vernacular.

00:56.123 --> 01:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.031 --> 01:06.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:06.833 --> 01:18.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For much of the
nation, it's must-see
TV tonight, and up to 100
million Americans

01:18.545 --> 01:20.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
might be tuning in.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican and Democratic
presidential
nominees meet on the same stage
in Hempstead,

01:24.151 --> 01:25.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
New York, to debate.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang is there, and he
begins our coverage.

01:27.988 --> 01:33.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: At Hofstra
University, the stage
is set.

01:33.293 --> 01:37.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier, stand-ins for Donald
Trump and Hillary
Clinton helped technicians work
out the final

01:37.864 --> 01:39.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
details.

01:39.299 --> 01:43.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The showdown comes as polls show
the two locked
in a very tight race.

01:43.637 --> 01:47.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton running mate Tim Kaine
predicted tonight
would be a big test for Trump.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Well, tonight, 90 minutes on
stage, you know,

01:51.378 --> 01:55.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's going to be a great
opportunity for
the American public to see if
this guy can

01:55.048 --> 01:59.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tell the truth, I mean, or maybe
if he recognizes
the truth.

01:59.586 --> 02:04.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Both sides are trying
to manage
expectations, Trump calling the
moderators

02:04.091 --> 02:06.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unfair, Clinton saying they
should fact-check.

02:06.893 --> 02:10.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This morning, Trump campaign
manager Kellyanne
Conway pushed back.

02:10.964 --> 02:16.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Manager:
What bothers us, Mark, is the
very public

02:16.703 --> 02:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and very coordinated attempt to
game the refs.

02:19.639 --> 02:23.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Between them, the
nominees have
participated in more than a
dozen primary

02:23.610 --> 02:24.578 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debates.

02:24.611 --> 02:27.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But those were nothing like
tonight.

02:27.180 --> 02:30.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anita Dunn is a former Obama
aide who helped
the president prepare for the
2012 debates.

02:30.817 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANITA DUNN, Former White House
Communications
Director: Secretary Clinton is a
disciplined,

02:35.188 --> 02:42.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experienced candidate who is
going to spend
her time really thinking about
how she communicates

02:42.195 --> 02:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her vision for the country in
the face of
her opponent being on stage with
her.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump has said he doesn't
think he
needs to do mock debates.

02:49.836 --> 02:54.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Brett O'Donnell was
on President
George W. Bush's 2004 debate
prep team.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRETT O'DONNELL, Former
Presidential Debate
Adviser: Donald Trump has done
only primary

02:56.743 --> 03:00.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debates where he was standing on
the stage
with multiple candidates.

03:00.080 --> 03:05.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He hasn't had to talk about
policy issues
continuously for 90 minutes.

03:05.819 --> 03:10.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, on the other
hand, has done
extensive one-on-one debating.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She did it in her Senate race.

03:11.958 --> 03:16.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She did it when she ran for
president against
Barack Obama, and she did it
against Bernie

03:16.530 --> 03:18.231 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sanders.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Tonight's face-off is
the first
of three scheduled debates
before Election

03:21.001 --> 03:22.736 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day.

03:22.769 --> 03:27.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the latest NBC News/"Wall
Street Journal"
poll, 11 percent of voters said
they were

03:27.307 --> 03:32.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not committed to any candidate
and that these
debates would be very important
in helping

03:32.846 --> 03:34.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them make up their minds.

03:34.981 --> 03:41.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, with the national polls so
close and key
battleground states showing the
race tightening

03:41.154 --> 03:45.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in each of them, these debates
could be crucial
-- Gwen, Judy.

03:45.225 --> 03:51.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: John, can I just ask
you, as the
witching hour approaches, how
have these candidates

03:51.264 --> 03:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really been preparing?

03:53.233 --> 03:58.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw some of the spin in your
piece about
what -- raising expectations,
lowering expectations.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's real?

04:00.207 --> 04:06.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I tell you, Gwen, the
debate prep
for the two candidates couldn't
be more different

04:06.379 --> 04:07.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than the candidates themselves.

04:07.948 --> 04:11.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If this were college, Hillary
Clinton would
be the grind.

04:11.384 --> 04:12.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's got briefing books.

04:12.752 --> 04:16.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's had mock debates, working
to time.

04:16.823 --> 04:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's had someone sitting in for
the moderator,
someone sitting in for Donald
Trump, a very

04:23.130 --> 04:30.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close aide, Philippe Reines, who
knows Clinton
well and knows how to get under
her skin and

04:30.137 --> 04:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is comfortable doing it, just in
case Donald
Trump does it tonight.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she has been working very
hard.

04:36.843 --> 04:42.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a matter of fact, aides tell
me even up
until late this afternoon, she
was still at

04:42.315 --> 04:43.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, on the other hand,
is sort of
gliding in.

04:46.052 --> 04:49.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't want to overprepare
for these.

04:49.322 --> 04:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been no mock debates,
no mock moderator,
no mock Hillary Clinton, going
over sort of

04:56.163 --> 05:01.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
broad themes and maybe a few
practice answers,
but not rehearsing.

05:01.234 --> 05:05.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He feels confident that he's
good at these
things and just going to sort of
almost wing

05:05.739 --> 05:07.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it, maybe -- Gwen, Judy.

05:07.407 --> 05:11.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John, give us a
sense of the
scene there at Hofstra
University.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clearly, all eyes are on this
debate tonight.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does it look like?

05:16.149 --> 05:24.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's a very -- given
the sets we
have seen in the debates this
primary season,

05:24.658 --> 05:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with all sorts of glitz and
lights and all
sorts of things, it's a very
spartan stage,

05:30.130 --> 05:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little bit maybe even a
throwback to the
previous debates, the original
debates.

05:35.902 --> 05:41.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lecterns are identical,
although in deference
to the height difference,
Secretary Clinton's

05:41.408 --> 05:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lectern a little bit lower than
Donald Trump's.

05:44.744 --> 05:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: John, how much have
they been
spending today trying to spin
expectations

05:50.350 --> 05:52.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in advance?

05:52.152 --> 05:56.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They're already --
the Clinton
people are talking about how
Trump has never

05:56.456 --> 06:03.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really faced any tough questions
about policy
before, almost saying that he's
being graded

06:03.230 --> 06:10.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a curve, that if he were to
come out and
not be the bombastic Donald
Trump that we

06:10.103 --> 06:15.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen in the past, that that
might be
a win, that the pundits and
others may declare

06:15.976 --> 06:17.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it a victory.

06:17.777 --> 06:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump already sort of
gaming the refs,
as it were, as Kellyanne Conway
said in the

06:22.816 --> 06:28.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
piece, warning the moderator
that the moderator
shouldn't be fact-checking the
candidates,

06:28.989 --> 06:30.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the candidates should be doing
that.

06:30.824 --> 06:35.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, incidentally, Janet Brown,
the head of
the Commission for Presidential
Debates, sort

06:35.795 --> 06:37.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of agrees with that.

06:37.597 --> 06:41.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She said it's not the
moderator's place to
check the facts of each of the
candidates.

06:41.701 --> 06:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The candidates, she said, should
be doing
that to each other.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, in a little
while, we will
see only three people on that
stage trying

06:48.008 --> 06:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to decide how that's actually
going to work
itself out.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang, thank you.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
See you later tonight.

06:53.647 --> 06:58.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
alleged gunman in a deadly
attack at a Washington

06:58.051 --> 07:02.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
state shopping mall has
confessed, but there's
no word on a motive.

07:02.522 --> 07:08.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's according to court
documents filed
today; 20-year-old Arcan Cetin
appeared before

07:08.194 --> 07:10.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a judge to face murder charges.

07:10.797 --> 07:14.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He allegedly gunned down five

a Houston
strip mall today, and wounded
six people,

07:19.773 --> 07:23.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one critically, before he died
in a gun battle
with police.

07:23.543 --> 07:28.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afterward, officers canvassed a
nearby condo
complex where the shooter lived,
and inspected

07:29.015 --> 07:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a car, as neighbors told of
their terror.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I called 911 because the
bullets didn't
stop.

07:34.721 --> 07:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They wouldn't stop, and they
were getting
louder and louder.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I was looking through the
window to try
to maybe help the police with
the direction

07:41.194 --> 07:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of who this person is, did you
see him, where
did he go, I could just hear the
bullets whizzing

07:45.632 --> 07:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through my -- by my window.

07:47.801 --> 07:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Police say the
gunman was a lawyer
who'd had issues with his
employer.

07:52.405 --> 07:57.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Authorities in
Charlotte, North
Carolina, have lifted a curfew
after violence

07:57.477 --> 08:00.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over a police shooting abated.

08:00.146 --> 08:03.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Weekend protests over the
shooting of Keith
Scott stayed peaceful.

08:03.917 --> 08:09.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, demonstrators locked
arms outside
the stadium where the Carolina
Panthers football

08:09.055 --> 08:10.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

08:10.623 --> 08:12.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

08:17.197 --> 08:22.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of nine black worshipers in
Charleston, South
Carolina, in 2015.

08:22.235 --> 08:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's accused of hate crimes and
obstruction
of religion, and he could get
the death penalty

08:27.107 --> 08:28.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if convicted.

08:28.408 --> 08:31.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Roof faces a separate trial of
state murder
charges.

08:31.611 --> 08:37.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The number of
murders across
the United States rose 10
percent last year.

08:37.183 --> 08:43.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI also reported today that
overall violent
crime increased nearly 4
percent.

08:43.256 --> 08:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even so, U.S. Attorney General
Loretta Lynch
says 2015 was still the
third-lowest year

08:49.896 --> 08:51.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for violent crime in two
decades.

08:51.998 --> 08:56.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There was no letup
today in the
ferocious assault on Syria's
largest city.

08:56.903 --> 09:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian planes laid waste to
parts of Aleppo,
and the Syrian military pressed
a new offensive

09:02.409 --> 09:04.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the ground.

09:04.377 --> 09:10.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, and all through the
weekend, Eastern
Aleppo was hammered from the
sky.

09:10.450 --> 09:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian planes dropped huge,
bunker-busting
bombs that reduced neighborhoods
to piles

09:15.455 --> 09:17.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of mangled debris.

09:17.891 --> 09:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hospitals were overwhelmed, with
at least
200 civilians killed.

09:22.228 --> 09:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
The offensive began with the
collapse last
week of the
U.S.-Russia-negotiated
cease-fire.

09:26.900 --> 09:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, Syria's foreign
minister blamed
Washington.

09:31.070 --> 09:34.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID AL-MOALLEM, Syrian Foreign
Minister
(through translator): If the
United States

09:34.908 --> 09:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a real intention to find a
solution, then
it would have been able to do so
already.

09:39.913 --> 09:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do not tell me that the United
States doesn't
have the ability to pressure the
countries

09:44.117 --> 09:46.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that follow it and say, enough
is enough.

09:46.586 --> 09:52.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The Obama
administration rejected
that claim, and said Syria's
President Assad

09:52.459 --> 09:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and his Russian allies bear the
blame.

09:55.161 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TONER, State Department
Spokesman: It's
hard to talk about any kind of
transition

10:00.567 --> 10:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government or any kind of
negotiating process
when, you know, the moderate
Syrian opposition

10:06.406 --> 10:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and civilians in Aleppo are
being bombed.

10:08.208 --> 10:13.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The diplomatic rift
led to bitter
exchanges at Sunday's emergency
meeting of

10:13.346 --> 10:14.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.N. Security Council.

10:14.380 --> 10:16.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power:

10:16.216 --> 10:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER, U.S. Ambassador
to the United
Nations: What Russia is
sponsoring and doing

10:20.286 --> 10:21.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is not counterterrorism.

10:21.955 --> 10:29.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is barbarism, laying waste to
what is left
of an iconic Middle Eastern
city.

10:29.729 --> 10:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are people who have
suffered horribly
in the five-and-a-half years of
war.

10:34.133 --> 10:38.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In turn, Moscow's
envoy pushed
aside hopes for a renewed truce.

10:38.938 --> 10:42.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VITALY CHURKIN, Russian
Ambassador to United
Nations (through translator): In
Syria, hundreds

10:42.976 --> 10:44.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of groups are being armed.

10:44.811 --> 10:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The territory of the country is
being bombed
indiscriminately, and bringing
peace is almost

10:49.349 --> 10:51.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an impossible task now.

10:51.050 --> 10:56.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Amid the destruction
of Aleppo,
a trickle of humanitarian aid is
arriving

10:56.289 --> 11:03.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elsewhere; 70 trucks reached
four besieged
towns yesterday in northwestern
and southwestern

11:03.329 --> 11:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria for the first time in
nearly six months.

11:07.600 --> 11:14.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The assault on Aleppo means no
aid is getting
through to the 250,000 trapped
civilian.

11:14.107 --> 11:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, selling
dominated Wall Street led by
worries over

11:18.978 --> 11:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany's troubled Deutsche Bank
and nervousness
over tonight's presidential
debate.

11:24.250 --> 11:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 166
points to close near 18095.

11:29.255 --> 11:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 48 points and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped 18.

11:34.761 --> 11:39.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And the Washington
Monument is
closing to the public
indefinitely.

11:39.766 --> 11:44.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Park Service said
today the obelisk
will be shut down until its
elevator control

11:44.871 --> 11:46.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
system can be fixed.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The elevator has broken down
repeatedly in
the last two years.

11:49.676 --> 11:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
we talk to Hillary Clinton's
campaign manager

11:54.213 --> 12:00.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a Donald Trump adviser, as
the candidates
prepare to go head to head;
plus, pre-debate

12:00.320 --> 12:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
analysis with Amy Walter, Mark
Shields, David
Brooks; and much more.

12:08.695 --> 12:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now looking ahead to
the debate,
we begin by hearing from both
campaigns.

12:19.906 --> 12:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A short time ago, I spoke with
Clinton campaign
manager Robby Mook and asked
what his claims

12:24.978 --> 12:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- about his claims that Hillary
Clinton is
being held to a double standard
in advance

12:30.083 --> 12:31.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to tonight's showdown.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK, Hillary Clinton
Campaign Manager:
Well, Gwen, we just want both
candidates to

12:34.654 --> 12:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be graded according to the same
criteria.

12:37.256 --> 12:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, both of these
candidates need
to demonstrate a command of the
issues.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something Hillary Clinton
has done.

12:43.396 --> 12:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just haven't seen that yet
from Donald
Trump.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to hear about some real
plans.

12:48.501 --> 12:52.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, Donald Trump has not --
still hasn't
rolled out, for example, a plan
on ISIS.

12:52.839 --> 12:58.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His tax plan has changed
multiple times, has
been ridiculed basically every
time it's come

12:58.044 --> 12:59.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, lastly, Donald Trump has
got to tell
the truth.

13:01.481 --> 13:06.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You cannot get a passing grade
after telling
I would argue even a single lie
in this debate,

13:06.686 --> 13:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let alone the string of lies
that he usually
tells.

13:08.921 --> 13:13.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we just want people to grade
as if the
next president of the United
States is on

13:13.092 --> 13:14.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that stage and we're judging
them.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no curve when you get
into the Oval
Office.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There shouldn't be a curve at
this debate.

13:18.665 --> 13:22.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, you make the
case that the
bar has been set too low for
Donald Trump.

13:22.168 --> 13:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet major news outlets this
weekend wrote
basically long stories saying
that he's a

13:28.307 --> 13:29.275 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
liar.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how can you make that
argument?

13:31.110 --> 13:36.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: Well, we're asking
for people
to judge the performance in the
debate tonight.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Donald Trump doesn't tell one
of his normal
lies, that's great.

13:39.786 --> 13:44.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But once we get through that
bar, which I
would argue is very low, we need
to hear a

13:44.290 --> 13:46.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
real, true command of the
issues.

13:46.192 --> 13:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can he actually speak for 90
seconds -- that's
the length of the answers -- in
a substantive

13:50.697 --> 13:52.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
way about policies?

13:52.598 --> 13:55.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And does he actually have
concrete ideas?

13:55.134 --> 14:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has a tendency, we saw at the
Commander-in-Chief
Forum a few weeks ago, to ramble
on and repeat

14:00.707 --> 14:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself, repeat things that may
or may not
be true.

14:03.710 --> 14:04.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's simply not enough.

14:04.977 --> 14:06.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're picking our next
president.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's time to get serious.

14:08.548 --> 14:11.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And voters expect him to meet a
very high
bar to become our next
president.

14:11.884 --> 14:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I don't expect you
to tell me
all of your debate prep secrets.

14:14.954 --> 14:20.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I am curious about how much
of the time
in preparing Secretary Clinton
for this debate

14:20.093 --> 14:23.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you spent talking or thinking
about how to
get inside Donald Trump's head.

14:23.563 --> 14:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: Well, look, Gwen, as
you're pointing
out, one of the things that's
very troubling

14:28.367 --> 14:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to voters about Donald Trump is
his erratic
behavior, his lack of good
temperament to

14:34.440 --> 14:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
serve as commander in chief.

14:36.209 --> 14:40.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is not the kind of
personality you want
controlling our nuclear codes or
commanding

14:40.847 --> 14:42.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our men or women in uniform.

14:42.715 --> 14:46.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we don't know how Donald
Trump will act
at this debate.

14:46.185 --> 14:50.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I would argue that is a
threshold reason he's
not qualified to be president.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Hillary Clinton is steady,
experienced.

14:52.592 --> 14:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has been on that debate
stage before one
on one.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure she will be prepared
for whatever
comes her way.

14:58.197 --> 15:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Secretary Clinton is
also on that
stage tonight.

15:01.467 --> 15:07.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Which audiences is she aiming
to, is she hoping
to speak to, aside from
criticizing Donald

15:07.306 --> 15:09.041 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

15:09.075 --> 15:11.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: Well, Gwen, I'm
really glad you
asked that question, because we
think that

15:11.544 --> 15:16.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this debate is a really
important opportunity
for Secretary Clinton and for
this campaign.

15:16.816 --> 15:21.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of voters are going to be
checking into
this debate for the very first
time.

15:21.187 --> 15:26.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time Secretary Clinton has
had the opportunity
to talk about her proactive
plans and ideas

15:26.325 --> 15:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about how to make people's lives
better, she's
done better on the campaign.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are undecided voters
still.

15:32.832 --> 15:38.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are people who are
supportive, but maybe
not quite as motivated to go
vote yet.

15:38.404 --> 15:41.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We see this as an opportunity to
speak to
all of those voters.

15:41.374 --> 15:46.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the most important
thing she can
do, make the case about this
lifelong mission

15:46.712 --> 15:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's had to fight for kids and
families and
how she's going to make a
difference in people's

15:51.350 --> 15:52.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lives as president.

15:52.952 --> 15:57.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How worried are you
about this
latest round of tightening
polls?

15:57.623 --> 16:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: You know, Gwen,
there are a lot
of polls out there.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Particularly public polls go up
and down.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The thing is, people use a lot
of different
methodologies.

16:06.999 --> 16:11.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we are just staying focused
on running
like we're 20 points behind.

16:11.437 --> 16:15.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there is a voter who isn't
registered yet
or may not have all the
information about

16:15.842 --> 16:19.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how to vote, we are going to go
and work hard
to make sure that they turn out
whether we're

16:19.378 --> 16:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ahead or behind in the polls.

16:20.880 --> 16:24.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're executing the same
strategy no matter
what.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to look past the
polls and
go right to the voters.

16:28.221 --> 16:32.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, this is the
first of three
one-on-one debates between the
presidential

16:32.291 --> 16:33.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debates.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How important is the first one?

16:35.294 --> 16:38.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or are we going to be having
this conversation
again, saying the next one is
the most important?

16:38.331 --> 16:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: Well, I think all of
them are
an important opportunity.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are some slightly
different formats.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, look, this is the first
one.

16:46.639 --> 16:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, voters are probably
going to be
tuning in to this one more than
any other.

16:50.910 --> 16:55.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, we think this is
such a valuable
opportunity for Secretary
Clinton to make

16:55.381 --> 16:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her proactive case for what
she's going to
do to help everyday people, why
people should

16:59.886 --> 17:02.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be excited about turning out to
vote for her.

17:02.088 --> 17:03.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, we're going to take
advantage of it.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, we will all be
on the edge
of our seats watching it,
probably not as

17:06.559 --> 17:08.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
closely as you.

17:08.327 --> 17:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robby Mook, Secretary Clinton's
campaign manager,
thank you so much for joining
us.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK: Thank you very much,
Gwen.

17:13.432 --> 17:16.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we turn now
to Jack Kingston.

17:16.302 --> 17:21.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's a former Republican
congressman from
Georgia, now a senior adviser to
Donald Trump's

17:21.908 --> 17:22.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jack Kingston, welcome.

17:24.677 --> 17:27.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There has been a lot of
commentary, as we
were just hearing, to the effect
that there's

17:27.580 --> 17:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lower bar of expectations
tonight for Donald
Trump than there is for Hillary
Clinton.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you think that's right?

17:34.387 --> 17:37.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK KINGSTON (R), Former U.S.
Congressman:
No, I think this is the Clinton
people spinning

17:37.456 --> 17:38.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a very accomplished
debater, as we should
all admit.

17:41.294 --> 17:44.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's been running for president
since 2007.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before that, she was a U.S.
senator, had plenty
of debates.

17:47.767 --> 17:53.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And before that, she was
coaching her husband
as a presidential and a
gubernatorial candidate.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Of course she's a very
accomplished debater.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's very disciplined, very
scripted.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We know that.

17:59.378 --> 18:02.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump, totally different
style of politics.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is a guy who's wide open.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's an element of change.

18:06.485 --> 18:11.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's non-Washington, and he has
solutions
which the American people
support.

18:11.123 --> 18:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a TV personality, if you
will, who knows
how to connect with the everyday
family.

18:17.363 --> 18:22.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you're going to see two
different styles,
but when I think -- when it
comes to substance,

18:22.568 --> 18:25.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is going to be
on the defense.

18:25.104 --> 18:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She wants to continue Barack
Obama's economic
policies, which are slow growth,
high unemployment,

18:34.313 --> 18:37.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she thinks that the national
security
picture is great, and she's
going to be on

18:37.450 --> 18:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the defensive to say why those
are great policies
and we need another three -- a
third term.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about what
Donald Trump needs to do.

18:45.825 --> 18:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just heard Robby Mook say he
needs to give
substantive answers, be concrete
in describing

18:51.464 --> 18:52.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what he would do as president.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also said he needs to tell
the truth.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is he going to do that tonight?

18:56.936 --> 19:01.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK KINGSTON: You know, when I
hear Robby
Mook or anybody from the Clinton
campaign

19:01.941 --> 19:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk about telling the truth,
here's a woman
who said she was, what, bombed
in Kosovo,

19:05.678 --> 19:07.046 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or shot.

19:07.079 --> 19:11.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's a woman who claims she
was named after
Sir Edmund Hillary.

19:11.450 --> 19:15.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a woman who said she had
one e-mail
server, when she had 13.

19:15.054 --> 19:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a woman who said she
turned over all
her e-mails.

19:18.190 --> 19:21.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're going to lecture
Donald Trump
about truth?

19:21.127 --> 19:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a little bit ridiculous.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want to talk about economy.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want to talk about jobs.

19:26.232 --> 19:30.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to talk about the fact
that there
are 94 million people who are
underemployed

19:30.669 --> 19:34.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or unemployed under the
Clinton-Obama economy.

19:34.473 --> 19:41.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to talk about the fact
that household
income has fallen from $57,000
to $53,000

19:41.247 --> 19:42.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the last 15 years.

19:42.882 --> 19:47.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to talk about the fact
that there
is 43 million people on food
stamps.

19:47.153 --> 19:50.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is not an A-plus, robust
economy.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not what people in
America want.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They want change.

19:53.192 --> 19:56.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why Donald Trump is
the exciting
candidate.

19:56.262 --> 19:58.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why so many people are
tuned in to
him.

19:58.230 --> 20:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Politico --
just picking
up on that, Politico has done a
survey of

20:03.469 --> 20:07.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- actually, a detailed
examination of what
Mr. Trump said over the course
of several

20:07.840 --> 20:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
days in a number of speeches and
interviews.

20:10.209 --> 20:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They looked at about four hours,
almost five
hours of remarks.

20:14.480 --> 20:19.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said, in that time,
they found an
untruth every
three-and-a-quarter minutes.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is from Politico.

20:21.821 --> 20:26.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK KINGSTON: Well, yes, but
keep in mind,
what they do is they select the
statements

20:26.692 --> 20:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they want to select.

20:28.494 --> 20:33.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I were to say 20 things and
they decided
we're going to focus on five for
me and five

20:33.732 --> 20:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Hillary, then they're going
to pick the
ones that are going to field
against Donald

20:37.470 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you know what?

20:39.472 --> 20:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think you have raised a good
point.

20:41.273 --> 20:44.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's one thing
that we're going
to have tonight, is each
candidate will have

20:44.543 --> 20:50.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the opportunity to call the
other candidate
out and say, no, that's not
actually accurate.

20:50.549 --> 20:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
February 16, 2015, you said such
and such.

20:54.386 --> 20:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's what a good,
old-fashioned
debate is about.

20:57.423 --> 21:02.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why tonight is exciting,
and 100,000
-- or 100 million people are
watching it.

21:02.228 --> 21:06.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You know, just kind of a
footnote that I heard
earlier today, maybe the most
famous political

21:07.032 --> 21:11.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
debate in history, the
Lincoln-Douglas debate,
there was not a moderator.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was just candidate vs.
candidate.

21:13.205 --> 21:17.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we are going to see
enough of that
tonight, though, to reveal which
one has a

21:17.977 --> 21:19.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
better plan.

21:19.812 --> 21:23.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's also been
speculation,
Jack Kingston, about which
Donald Trump will

21:23.516 --> 21:25.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show up.

21:25.384 --> 21:29.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know he's been calmer on the
campaign trail
recently than he was early in
this election

21:29.989 --> 21:31.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cycle.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think we're going to
see?

21:32.992 --> 21:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK KINGSTON: You know, I
think, under the
team of Kellyanne Fitzpatrick
(sic), that

21:39.298 --> 21:44.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're going to see just a lot
more steadiness,
a lot more presidential-type
behavior.

21:44.270 --> 21:47.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's doing very, very well with
his base.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has unified the Republican
Party.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So now he needs to show that he
is presidential.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as you know, as a very
successful businessman,
he has built empires.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's made a lot of people a lot
of money.

21:58.551 --> 22:01.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's run lots of successful
corporations.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we're going to see
that part of
him tonight.

22:03.556 --> 22:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's very important,
as he talks
about national security, his
vision, as he

22:07.526 --> 22:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talks about the economy, his
vision, as he
talks about his style, his
administration,

22:12.364 --> 22:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
again, his vision.

22:13.966 --> 22:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think this is going to be
a great opportunity
for him to showcase that.

22:18.103 --> 22:22.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jack Kingston,
we're all going
to be watching along with you.

22:22.074 --> 22:23.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JACK KINGSTON: Thanks a lot.

22:25.244 --> 22:30.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: We get some
pre-debate analysis
now with Amy Walter of The Cook
Political

22:30.449 --> 22:34.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Report, syndicated columnist
Mark Shields,
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

22:34.954 --> 22:38.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is so much to dig into
from all of that,
folks.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to start with you Mark
Shields.

22:39.758 --> 22:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does Hillary Clinton, what
do -- does
Donald Trump have to accomplish
tonight?

22:43.729 --> 22:48.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Hillary Clinton,
at the end
of the debate, what you want
viewers to say,

22:49.001 --> 22:55.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
yes, she's smart, she's
knowledgeable, but
she's not a bad egg, you know?

22:55.708 --> 23:02.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You want that sense of a
personal identity,
a reality come through to give
us a peek,

23:02.481 --> 23:05.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a view of her soul, her heart.

23:05.684 --> 23:12.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if the people -- not a bad
egg is a pretty
high compliment in American
politics, given

23:12.358 --> 23:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the toxic atmosphere in which we
currently
dwell.

23:15.294 --> 23:16.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:16.495 --> 23:17.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's what I
think she's looking
for.

23:17.463 --> 23:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump -- Donald Trump
defies gravity.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have no idea.

23:22.735 --> 23:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have watched these things
since Hector was
a pup.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I honestly -- remarkable.

23:29.475 --> 23:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't care, Pants on Fire,
four Pinocchios,
it makes no difference.

23:33.612 --> 23:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I guess he has to be
Donald Trump.

23:37.516 --> 23:38.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's gotten him so far.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's going to dance with the
girl who brung
him.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, you have
been watching
almost as long as Hector.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:44.056 --> 23:45.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Yes,
I was at the Lincoln-Douglas
debates.

23:45.391 --> 23:46.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Were not televised.

23:46.392 --> 23:47.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:47.493 --> 23:49.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you think
they need
to do?

23:49.328 --> 23:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, I think a lot
of this depends
on the terrain in which the
debate is taking

23:52.097 --> 23:53.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

23:53.866 --> 23:58.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for Hillary Clinton, she
wants it to be
on -- she wants to be on the
offense, and

23:58.370 --> 24:01.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that means putting him on the
defense early
on about the two issues that are
the most

24:01.974 --> 24:05.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
problematic for him, his
temperament and his
judgment, right?

24:05.377 --> 24:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if the debate is on those
issues, who has
the temperament to be president
of the United

24:09.348 --> 24:14.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States, who has the experience
to do this
job, that's great terrain for
her.

24:14.753 --> 24:18.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the debate is where Jack
Kingston is talking
about -- and I think this is
where Donald

24:18.857 --> 24:22.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump wants to take it -- about
change, about
shaking things up, going against
the status

24:22.561 --> 24:25.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quo, that's a very difficult
place for her
to be.

24:25.264 --> 24:29.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where this election
-- like, where
this election wants to go and
where this election

24:29.568 --> 24:31.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is going.

24:31.437 --> 24:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where the election wants to go,
slightly more
voters than not see this as an
election that

24:35.541 --> 24:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they want to make a change.

24:38.177 --> 24:42.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for Hillary Clinton to win,
they have
to believe that that change is
much too dangerous.

24:42.114 --> 24:47.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: David Brooks, what
if these 100
viewers tune in for a reality
show tonight,

24:47.720 --> 24:48.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get a debate instead?

24:48.721 --> 24:50.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:50.556 --> 24:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The Earth would
spin off its
axis, and we would all fall out
of our chairs.

24:53.559 --> 24:54.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:54.760 --> 24:55.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I don't think
that's going
to happen.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do think it is more like a
reality show.

24:58.697 --> 25:00.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's drama.

25:00.599 --> 25:03.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And especially the undecided
voters, you know,
they're not interested in
somebody's -- the

25:03.635 --> 25:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
third plank of the health care
plan.

25:05.637 --> 25:09.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not going to be Plato's
symposium,
not that it's been that so far.

25:09.408 --> 25:11.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not even about what they
say.

25:11.577 --> 25:13.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's about who they are.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we had a character debate.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are going to have to
display some
character traits.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does she seem normal?

25:19.251 --> 25:20.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does she seem warm?

25:20.252 --> 25:21.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does she seem empathetic?

25:21.253 --> 25:22.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does she seem one of us?

25:22.521 --> 25:23.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does he seem in command?

25:23.555 --> 25:26.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does he seem basically stable?

25:26.091 --> 25:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are low bars, maybe, but I
do think
it's -- people are -- it's a
visual medium.

25:31.430 --> 25:36.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a visual confrontation
between two people
who sort of contemptuous of each
other.

25:36.135 --> 25:40.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do they handle that body
politic is as
important as any words that
actually come

25:40.506 --> 25:42.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of their mouths?

25:42.474 --> 25:44.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, given that,
Mark, how much
does it matter whether Donald
Trump is preparing?

25:44.676 --> 25:49.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We keep hearing he doesn't like
to prepare,
he thinks that that doesn't
really matter.

25:49.515 --> 25:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet Hillary Clinton has been
seriously
preparing every day for a while.

25:53.852 --> 25:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't know why
the Clinton
people keep telling us how long
she's been

25:57.823 --> 25:59.558 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
preparing.

25:59.591 --> 26:08.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That really just kind of
reinforces this process-driven
character.

26:08.834 --> 26:14.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know she knows the issues
incredibly well.

26:14.273 --> 26:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that he doesn't know the
issues incredibly
well -- doesn't know the issues
well.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not hindered him thus
far.

26:22.381 --> 26:26.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I agree, the temperament is a
question.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You do want to get under his
skin.

26:28.720 --> 26:35.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would have Elizabeth Warren
sitting in his
eyesight, who obviously bothers
him.

26:35.060 --> 26:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, I would try and
say that the
Republican I admired and worked
most closely

26:39.765 --> 26:45.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with in the Senate, that Hillary
Clinton did
and has written, was John
McCain, and I think

26:45.370 --> 26:52.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he is a hero, unlike my
opponent, who doesn't
think John McCain is a hero, to
remind him,

26:52.444 --> 27:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through what he has said, of the
embarrassing
things he's said, the Khans, the
McCain, his

27:00.452 --> 27:03.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
incitement to violence.

27:03.155 --> 27:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's -- I would put
him -- trying
to put him on the defensive.

27:06.625 --> 27:09.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, not only that,
but also
there has been a lot of
discussion leading

27:10.028 --> 27:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up to this debate, Amy, about
lies and truth
and consequences.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Is that something -- for
instance, we just
heard Jack Kingston make a
comment, even talking

27:17.703 --> 27:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Judy, about 13 servers that
she had.

27:21.607 --> 27:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She didn't have 13 servers, but
they just
slide the stuff into the
conversation.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's devices she had
vs. servers.

27:26.845 --> 27:27.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Exactly.

27:27.846 --> 27:28.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does that work?

27:28.847 --> 27:29.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does that work?

27:31.149 --> 27:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And does that matter to people
if truth gets
told or called?

27:32.918 --> 27:36.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right now, Mark is
totally correct.

27:36.688 --> 27:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you ask people in the
NBC/Wall Street
Journal poll, who do you think
is the more

27:40.592 --> 27:42.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
honest and trustworthy, Donald
Trump wins
that question.

27:43.028 --> 27:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it's not like a lot of
people believe
both of them -- either are
honest and trustworthy,

27:48.967 --> 27:54.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but comparatively, he wins that,
and especially
among some of the groups that
she needs to

27:54.373 --> 27:56.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get, like white voters.

27:56.975 --> 28:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the question -- and
you know this
better than anybody, having to
moderate a

28:00.879 --> 28:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debate -- but these candidates
have both made
so many contradictory
statements, he more

28:04.650 --> 28:07.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than her, over the course of
this campaign.

28:07.819 --> 28:12.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the way to start the
fact-checking
is not by having a crawl
underneath saying,

28:12.157 --> 28:15.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he said was incorrect, was,
you said
this, you said this, you said
this, and you

28:15.861 --> 28:17.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
said this.

28:17.129 --> 28:20.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Which one of those things is
your position
on this issue?

28:20.265 --> 28:23.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rather than trying to saying,
that is actually
a lie.

28:23.168 --> 28:24.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No, you're not telling the
truth.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I see, string it all
together.

28:25.837 --> 28:26.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: String it all
together.

28:26.838 --> 28:28.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would just underline Mark's
humility about
this, especially for Mark -- no,
for all of

28:29.975 --> 28:30.943 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

28:30.976 --> 28:31.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:31.977 --> 28:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: He is tied.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a tied race.

28:34.346 --> 28:37.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How that exists, I have no idea.

28:37.115 --> 28:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the normal rules of
Newtonian physics
suggests it shouldn't be that.

28:40.586 --> 28:41.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, somehow, the rules...

28:41.954 --> 28:43.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In fact, Hillary
Clinton said
as much the other day.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why are I 50 points ahead?

28:44.356 --> 28:45.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

28:45.357 --> 28:46.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Excellent
question.

28:46.758 --> 28:47.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it does
depend on the
poll you're looking at.

28:47.826 --> 28:48.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you're right.

28:48.827 --> 28:49.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're right.

28:49.828 --> 28:50.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: So, she may be
ahead by two.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this is a very close race.

28:52.965 --> 28:56.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And why that is happening and
how he's been
able to do this -- so it's very
hard to predict

28:56.668 --> 28:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the debate because none of the
rules are applying.

28:58.904 --> 29:02.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one word I would pick out is
the word
is cruelty.

29:02.040 --> 29:07.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the time he actually has
been hurt
were the Khans, is, he has
appeared cruel.

29:07.079 --> 29:10.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he appears cruel, then I
do think we
will begin to see something
shift here.

29:10.682 --> 29:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Can I make one point
about the
laws of physics?

29:13.185 --> 29:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually think that this is
what the laws
of physics at this time and
place in politics

29:18.357 --> 29:20.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suggest we should always have a
two- or three-point
race.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is happening in this race
and the reason
that it has gotten this close is
that Republicans

29:24.596 --> 29:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have now accepted Donald Trump.

29:26.698 --> 29:30.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the race was -- there was a
big gap,
it was because so many
Republicans were staying

29:30.535 --> 29:32.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the sidelines.

29:32.337 --> 29:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what this is telling us
about politics
in the 21st century is that
we're aligned

29:35.240 --> 29:38.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much more by our jerseys than we
are by anything
else.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, less
than a minute.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We awake tomorrow
morning,
six weeks to go in this
election, will things

29:44.549 --> 29:46.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have changed?

29:46.351 --> 29:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They are going to
say, geez,
Shields, Brooks and Walter
really nailed it.

29:48.153 --> 29:49.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:49.154 --> 29:50.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That is what they
will say.

29:50.155 --> 29:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will say it.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: They're already
saying it.

29:52.157 --> 29:53.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

29:53.158 --> 29:54.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what we will say.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:56.128 --> 29:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, Judy, what is
confounding,
and I hope will get resolved
tonight, is 70

29:59.998 --> 30:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent of Hillary Clinton's
voters believe
she would be a good president.

30:03.368 --> 30:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barely half of Donald Trump's
voters believe
he would be a good president.

30:07.606 --> 30:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're voting -- the majority
of whom are
voting against Hillary Clinton.

30:10.509 --> 30:15.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the change element that Amy
addressed
is so significant.

30:15.213 --> 30:16.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, they are angry.

30:16.915 --> 30:17.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They feel abandoned.

30:18.016 --> 30:19.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They feel all sorts of things.

30:19.751 --> 30:27.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that Donald Trump
can't name
the NATO countries, whatever
else, or the

30:27.859 --> 30:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five presidents of the first
half of the 20th
century, make no difference to
them.

30:32.764 --> 30:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it is, as David put,
temperament,
if he does come across as cruel,
mean-spirited

30:39.171 --> 30:41.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and a bully.

30:41.473 --> 30:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, don't forget, it's the
first time
a man has debated with a woman
for president.

30:46.311 --> 30:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you, Mark
Shields, David
Brooks, Amy Walter, kind of a
mega-Politics

30:50.348 --> 30:51.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Monday.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:53.018 --> 30:54.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Join us at 9:00 p.m.
Eastern for
special live coverage of the
debate.

30:55.020 --> 30:59.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tune in online for in-depth
analysis,
where the "NewsHour" team will
put what the

30:59.524 --> 31:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
candidates say in context.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's all at PBS.org/NewsHour.

31:03.995 --> 31:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

31:11.470 --> 31:23.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
remembering Arnold
Palmer, the man who brought golf
into America's

31:23.248 --> 31:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
living rooms; and what makes
songs from "West
Side Story" so remarkable?

31:31.923 --> 31:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Two weeks ago, the
"NewsHour" reported
on an investigation into
corruption of the

31:37.129 --> 31:39.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
top leaders of South Sudan.

31:39.331 --> 31:44.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The investigation by The Sentry
group, a Washington
non-profit, alleged insider
dealing by the

31:44.936 --> 31:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president and former vice
president of the
country, as well as their top
generals.

31:49.141 --> 31:55.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After our report, the new vice
president of
South Sudan reached out to
"NewsHour."

31:55.213 --> 32:00.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan spoke with him
last week
about the report and also what
has been a

32:00.352 --> 32:03.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
long, violent summer in the
world's youngest
nation.

32:03.922 --> 32:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This summer,
clashes between
forces supporting the president
of South Sudan

32:08.193 --> 32:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the former vice president
have turned
violent, pushing the nation
toward the brink

32:12.464 --> 32:14.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a civil war.

32:14.299 --> 32:19.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On July 7, troops loyal to the
president fired
between 50 and 100 rounds of
ammunition at

32:19.538 --> 32:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a convoy of American diplomats.

32:22.174 --> 32:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One group of Americans had to be
rescued from
the scene of the attack by U.S.
Marines.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No one was hurt.

32:28.180 --> 32:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some reports said it was the
president's own
guards who led the assault.

32:32.284 --> 32:37.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That same week, a group of
government soldiers
stormed the Terrain Hotel,
targeting American

32:37.455 --> 32:40.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aid workers with beatings and
sexual abuse.

32:40.325 --> 32:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eyewitnesses told the Associated
Press that
many of the soldiers wore the
insignia of

32:44.462 --> 32:46.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the presidential guard.

32:46.264 --> 32:50.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former Vice President Riek
Machar left the
capital, and in his absence,
President Salva

32:50.502 --> 32:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kiir recently appointed this
man, Taban Deng
Gai, as vice president in his
place.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are the presidential guard under
the president's
control?

32:59.010 --> 33:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI, South Sudanese
Vice President:
Yes, they are.

33:00.712 --> 33:02.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, they don't
do anything
without his orders?

33:02.380 --> 33:04.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: Not necessarily
that.

33:04.115 --> 33:09.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, even in America, Obama
is the supreme
commander, is the commander in
chief.

33:09.120 --> 33:13.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the army is misbehaving in
Afghanistan
or Baghdad, what do you say?

33:13.325 --> 33:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, the
concern is, is
that there was an attack on U.S.
diplomats

33:17.829 --> 33:21.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in July, and that came from the
presidential
guard.

33:21.066 --> 33:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So was it under the president's
orders?

33:22.901 --> 33:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: No, the attack
on the American
vehicle was not from the
presidential guards.

33:26.872 --> 33:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was from security personnel
who were on
patrol.

33:31.142 --> 33:35.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The officer in charge was
arrested and he's
still under arrest and he's
being investigated.

33:35.313 --> 33:39.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As for the
July attack on
the Terrain Hotel, Deng says
that the president

33:39.618 --> 33:44.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
immediately ordered an
investigation, led
by one of South Sudan's most
respected judges.

33:44.489 --> 33:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: There are a
number of people
up to now got arrested.

33:47.192 --> 33:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But up to now, we have not yet
established
who among those arrested have
committed the

33:55.233 --> 33:57.068 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rape.

33:57.102 --> 34:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I ask these
questions partly
because, is it safe for an
American to visit

34:02.407 --> 34:04.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South Sudan?

34:04.209 --> 34:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: Is it safe for
the American
to visit Iraq or, say, Cairo,
for example,

34:12.317 --> 34:13.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or Nairobi?

34:13.551 --> 34:15.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it safe?

34:15.420 --> 34:18.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or is it safe for South Sudanese
to visit
U.S.?

34:18.456 --> 34:19.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Those are relative.

34:19.557 --> 34:21.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Crime happen anywhere.

34:21.393 --> 34:26.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even the days since I have been
in New York
here, there was a shooting in
North Carolina.

34:26.865 --> 34:28.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is crime.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you say to South Sudanese
it's not say
to go to North Carolina?

34:30.168 --> 34:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Earlier this
month, the
U.N. Security Council authorized
an additional

34:34.272 --> 34:40.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
4,000 peacekeepers to South
Sudan, this in
addition to the nearly 14,000
already in the

34:40.345 --> 34:42.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

34:42.180 --> 34:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power
traveled to
Juba for the announcement with
President Kiir.

34:45.617 --> 34:49.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite the joint appearance,
the South Sudanese
are hesitant to accept
additional peacekeepers.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: Not that we
don't want.

34:52.557 --> 34:57.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want -- because the U.N., the
world family
have decided to enforce it on
us.

34:57.462 --> 34:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can only live with it.

34:58.496 --> 35:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no way of us saying that
we don't
want.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're trying to tell the
world that, look,
let us be careful.

35:04.602 --> 35:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This most
recent cycle of
violence is once again forcing
civilians to

35:08.740 --> 35:10.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
flee the capital city of Juba.

35:10.709 --> 35:16.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. says that more than a
million people
have been displaced since the
country's founding.

35:16.381 --> 35:21.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Just last week, the U.S.
announced $133 million
in humanitarian aid.

35:21.753 --> 35:27.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This makes nearly $2 billion in
U.S. aid to
South Sudan since the nation's
birth.

35:27.225 --> 35:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is growing concern as to
how these dollars,
as well as the nation's oil
revenues are being

35:32.230 --> 35:34.265 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spent.

35:34.299 --> 35:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A recent report by The Sentry
group, a Washington
based nonprofit, documented
widespread corruption

35:38.336 --> 35:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the upper levels of South
Sudanese government
and military.

35:41.973 --> 35:46.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It detailed lavish spending on
mansions and
luxury hotels around the world.

35:46.444 --> 35:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says that President Kiir and
Riek Machar
have expensive homes in an
exclusive neighborhood

35:51.683 --> 35:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Nairobi, Kenya, while the
president built
a massive compound in South
Sudan, far away

35:56.955 --> 35:58.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the capital.

35:58.790 --> 36:02.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice President Deng says he has
not read the
report, but is still critical of
the conclusions

36:02.894 --> 36:04.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it draws about the president.

36:04.696 --> 36:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: To me, actually,
the crime
will be even if he did not even
own one house.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What has he been doing with the
salary?

36:12.003 --> 36:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What does the
president
make in South Sudan?

36:14.439 --> 36:15.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the salary?

36:15.440 --> 36:17.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: The salary?

36:17.208 --> 36:18.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do not know the salary, but,
of course,
you cannot compare it to
American president.

36:18.943 --> 36:20.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: No, no, I'm
asking.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: But he can buy a
house.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's put the
president
aside for a second.

36:23.548 --> 36:27.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What about all the other
different leaders
that they have documented, the
family members

36:27.786 --> 36:31.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the generals, sometimes their
kids that
actually run the businesses that
get pretty

36:32.023 --> 36:32.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big contracts?

36:33.024 --> 36:34.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:34.559 --> 36:37.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: The kids running
businesses,
they need to be investigated.

36:37.295 --> 36:38.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They need to.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what can
you tell me
that your government...

36:40.632 --> 36:43.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: I'm telling you,
yes, we shall
make of use of those
informations.

36:43.234 --> 36:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Vice President
Deng acknowledges
that The Sentry group, led
partly by John

36:47.272 --> 36:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prendergast and George Clooney,
are friends
of the nation, but disagrees
with how the

36:51.643 --> 36:52.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
information was presented.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TABAN DENG GAI: They are friends
of the president.

36:54.879 --> 36:56.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have access to the
president.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They could have discussed their
finding with
the president.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The vice
president says
he aims to meet with The Sentry
group this

37:01.152 --> 37:02.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
week in Washington.

37:02.420 --> 37:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

37:07.926 --> 37:20.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The tributes have
poured in all
day for golfing legend Arnold
Palmer, from

37:20.538 --> 37:25.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his friend and rival Jack
Nicklaus, to recent
champions like Tiger Woods, to
dignitaries

37:25.610 --> 37:27.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like President Obama.

37:27.412 --> 37:32.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A handful of other champions won
more tournaments
and titles, but Palmer set a
standard for

37:32.684 --> 37:35.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attracting public attention to
the sport.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham has a look back
at the king.

37:37.789 --> 37:44.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: The U.S. open, played
in the shadow
of the Rockies, saw Arnold
Palmer sink an

37:44.329 --> 37:46.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
incredible putt.

37:46.197 --> 37:50.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: June 1960,
Denver, Colorado,
an improbable win in the U.S.
Open became

37:51.002 --> 37:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the stuff of golfing legend.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: Coming from seven
strokes behind,
Palmer showed nerves of steel
and a will of

37:54.372 --> 37:58.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
granite, as he battled to win
the U.S. Open.

37:58.243 --> 38:02.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And it defined
the style
of Arnold Palmer.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: Golfing's man of the
year.

38:04.649 --> 38:07.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was,
perhaps, Palmer's
greatest year.

38:07.886 --> 38:13.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had won the Masters just two
months earlier,
and, all told, won eight times
that season.

38:13.725 --> 38:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He followed up with victories at
the next
two British Opens, and two more
Masters in

38:18.163 --> 38:20.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
1962 and '64.

38:20.798 --> 38:24.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He reflected on his success in a
2011 interview
with Charlie Rose.

38:24.269 --> 38:29.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ARNOLD PALMER, Former
Professional Golfer:
Any time I got close, it was
just I felt I

38:29.140 --> 38:30.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had to win.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.109 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I had to.

38:31.142 --> 38:32.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I couldn't lose.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I couldn't let that happen to
me.

38:34.779 --> 38:36.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it worked.

38:36.714 --> 38:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Arnold Daniel
Palmer was
born on September 10, 1929, in
Latrobe, Pennsylvania,

38:41.653 --> 38:43.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outside Pittsburgh.

38:43.521 --> 38:47.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He began swinging a club at age
4 and practically
lived at the area country club,
where his

38:47.692 --> 38:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dad was first the greenskeeper,
and later,
the club pro.

38:52.030 --> 38:57.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Palmer won the U.S. Amateur in
1954, turned
pro the next year and quickly
began piling

38:57.268 --> 39:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up victories, 62 over his
career, including
seven major championships.

39:03.441 --> 39:07.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had a ferocious, muscular
swing that made
him one of golf's greatest
drivers.

39:07.979 --> 39:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his magnetic, down-to-earth
personality
drew an energetic fan base,
dubbed Arnie's

39:13.585 --> 39:14.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Army.

39:14.752 --> 39:17.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He helped turn golf into a major
television
sport.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARNOLD PALMER: The game is so
fantastic.

39:20.058 --> 39:26.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I had a little bit to do with
some of the
enjoyment that I see today, I'm
pleased with

39:26.698 --> 39:28.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

39:28.566 --> 39:31.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The fans had a
lot to enjoy,
especially in the 1960s, when
Palmer was named

39:31.769 --> 39:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Associated Press Athlete of
the Decade.

39:35.006 --> 39:37.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was so popular, he ended up
with his own
drink.

39:37.542 --> 39:41.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The lemonade-iced tea combo he
loved was named
after him.

39:41.446 --> 39:45.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Along the way, he famously
forged a bond with
President Dwight Eisenhower,
himself an avid

39:45.817 --> 39:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
golfer, as Palmer recalled at
the World Golf
Hall of Fame in 2009.

39:49.554 --> 39:55.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARNOLD PALMER: My relationship
with Eisenhower
is one of the great
relationships that I have

39:55.760 --> 39:57.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ever had in my life.

39:57.295 --> 40:00.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Arnold
Palmer's own success
extended far beyond his play.

40:00.965 --> 40:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He developed a passion for
course design,
putting his stamp on about 300
worldwide,

40:05.803 --> 40:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and creating the Arnold Palmer
Design Company.

40:07.972 --> 40:10.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARNOLD PALMER: For me, that has
to be a Cadillac.

40:10.341 --> 40:15.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He was also a
sports marketing
pioneer, advertising everything
from Cadillac,

40:15.380 --> 40:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the blood-thinner Xarelto in
his later
years.

40:18.549 --> 40:22.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Palmer made time as well for
philanthropy,
opening a children's hospital
and investing

40:22.620 --> 40:24.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in youth development.

40:24.322 --> 40:28.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2004, he became the first
golfer to receive
the Presidential Medal of
Freedom.

40:28.493 --> 40:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in 2012, he was awarded the
Congressional
Gold Medal.

40:33.097 --> 40:37.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even in his later years, he
stayed active
in golf, playing his final
competitive match

40:37.402 --> 40:39.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the age of 77.

40:39.437 --> 40:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He took over as honorary starter
at the Masters
in 2007.

40:43.841 --> 40:51.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After that, his friends and
longtime rivals
Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player
joined him.

40:51.482 --> 40:53.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Arnold Palmer died Sunday in
Pittsburgh.

40:53.618 --> 40:57.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was 87 years old.

40:57.221 --> 41:01.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for more on Palmer's legacy,
I'm joined
now by George Savaricas of The
Golf Channel,

41:01.526 --> 41:04.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who's covered Palmer's career,
and just interviewed
him a week ago.

41:05.029 --> 41:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
George, thank you very much for
being here.

41:07.565 --> 41:12.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For those of us who haven't
really followed
his career, just tell us what a
-- what made

41:12.870 --> 41:15.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him such a tremendous talent on
the golf course
itself?

41:15.640 --> 41:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE SAVARICAS, The Golf
Channel: I would
say, on the golf course, it was
clearly his

41:18.976 --> 41:24.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
style of play, because if you
look all time,
he wasn't the winningest golfer,
by any stretch

41:24.449 --> 41:26.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the imagination.

41:26.284 --> 41:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That honor would go to Jack
Nicklaus, and
then Tiger Woods is also in the
conversation.

41:29.687 --> 41:35.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for Arnold, his style of
play was one
that was fearless, bordering at
times on reckless.

41:36.027 --> 41:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it was one that fans could
easily relate
to and support, because he
always had a go-for-broke

41:42.066 --> 41:47.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mentality, that if there was a
shot that he
could pull off, even if the
percentage play

41:47.839 --> 41:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was to maybe be a little more
conservative,
then he would always go for
broke, go for

41:51.909 --> 41:53.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the gusto.

41:53.711 --> 41:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was something that
really appealed
to the crowds back then and it
helped build

41:57.148 --> 42:02.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
upon what became just a -- not
just a brand
on the golf course, but a brand
off the golf

42:02.487 --> 42:04.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
course as well.

42:04.288 --> 42:06.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It seems like,
just as you
say, that he came along at a
time when golf

42:07.024 --> 42:11.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of had this stodgy image of
the country
club set, and he sort of gave it
this charisma

42:11.729 --> 42:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this sort of blue-collar
appeal that seemed
pretty novel at the time.

42:14.999 --> 42:20.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE SAVARICAS: Yes, he was a
guy who had
fairly humble beginnings,
definitely part

42:20.872 --> 42:22.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of middle-class America.

42:22.807 --> 42:24.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His father was a greenskeeper.

42:24.642 --> 42:28.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he grew up playing at
Latrobe Country
Club, so he was a guy who
understood the value

42:28.846 --> 42:32.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of earning a dollar and an
honest day's paycheck.

42:32.083 --> 42:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So when he really burst on the
scene and golf
was first being televised, it
didn't hurt

42:37.488 --> 42:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he had movie star-type
looks and was
the guy who was at the top of
the game from

42:42.427 --> 42:46.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about 1957 to 1963, into the mid
to late '60s.

42:46.998 --> 42:52.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he was able to pile up seven
major victories,
which was remarkable at that
time.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he did it in a short period
of time.

42:54.439 --> 42:59.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he transitioned from doing
that and becoming
this figurehead on the course to
almost a

42:59.477 --> 43:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secondary career, where he was
able to become
just as successful, if not more
so, a successful

43:06.083 --> 43:07.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
businessman.

43:07.885 --> 43:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things I have
been struck by today in a lot of
the tributes

43:10.354 --> 43:15.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to him is that not only talking
about his
talent, but also that he just
seemed to be

43:15.259 --> 43:18.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
apparently an incredibly
magnanimous person
outside of sport.

43:18.963 --> 43:19.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did you see that?

43:19.964 --> 43:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEORGE SAVARICAS: Oh, clearly.

43:22.200 --> 43:27.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, today, I was at
Bay Hill Club
and Lodge, a private country
club that he

43:27.071 --> 43:33.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bought back in 1974, moved the
tournament,
the PGA tour event that's held
in Orlando

43:33.377 --> 43:35.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to there in 1979.

43:35.279 --> 43:38.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was just hanging outer
with the members
and getting their stories.

43:38.716 --> 43:43.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was the most unassuming
global celebrity
that you could ever come across.

43:43.921 --> 43:48.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had a specific table that he
would sit
at every day and play cards with
the guys

43:48.693 --> 43:54.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or play a game of golf or have a
bite to eat
or have a cocktail with them and
just tell

43:54.432 --> 43:56.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stories.

43:56.200 --> 43:59.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And everyone, the first time
they would meet
him, be it if you were an A-list
celebrity

43:59.136 --> 44:04.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or just a guy off the street,
would be nervous,
because you're approaching
Arnold Palmer,

44:04.675 --> 44:09.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that's a name that resonates
not just
with my generation or my mom's
generation

44:09.714 --> 44:15.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or my grandparents' generation,
with all of
those, because he's been an
A-list-plus celebrity

44:16.020 --> 44:17.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for 50, 60 years.

44:17.989 --> 44:23.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it was just amazing to hear
their stories,
and then to hear from guys on
the PGA Tour,

44:23.561 --> 44:28.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be it Tiger Woods, or Jack
Nicklaus, or Phil
Mickelson, or even younger guys
like Rickie

44:28.533 --> 44:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fowler or Jordan Spieth, just
what it meant
to them to either share moments
or share big

44:35.306 --> 44:39.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chunks of their life where they
were lucky
enough to call Arnold Palmer a
friend.

44:39.043 --> 44:44.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We take it for
granted now
that celebrities who excel get
endorsement

44:44.549 --> 44:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deals and that's a big part of
their career,
but he was really a pioneer in
that regard

44:48.953 --> 44:50.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as well, right?

44:50.755 --> 44:54.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE SAVARICAS: That's kind of
the forgotten
story when you look at the
lasting legacy

44:54.458 --> 44:58.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Arnold Palmer will leave
behind, with
what he and Mark McCormack were
able to do

44:59.030 --> 45:00.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with starting IMG.

45:00.298 --> 45:04.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's something that is not
lost on the
modern player.

45:04.035 --> 45:07.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with Suzann Pettersen
today, who is
a star on the LPGA tour.

45:07.505 --> 45:09.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she said she's a member at
Bay Hill Club.

45:10.007 --> 45:14.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When she was looking at
representation and
trying to figure out what move
to make just

45:14.879 --> 45:18.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few years ago, she talked to
Arnold Palmer
and reached out for advice.

45:18.182 --> 45:24.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he told her the story of how
he and Mark
McCormack starting IMG together
and how he

45:24.255 --> 45:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was able to really build his
brand off the
course by gaining endorsements
and then spinning

45:29.193 --> 45:33.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that to a secondary career when
his playing
days were over.

45:33.164 --> 45:38.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been able to as profitable
and successful
as he was, or even more so, than
when he was

45:38.803 --> 45:42.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an A-list golfer and one of the
top draws
on the PGA Tour.

45:42.473 --> 45:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's something that the
modern players,
A, have to be thankful for and,
B, can still

45:47.244 --> 45:49.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
learn lessons from.

45:49.213 --> 45:53.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I understand
that you interviewed
him not too long and asked him
what he thought

45:53.985 --> 45:56.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his lasting legacy of the game
would be.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did he tell you?

45:57.588 --> 45:58.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE SAVARICAS: Yes.

45:58.589 --> 46:00.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was just a week-and-a-half
ago.

46:00.091 --> 46:04.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's amazing to think that I
went from
laughing and joking with him.

46:04.362 --> 46:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was just so recent.

46:06.130 --> 46:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was part of the Latrobe
Classic, which
he has hosted four years in a
row to raise

46:09.934 --> 46:13.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
money for the Arnie's Army
Foundation.

46:13.504 --> 46:17.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what he's done for health
care in the
Orlando area with the Arnold
Palmer Hospital,

46:17.708 --> 46:23.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Winnie Palmer children's
hospital, which
has delivered more than 150,000
babies, you

46:23.481 --> 46:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could tell that that's what got
him excited
at this stage in his life and
his career.

46:28.352 --> 46:32.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had asked him -- it was
just two days
after his 87th birthday, when we
had this

46:32.423 --> 46:35.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interview -- what his goals were
going forward.

46:35.660 --> 46:39.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And raising money for that
hospital -- they
have a $2 million goal that
they're well en

46:39.597 --> 46:40.831 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
route to.

46:40.865 --> 46:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was at the forefront of his
mind.

46:43.300 --> 46:47.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you could see that twinkle
in his eye,
that that's what was getting him
excited to

46:47.471 --> 46:49.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
push forward.

46:49.306 --> 46:51.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
George Savaricas
of The Golf Channel, thanks so
much for sharing

46:51.876 --> 46:52.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your memories of the man.

46:52.977 --> 46:57.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEORGE SAVARICAS: Of course.

46:57.548 --> 47:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
on a light
note: On this day in 1957, "West
Side Story"

47:10.594 --> 47:12.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
debuted on Broadway.

47:12.763 --> 47:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Composer and musician Rob
Kapilow is back
to tell us why the music has
withstood the

47:17.468 --> 47:19.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
test of time.

47:19.103 --> 47:20.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown sat down with
Kapilow recently.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ron Kapilow,
welcome back.

47:22.206 --> 47:23.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW, Composer: It's
great to be here.

47:24.008 --> 47:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, "West Side
Story," one
of the most famous musicals in
history, but

47:27.578 --> 47:30.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not quite what it was intended
to be, I guess.

47:30.448 --> 47:32.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: I think that's
true.

47:32.316 --> 47:36.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Leonard Bernstein had
already written
two his musicals, "On the Town"
and "Wonderful

47:36.153 --> 47:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Town," and those shows are
filled with Bernstein's
love, facility, and affection
for the popular

47:40.691 --> 47:41.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
music of the day.

47:41.792 --> 47:44.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But they're lighthearted
musicals, fundamentally.

47:44.295 --> 47:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And now he wanted to do
something serious,
and he got together an
incredibly serious

47:49.166 --> 47:50.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
crew of guys.

47:50.334 --> 47:52.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we had Jerome Robbins,
who did serious
ballets.

47:52.837 --> 47:55.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had Arthur Laurents, who
wrote serious
plays.

47:55.506 --> 47:59.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had Leonard Bernstein, and
they wanted
to do something serious.

47:59.210 --> 48:00.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was the amazing thing about
Bernstein.

48:00.945 --> 48:03.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He could actually do both, and
he crossed
over.

48:03.714 --> 48:08.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this whole piece is really
about, in a
way, the conflict between those
two worlds,

48:08.419 --> 48:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between the serious world.

48:10.087 --> 48:14.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is going to be, he called a
tragic musical
comedy, if that's not an
oxymoron.

48:14.825 --> 48:17.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tragedies get
turned into operas
all the time.

48:17.762 --> 48:18.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: All the time.

48:18.863 --> 48:20.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In fact, tragedy is the
lifeblood of opera.

48:20.531 --> 48:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not really an opera unless
somebody dies
at the end.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But people don't usually die at
the end in
a Broadway musical.

48:25.903 --> 48:30.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this one had a body count of
three, with
two of them dead at the first
act curtain.

48:30.708 --> 48:35.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, that is not the stuff of
a Broadway
musical, not to mention a
classic Shakespeare

48:35.613 --> 48:37.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
play, "Romeo and Juliet," as the
background.

48:37.414 --> 48:41.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Most people, of
course, know
"West Side Story" from the film,
the musical

48:42.019 --> 48:42.987 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
version.

48:43.020 --> 48:43.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: True.

48:44.021 --> 48:45.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
True.

48:45.222 --> 48:45.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So use the song
"Maria," a
famous song.

48:46.023 --> 48:47.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Famous song.

48:47.057 --> 48:48.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Show us what
turned out there.

48:48.793 --> 48:50.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Well, there's a
great moment
in the middle of "Maria," which
shows this

48:50.728 --> 48:53.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
battle intention between opera
and Broadway.

48:53.798 --> 48:59.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The orchestra is playing the
music of the
opening as if it's become
somehow Tony's subconscious

48:59.136 --> 49:00.104 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mind.

49:00.137 --> 49:01.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR (singing): Maria.

49:01.806 --> 49:12.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have just kissed a girl named
Maria, and
suddenly I found how wonderful a
song can

49:12.049 --> 49:13.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

49:13.417 --> 49:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Beautiful chord,
and all the
warmth.

49:20.591 --> 49:27.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that's what the orchestra
is doing, but,
above it, in the film, Tony, as
if rhapsodizing

49:27.164 --> 49:38.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about this Maria, the sound and
the single
word gets higher and higher in
pitch, until

49:38.843 --> 49:47.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finally climaxes up here, Maria,
and then
in the film, sings this.

49:47.551 --> 49:50.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR (singing): Maria.

49:50.754 --> 49:51.789 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Maria.

49:51.822 --> 49:52.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Maria.

49:52.890 --> 49:53.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Maria.

49:53.958 --> 49:55.292 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Maria.

49:55.326 --> 50:01.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: Now, that's kind of
operatic,
but it's lower in pitch.

50:01.665 --> 50:03.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We're not holding
you to just
sing it again.

50:03.634 --> 50:04.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: But -- exactly.

50:04.635 --> 50:06.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one's vocal chords are
straining.

50:06.203 --> 50:08.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one's blood vessels are
bursting.

50:08.539 --> 50:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's doable eight times a week,
and for the
public, it was perfectly
successful.

50:12.476 --> 50:16.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right, but that's
not the opera
version that Bernstein wanted.

50:16.413 --> 50:18.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: That's not what he
wanted.

50:18.082 --> 50:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He comes from the world of being
one of the
great opera conductors.

50:20.951 --> 50:25.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, was there ever a more
over-the-top,
larger-than-life, operatic
personality than

50:25.623 --> 50:27.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bernstein?

50:27.391 --> 50:40.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he writes a version that
goes higher,
and higher, and higher, and
finally climaxes

50:40.571 --> 50:45.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on a high B-flat held for 10
beats.

50:45.242 --> 50:47.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR (singing): Maria!

50:47.845 --> 50:53.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: This is something
right out of
"La Bohem" or "La Traviata."

50:53.984 --> 50:56.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You literally see the vocal
chords bursting.

50:56.754 --> 51:00.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, eventually, they had to get
rid of it,
and Bernstein was so depressed
because he

51:00.724 --> 51:04.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was constantly writing to his
wife, they're
getting rid of all my favorite
parts, the

51:04.328 --> 51:06.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
operatic parts.

51:06.096 --> 51:10.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he realized that for a tenor
to sing a
high B-flat for 10 beats eight
times a week

51:10.334 --> 51:11.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be hospital-casualty
material.

51:11.802 --> 51:14.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So that's gone
from the musical.

51:14.805 --> 51:15.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: That's gone.

51:15.806 --> 51:16.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They lowered it in pitch.

51:16.807 --> 51:18.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't have to sing the high
notes

51:18.475 --> 51:22.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, interestingly, later in his
life, in
his head, he thought, I really
do want to

51:22.813 --> 51:27.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear this with opera singers,
and he actually
went back later and recorded it
with opera

51:27.051 --> 51:29.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
singers, with the incredibly
high B-flat.

JEFFREY BROWN: Your argument is
that somehow
in the tension between this
opera and musical,

51:35.960 --> 51:38.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high and low, I guess, something
great happened.

51:38.896 --> 51:40.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB KAPILOW: Yes.

51:40.731 --> 51:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the great things about
Bernstein was
that he moved so effortlessly
between the

51:43.067 --> 51:48.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worlds of serious music and
popular music,
and he spoke both languages
absolutely as

51:48.405 --> 51:50.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if they were vernacular.

51:50.240 --> 51:54.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's interesting is the
tension between
what he brought to the world of
the Broadway

51:54.211 --> 52:00.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
musical was the entire world of
serious classical
music, yet he also spoke it in a
natural way

52:00.985 --> 52:03.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that other classical composers
didn't.

52:03.087 --> 52:06.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the end of this piece is a
perfect example.

52:06.390 --> 52:13.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR (singing): The most
beautiful song I
ever heard.

52:13.597 --> 52:19.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: It ends with opera,
but not the
high opera that we think of
opera, but the

52:19.336 --> 52:26.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intimate world of opera, a
floated voice,
a falsetto voice, not the first
Maria, Maria,

52:26.477 --> 52:31.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not the second one, Maria, but a
final one
that resolves Maria for the
first time in

52:31.915 --> 52:36.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the piece, Maria.

52:36.587 --> 52:43.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR (singing): Maria.

52:43.160 --> 52:51.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW: And while a tenor,
only an operatic
tenor can do it well, floats
this high note,

52:52.002 --> 53:00.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the orchestra goes, and we end
the perfect
merging of Broadway musical and
the world

53:00.644 --> 53:01.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of opera.

53:01.645 --> 53:03.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "West Side
Story."

GWEN IFILL: You should have
heard Judy and
I singing along.

53:21.331 --> 53:22.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was something.

53:22.332 --> 53:23.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)
