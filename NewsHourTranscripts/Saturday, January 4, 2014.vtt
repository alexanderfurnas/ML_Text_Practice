VIOLENT EVENTS IN WHICH TH

HANDING POWER TO THE IRAQI

05:07.700 --> 05:10.300

05:10.300 --> 05:12.533
ISSUES THAT HAS GONE ON IN THA

05:12.533 --> 05:14.400
TIME IS THAT THE PRIME MINISTE

HAS NOT BEEN PARTICULARL

05:18.867 --> 05:20.400
COMMUNITIES IN THESE SUNNI AREAS

05:20.400 --> 05:23.900

05:23.900 --> 05:25.700
RESENTMENT TO THE CENTRA

05:25.700 --> 05:26.067
GOVERNMENT

05:26.067 --> 05:29.033

SECTARIAN TENSIONS THAT WERE

05:30.000 --> 05:32.033
STIRRED UP BY THE U.S. INVASIO

05:32.033 --> 05:34.700
OF IRAQ AND A FAILURE OF THE

05:35.867 --> 05:37.700
THESE AREAS IN THE POLITICS OF

05:37.700 --> 05:40.533

05:40.533 --> 05:43.133
HAVE COME FROM THE CENTRAL DOWN.

05:43.133 --> 05:44.300
THERE ARE DIFFICULT THINGS GOING

05:44.300 --> 05:44.567
ON

05:44.567 --> 05:46.767
>> HAS THE SITUATION IN SYRI

05:46.767 --> 05:49.867
MADE IT EASIER FOR THE ISLAMIC

MOVEMENT OF -- WHAT WAS IT THE

05:53.167 --> 05:56.600
ISLAMIC STATE OF IRAQ AND SYRI

05:56.600 --> 05:58.767
TO ESTABLISH A FOOTHOLD IN

05:58.767 --> 05:59.567
RAMADI AND FALLUJAH?

05:59.567 --> 06:01.100
>> ABSOLUTELY.

06:01.100 --> 06:04.167
THEY HAVE TAKEN OVER TERRITORY

06:04.167 --> 06:06.633
IN AREAS BORDERING IRAQ.

06:06.633 --> 06:08.900
IT IS GIVING THEM FREEDOM OF

06:08.900 --> 06:10.800
MOVEMENT AND THAT HAS MADE I

06:10.800 --> 06:12.867
MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO ASSERT

06:12.867 --> 06:14.967
THEMSELVES IN THE IRAQ

06:14.967 --> 06:16.000
PROVINCES FROM WHICH THE

AMERICAN TROOPS THOUGHT THEY HAD

06:18.067 --> 06:18.367
DRIVEN THEM OUT.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.200
FAULT LINES THAT WERE ALWAYS

06:29.200 --> 06:31.833

STRONG CENTRAL GOVERNMEN

06:33.000 --> 06:35.033
ANYWHERE IN THE REGION

06:36.200 --> 06:37.667
THEMSELVES IN THIS AREA AN

06:37.667 --> 06:38.900
OTHER GROUPS ARE ASSERTING

06:38.900 --> 06:41.400
THEMSELVES HERE AND THERE.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.067
AND THE REGION IS FRAGMENTING.

UNITED STATES?

06:45.233 --> 06:47.767

STATE OF IRAQ, A LOT OF MONE

06:54.000 --> 06:56.800

INVOLVED IN THE MIDDLE EAST AS

07:03.167 --> 07:04.367
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS WERE.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.033
AND THE RESULT OF THAT I

07:06.033 --> 07:09.967
OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF TURMOIL AND

07:09.967 --> 07:11.967
UPHEAVAL BECAUSE AMERICA WAS THE

10:19.367 --> 10:20.367
MOTHERS HAVE LITTLE EDUCATIO

10:20.367 --> 10:23.400
ARE RARELY BEING READ TO AND

10:23.400 --> 10:24.867
VERBAL INTERACTION IN THOS

10:24.867 --> 10:27.933
FAMILIES IS MINIMAL.

10:27.933 --> 10:28.367
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THIS NOT ONLY

10:28.367 --> 10:30.533
PUTS THEM BEHIND IN SCHOOL BUT

10:30.533 --> 10:32.967
THOSE CHILDREN RARELY CATCH UP

10:32.967 --> 10:35.467
BECAUSE THEIR BRAINS ARE NOT

10:35.467 --> 10:37.400
DEVELOPING AS RAPIDLY.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.900
>> EARLY SUSTAINED MUSIC

10:39.900 --> 10:43.100
LEARNING IS ACTUALLY THE

10:43.100 --> 10:45.233
FRAME -- THE FRAME UPON WHIC

10:45.233 --> 10:46.767
EDUCATION ITSELF CAN BE BUIL

10:46.767 --> 10:48.900
FOR LOW-INCOME KIDS.

10:48.900 --> 10:50.567
>> Reporter: MARGARET MARTIN WAS

10:50.567 --> 10:52.033
CONVINCED OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE

10:52.033 --> 10:53.667
GRADUATION RATE OF KIDS WHO HAVE

10:53.667 --> 10:54.867
GONE THROUGH HER PROGRAM

10:54.867 --> 10:56.533
THIS YEAR SHE SAYS 93% OF THEM

10:56.533 --> 10:58.100
FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL IN FOUR

10:58.100 --> 11:01.367
YEARS AND WENT TO COLLEGE.

11:01.367 --> 11:03.267
BUT MARTIN ACKNOWLEDGES SHE DOES

11:03.267 --> 11:06.267
NOT HAVE THE FORMAL TRAINING T

11:06.267 --> 11:08.767
PROVE THAT MUSIC HELPS KID

11:08.767 --> 11:11.667
GRASP LANGUAGE BETTER AND BECOME

11:11.667 --> 11:13.700
MORE PROFICIENT READERS.

11:13.700 --> 11:17.067
SO SHE ENLISTED THE HELP O

11:17.067 --> 11:19.200
DR. NINA CROUSE.

11:19.200 --> 11:23.400
FOR 25 YEARS SHE HAS STUDIED HOW

11:23.400 --> 11:24.733
THE BRAIN PROCESSES INFORMATION.

11:24.733 --> 11:26.600
THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF AUDITO

11:26.600 --> 11:27.400
LEARNING

11:27.400 --> 11:31.333
>> WHAT IS THE CONNECTION?

11:31.333 --> 11:33.433
>> THERE IS A CONNECTION IN WHEN

11:33.433 --> 11:35.333
YOU LEARNING TO READ YOU HAVE TO

11:35.333 --> 11:37.667
CONNECT THE SOUNDS OF WORDS YO

11:37.667 --> 11:38.767
HAVE HEARD FOR MANY YEARS WITH

11:38.767 --> 11:40.567
THE SYMBOL ON THE PAGE

11:40.567 --> 11:43.667
YOU ARE MAKE A SOUND TO MEANIN

11:43.667 --> 11:44.167
CONNECTION

11:44.167 --> 11:46.533
>> Reporter: NO ONE HAS PROVEN

11:46.533 --> 11:48.500
CONCLUSIVELY THAT MUSIC IMPROVES

11:48.500 --> 11:50.467
LEARNING AND SOME STUDIES HAVE

11:50.467 --> 11:51.900
FOUND NO LINK AT ALL

11:51.900 --> 11:53.900
BUT AFTER BEING CONTACTED BY

11:53.900 --> 11:55.900
MARTIN, THE SCIENTIST DESIGNED

11:55.900 --> 11:58.333
TESTS TO MEASURE THE IMPAC

11:58.333 --> 12:01.600
MUSIC HAD ON THIS GROUP OF KIDS.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.333
DR. CROUSE STARTED IN 2011

12:05.333 --> 12:07.467
THE STUDENTS CAME FROM SIMILAR

12:07.467 --> 12:08.733
BACKGROUNDS AND WERE ALL

12:08.733 --> 12:11.000
MOTIVATED TO LEARN MUSIC AT TH

12:11.000 --> 12:11.533
HARMONY PROJECT.

12:11.533 --> 12:13.767
HALF THE KIDS WERE SELECTED TO

12:13.767 --> 12:15.733
START MUSIC STUDY THEN AND THE

12:15.733 --> 12:16.367
OTHER HALF, THE CONTROL GROU

12:16.367 --> 12:20.000
WAITED A YEAR TO BEGIN

12:20.000 --> 12:23.367
DR. CROUSE'S TEAM TOOK A MOBIL

12:23.367 --> 12:25.300
TESTING LAB TO L.A. AT THE

12:25.300 --> 12:26.767
BEGINNING AND ONCE A YEAR FO

12:26.767 --> 12:28.867
TWO YEARS TO ASSESS THE CHANGE

12:28.867 --> 12:30.633
IN KIDS BRAIN RESPONSE I

12:30.633 --> 12:32.100
SPECIFIC AREAS IMPORTANT FOR

12:32.100 --> 12:34.000
GOOD READING AND LEARNIN

12:34.000 --> 12:34.133
SKILLS

12:34.133 --> 12:36.233
WHAT ARE THE TESTS LIKE THAT YOU

12:36.233 --> 12:38.467
DO ON THE KIDS TO MEASURE THES

12:38.467 --> 12:38.867
THINGS

12:38.867 --> 12:42.267
>> WE ARE INTERESTED IN RHYTHMIC

12:42.267 --> 12:42.533
SKILLS

12:42.533 --> 12:45.367
WE ASK THEM TO TAP ALONG WITH

12:45.367 --> 12:45.833
STEADY RHYTHM.

12:45.833 --> 12:49.767
>> NOW WE ARE GOING TO TAP

12:49.767 --> 12:51.267
FASTER

12:51.267 --> 13:00.333
>> IF YOU PRESENT A BEAT ON

13:00.333 --> 13:01.767
METRONOME THAT ABILITY IS LINKED

13:01.767 --> 13:03.000
TO READING ABILITY

13:03.000 --> 13:05.133
WE ASK THEM TO LISTEN TO WORDS

13:05.133 --> 13:06.833
OR PARTS OF WORDS.

13:06.833 --> 13:08.333
>> IMAGINE YOU ARE AT A PARTY.

13:08.333 --> 13:10.267
THERE WILL BE A WOMAN TALKIN

13:10.267 --> 13:11.700
AND SEVERAL TALKERS IN THE

13:11.700 --> 13:12.433
BACKGROUND

13:12.433 --> 13:15.300
>> WE HAVE THEM LISTEN T

13:15.300 --> 13:16.833
SENTENCES PRESENTED IN NOISY

13:16.833 --> 13:18.833
BACKGROUNDS AND THEY HAVE TO

13:18.833 --> 13:22.067
REPEAT BACK AS MUCH AS THEY WERE

13:22.067 --> 13:23.167
ABLE TO HEAR

13:23.167 --> 13:24.800
>> THE PIN SELL --

13:24.800 --> 13:26.967
>> AND THE BACKGROUND IS NOISIER

13:26.967 --> 13:28.733
AND IT IS HARDER AND HARDER TO

13:28.733 --> 13:35.667
HEAR THE SOUNDS.

13:35.667 --> 13:37.900
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD MUSICA

13:37.900 --> 13:39.000
TRAINING ARE BETTER AT HEARING

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
SPEECH IN NOISE.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.033
AND IT'S NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM

13:46.033 --> 13:46.733
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING YOUR NERVOU

13:46.733 --> 13:48.367
SYSTEM TO DO WHEN YOU AR

13:48.367 --> 13:50.900
LISTENING FOR A TEACHER'S VOIC

13:50.900 --> 13:52.533
IN A NOISY CLASSROOM

13:52.533 --> 13:54.533
SO WE SIMPLY KNOW THAT IF YO

13:54.533 --> 13:56.767
ASK PEOPLE TO REPEAT BAC

13:56.767 --> 13:58.433
SENTENCES THAT ARE PRESENTED T

13:58.433 --> 14:00.800
THEM IN BACKGROUND NOISE, THAT

14:00.800 --> 14:04.133
IF YOU HAVE MUSICAL TRAINING

14:04.133 --> 14:08.067
THAT YOU ARE BETTER AT REPEATING

14:08.067 --> 14:09.300
BACK THE SENTENCES ACCURATEL

14:09.300 --> 14:09.833
THAN IF YOU DID NOT HAVE THA

14:09.833 --> 14:12.133
MUSICAL TRAINING

14:12.133 --> 14:13.933
>> I GUESS THAT IS ESPECIALL

14:13.933 --> 14:16.867
TRUE WHEN A CHILD IS IN AN

14:16.867 --> 14:34.267
ORCHESTRA HAS HAS TO DISTINGIS

14:34.267 --> 14:35.867
THE NOISE HE IS MAKING

14:35.867 --> 14:37.133
>> THEIR COMPREHENSION O

14:37.133 --> 14:39.233
MEANING IN A NOISY ENVIRONMENT

14:39.233 --> 14:40.867
GOES UP ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE

14:40.867 --> 14:42.333
STARTED MUSIC.

14:42.333 --> 14:45.200
>> AND THE KIDS WHO HAVE HAD TWO

14:45.200 --> 14:47.667
YEARS ARE CONTINUING TO MAKE

14:47.667 --> 14:48.467
GAINS.

14:48.467 --> 14:53.367
>> MUSIC EDUCATION IS AN

14:53.367 --> 14:54.633
IMPORTANT INVESTMENT IN TEACHING

14:54.633 --> 14:58.967
A CHILD ALL KINDS OF SKILLS.

14:58.967 --> 15:03.233
>> DR. CROUSE IS ANALYZING DAT

15:03.233 --> 15:05.467
BUT PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST

15:05.467 --> 15:08.367
THAT MUSIC MAY ENHANCE THE

15:08.367 --> 15:09.500
NEUROLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF KIDS

15:09.500 --> 15:12.133
IN THE HARMONY PROJECT WHO WER

15:12.133 --> 15:12.700
BEHIND IN SCHOOL

15:12.700 --> 15:14.767
>> YOU CAN DOCUMENT THAT KID

15:14.767 --> 15:18.967
WHO HAVE HAD MUSICAL EDUCATION

15:18.967 --> 15:21.500
NOW HAVE NERVOUS SYSTEMS THA

15:21.500 --> 15:24.033
RESPOND MORE ACCURATELY AN

15:24.033 --> 15:24.767
PRECISELY TO MEANINGFUL ELEMENTS

15:24.767 --> 15:29.233
IN LANGUAGE.

15:29.233 --> 15:32.067
>> IN SCIENCE I HAD VERY LOW

15:32.067 --> 15:32.300
GRADES

15:32.300 --> 15:35.200
WHEN I STARTED LEARNING ABOU

15:35.200 --> 15:39.067
MUSIC, BEING ABLE TO PRACTIC

15:39.067 --> 15:41.333
AND CONCENTRATING, MY GRADES

15:41.333 --> 15:42.633
HAVE GONE HIGHER

15:42.633 --> 15:44.467
I WOULD CONCENTRATE IN MY MUSIC.

15:44.467 --> 15:46.167
IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO B

15:46.167 --> 15:48.867
FOCUSED ON AND NOT BE BOTHERED

15:48.867 --> 15:49.700
BY ANYONE.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.867
I WAS USING THAT IN MY HOMEWORK.

15:52.867 --> 15:54.400
SCIENCE IS NOW ONE OF MY BES

15:54.400 --> 15:55.033
SUBJECTS

15:59.833 --> 16:03.767
SAY THE KIDS ARE LISTENING T

16:03.767 --> 16:05.000
MUSIC ALL THE TIME

16:05.000 --> 16:06.167
WHY DOESN'T THAT WORK?

16:06.167 --> 16:08.800
>> NO ONE EVER GOT FIT WATCHIN

16:08.800 --> 16:09.767
SPECTATOR SPORTS

16:09.767 --> 16:11.900
PLUGGING IN AND LISTENING TO

16:11.900 --> 16:14.667
MUSIC, IT DOESN'T FIX YOUR

16:14.667 --> 16:14.933
BRAIN.

16:14.933 --> 16:15.967
DOING IT TRANSFORMS YOUR NERVOUS

16:15.967 --> 16:19.200
SYSTEM

16:19.200 --> 16:19.733
