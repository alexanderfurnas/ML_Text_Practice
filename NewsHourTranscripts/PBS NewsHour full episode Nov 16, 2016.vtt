HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
President-elect
Donald Trump denies reports of a
disorderly

00:11.812 --> 00:15.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
transition as he begins shaping
his new administration.

00:15.949 --> 00:20.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Wednesday: As
protests against
the Dakota Access pipeline grow
nationwide,

00:20.754 --> 00:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we talk with the CEO of the
company trying
to move the oil.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELCY WARREN, CEO, Energy
Transfer Partners:
We're complying with all the
laws, all the

00:26.860 --> 00:29.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rules, and we're overdesigning.

00:29.296 --> 00:34.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This pipeline is being built to
safety standards
that far exceed what the
government requires

00:34.234 --> 00:36.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us to do.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we head to
the front
lines in the battle against
ISIS, where Iraqi

00:38.906 --> 00:41.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forces try to take back the key
city of Mosul.

00:41.875 --> 00:47.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This is as far as
the front
line comes here in Mosul in this
neighborhood,

00:47.281 --> 00:50.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just this pile of rubble, beyond
it, ISIS
fighters.

00:50.384 --> 00:58.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.058 --> 01:00.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.961 --> 01:10.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: From the top
of Trump Tower
in New York on down, the message
today was

01:10.570 --> 01:14.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emphatic: There is no turmoil in
the transition.

01:14.474 --> 01:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News accounts told of more
moderate figures
being purged, of advisers
fighting for power,

01:19.880 --> 01:22.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and of foreign officials unable
to reach Trump
aides.

01:22.983 --> 01:26.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president-elect denied it
all in a series
of tweets.

01:26.286 --> 01:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, he wrote, it is going
so smoothly,
and his spokesman echoed the
claim.

01:30.424 --> 01:34.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON MILLER, Trump Campaign
Senior Communications
Adviser: Inside, there's a very
solid plan.

01:34.995 --> 01:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a methodical approach to
all this
being put together.

01:38.899 --> 01:44.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have read a number of the news
reports that
want to make us kind of like --
there's all

01:44.738 --> 01:45.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sorts of descriptions I have
heard.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very calm, it's very
structured.

01:47.474 --> 01:49.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And anyone saying anything else
is either,
A, bitter because they're not on
the inside

01:49.509 --> 01:53.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not being considered, or
they're someone
who is just bitter because the
election was

01:53.380 --> 01:56.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last week and they didn't get
the result that
they wanted.

01:56.984 --> 02:00.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile, in
Washington,
vice president-elect Pence met
with Vice President

02:00.721 --> 02:05.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Biden, who said he's confident
everything
will be in good hands on day one
of the new

02:06.026 --> 02:07.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

02:07.694 --> 02:11.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But House Democrats formally
asked that Steve
Bannon not be made a senior
adviser.

02:11.698 --> 02:16.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They cited allegations of racial
bigotry and
anti-Semitism, which Bannon
denies.

02:16.370 --> 02:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama also offered
reassurance about
the political transition on his
farewell tour

02:21.375 --> 02:23.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Europe.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Obama visited the ancient
Acropolis in
Athens, Greece, the cradle of
democracy.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in a speech, he again
promised a peaceful
handover of power.

02:30.517 --> 02:33.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
As you may have noticed, the
next American

02:33.987 --> 02:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president and I could not be
more different.

02:36.690 --> 02:37.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:37.691 --> 02:39.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:39.426 --> 02:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: We have very
different points
of view, but American democracy
is bigger

02:44.031 --> 02:45.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than any one person.

02:45.432 --> 02:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: From Greece,
the president
flew on to Germany.

02:48.502 --> 02:53.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president of Turkey today
criticized anti-Trump
protesters in the U.S. Recep
Tayyip Erdogan

02:53.940 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said his message is show some
respect and
wait to see how he actually
governs.

02:59.713 --> 03:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a TV interview, Syrian
President Bashar
al-Assad praised Mr. Trump's
campaign comments

03:05.419 --> 03:07.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on fighting Islamic State forces
in Syria.

03:07.954 --> 03:11.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, President of
Syria (through
translator): If -- I say if --
if he is going

03:11.591 --> 03:16.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fight the terrorists, of
course, we're
going to be ally, natural ally
in that regard,

03:16.830 --> 03:18.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with the Russians, with
Iranians, with many
other countries.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
president-elect has
said he would prioritize
fighting ISIS over

03:22.502 --> 03:24.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regime change in Syria.

03:24.971 --> 03:28.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Russia, the Supreme Court has
overturned
a criminal conviction against
opposition leader

03:28.975 --> 03:30.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Alexei Navalny.

03:30.811 --> 03:34.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was convicted for
embezzlement in 2013,
but, in February, the European
Court of Human

03:34.548 --> 03:38.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rights ruled his right to a fair
trial had
been violated.

03:38.085 --> 03:43.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Navalny will now get a new
trial, but that
could still hinder him from
running for office

03:43.256 --> 03:45.125 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

03:45.158 --> 03:48.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in this country, a
Minnesota policeman
was charged today with
second-degree manslaughter

03:48.595 --> 03:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the killing of Philando
Castile during
a traffic stop last summer.

03:52.966 --> 03:58.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officer Jeronimo Yanez has said
he opened
fire after Castile said he was
armed and appeared

03:58.572 --> 04:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be reaching for something.

04:00.207 --> 04:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The aftermath was streamed live
by his girlfriend
and triggered protests.

04:04.945 --> 04:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A prosecutor said today the
shooting was totally
unjustified.

04:08.582 --> 04:14.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CHOI, Ramsey County
Prosecutor: To those
who may say that this incident
was Philando

04:14.321 --> 04:24.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Castile's fault, I would submit
that no reasonable
officer, knowing, seeing and
hearing what

04:24.297 --> 04:31.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officer Yanez did at the time,
would've used
deadly force under these
circumstances.

04:31.505 --> 04:36.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yanez could be
sentenced
to up to 10 years in prison if
he's convicted.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans and Democrats in the
Senate picked
their leaders today.

04:39.246 --> 04:43.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kentucky Republican Mitch
McConnell was reelected
to serve as majority leader.

04:43.383 --> 04:47.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York Democrat Chuck Schumer
will take
over as minority leader,
replacing the retiring

04:47.287 --> 04:48.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Harry Reid.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both men talked of looking past
the election
and cooperating where they can.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.760 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: we're
going to address the real
concerns of the

04:55.529 --> 05:01.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American people, not go back and
relitigate
what anybody on either side may
have said

05:01.701 --> 05:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during a very hotly contested
presidential
race.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.639 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:05.672 --> 05:07.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES SCHUMER (D), New York:
Where we can
work together, we will.

05:08.008 --> 05:12.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have also said to the
president-elect,
on issues where we disagree, you
can expect

05:12.312 --> 05:14.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a strong and tough fight.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Democrats'
new leadership
team also includes former
presidential candidate

05:17.817 --> 05:19.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bernie Sanders.

05:19.586 --> 05:23.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been another long day for
crews trying
to douse flames in seven states
across the

05:23.223 --> 05:25.125 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
South.

05:25.158 --> 05:29.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wildfires have burned roughly
128,000 acres
in woodland areas, much of that
in North Carolina,

05:29.763 --> 05:31.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and fueled by drought
conditions.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 5,000 firefighters are
on the job.

05:34.701 --> 05:39.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials say heavy smoke from
the fires is
causing breathing problems in a
number of

05:39.406 --> 05:41.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
communities.

05:41.341 --> 05:45.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, bank shares gave
up some post-election
gains, and stocks finished
mostly lower.

05:45.278 --> 05:49.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly
55 points to close at 18868.

05:49.449 --> 05:54.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose almost 19
points, but the
S&amp;P 500 slid three.

05:54.788 --> 05:59.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Obama has named 21
recipients
of the Presidential Medal of
Freedom, the

05:59.459 --> 06:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nation's highest civilian honor.

06:01.494 --> 06:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The list includes
singer-songwriter Bruce
Springsteen, actor Tom Hanks,
basketball great

06:06.566 --> 06:11.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Michael Jordan, and
mathematician and computer
scientist Margaret Hamilton,
among others.

06:11.238 --> 06:15.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will be recognized in a
White House ceremony
on Tuesday.

06:15.675 --> 06:19.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
potential
conflicts of interest between
the president-elect

06:19.813 --> 06:24.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his business ventures; the
CEO of the
controversial Dakota Access
pipeline on the

06:24.851 --> 06:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
project's opposition; the long,
hard fight
for the Iraqi city of Mosul; and
much more.

06:34.894 --> 06:41.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
project's opposition; the long,
hard fight
for the Iraqi city of Mosul; and
much more.

06:41.601 --> 06:49.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Often, the people a president
surrounds himself
with says something about his
goals as any

06:49.242 --> 06:51.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
policy statement.

06:51.278 --> 06:55.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump is in the
process of
deciding who will fill critical
national security

06:55.615 --> 06:57.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and diplomatic posts.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These decisions will shape the
direction of
his presidency and the country.

07:00.854 --> 07:05.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on who's in the running
for these
jobs, and the reaction from
allies and others

07:05.125 --> 07:08.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overseas, I'm joined now by
"NewsHour" chief
foreign affairs correspondent
Margaret Warner.

07:08.995 --> 07:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of important
national security
jobs, foreign policy positions.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the latest?

07:16.736 --> 07:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, the
latest is, Hari,
that to experienced foreign
policy hands,

07:19.973 --> 07:22.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the process looks chaotic.

07:22.542 --> 07:26.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have names being raised --
for instance,
let's take secretary of state.

07:26.212 --> 07:30.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have John Bolton, the former
U.N. ambassador,
very kind of aggressive, you
would call a

07:30.850 --> 07:32.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neoconservative.

07:32.852 --> 07:37.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then you have Senator Bob
Corker, who is considered
sort of middle of the road and
conservative.

07:37.791 --> 07:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you have Rudy Giuliani,
of course,
the former New York mayor.

07:42.395 --> 07:47.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few other names have surfaced,
Kelly Ayotte,
Nikki Haley, the South Carolina
governor.

07:47.934 --> 07:54.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what troubles those who are
really observing
this process is there seems to
be no rhyme

07:54.174 --> 07:55.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or reason.

07:55.542 --> 07:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what you have got are people
who don't
share the same views.

07:58.912 --> 08:02.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some don't share the views that
Trump enunciated
during the campaign.

08:02.382 --> 08:08.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the people close to the
Trump Organization
say, look, we honestly didn't
expect to win.

08:08.655 --> 08:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they didn't have a big
structure set up,
as Hillary Clinton did, with
somebody like

08:12.492 --> 08:17.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a former national security
adviser in charge
of this particular part of the
transition.

08:17.430 --> 08:21.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it is also keeping
with the way
he ran his campaign, which was
kind of freeform

08:21.501 --> 08:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and competing centers of power.

08:23.703 --> 08:29.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so then, of course, it's
also, finally,
the first time he's really
having a baptism

08:29.843 --> 08:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by fire in managing this chaotic
-- or, I
would say, diverse Republican
coalition.

08:35.048 --> 08:39.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, you have John McCain
lecturing him yesterday
about don't get too close to
Putin.

08:39.285 --> 08:46.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have Senator Rand Paul
shooting bullets
at both Bolton and Giuliani,
saying we don't

08:46.226 --> 08:49.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
need a hothead in these jobs.

08:49.195 --> 08:56.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that everybody will
settle down
once you have got these top jobs
filled.

08:56.836 --> 09:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
President Obama
overseas trying to reassure the
E.U., different

09:03.143 --> 09:06.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries, that President Trump
will honor
his commitment to NATO.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do the Europeans see this?

09:08.181 --> 09:12.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: One ambassador
said to me,
very reassuring words, but we
want to hear

09:12.519 --> 09:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them from president-elect Trump.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you said, President Obama
will be meeting
with Chancellor Merkel tomorrow.

09:18.458 --> 09:23.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have private meetings
before he goes
in meetings with other NATO
allies.

09:23.530 --> 09:29.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What concerns the Europeans
deeply are two
things that Donald Trump said
during the campaign.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One was, he questioned the whole
relevance
of the NATO alliance and in fact
some of our

09:32.605 --> 09:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alliances overseas, the burden
that the United
States pays to support them.

09:36.810 --> 09:42.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he actually suggested that
maybe NATO
wouldn't come to the rescue some
of country

09:42.182 --> 09:47.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if it hadn't been -- under
Article V if it
hadn't been paying its full fair
share, which

09:47.153 --> 09:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is supposed to be 2 percent of
GDP.

09:49.656 --> 09:55.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Wolfgang Ischinger, who
used to be
the German ambassador here --
and I spoke

09:55.862 --> 10:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Ambassador Ischinger late
last night -- and
he said, these are really
dangerous times

10:00.433 --> 10:01.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Europe.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got the migrant crisis.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have got Britain leaving the
E.U.

10:04.237 --> 10:08.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got the rise of all
these populist
nationalist parties with some
ugly aspects

10:08.341 --> 10:10.109 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

10:10.143 --> 10:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we start to feel that the
United States
is not really our reliable
partner, ally,

10:15.348 --> 10:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and anchor, it's going to get
worse, then
dangerous.

10:17.851 --> 10:22.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, finally,
what about
the relationship between
president-elect Trump

10:22.889 --> 10:23.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Putin?

10:23.890 --> 10:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How are Europeans concerned
about this?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That's a big
part of it,
Hari.

10:27.126 --> 10:31.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There was actually an
interesting little conference
call yesterday with two former
secretaries

10:31.297 --> 10:32.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
general of NATO.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm surprised they spoke so
bluntly.

10:34.400 --> 10:40.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is concern that -- it
didn't go unnoticed
that president-elect Trump
called Vladimir

10:40.340 --> 10:46.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin before he called some NATO
leaders,
and they are concerned that he
will be open

10:46.279 --> 10:52.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to cutting some separate deal
with Putin,
some sort of trade-off between
Syria and the

10:52.519 --> 10:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ukraine, without getting into
all the details.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said that would really
be very, very
dangerous.

10:57.824 --> 11:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would send the message that
taking -- you
know, crossing borders and
taking territory

11:01.694 --> 11:02.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by force is OK.

11:02.795 --> 11:05.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Margaret
Warner, thanks
so much.

11:05.665 --> 11:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Thank you.

11:12.205 --> 11:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Donald Trump
will be sworn
into office on January 20 with
more business

11:18.978 --> 11:21.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
holdings than any previous
president.

11:21.781 --> 11:24.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang has more on the
questions that are
being asked.

11:24.684 --> 11:30.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: The Trump
Organization has a variety
of assets and arrangements that
span the globe.

11:30.089 --> 11:34.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as president, Mr. Trump
will have the
authority to appoint people who
will make

11:34.193 --> 11:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decisions that affect those
businesses.

11:36.896 --> 11:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here to discuss the potential
for conflict
is Robert Weissman, president of
nonprofit

11:41.634 --> 11:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public interest group Public
Citizen, and
in New York, Susanne Craig, a
New York Times

11:46.506 --> 11:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reporter who has writing about
this story.

11:48.942 --> 11:49.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Susanne, let me start with you.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a very complicated
story.

11:53.580 --> 11:57.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of parts to
president-elect
Trump's business holdings.

11:57.717 --> 12:04.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the easiest example
is the Trump
International Hotel here in
Washington, D.C.

12:04.524 --> 12:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Walk us through the potential
for conflicts
with that hotel.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSANNE CRAIG, The New York
Times: It's really
interesting.

12:10.530 --> 12:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a hotel that just
opened, and it's
been -- it's been in progress
for a few years,

12:16.936 --> 12:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's on the site of the old
post office,
which is a government property.

12:22.875 --> 12:28.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump has a ground
lease for 60
years, the Trump Organization,
for 60 years,

12:28.214 --> 12:30.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to run the hotel out of that.

12:30.483 --> 12:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's an arrangement
between the federal
government, an agency called the
GSA, and

12:35.254 --> 12:37.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Trump Organization.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president has the power
to appoint
the head of the GSA.

12:41.361 --> 12:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's just this incredible
situation where
you have got a private company
that will now

12:46.332 --> 12:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be -- that is owned by soon to
be the president
that will be negotiating with a
government

12:52.405 --> 12:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agency where the head of that
agency is appointed
by the president.

12:55.975 --> 13:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So just the potential there for
conflict,
you can just see it coming 100
miles away.

13:01.047 --> 13:05.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the GSA is already saying
they are preparing
for it and they're looking at
it.

13:05.518 --> 13:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Imagine that situation and
multiply it by
so many when you look at all the
different

13:10.823 --> 13:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things that could happen with
the various
companies that Donald Trump owns
and the business

13:16.062 --> 13:17.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
interests that he has.

13:17.864 --> 13:22.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, also, Susanne,
in that hotel
are workers who might want to
unionize.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSANNE CRAIG: Who might want to
unionize.

13:24.837 --> 13:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this situation's actually
been playing
out in Las Vegas, where he
co-owns a hotel

13:29.308 --> 13:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Las Vegas, and that hotel has
-- the workers
there have tried to unionize,
and the National

13:36.683 --> 13:42.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Labor Relations Board, which has
got presidential
appointees on it, has actually
-- the board

13:42.422 --> 13:46.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has ruled against Donald Trump
even in the
days before the election, so yet
another example

13:46.859 --> 13:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
playing out in real time already
where you
have got conflict between the
private -- the

13:53.099 --> 13:57.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
private holdings and now
government agencies
that will have presidential
appointees on

13:57.270 --> 13:59.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

13:59.072 --> 14:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Robert Weissman, Hope
Hicks, who
is the spokesperson for
president-elect Trump,

14:02.408 --> 14:07.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says that Mr. Trump will comply
with all applicable
rules and regulations.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What are the rules and
regulations in this
case?

14:09.615 --> 14:11.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
®MD-BO /ROBERT WEISSMAN,
President, Public
Citizen: Almost none.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSANNE CRAIG: Yes.

14:13.252 --> 14:17.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT WEISSMAN: There are a lot
of rules,
ethics rules that apply to
government employees,

14:17.457 --> 14:19.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to members of Congress.

14:19.258 --> 14:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As regards this set of issues,
there's really
not too much that applies to the
president,

14:23.763 --> 14:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
except some issues about taking
gifts from
foreign governments.

14:27.166 --> 14:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And so there's no
law, there's
nothing that says he has to do
anything with

14:32.171 --> 14:33.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his personal assets?

14:33.172 --> 14:34.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT WEISSMAN: There's no law.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is common sense.

14:36.809 --> 14:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we're looking at is an
unprecedented
set of conflicts of interests,
and common

14:40.513 --> 14:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense says the president has to
divest himself
of these business holdings to
avoid these

14:45.651 --> 14:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conflicts, which will be legion,
covering
everything from worker health
and safety issues,

14:52.325 --> 14:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worker rights that you were
discussing, treatment
of government contractors, to
consumer protection,

14:57.163 --> 15:02.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how the civil justice system
works, bankruptcy
law, tax policy, even the --
even the conduct

15:02.902 --> 15:04.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of foreign policy.

15:04.704 --> 15:09.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a staggering set of
potential conflicts
of -- actually, conflicts that
will emerge,

15:09.275 --> 15:10.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unless he divests.

15:10.710 --> 15:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He says he's going to
have his
children running the business.

15:14.213 --> 15:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Rudy Giuliani says: "You
have to have
some confidence in the integrity
of the president.

15:19.585 --> 15:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think there's any real
fear or suspicion
that he's seeking to enrich
himself by being

15:24.190 --> 15:25.158 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president."

15:25.191 --> 15:27.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you respond?

15:27.226 --> 15:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT WEISSMAN: Well, even if
the president-elect
operates in good faith as
president, the conflicts

15:30.329 --> 15:31.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are still present.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are unavoidable.

15:32.331 --> 15:34.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSANNE CRAIG: Yes.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT WEISSMAN: And it makes no
difference
if he maintains ownership of the
Trump Organization

15:37.537 --> 15:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
businesses and lets his children
run the businesses.

15:40.473 --> 15:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, those children
are plainly
going to be centrally involved
in administration

15:44.410 --> 15:45.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and policy-making.

15:45.912 --> 15:49.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Susanne, we talked
about the specific
example of that hotel.

15:49.081 --> 15:52.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a real estate businessman.

15:52.385 --> 15:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He relies on low interest rates
from banks
to prosper.

15:56.489 --> 16:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says he won't release his tax
returns because
they're being audited.

16:01.494 --> 16:06.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But talk about the nexus of his
role as president
and those issues as well.

16:07.033 --> 16:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSANNE CRAIG: Well, the thing
is, sometimes,
it's -- these conflicts and
potential conflicts

16:11.771 --> 16:15.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exist, and it's simply that you
don't know
a lot of conversations that are
going on,

16:15.975 --> 16:19.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is why there is a call for
him to divest
the assets.

16:19.846 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you can't -- you can't
have your children
run them and then not know what
the assets

16:25.151 --> 16:26.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are, and especially in the case
of real estate.

16:26.752 --> 16:29.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
These are fixed assets.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He knows the financials of them.

16:31.123 --> 16:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, unless there's a full
divestiture, there's
just -- there's no way that
these either real

16:36.295 --> 16:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conflicts or potential conflicts
come up.

16:39.532 --> 16:43.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the other thing that's of
concern is that
he hasn't released his taxes.

16:43.135 --> 16:48.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have a full picture of
his financial
situation and foreign holdings.

16:48.841 --> 16:53.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's just -- there's so much
going on here,
and it's just -- sometimes,
we're just never

16:53.446 --> 16:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even going to know if stuff
happens because
we don't even know, you know,
that there is

16:57.717 --> 16:59.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even a conflict.

16:59.385 --> 17:04.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I did a story earlier this year,
and he had
he had released a number of his
lenders.

17:04.056 --> 17:08.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it turns out he'd only
released loans
in which the Trump Organization,
in which

17:08.861 --> 17:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was 100 percent ownership
of the property
behind it.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We found loans on partnerships
that weren't
disclosed and so on.

17:15.501 --> 17:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just -- it was sort of
mind-boggling
when I started to do this, this
summer on

17:18.504 --> 17:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just the potential for what
wasn't there and
what we were finding.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a situation where I
just don't
think we're ever going to be
sure, unless

17:26.345 --> 17:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a divestiture, that
there isn't something
going on or there is the
potential for something

17:31.083 --> 17:32.051 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to go on.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's troubling.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Robert, we have a
very brief amount
of time left.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What can be done?

17:37.256 --> 17:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what do you want to see done
in this case?

17:39.258 --> 17:43.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT WEISSMAN: Well, there's
just no way
to square the candidate's
promises to deal

17:43.896 --> 17:47.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with corruption in Washington,
to end ended
insider dealing and his
maintaining these

17:47.967 --> 17:49.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
business interests.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he's going to have to sell
them off, unless
he's going to discredit
everything he ran

17:52.872 --> 17:54.373 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

17:54.407 --> 17:58.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Robert Weissman,
Susanne Craig,
thanks very much for joining us.

17:58.477 --> 18:04.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSANNE CRAIG: Thank you.

18:04.717 --> 18:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The struggle
over the Dakota
Access oil pipeline intensified
this week,

18:13.359 --> 18:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with protesters in a number of
cities joining
the Native tribes who are
opposed to the project.

18:18.331 --> 18:23.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the company building
the pipeline
is pushing back, filing suit in
federal court

18:23.302 --> 18:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yesterday to get its last permit
issued.

18:26.372 --> 18:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham continues his
reporting on
this legal and environmental
standoff.

18:31.243 --> 18:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: From New York
to Chicago
to Los Angeles, protests against
the Dakota

18:40.353 --> 18:44.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Access oil pipeline have spread
nationwide
this week.

18:44.123 --> 18:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Opponents say the last remaining
section of
the pipeline would threaten the
drinking water

18:48.060 --> 18:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and cultural lands of the
Standing Rock Sioux
Tribe in North Dakota.

18:51.998 --> 18:57.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: They're threatening
millions of people
in the entire region and
threaten ultimately

18:57.603 --> 19:00.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the climate of the entire
planet.

19:00.272 --> 19:05.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
1,200-mile-long pipeline
would carry 500,000 gallons of
crude oil every

19:05.411 --> 19:10.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day from North Dakota through
South Dakota
and Iowa to a shipping point in
Illinois.

19:10.449 --> 19:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, since August, hundreds,
sometimes thousands
of members of various Indian
tribes and nations

19:15.588 --> 19:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have gathered at a camp near
Cannon Ball,
North Dakota, to try to stop
construction.

19:20.960 --> 19:25.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're drawing support from
outside figures
as well, including Robert F.
Kennedy Jr.,

19:25.297 --> 19:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who visited yesterday.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.,
President, Waterkeeper
Alliance: I think they have a
lot of courage.

19:29.001 --> 19:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they're standing up for
America, that
they're standing up in the face
of a bully.

19:33.539 --> 19:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Elsewhere,
dozens of people
were arrested yesterday near
Mandan, North

19:37.109 --> 19:41.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dakota, for blocking railway
tracks near a
pipeline work site.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a court fight looms.

19:43.949 --> 19:48.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
granted construction
permits back in July, but, two
months later,

19:48.854 --> 19:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stopped work and called for
further review.

19:51.323 --> 19:54.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, on Monday, the Corps
announced a
further delay.

19:54.994 --> 19:59.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the pipeline builder,
Texas-based Energy
Transfer Partners, is asking a
federal judge

19:59.899 --> 20:01.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to give the remaining
construction the go-ahead.

20:02.001 --> 20:07.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement Tuesday, the
company decried
what it called the Obama
administration's

20:07.606 --> 20:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"political interference" and
"its flagrant
disregard for the rule of law."

20:13.612 --> 20:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on this ongoing fight,
I'm joined
now by Kelcy Warren.

20:17.016 --> 20:21.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the CEO of Energy Transfer
Partners,
the company that owns and is
building the

20:21.187 --> 20:22.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Dakota Access pipeline.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Warren, thank you very much
for being
here.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELCY WARREN, CEO, Energy
Transfer Partners:
Thank you.

20:26.392 --> 20:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk
about the overarching
fight that is going on here.

20:30.096 --> 20:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you well know, the Standing
Rock Tribe
has two principal arguments.

20:34.300 --> 20:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, the construction of this
pipeline is
going to damage ancestral sites
of theirs,

20:40.139 --> 20:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, two, if the pipeline is
built and it
goes under the Missouri River,
that it is

20:44.410 --> 20:49.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to, if it were to leak,
potentially
contaminate their drinking
water.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wonder what your response
to those concerns
are.

20:52.384 --> 20:53.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KELCY WARREN: Yes.

20:53.586 --> 20:57.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, first of all, I think this
is well-known
by now.

20:57.490 --> 21:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not on any Indian property
at all, no
Native American property.

21:03.729 --> 21:04.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're on private lands.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's number one.

21:06.298 --> 21:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Number two, this pipeline is new
steel pipe.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're boring underneath Lake
Oahe.

21:11.971 --> 21:17.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to go 90 feet to 150
feet below
the lake's surface.

21:17.042 --> 21:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's thick wall pipe, extra
thick, by the
way, more so than just the
normal pipe that

21:22.181 --> 21:24.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we lay.

21:24.083 --> 21:29.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, on each side of the lake,
there's automated
valves that, if in the very,
very unlikely

21:29.588 --> 21:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation there were to be a
leak, our control
room shuts down the pipe,
encapsulates that

21:36.896 --> 21:40.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
small section that could be in
peril.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's that's just not going
to happen.

21:43.235 --> 21:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Number one, we're not going to
have a leak.

21:46.505 --> 21:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't promise that, of course,
but that
-- no one would get on airplanes
if they thought

21:50.609 --> 21:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they were going to crash.

21:52.444 --> 21:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, number two, there is no way
there would
be any crude contaminate their
water supply.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're 70 miles downstream.

21:59.118 --> 22:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things that really
seems to irk the people out
there at the Standing

22:03.422 --> 22:09.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rock Tribe is that the pipeline
was originally
scheduled and slotted to go
north, just north

22:09.061 --> 22:11.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Bismarck.

22:11.096 --> 22:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after there were concerns
about endangering
the water supply there, the
pipeline was rerouted

22:15.100 --> 22:16.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
south next to the Standing Rock
Tribe.

22:17.002 --> 22:22.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And their belief is, why were
the concerns
of Bismarck residents given
greater weight

22:22.775 --> 22:24.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than the concerns that we have?

22:24.343 --> 22:29.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KELCY WARREN: Well, they
certainly were not
by Energy Transfer Partners.

22:29.481 --> 22:31.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're vulnerable to these
routings, too.

22:31.450 --> 22:34.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Army Corps of Engineers
weighs in heavily.

22:34.453 --> 22:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They asked for input from all
concerned.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They get that input.

22:39.358 --> 22:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they suggest to us what
deviation
in the route should be taken.

22:44.463 --> 22:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Keep in mind, Energy Transfer,
we're laying
a pipeline to have minimal
impact to all people

22:50.603 --> 22:54.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
concerned, and with great input
from our government.

22:54.807 --> 22:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this route, it wasn't just
something that
Energy Transfer said, hey, let's
build it

22:59.778 --> 23:01.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

23:01.580 --> 23:04.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This was after great
consultation with the
Army Corps of Engineers, the
offering up for

23:04.917 --> 23:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consultation with also the
Standing Rock Sioux,
which they didn't choose to do.

23:09.121 --> 23:13.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You say that
it's very unlikely
or very rare that this pipeline
might rupture,

23:13.425 --> 23:16.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but some companies' pipelines
seem to spill
more than others.

23:16.428 --> 23:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And your subsidiary Sunoco
Logistics has a
pretty poor track record when it
comes to

23:22.368 --> 23:24.136 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leaks.

23:24.169 --> 23:28.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to analysis done by
Reuters, Sunoco
Logistics spills more crude than
any of its

23:28.240 --> 23:32.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
competitors, 200 oil leaks in
the last six
years.

23:32.177 --> 23:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doesn't that safety record
indicate that the
concerns of the Standing Rock
Tribe ought

23:36.482 --> 23:37.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be listened to?

23:37.916 --> 23:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELCY WARREN: I disagree with
that statistic
about Sunoco Logistics.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But everybody should be
concerned about that.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But keep in mind there's a
difference here.

23:46.525 --> 23:48.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a body of water.

23:48.460 --> 23:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a pipe that's been
designed specifically
to fit into a bore underneath
the riverbed.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is very thick wall pipe.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's brand-new steel.

23:59.505 --> 24:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Any reports they're talking
about with Sunoco,
Sunoco is a 100-plus-year-old
company.

24:04.476 --> 24:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's some very, very old
pipe in our...

24:07.613 --> 24:09.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:09.315 --> 24:12.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But we have
seen ruptures
in very recent, newly built
pipes.

24:12.918 --> 24:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Your Permian Express pipeline in
Texas was
a brand-new pipe.

24:16.655 --> 24:18.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It spilled 8,000 barrels, I
believe.

24:19.024 --> 24:23.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Keystone One, again, a very new
pipeline,
spilled 14 times in its first
year.

24:23.195 --> 24:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It just seems like the concerns
of the Standing
Rock Tribe are not based on
nothing.

24:27.299 --> 24:32.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELCY WARREN: You know, look,
again, like
I said, everybody should be
concerned about

24:32.571 --> 24:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spilling oil on the ground or
gasoline or
any hydrocarbon or any
contaminant, for that

24:36.975 --> 24:38.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
matter.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Energy Transfer is doing the
very best we
can.

24:40.746 --> 24:44.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're complying with all the
laws, all the
rules, and we're overdesigning.

24:44.850 --> 24:49.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This pipeline is being built to
safety standards
that far exceed what the
government requires

24:49.755 --> 24:51.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us to do.

24:51.423 --> 24:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just think the likelihood
of a spill
into Lake Oahe is just extremely
remote.

24:56.128 --> 25:00.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What about the
other concern
that the tribe brings up, that
the construction

25:00.332 --> 25:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this pipeline is damaging
sacred sites
of theirs, that your bulldozers
have already

25:05.637 --> 25:07.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
damaged it there?

25:07.506 --> 25:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also are very upset with
the fact that
your company apparently
discovered historical

25:11.043 --> 25:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
artifacts and dragged your feet,
according
to them, in reporting it to
authorities.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELCY WARREN: Those are just
lies.

25:17.716 --> 25:18.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're complete lies.

25:18.717 --> 25:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: No basis in
fact?

25:19.818 --> 25:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELCY WARREN: No, not at all.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's go to the real facts.

25:23.122 --> 25:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The facts are, we worked with
the state of
North Dakota, we worked with the
federal government

25:27.893 --> 25:32.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to assure us that we were not
disturbing any
historical sites.

25:32.297 --> 25:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We hired archaeologists.

25:34.633 --> 25:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state of North Dakota
concluded that -- the
Army Corps of Engineers
concluded we have

25:39.838 --> 25:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not damaged any historical
sites.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last question
for you.

25:44.476 --> 25:48.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump, president-elect
Trump is
-- I know he holds some stock in
your company,

25:48.614 --> 25:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reportedly, and I know you're a
big supporter
of his.

25:50.749 --> 25:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think, when he becomes
president, that
he will simply authorize the
construction

25:54.653 --> 25:56.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this pipeline?

25:56.555 --> 26:01.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELCY WARREN: Well, I don't
think -- I don't
think a president actually
authorizes an easement.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he allows the rules,
procedures and
laws.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But you think
it will happen
when he takes over?

26:06.765 --> 26:08.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KELCY WARREN: I do, yes.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And what
happens to the
protesters at that point?

26:10.436 --> 26:14.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the ones that I have
spoken to said
that they are not going anywhere
and that

26:14.239 --> 26:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're building shelters for
the winter and
they're going to wait this out.

26:16.775 --> 26:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELCY WARREN: The people of the
state of North
Dakota are generally, generally
wonderful

26:21.647 --> 26:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, law-abiding, nonviolent
people.

26:23.449 --> 26:24.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're trying to go about
their lives.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This has been such a disruption
to that state.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not a peaceful protest.

26:29.388 --> 26:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if they want to stick around
and continue
to do what they're doing, great,
but we're

26:33.158 --> 26:34.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
building the pipeline.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Kelcy Warren,
CEO of Energy Transfer Partners,
thanks very

26:37.529 --> 26:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much for talking with us.

26:39.665 --> 26:46.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELCY WARREN: Thank you, sir.

26:46.705 --> 26:53.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

26:53.745 --> 26:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
rare look into
an astronaut's adventures in
space; and, in

26:59.318 --> 27:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remembrance of Gwen Ifill, we
explore the
battle against gynecological
cancers.

27:03.555 --> 27:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: It's been more than
five weeks
since Iraqi forces, backed by
airstrikes from

27:09.161 --> 27:13.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S.-led coalition, began
the campaign
to retake Mosul from ISIS.

27:13.866 --> 27:18.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city is the largest in
either Iraq or
Syria still held by the
militants, and the

27:18.937 --> 27:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fight to retake it has been
vicious.

27:21.673 --> 27:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane
Ferguson and videographer
Alessandro Pavone have spent the
last several

27:25.878 --> 27:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days with Iraqi special forces
inside the
city, and sent us this report.

27:30.449 --> 27:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Searching for
enemy movement,
Major Ziad Al-Goberi (ph) leads
his squad

27:35.821 --> 27:37.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of fighters.

27:37.623 --> 27:43.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the radio, reports that
several ISIS gunmen
are rushing this front-line
position.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His men are ready.

27:45.063 --> 27:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have pushed this far into
Mosul city,
and, from a mosque, Iraq's
special forces

27:50.035 --> 27:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fight off counterattacks.

27:51.436 --> 27:54.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: You see these guys?

27:54.206 --> 27:59.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: "A fighter just
blew himself
up just over there," he tells
us.

27:59.211 --> 28:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This tangle of wreckage is all
that separates
his soldiers from the suicide
bombers.

28:05.317 --> 28:10.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is as far as the front line
comes here
in Mosul in this neighborhood,
just this pile

28:10.522 --> 28:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of rubble, beyond it, ISIS
fighters.

28:14.493 --> 28:19.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Taking Mosul from ISIS is the
toughest mission
these men have ever faced.

28:19.364 --> 28:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brutal street-to-street fighting
pushed the
militants from this area just
days go.

28:23.769 --> 28:35.013 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
So, this was a
marketplace here in this
neighborhood of Mosul.

28:35.047 --> 28:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fighters here tell us that
there was a
heavy battle with ISIS fighters
here.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their bodies are still strewn
around the area.

28:43.455 --> 28:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi forces are facing an enemy
that embraces
and celebrates death, and in a
nearby house,

28:51.363 --> 28:55.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are suddenly told more ISIS
fighters are
approaching.

28:55.767 --> 29:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Major Ziad orders his men onto
the roof, and
the fight begins.

29:04.009 --> 29:10.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS fighters are just in the
building right
next door to us here.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Iraqi special forces are
exchanging
fire with them.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNFIRE)

29:14.753 --> 29:17.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This kind of
fighting on the
front line is happening every
day right now

29:17.122 --> 29:21.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Mosul now.

29:21.059 --> 29:22.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What happened?

29:22.961 --> 29:26.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): In the
neighborhood
in front of us, there is a group
of ISIS fighters,

29:26.264 --> 29:27.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
plus a car bomb.

29:27.532 --> 29:29.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They always try to send car
bombs.

29:29.434 --> 29:35.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: When the fighting
eases, civilians
appear from their houses on the
street outside.

29:35.207 --> 29:40.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One soldier proudly shows us his
loot he's
poached from ISIS: uniforms and
memorabilia

29:40.812 --> 29:43.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Islamic State.

29:43.415 --> 29:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Further down the street, Major
Ziad sees more
ISIS fighters.

29:50.122 --> 29:54.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He calls for a mortar strike.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
On this tablet, they can
pinpoint targets
in the city.

29:57.696 --> 30:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With so many civilians still in
their homes,
there is no room for error.

30:02.868 --> 30:06.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They then race to the rooftop to
get a better
view.

30:06.471 --> 30:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The front line snakes through
the streets
around us.

30:09.441 --> 30:14.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS fighters can come from many
sides.

30:14.946 --> 30:17.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two mortars hit buildings
nearby.

30:17.149 --> 30:23.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you tell us, what are the
main dangers
in this battle?

30:23.522 --> 30:31.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
most dangerous
thing ISIS is using is the car
bomb.

30:31.363 --> 30:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also they have a new style,
using drone-carried
bombs.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can control them with the
remote.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They use a small amount of
explosives.

30:39.604 --> 30:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They target our cars and groups
of us.

30:43.108 --> 30:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: ISIS had two
years to plan
its defense, and the group spent
that time

30:50.515 --> 30:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
innovating its tactics and
weapons.

30:53.418 --> 30:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thick armor envelops car bombs.

30:55.721 --> 31:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bullets cannot penetrate them,
so suicidal
drivers tear towards Iraqi
fighters, seen

31:01.593 --> 31:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here in an ISIS propaganda
video.

31:08.366 --> 31:14.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this urban environment, cars
can appear
from around corners just yards
away, so crude

31:14.406 --> 31:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
barricades have been erected,
and civilians
banned from driving.

31:18.810 --> 31:25.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If any car approaches, these
soldiers shoot.

31:25.250 --> 31:28.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And ISIS is not only deadly
above ground.

31:28.220 --> 31:34.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
An elaborate network of
underground passageways
allow their fighters to creep up
behind advancing

31:34.760 --> 31:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
forces and shoot at them.

31:37.129 --> 31:40.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hidden below, they can hide from
U.S. coalition
airstrikes.

31:41.032 --> 31:43.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
During the battle, ISIS fighters
wouldn't
just move around through here.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They could also live in these
tunnels.

31:46.438 --> 31:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can see they have been
sleeping all along
this one.

31:49.274 --> 31:52.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They even have gas lanterns left
and uniforms
here.

31:52.744 --> 31:58.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Digging machines, like this one
captured by
Iraqi forces, are what ISIS is
using to make

31:58.383 --> 32:03.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tunnels, giving themselves
an advantage
in the urban environment.

32:03.622 --> 32:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even after their retreat, ISIS
is able to
inflict casualties.

32:07.159 --> 32:13.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They rig houses with booby-traps
and leave
hidden bombs across this city,
causing devastating

32:13.498 --> 32:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
injuries to soldiers and slowing
the army's
advance.

32:17.269 --> 32:21.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Abdullah Ali's job in the bomb
disposal unit
just cost him his eye.

32:21.540 --> 32:26.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A hidden bomb exploded on him
last week when
he opened the front door of a
house.

32:26.311 --> 32:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDULLAH ALI, Injured in Bomb
Blast (through
translator): ISIS planted it in
the house.

32:29.514 --> 32:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I tried to clear the house, so a
family could
return to it.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And then I got hit.

32:34.452 --> 32:40.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Outnumbered and
outgunned,
ISIS' bomb-making tactics are a
way to compensate.

32:40.192 --> 32:44.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ABDULLAH ALI (through
translator): Of course,
the ISIS' main plan is to use
bombs and car

32:44.162 --> 32:45.430 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bombs and IEDs.

32:45.463 --> 32:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't have military power,
so they depend
on them.

32:48.900 --> 32:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The people living
in Mosul
are also used by ISIS as cover,
around a million

32:55.473 --> 33:00.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are still in the city, on the
front line of
a war that rages around them.

33:00.745 --> 33:05.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with so many families still
sheltering
inside their homes, airstrikes
risk killing

33:05.684 --> 33:07.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the innocent.

33:07.485 --> 33:11.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the Iraqi army battled
ISIS fighters
in these streets, the people
here waited and

33:11.923 --> 33:19.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prayed for days for it to be
over.

33:19.698 --> 33:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This family had been hiding
inside their house.

33:22.033 --> 33:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like so many families in Mosul,
they have
found themselves on the front
line caught

33:26.905 --> 33:29.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between ISIS and the Iraqi army.

33:29.641 --> 33:34.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Food finally arrived with these
government
handouts, and residents poured
into the streets

33:34.713 --> 33:37.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get help.

33:37.148 --> 33:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a steady stream of
civilians fleeing
the city, with nothing but
homemade white

33:42.187 --> 33:47.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flags as a flimsy signal that
they mean no
harm.

33:47.692 --> 33:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some are loaded onto trucks
bound for refugee
camps.

33:51.263 --> 33:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Others simply walk, hoping to
find help.

33:55.133 --> 33:57.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a treacherous journey.

33:57.135 --> 34:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Villages like this outside Mosul
have now
really just become transit
points.

34:02.207 --> 34:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others fleeing from further
inside the city
move through here to make it to
camps.

34:07.679 --> 34:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is still fighting ongoing
even out here
on the outskirts of the city.

34:13.818 --> 34:20.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American involvement in this war
is not so
visible in Mosul City, but it is
hugely significant.

34:20.125 --> 34:25.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over 5,000 U.S. troops are
present in Iraq,
training and advising Iraqis.

34:25.830 --> 34:32.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. airstrikes, artillery,
rockets and special
forces are giving crucial
support to the army's

34:32.470 --> 34:35.473 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
advance.

34:35.507 --> 34:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In control-and-command centers,
American and
Iraqi military leaders monitor
the battle

34:40.378 --> 34:42.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
together.

34:42.247 --> 34:45.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Army Colonel Brett Sylvia
is the commanding
officer at Camp Swift Base
outside Mosul.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.686 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

34:47.719 --> 34:50.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRETT SYLVIA, U.S. Army: The
progress was
very fast in being able to get
to Mosul, and

34:50.522 --> 34:55.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
predictably, it slows down when
you hit this
dense urban area.

34:55.794 --> 34:58.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, still, every single day,
they make forward
progress.

34:58.930 --> 35:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but regardless of how long it
takes, it's
not a question of if Mosul will
be liberated,

35:03.601 --> 35:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but just a question of when.

35:05.503 --> 35:10.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The American
military is giving
them as much of a battleground
advantage as

35:10.342 --> 35:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can, but Iraqi soldiers
will still have
to fight their way through the
city's treacherous

35:16.982 --> 35:18.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
streets.

35:18.516 --> 35:23.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Men like Major Ziad and his
troops have a
long and dangerous battle ahead.

35:23.054 --> 35:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Mosul, Iraq.

35:33.064 --> 35:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now some
lessons from time
spent in space from a man who
seemed like

35:43.274 --> 35:46.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a most unlikely candidate to
become an astronaut.

35:46.811 --> 35:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has a conversation
about a most
unusual career, part of our
weekly series

35:51.649 --> 35:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the Leading Edge of science
and technology.

35:53.585 --> 36:03.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Mike Massimino
went to low-Earth
orbit twice aboard the space
shuttle, both

36:03.628 --> 36:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times to repair the Hubble space
telescope.

36:06.898 --> 36:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his new book, "Spaceman," he
details the
long and difficult journey he
took to become

36:12.303 --> 36:13.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an astronaut.

36:13.304 --> 36:14.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, you're afraid of heights.

36:14.472 --> 36:15.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO, NASA
Astronaut: Yes, I
still am.

36:15.407 --> 36:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't like this right here,
Miles.

36:16.408 --> 36:17.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm a little worried.

36:17.409 --> 36:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You don't swim
very well.

36:19.444 --> 36:20.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: No.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The hardest thing for me as an
astronaut was
to improve my swimming skills.

36:23.048 --> 36:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Vision was a
problem, a real
problem.

36:25.150 --> 36:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Imagine being
D.Q.ed because
I couldn't see well enough.

36:26.651 --> 36:30.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And you barely
got through
the program at MIT.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Yes.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.490 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

36:34.259 --> 36:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, really, it's
completely
improbable that you became an
astronaut.

36:35.960 --> 36:36.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

36:36.961 --> 36:38.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Yes, yes,
absolutely.

36:38.830 --> 36:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: We met beside the
shuttle Enterprise
display at the Intrepid Sea, Air
and Space

36:42.000 --> 36:45.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Museum in New York City, his
hometown.

36:45.470 --> 36:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It occurs to me, though, that
the lessons
you learned all along the way,
then, dealing

36:50.075 --> 36:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- coping and dealing with those
setbacks,
those failures, the resilience,
are exactly

36:55.013 --> 36:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what you need to go through to
become an astronaut.

36:57.715 --> 36:58.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Aha.

36:58.716 --> 36:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now we're getting at something.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think you're right, yes.

37:01.653 --> 37:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a question of being the
best at something
or things coming easy to you,
but it's being

37:06.724 --> 37:09.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a person that can work with
others and not
give up.

37:09.360 --> 37:12.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, for me, that was part of it
too.

37:12.097 --> 37:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At every step of the way, when I
had trouble,
there were people that came in,
in my life

37:16.201 --> 37:18.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that helped me.

37:18.036 --> 37:21.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important to go seek help
when you need
it, and to give help when other
people need

37:21.106 --> 37:22.941 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

37:22.974 --> 37:26.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that is really more
important than coming
in with a gigantic brain into
the astronaut

37:26.511 --> 37:27.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

37:27.812 --> 37:29.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: That's an
important lesson
for all of us, I think.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: I think so,
especially
when doing things that are
really hard.

37:31.616 --> 37:36.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It occurs to me
that this book,
to some degree, it's about
space, but space

37:36.688 --> 37:39.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is almost a backdrop for a
completely separate
story.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that the way you view it?

37:40.859 --> 37:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: I applied to
be an astronaut
four times.

37:42.327 --> 37:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was rejected three times
before I was accepted.

37:44.295 --> 37:47.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's about that, not --
following your
dream and not giving up.

37:47.665 --> 37:51.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: If you hadn't
persevered and
become an astronaut, what would
you be doing

37:51.769 --> 37:53.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today?

37:53.538 --> 37:54.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Yes, I would
probably be
working on my next astronaut
application.

37:54.572 --> 37:55.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think -- that's what I think.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.775 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:57.809 --> 38:00.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You always made
an effort to
connect with and try to relate
the experience

38:00.712 --> 38:01.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to others.

38:01.713 --> 38:03.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Yes.

38:03.548 --> 38:07.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But I don't think
I have ever
heard any astronaut put words to
that experience

38:07.352 --> 38:09.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that really do it justice.

38:09.087 --> 38:13.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it possible to explain
especially what
it's like when you're on an EVA,
on a space

38:13.791 --> 38:14.759 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
walk?

38:14.792 --> 38:15.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: It's very
emotional.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the way I try to describe it
is what I
was feeling.

38:17.862 --> 38:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And viewing our planet was so
compelling.

38:21.766 --> 38:24.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Words like beautiful and awesome
just don't
do it justice.

38:24.702 --> 38:27.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I felt that I was looking at a
paradise.

38:27.705 --> 38:29.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was looking at heaven.

38:29.507 --> 38:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't imagine any place being
more beautiful
than our planet and how lucky we
are to be

38:35.947 --> 38:37.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
able to live here.

38:37.415 --> 38:39.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's what I felt.

38:39.250 --> 38:44.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what I was thinking at
the time, which
I think is a better way for me
to explain

38:44.289 --> 38:49.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it than trying to think of words
that don't
exist to explain to people just
how beautiful

38:49.127 --> 38:50.094 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it is.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That's pretty
good.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.096 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Not bad.

38:52.130 --> 38:54.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Well, thanks.

38:54.299 --> 38:58.002 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: There was a
moment on that
flight where you might have
ruined your
stop-and-smell-the-roses

38:58.036 --> 39:00.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moment, and that was when you
almost broke
the Hubble.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Yes.

39:01.806 --> 39:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were trying to do a repair of
the space
telescope imaging spectrograph,
but, before

39:05.143 --> 39:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we could do that, we had a very
easy task,
which was to remove a handrail
with big bolts

39:09.747 --> 39:10.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on it.

39:10.748 --> 39:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I went and stripped one of
those bolts.

39:12.450 --> 39:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the solution that came up to
take the
handrail off was to see if I
could just tear

39:17.822 --> 39:18.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it of the telescope.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know if that ever would
have crossed
my mind.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is so counter to the way we
do things.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, luckily, we had smart
engineers that
thought of it on the ground.

39:25.863 --> 39:32.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm inside the Hubble space
telescope doing
this million-dollar repair on
this billion-dollar

39:32.170 --> 39:33.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
telescope.

39:33.171 --> 39:35.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Houston, you ready for this?

39:35.740 --> 39:37.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Yes, we're ready.

39:37.575 --> 39:41.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: I grabbed
that handrail
and gave it a couple of tugs,
and, wang, it

39:41.779 --> 39:42.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
came right off.

39:42.780 --> 39:43.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's off.

39:43.781 --> 39:45.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Final thought.

39:45.183 --> 39:47.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think about how fortunate we
were to be alive
on that day in 1969...

39:47.685 --> 39:48.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Yes.

39:48.686 --> 39:49.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

39:49.687 --> 39:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: ... they walked
to the moon.

39:50.922 --> 39:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were kind of sprinkled with
moon dust,
our generation.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Yes, we were
very lucky.

39:53.591 --> 39:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And it inspired a
whole generation
of astronauts of your
generation.

39:55.660 --> 39:56.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Yes.

39:56.661 --> 39:58.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Do you worry that
young people
today don't have a similar
inspiration?

40:01.099 --> 40:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: I talk to a
lot of high
schools students around the
country.

40:04.669 --> 40:07.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They still have that same
interest, but it's
just different.

40:07.138 --> 40:08.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not like we had.

40:08.439 --> 40:10.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a way -- what was given to
us, it's different.

40:10.642 --> 40:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we can engage with the
astronauts that
are in space.

40:13.111 --> 40:17.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was the first person to tweet
from space,
but now every astronaut tweets
from space

40:17.548 --> 40:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and does Instagram and Snapchat
and Face -- they
have Facebook going.

40:21.286 --> 40:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it's more of a
personal relationship
they have with space now.

40:26.057 --> 40:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They see it as more obtainable
than me watching
my superhero Neil Armstrong and
Buzz Aldrin

40:31.229 --> 40:32.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
walking on the moon.

40:32.230 --> 40:33.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like, there's no way I can
do that.

40:33.765 --> 40:37.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's more engageable,
and it's just
different than what we had.

40:37.235 --> 40:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they still think it's very,
very cool.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't see that interest
waning.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I see it -- I see it as growing.

40:44.208 --> 40:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: All right, Mike
Massimino,
thank you very much.

40:46.644 --> 40:47.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:47.645 --> 40:48.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MASSIMINO: Thanks,
Miles.

40:48.646 --> 40:50.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's a pleasure.

40:50.315 --> 40:52.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Enjoyed it.

40:52.183 --> 40:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Online, find a
review of
"Mars," a new six-part
miniseries that premiered

40:55.620 --> 40:58.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Monday on the National
Geographic Channel.

40:58.456 --> 41:07.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

41:07.265 --> 41:15.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next: the battle against cancer,
specifically,
gynecological cancers.

41:15.573 --> 41:21.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen died on Monday at the age
of 61, after
her fight with endometrial
cancer, also referred

41:21.212 --> 41:23.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to as uterine cancer.

41:23.081 --> 41:28.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is one of several
gynecological cancers
women face that sometimes get
less attention.

41:28.086 --> 41:33.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 50,000 women in the
U.S. are diagnosed
with uterine cancer each year,
and more than

41:33.424 --> 41:36.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
9,300 die from it.

41:36.361 --> 41:38.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ovarian cancer is better known.

41:38.096 --> 41:43.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About 20,000 women are diagnosed
each year,
and more than 14,000 die from it
annually.

41:43.601 --> 41:46.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cervical cancer's death rate has
dropped dramatically.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Roughly 12,000 are diagnosed
with it annually.

41:49.073 --> 41:51.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
More than 4,000 die from it.

41:51.142 --> 41:55.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not focused on Gwen's
particular case
tonight, but we wanted to take
this moment

41:55.446 --> 41:59.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to look at the latest efforts to
diagnose
and treat these cancers.

41:59.117 --> 42:05.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Dr. Karen Lu is chair of
gynecologic oncology
at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
in Houston.

42:05.456 --> 42:08.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Dr. Angela Marshall is an
adviser to the
Black Women's Health Imperative.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She is a women's health
specialist in Maryland.

42:11.763 --> 42:16.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Lu, now that we have set the
table a little
bit, let's add a little context
to this.

42:16.467 --> 42:19.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In relation to other cancers,
how prevalent
are these?

42:19.504 --> 42:21.239 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:21.272 --> 42:23.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN LU, M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center: So,
all together, as you said,
almost 100,000

42:23.408 --> 42:26.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
women this year will be
diagnosed with a gynecologic
cancer.

42:27.011 --> 42:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, importantly, with uterine
cancer, it's
on the rise.

42:30.882 --> 42:34.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And put that
in perspective.

42:34.252 --> 42:39.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Compared to -- you know, there's
a horrible
reality in the cancer
marketplace that some

42:39.791 --> 42:43.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cancers get more attention than
others, and
then the more attention they
get, the more

42:43.795 --> 42:45.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
research funding they get as
well.

42:45.630 --> 42:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how do these cancers compete
and fare
when we think about all the
other cancers

42:49.734 --> 42:50.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are out there?

42:50.735 --> 42:52.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:52.537 --> 42:54.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN LU: There definitely is
less attention,
even though there's such a high
number of

42:54.939 --> 42:56.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
women with these cancers.

42:56.808 --> 43:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the breast cancer
community has
done a fantastic job about
demystifying and

43:03.681 --> 43:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being open about talking about
breast cancer,
about risk factors, about what
early signs

43:10.154 --> 43:12.023 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

43:12.056 --> 43:15.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, when we're talking
about gynecologic
cancers -- so that's cancer of
the uterus,

43:15.460 --> 43:21.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cervix, and the ovaries --
we're a little
bit more maybe perhaps
embarrassed to talk

43:21.065 --> 43:22.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about it.

43:22.900 --> 43:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that -- that goes towards
individual women
and the impact that that may
have in terms

43:29.240 --> 43:35.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them thinking about symptoms
that they
may have, and also kind of on a
broader scale

43:35.413 --> 43:42.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of really garnering
interest and
increasing research funding for
the diseases.

43:42.220 --> 43:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Marshall,
I have heard
them described as below-the-belt
cancers.

43:46.123 --> 43:50.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a stigma attached with
discussing
this openly, compared to, say,
breast cancer

43:50.595 --> 43:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which, societally, we seem to
have no problem
talking about?

43:52.563 --> 43:53.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:53.998 --> 43:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA MARSHALL, Black Women's
Health Imperative:
I think there is.

43:55.733 --> 43:58.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, more importantly, I
think this
is a good time to talk about the
importance

43:58.169 --> 43:59.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of women and self-care.

43:59.704 --> 44:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by self-care, I mean the
importance of
getting screening tests.

44:04.909 --> 44:09.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And screening tests are tests
that we do when
people are having no symptoms.

44:09.480 --> 44:15.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when we do mammograms, we're
screening
for breast cancer in women who
have not symptoms.

44:15.386 --> 44:20.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, for uterine and for
ovarian cancer,
we don't have adequate screening
tests for

44:20.791 --> 44:22.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
those.

44:22.593 --> 44:26.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So those are tests that rely on
women reporting
symptoms before we do any kind
of workup.

44:26.831 --> 44:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think it's important to
get the word
out.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think education is extremely
important.

44:32.203 --> 44:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People need to know what the
symptoms are,
and they need to know what tests
to be requesting

44:36.741 --> 44:38.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from their health care
providers.

44:38.543 --> 44:42.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Lu, is
there a gap in
women seeing symptoms, but not
necessarily

44:42.179 --> 44:44.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporting them, or not even
knowing that they
are symptoms?

44:44.348 --> 44:45.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:45.349 --> 44:47.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAREN LU: I think there's two
gaps.

44:47.184 --> 44:54.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there's a gap where
women don't know
that there are early symptoms of
these cancers,

44:54.191 --> 44:56.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and so don't recognize them.

44:56.727 --> 44:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there's also a gap when
they report
these symptoms.

44:59.730 --> 45:02.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sometimes, they can be
nonspecific.

45:02.533 --> 45:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And certainly, with ovarian
cancer, women
will present with bloating or
their bellies

45:08.372 --> 45:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be bigger, very nonspecific
pain.

45:11.342 --> 45:19.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, sometimes, physicians will
dismiss these
symptoms and not fully work up
and think about

45:19.050 --> 45:22.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ovarian cancer or other
gynecologic cancers
as a cause.

45:22.853 --> 45:25.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Marshall,
I see you
nodding your head in agreement
here.

45:25.590 --> 45:27.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is this also the case?

45:27.458 --> 45:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And does it disproportionately
affect women
of color or in the
African-American community?

45:30.561 --> 45:31.529 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:31.562 --> 45:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGELA MARSHALL: It does.

45:33.397 --> 45:36.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, specifically for
African-American
women, it's important to have
health care

45:36.601 --> 45:41.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
providers that we trust, because
there's historically
been some mistrust in the
African-American

45:41.906 --> 45:43.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

45:43.240 --> 45:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also important to have good
access to
health care.

45:46.243 --> 45:51.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's important for to us
have access to
health insurance plans that
aren't high deductibles.

45:51.716 --> 45:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, some women are forced
with making
a decision to put food on the
table vs. paying

45:56.654 --> 45:58.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for expensive diagnostic
testing.

45:58.723 --> 46:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, sometimes, it boils down
to an economic
issue.

46:02.026 --> 46:04.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, sometimes,
it's the
infrastructure that's
influencing whether

46:04.528 --> 46:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or not they get the care.

46:05.529 --> 46:06.497 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:06.530 --> 46:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGELA MARSHALL: Exactly.

46:08.399 --> 46:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Lu, if a
patient gets
one of these diagnoses, what
should they start

46:11.268 --> 46:13.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thinking about, and how should
they look at
this?

46:13.504 --> 46:14.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:14.505 --> 46:16.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAREN LU: That's a great
question.

46:16.407 --> 46:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, there's so much
information available
on the Internet, and we say
that's good and

46:20.911 --> 46:22.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bad.

46:22.747 --> 46:27.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do, overall, think it's
important for
women to arm themselves with
information when

46:27.084 --> 46:29.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they go seek health care.

46:29.387 --> 46:33.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the second thing is to
really seek
a specialist.

46:33.991 --> 46:41.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are -- we are specialists,
gynecologic
oncologists, who focus on
treating these cancers.

46:41.232 --> 46:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's really important that
women who are
diagnosed with uterine cancer,
ovarian cancer,

46:48.472 --> 46:51.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cervix cancer have a specialist
who can take
care of them.

46:51.942 --> 46:55.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Marshall,
what about
those cases where, if you don't
have the expertise

46:55.946 --> 46:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a Dr. Lu, you don't live in
Houston, you
don't live near a major cancer
center or medical

46:59.750 --> 47:05.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center, how hard is it for
someone to lobby,
basically, for themselves, or
advocate to

47:05.056 --> 47:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try to get that extra level of
care and expertise?

47:07.658 --> 47:09.393 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:09.427 --> 47:11.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MARSHALL: I think it
starts with having
a health care provider that you
trust.

47:11.929 --> 47:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, so often, we don't,
especially among
African-Americans.

47:15.933 --> 47:21.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think your primary care
doctor is
a great resource, and I think
you should be

47:21.172 --> 47:26.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an advocate for yourself, and
help -- have
them help you with the referrals
to the specialists.

47:26.477 --> 47:30.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Lu, where
does the research
stand in all this, considering
-- especially

47:30.548 --> 47:34.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even including pharmaceutical
companies, because
they're crucial in the treatment
part?

47:34.185 --> 47:35.152 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:35.186 --> 47:36.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN LU: Absolutely.

47:36.187 --> 47:37.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Research is really important.

47:37.188 --> 47:38.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's a great time now.

47:38.189 --> 47:40.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a lot of exciting
research going on.

47:40.624 --> 47:47.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I like to think about it,
for early-stage
cancers, we're really focusing
on minimizing

47:47.865 --> 47:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
treatment in some ways.

47:49.333 --> 47:53.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're seeing younger women
who are diagnosed
with uterine cancer.

47:53.337 --> 47:55.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Uterine cancer is very tightly
linked to obesity.

47:55.973 --> 48:01.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, as we see an obesity
epidemic, we're seeing
more and more younger women,
women in their

48:01.312 --> 48:04.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
40s, sometimes even in their
30s, with uterine
cancer.

48:04.215 --> 48:11.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're thinking about, can we
think about
treatment where's we can
preserve the uterus?

48:11.122 --> 48:19.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even with cervix cancer, we're
thinking about,
are there options for women to
be able to

48:19.096 --> 48:20.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have the option of childbearing?

48:20.698 --> 48:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's for early-stage.

48:23.100 --> 48:32.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For later-stage cancers, there's
a lot of
emphasis on understanding the
very basic molecular

48:32.042 --> 48:37.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
kind of DNA genes that
contribute to the cancer
cells.

48:37.181 --> 48:44.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once we understand that, we're
able to bring
in some of these new targeted
therapies, immunotherapy.

48:44.455 --> 48:51.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's an exciting time, but
it requires
-- it requires resources.

48:51.929 --> 48:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It requires women to be open to
clinical trials.

48:55.866 --> 49:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really want to stress
that, because
I think that, if we're going to
make advances

49:01.305 --> 49:05.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and we need to, especially
for women who
have advanced-stage disease --
we're going

49:05.743 --> 49:09.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to really need to encourage
women to participate
in clinical trials.

49:09.580 --> 49:13.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr Karen Lu,
Dr. Angela
Marshall, thank you for what
might be the

49:13.484 --> 49:15.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first of many conversations on
this topic.

49:15.519 --> 49:18.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

49:18.455 --> 49:19.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

49:19.857 --> 49:25.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGELA MARSHALL: Thank you.

49:25.563 --> 49:31.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

49:31.569 --> 49:33.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

49:33.704 --> 49:38.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2013, major repairs began on
the dome atop
the U.S. Capitol.

49:38.108 --> 49:41.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, those much-needed
renovations officially
wrapped up.

49:41.512 --> 49:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
filed this
report from Capitol Hill.

49:44.248 --> 49:46.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN AYERS, Architect of the
Capitol: Good
morning, everyone.

49:46.717 --> 49:51.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Architect of the
Capitol, Stephen
Ayers, stood before Washington's
iconic landmark

49:51.055 --> 49:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to declare its latest renovation
complete.

49:53.824 --> 49:59.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN AYERS: The AOC's motto
is to serve,
preserve and inspire, and we do
so every day

49:59.964 --> 50:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
across this Capitol campus.

50:02.466 --> 50:09.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this one project was the
most visible
of all, the symbol of America's
democracy

50:09.640 --> 50:13.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the beacon of hope for
millions around
the world.

50:13.544 --> 50:15.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we delivered.

50:15.279 --> 50:19.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: The current dome
was added
to the U.S. Capitol in the
1860s, even as

50:19.450 --> 50:21.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Civil War raged.

50:21.552 --> 50:26.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ever since, its nearly nine
million pounds
of cast-iron have stood tall
amid political

50:26.523 --> 50:29.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
storms and literal ones.

50:29.059 --> 50:35.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dome last saw major repairs
in 1960, when
rust-prohibiting paint turned it
temporarily

50:35.332 --> 50:36.834 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
red.

50:36.867 --> 50:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, 50 years on, the Capitol's
main attraction
had deteriorated once more.

50:40.871 --> 50:45.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Surveyors found cracks and
peeling paint were
allowing moisture to seep in,
threatening

50:45.509 --> 50:47.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
infrastructure, art work and
people inside.

50:47.912 --> 50:50.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN AYERS: We determined
that it was time
to intervene.

50:50.514 --> 50:54.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were losing too much historic
and original
material of the dome.

50:55.019 --> 50:59.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: So, the latest
nearly $60 million
face-lift got under way.

50:59.690 --> 51:05.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For nearly three years, workers
stood on 1.1
million pounds of scaffolding to
repair the

51:05.229 --> 51:08.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 12,000 inches of
cast-iron cracks.

51:08.832 --> 51:14.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The team restored the dome's
decorative ornaments
and cupola windows, and placed
white draping

51:14.038 --> 51:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inside to protect the Rotunda
below.

51:16.907 --> 51:22.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That dome donut, as it was
affectionately
called, allowed interior repairs
to go forward,

51:22.279 --> 51:26.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while still giving the one
million visitors
a year a glimpse of the
historical fresco

51:26.650 --> 51:28.285 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
above.

51:28.319 --> 51:32.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this summer, as temperatures
went up,
the scaffolding started to come
down, and

51:32.222 --> 51:37.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workers applied more than 1,200
gallons of
paint, appropriately named dome
white, as

51:37.528 --> 51:39.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a finishing touch along the way.

51:39.463 --> 51:45.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN AYERS: It's so important
for us to
have this grand Capitol Building
to look magnificent

51:45.636 --> 51:47.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to truly be our nation's
stage.

51:47.938 --> 51:51.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Ayers now turns
his attention
to the next big event on Capitol
Hill, the

51:51.842 --> 51:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inauguration of president-elect
Donald Trump.

51:55.012 --> 51:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
