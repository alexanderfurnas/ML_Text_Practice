GWEN IFILL: But, first, payday
lending is
a $46 billion industry in the
U.S. About 12

00:07.040 --> 00:14.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million Americans borrow more
than $7 billion
annually from over 22,000
storefronts.

00:14.248 --> 00:17.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the industry's practices
have long been
under scrutiny.

00:17.284 --> 00:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Andrew
Schmertz has
the story from South Dakota,
part of our ongoing

00:22.189 --> 00:27.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporting initiative Chasing the
Dream: Poverty
and Opportunity in America.

00:27.694 --> 00:32.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Living paycheck
to paycheck
isn't easy. Sometimes, you have
to come up

00:32.733 --> 00:34.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with creative ways to relieve
the stress.

00:34.968 --> 00:38.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTI MCLAUGHLIN, South Dakota:
A good way
to just live in denial is just
throw away

00:38.639 --> 00:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your bills. I know I can't pay
them anyway,
so...

00:41.742 --> 00:46.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Kristi
McLaughlin and her
husband, T.J., were getting by
on T.J.'s salary

00:46.146 --> 00:52.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a manufacturing plant manager
here in Sioux
Falls, South Dakota, that was,
until T.J.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
got sick.

00:53.921 --> 00:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
T.J. MCLAUGHLIN, South Dakota: I
was working
the night shift, and I was on my
feet a lot.

00:55.756 --> 01:01.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had a couple of wounds
start developing
on my leg. And they were pretty
small at first,

01:01.995 --> 01:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then they got infected and
just started
growing.

01:06.133 --> 01:10.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: When T.J. went
to get treatment,
the doctor said it would only
take a day,

01:10.704 --> 01:13.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, in fact, he ended up
missing a whole
week of work.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
T.J. MCLAUGHLIN: They ended up
docking my
pay. We ended up being short on
bills. I panicked,

01:16.710 --> 01:18.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so...

01:18.512 --> 01:23.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: So McLaughlin
came here,
a title loan place just a few
miles from his

01:23.917 --> 01:28.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home. He says the process was
simple and quick.
They inspected his car and then
handed him

01:29.022 --> 01:33.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$1,200 in cash. He agreed to pay
$322 a month
for a year.

01:33.994 --> 01:38.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
T.J. MCLAUGHLIN: I was making
good money.
I didn't really foresee a
problem paying it

01:38.498 --> 01:40.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back at that time.

01:40.300 --> 01:43.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: But then his
leg got worse,
and he had to go back to the
hospital for

01:43.537 --> 01:45.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
another week.

01:45.305 --> 01:50.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTI MCLAUGHLIN: And on
Wednesday of the
following week, the H.R. person
called from

01:50.711 --> 01:56.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his job and fired him, and, on
that day, we
pretty much lost everything.

01:56.416 --> 02:01.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: But not the
loan. After nine
months, the total amount they
owed grew from

02:01.188 --> 02:08.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$1,200 to over $3,000. That's an
annual interest
rate of more than 300 percent.

02:09.029 --> 02:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Title loans and payday loans are
supposed
to be short-term quick fixes for
people who

02:13.100 --> 02:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can't get traditional credit.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTRESS: Do you need fast cash?
You have come
to the right place.

02:17.337 --> 02:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: They use
high-energy commercials
and bank-like storefronts to
entice people

02:21.575 --> 02:28.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to borrow money at triple-digit
interest rates.
The problem? They are rarely
short-term. Borrowers

02:28.348 --> 02:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frequently need to take out a
second loan
to pay off the first one. It's
called flipping.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HICKEY (R), Former South
Dakota State
Legislator: The average payday
loan in the

02:35.722 --> 02:40.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States is flipped eight
times. And
they are a debt trap that's
intentionally

02:40.193 --> 02:45.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marketed to the financially
unsophisticated,
intending to lock them in on
something that

02:45.732 --> 02:47.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they can't pay back.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Former state
lawmaker Steve
Hickey tried to rein in the
industry, which

02:50.637 --> 02:57.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charges an average of 574
percent, with legislation
to cap interest rates. But he
could never

02:57.244 --> 02:58.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get his bills out of committee.

02:58.945 --> 03:02.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HICKEY: Just not much
stomach in the
legislature, because the
financial sector

03:02.215 --> 03:06.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our state is such a huge
deal. There's
millions and millions at stake.

03:06.319 --> 03:10.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: South Dakota
has been the
epicenter of high interest since
the 1980s,

03:10.891 --> 03:14.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the state repealed laws
capping rates
to attract jobs from credit card
companies

03:14.895 --> 03:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like Wells Fargo and Citibank.

03:16.730 --> 03:21.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HICKEY: The purpose at
that time was
to bring in 400 Citibank jobs,
not to bring

03:21.668 --> 03:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in 400 percent interest rates.

03:23.703 --> 03:29.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Hickey wasn't
alone in recognizing
the problems created by these
short-term loans.

03:29.609 --> 03:34.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steve Hildebrand runs Josiah's
coffee shop
here in Sioux Falls. He's seen
the detrimental

03:34.081 --> 03:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effects of these high interest
rates firsthand.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HILDEBRAND, South Dakotans
for Responsible
Lending: I have had employee
after employee

03:38.251 --> 03:42.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after employee over the last
three years in
the coffee shop, going through
horrible, horrible

03:42.622 --> 03:48.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
financial experiences, taking
out these emergency
loans, and just getting into
this terrible

03:48.462 --> 03:54.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cycle of debt that is incredibly
hard for
them to get out of.

03:54.101 --> 03:58.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Hildebrand, an
openly gay
Democrat who worked on the Obama
campaign,

03:58.572 --> 04:03.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't have much in common with
Hickey, a
Republican and conservative
Christian pastor

04:03.043 --> 04:07.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who has railed against
homosexuality, but
they did see eye to eye on what
they consider

04:07.881 --> 04:09.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
predatory lending.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HICKEY: We created a
campaign called
South Dakotans for Responsible
Lending. Steve

04:12.986 --> 04:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I are chair and co-chair.
It's brought
people on the right and the left
together

04:17.424 --> 04:19.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a very healthy way.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: They decided to
use a tactic
that was born right here in the
Mount Rushmore

04:22.596 --> 04:24.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state in 1898, the ballot
initiative.

04:24.397 --> 04:27.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REYNOLD NESIBA, South Dakotans
for Responsible
Lending: And you're registered
to vote in

04:27.467 --> 04:27.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South Dakota?

04:28.001 --> 04:29.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Yes.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Reynold Nesiba
is a volunteer
gathering signatures to put a
measure on the

04:32.105 --> 04:37.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ballot that would do what
lawmakers could
not: cap interest rates on all
loans at 36

04:37.410 --> 04:39.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REYNOLD NESIBA: And I feel so
strongly about
this that I'm the treasurer of
this campaign,

04:42.516 --> 04:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that's my name on the bottom.
If you're
registered to vote, I would love
to have your

04:45.986 --> 04:47.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
signature.

04:47.787 --> 04:51.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: The goal? To
get well more
than the 13,871 signatures
required to put

04:51.625 --> 04:56.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the issue in front of voters
next November.
With millions of dollars in
revenue at stake,

04:56.196 --> 05:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the lending industry is strongly
opposed to
any new regulation.

05:00.066 --> 05:04.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two-thirds of U.S. states allow
some form
of high-interest-rate loans, and
when similar

05:04.704 --> 05:09.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
initiatives have sprung up in
other states,
the industry has fought back.
Here in South

05:09.209 --> 05:12.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dakota, the lending industry is
fighting back
using a ballot initiative
itself.

05:12.913 --> 05:19.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HILDEBRAND: They were
putting forward
an 18 percent rate cap in order
to convince

05:19.486 --> 05:23.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people they should sign that
one, instead
of the 36, because 18 sounds
better than 36,

05:23.323 --> 05:25.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

05:25.058 --> 05:28.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: By that
initiative comes
with a catch. It only caps rates
at 18 percent

05:28.195 --> 05:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "unless the borrower
agrees to
another rate in writing,"
meaning if the borrower

05:33.500 --> 05:37.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants the loan, they have to
agree to whatever
terms the lender demands.

05:37.737 --> 05:41.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE HILDEBRAND: So, the 18
percent rate
cap is just a fake cap.

05:41.041 --> 05:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Teams of paid
circulators
have been out across the state
gathering signatures

05:45.078 --> 05:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for that petition. None were
willing to speak
with us on camera, and repeated
requests for

05:49.549 --> 05:52.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
comment went unanswered.

05:52.152 --> 05:56.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When asked about capping rates
at 36 percent,
the one payday lender who did
speak with us

05:56.957 --> 05:58.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was unequivocal.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK BRENNAN, CEO, Dollar Loan
Center: It's
a kill-bill for the state. The
entire lending

06:01.595 --> 06:03.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
industry would be out of
business with it.

06:03.463 --> 06:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Chuck Brennan,
a Sioux Falls
native, is the founder and CEO
of Dollar Loan

06:07.067 --> 06:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Center, a chain of more than 90
short-term
lending stores, with 11
locations in South

06:11.905 --> 06:13.840 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dakota.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK BRENNAN: We have a huge
customer base.
In South Dakota, we have had
over 40,000 applicants

06:16.943 --> 06:21.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for loans over the years. Over
20 percent
of the state who is over 18 has
applied for

06:21.348 --> 06:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a loan here, which really shows
there's a
need for the product out there.

06:25.552 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Further,
Brennan says a rate
cap will actually harm the
people it is intended

06:29.589 --> 06:31.458 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to help.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK BRENNAN: It isn't like
when the industry
goes out of business people are
going to stop

06:33.827 --> 06:37.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needing money. They're going to
have to turn
to online loans, illegal
sources, and something

06:37.864 --> 06:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the state can't regulate.

06:39.699 --> 06:43.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: But Hickey
says, in reality,
there are plenty of ways to help
people who

06:43.603 --> 06:46.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need money without charging them
triple-digit
interest.

06:46.306 --> 06:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HICKEY: As an employer
with employees,
I would give a payday advance. I
know Steve

06:51.278 --> 06:56.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hildebrand does at his coffee
shop. He will
lend somebody money on their
paycheck at zero

06:56.383 --> 07:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent interest, and maybe
there could even
be regulation on that. Four
times a year,

07:01.821 --> 07:04.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's an employee benefit.

07:04.090 --> 07:08.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: After months of
hard work,
the campaign gathered over
20,000 signatures

07:08.695 --> 07:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Hildebrand to deliver to the
secretary
of state. But the opposing
lender-supported

07:13.466 --> 07:16.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign also managed to gather
enough signatures
to get on the ballot.

07:16.970 --> 07:21.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE HILDEBRAND: The payday
lenders are going
to spend millions of dollars on
television

07:21.274 --> 07:25.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to confuse voters and
misrepresent
our side.

07:26.012 --> 07:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: So, the fight's
not over.
Hildebrand has one year to
convince South

07:30.183 --> 07:36.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Dakotans to vote for his
interest rate cap.
In the meantime, T.J. ended up
losing his

07:37.023 --> 07:40.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fight to save his leg. It was
amputated six
months after he lost his job.

07:40.927 --> 07:44.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRISTI MCLAUGHLIN: It needs to
go at least
to there.

07:44.664 --> 07:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: T.J. and Kristi
are now focused
on rehab, instead of the title
loan.

07:49.035 --> 07:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTI MCLAUGHLIN: I told them
to come and
get the car. Take it. You know,
our world

07:54.007 --> 07:57.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has fallen out from underneath
us, and if
you want it that badly, come and
get it.

07:57.377 --> 08:00.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: Over
Thanksgiving, the lender
repossessed their car.

08:00.780 --> 08:05.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
T.J. MCLAUGHLIN: People get
sick. And, you
know, if it's serious enough,
they can lose

08:05.485 --> 08:10.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything. We lost everything
in a matter
of a week, it seems like.

08:10.523 --> 08:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW SCHMERTZ: T.J. and Kristi
may have
to find their way out of this
devastation

08:14.461 --> 08:18.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on their own. But they hope, by
speaking out,
they can at least save other
South Dakotans

08:18.865 --> 08:22.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from becoming trapped in a
nightmare of high
interest rates.

08:22.702 --> 08:24.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," Andrew
Schmertz in
Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Hari Sreenivasan takes a
broader look
at the problems lower-income
Americans face

08:25.438 --> 08:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it comes to getting the
money they need.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: South Dakota
isn't the only
place where payday loans are
such a big problem.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While a few states have banned
or imposed
strict regulations on these
fringe lenders,

08:31.077 --> 08:32.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're ubiquitous in most of
the country.
In fact, there are more payday
lending storefronts

08:32.145 --> 08:34.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than there are Starbucks and
McDonald's combined.

08:34.080 --> 08:35.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her book "How the Other Half
Banks," Mehrsa
Baradaran explores the booming
industry providing

08:35.982 --> 08:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
financial services to the poor
at exorbitant
costs and offers some more
equitable solutions.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why -- where is this gap
created? And
why isn't there an incentive for
all banks

08:39.152 --> 08:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reach out to all people with
money?

08:40.720 --> 08:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEHRSA BARADARAN, Author, "How
the Other Half
Banks": The gap is fairly new.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, starting in the 1980s, a lot
of community
banks started shutting down
branches in lower-income

08:44.491 --> 08:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas, inner-city neighborhoods,
areas where
their profit margins were lower
than in other

08:46.326 --> 08:48.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas. And so part of it is,
it's higher cost
to lend to someone or to take a
small deposit

08:48.194 --> 08:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than it is to get a big deposit.
Right? Your
overhead is the same whether
you're, you know,

08:49.863 --> 08:50.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking in $100,000 vs. taking in
$500, but
your revenue off of that
$100,000 is much

08:50.864 --> 08:52.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
higher than it is off of that
small deposit.

08:52.832 --> 08:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so these banks started
leaving these areas.
And part of it is that the
government deregulatory

08:54.601 --> 08:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces allowed them to merge and
form these
huge conglomerates such as Bank
of America.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as these banks leave, they
leave this
void for banking service. And
this is a void

08:57.971 --> 08:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that quickly is filled by these
fringe lenders,
so payday loans, check cashing.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, when you
go through
certain cities, just like there
are food deserts

09:01.641 --> 09:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where you don't have a grocery
store, it seems
like there are almost bank
deserts, where

09:03.143 --> 09:03.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's populated primarily with
these lenders
that you're talking about.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much money is there to be
made?

09:05.712 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEHRSA BARADARAN: It's an $89
billion industry
yearly. And it doesn't seem that
way.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you go into these
neighborhoods,
these check cashers or payday
lenders, they

09:09.315 --> 09:10.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seem like neighborhood joints.
But they're
really sort of multinational
corporations.

09:10.316 --> 09:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're large, very profitable
organizations.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have this, what I call
a facade of
informality, right? So it seems
as though,

09:13.853 --> 09:15.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look, they speak your language.
They're in
your neighborhood, but, really,
behind them,

09:15.555 --> 09:17.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is a lot of bank
financing. These are
very sort of corporate, big, big
firms.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: These
companies are going
to say, look, I'm taking a
greater risk. This

09:19.192 --> 09:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a person that is not as
creditworthy as
someone who maybe walks into a
Bank of America

09:20.894 --> 09:21.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a much larger amount of
assets, right,
so shouldn't I be able to charge
a higher

09:21.861 --> 09:23.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interest rate to get them this
money fast?

09:23.630 --> 09:25.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MEHRSA BARADARAN: It is
certainly a higher
risk to lend to someone who's
low-income.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, there's a lot of
studies to show
that the price that they're
actually charging

09:27.300 --> 09:28.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't the cost of the loan. It's
also fairly
misleading when you compare it
to the credit

09:28.668 --> 09:30.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
markets that the middle class
and higher income
have access to.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the big points of the
book is,
even assuming that this is a
market price

09:32.172 --> 09:33.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they're charging and it is
the cost of
credit because of the risks and
the defaults,

09:33.473 --> 09:35.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
et cetera, the rest of us don't
pay market
prices for credit.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The credit markets, whether it's
for our mortgages,
our student loans, any sort of
bank credit

09:36.609 --> 09:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you get is heavily subsidized by
the federal
government.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The book is
called "How
the Other Half Banks."

09:39.112 --> 09:39.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mehrsa Baradaran, thanks so much
for joining
us.

09:39.779 --> 09:39.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEHRSA BARADARAN: Thank you.
