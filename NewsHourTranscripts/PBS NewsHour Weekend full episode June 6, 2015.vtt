00:45.812 --> 00:47.314
ABOUT ONE OF THE LARGEST-KNOWN

00:47.314 --> 00:49.049
CYBER ATTACKS EVER TO STRIKE THE

01:09.202 --> 01:11.471
POTENTIALLY RECRUIT SPIES INSIDE

01:12.940 --> 01:14.107
THE POST QUOTES GOVERNMENT

01:14.107 --> 01:15.509
OFFICIALS WHO CALL THE THEFT

01:15.509 --> 01:18.278
PART OF A STRATEGIC PLAN.

01:18.278 --> 01:19.680
THIS IS THE THIRD MAJOR CYBER

01:19.680 --> 01:21.348
ATTACK ON A FEDERAL DATABASE IN

01:21.348 --> 01:22.983
THE PAST YEAR.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.017
THE WHITE HOUSE IS CALLING ON

01:24.017 --> 01:25.485
CONGRESS TO, "COME OUT OF THE

01:25.485 --> 01:26.820
DARK AGES" AND PASS CYBER

01:26.820 --> 01:28.422
SECURITY LEGISLATION.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.823
BUT CRITICS SAY THE OBAMA

01:29.823 --> 01:31.058
ADMINISTRATION HASN'T DONE

01:31.058 --> 01:32.159
ENOUGH TO SECURE FEDERAL

01:32.159 --> 01:33.527
DATABASES.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.362
IN WILMINGTON DELAWARE TODAY, AN

01:35.362 --> 01:36.897
OVERFLOW CROWD OF AT LEAST A

01:36.897 --> 01:38.665
THOUSAND PEOPLE GATHERED FOR THE

01:38.665 --> 01:40.167

01:43.437 --> 01:44.805
GENERAL DIED A WEEK AGO OF BRAIN

01:44.805 --> 01:47.374

01:47.374 --> 01:49.209

01:49.209 --> 01:50.811
DELIVERED A EULOGY, DESCRIBING

01:50.811 --> 01:52.946
BEAU BIDEN AS HIS FATHER'S SON

01:52.946 --> 01:54.815
CALLING HIM , "JOE-TWO-POINT-

01:54.815 --> 01:56.283
OH:"

01:56.283 --> 01:59.987
>> SOMEONE WHO CARED, SOMEONE

01:59.987 --> 02:01.855
WHO CHARMED YOU, AND DISARMED

02:01.855 --> 02:05.292
YOU, AND PUT YOU AT EASE.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.793
A 10-YEAR INTERNAL STUDY OF THE

02:06.793 --> 02:08.695
SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION

02:08.695 --> 02:09.830
SHOWS THAT THE GOVERNMENT

02:09.830 --> 02:11.465
OVERPAID SOCIAL SECURITY

02:11.465 --> 02:13.133
BENEFICIARIES BY NEARLY

02:13.133 --> 02:14.968
17 BILLION DOLLARS.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.470
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE

02:16.470 --> 02:18.338
TRACKED THE PAYMENTS FROM 2003

02:18.338 --> 02:19.873
TO 2014.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.375
MANY OF THE OVERPAYMENTS WENT TO

02:21.375 --> 02:22.843
PEOPLE WHO EARNED TOO MUCH TO

02:22.843 --> 02:24.411
QUALIFY, WERE NO LONGER

02:24.411 --> 02:26.213
DISABLED, HAD DIED OR GONE TO

02:26.213 --> 02:27.314
PRISON.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.582
THE AGENCY'S DEBT COLLECTION

02:28.582 --> 02:30.350
PROGRAM RECOUPED OVER EIGHT

02:30.350 --> 02:31.585
BILLION DOLLARS.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.753
BUT INVESTIGATORS SAY IT TOOK

02:32.753 --> 02:34.888
YEARS TO GET THAT MONEY BACK.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.623
A FEDERAL JURY HAS ACQUITTED A

02:36.623 --> 02:38.458
FORMER B.P. EXECUTIVE ACCUSED OF

02:38.458 --> 02:39.826
MAKING FALSE STATEMENTS TO

02:39.826 --> 02:41.561
FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS AFTER THE"

02:41.561 --> 02:43.130
DEEPWATER HORIZON" OIL RIG

02:43.130 --> 02:44.698
EXPLOSION.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.033
DAVID RAINEY WAS FACING FIVE

02:46.033 --> 02:47.501
YEARS IN PRISON FOR ALLEGEDLY

02:47.501 --> 02:49.002
MISLEADING INVESTIGATORS.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.904
HE ESTIMATED NEARLY 5,100

02:50.904 --> 02:52.439
BARRELS OF OIL PER-DAY WERE

02:52.439 --> 02:54.341
LEAKING INTO THE GULF.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.675
SCIENTISTS LATER FOUND IT WAS

02:55.675 --> 02:57.778
MORE THAN 60,000 BARRELS PER

02:57.778 --> 02:58.779
DAY.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.380
THE DEFENSE ARGUED RAINEY HAD NO

03:00.380 --> 03:01.882
REASON TO LIE.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.750
THE 2010 EXPLOSION KILLED 11

03:03.750 --> 03:05.152
PEOPLE AND TRIGGERED THE LARGEST

03:05.152 --> 03:06.787
OFFSHORE OIL SPILL IN U.S.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.055
HISTORY.

03:08.055 --> 03:09.556
IN IRAQ, PRO-GOVERNMENT TROOPS

03:09.556 --> 03:11.425
FOUGHT OFF TWO ISIS ATTACKS IN

03:11.425 --> 03:12.826
ANBAR PROVINCE.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.294
ISIS TRIED TO TAKE HUSSEIBA

03:14.294 --> 03:16.096
TODAY, USING HEAVY MORTAR FIRE,

03:16.096 --> 03:17.898
BUT IRAQI FORCES HUNG ON.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.666
THE U.S. LED COALITION CONTINUES

03:19.666 --> 03:21.501
TO CONDUCT AIRSTRIKES.

03:21.501 --> 03:22.602
A U.S. GENERAL CALLED THE

03:22.602 --> 03:24.638
BOMBING CAMPAIGN AGGRESSIVE AND

03:24.638 --> 03:26.873
SAYS IT HAS KILLED 1,000 ISLAMIC

03:26.873 --> 03:28.975
STATE FIGHTERS PER MONTH.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.277
STILL, IRAQI FORCES HAVE NOT

03:30.277 --> 03:32.212
BEEN ABLE TO RETAKE THE KEY CITY

03:32.212 --> 03:33.580
OF RAMADI.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.981
IN CHINA, THE DEATH TOLL FROM

03:34.981 --> 03:36.450
THE OVERTURNED CRUISE LINER THAT

03:36.450 --> 03:38.518
CAPSIZED MONDAY NIGHT HAS JUMPED

03:38.518 --> 03:41.054
TO 396 PEOPLE.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.355
THE "EASTERN STAR" FLIPPED OVER

03:42.355 --> 03:43.657
ON THE YANGTZE RIVER DURING A

03:43.657 --> 03:45.459
FREAK STORM MONDAY NIGHT.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.960
CREWS RIGHTED THE SHIP AND

03:46.960 --> 03:48.228
RESCUERS ARE STILL HOLDING OUT

03:48.228 --> 03:50.030
HOPE, SEARCHING FOR SURVIVORS.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.799
THEY'VE ONLY FOUND 14 SO FAR.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.334
MOST OF THE PASSENGERS WERE

03:54.334 --> 03:56.570
ELDERLY TOURISTS.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.114
>> Stewart: IT HAS BEEN JUST

04:07.114 --> 04:08.348
OVER A WEEK SINCE THE NEW

04:08.348 --> 04:10.016
PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA, MUHAMMADU

04:10.016 --> 04:11.785
BUHARI WAS INAUGURATED.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.186
AND SO FAR, THE WEEK HAS BEEN

04:13.186 --> 04:14.921
MARRED BY A SERIES OF ATTACKS,

04:14.921 --> 04:16.289
ALL BLAMED ON THE ISLAMIC

04:16.289 --> 04:18.058
MILITANT GROUP BOKO HARAM.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.026
MOST RECENTLY, AS MANY AS 45

04:20.026 --> 04:21.428
PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN A SUICIDE

04:21.428 --> 04:23.730
BOMBING IN NORTHEASTERN NIGERIA.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.699
IN HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS, BUHARI

04:25.699 --> 04:28.068
CALLED BOKO HARAM "MINDLESS" AND

04:28.068 --> 04:30.003
"GODLESS" AND VOWED TO ERADICATE

04:30.003 --> 04:31.438
THE GROUP AND RESCUE HUNDREDS OF

04:31.438 --> 04:32.939
WOMEN AND CHILDREN IT'S TAKEN

04:32.939 --> 04:34.107
HOSTAGE.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.408
SO HOW WILL HE MAKE GOOD ON THAT

04:35.408 --> 04:36.510
PLEDGE?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.811
FOR MORE INSIGHT, WE'RE JOINED

04:37.811 --> 04:39.446
NOW VIA SKYPE FROM ACCRA, GHANA

04:39.446 --> 04:41.414
BY DREW HINSHAW OF THE WALL

04:41.414 --> 04:42.482
STREET JOURNAL.

04:42.482 --> 04:43.850
AND, DREW, IN THE SHORT TERM HOW

04:43.850 --> 04:45.018
IS THE NEW PRESIDENT GOING TO

04:45.018 --> 04:47.254
MAKE GOOD ON THAT PROMISE?

04:47.254 --> 04:48.522
>> WELL, THE FIRST THING HE'S

04:48.522 --> 04:50.223
DONE IS EXPRESS A CERTAIN

04:50.223 --> 04:52.726
SERIOUSNESS ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT

04:52.726 --> 04:53.860
MIJEERNS, I THINK, ARE

04:53.860 --> 04:55.629
CELEBRATING.

04:55.629 --> 04:56.630
HE'S TALKED ABOUT MOVING HIS

04:56.630 --> 04:58.398
GENERAL TO THE NORTHEAST THAT

04:58.398 --> 05:00.467
THEY CAN BE IN CLOSER CONTACT

05:00.467 --> 05:01.501
WITH THE SOLDIERS WHO HAVE TO

05:01.501 --> 05:03.003
FIGHT THIS WAR.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.037
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SEEING,

05:04.037 --> 05:05.639
THOUGH, IS THAT BOKO HARAM IS A

05:05.639 --> 05:07.674
GROUP OF MAYBE SEVERAL THOUSANDS

05:07.674 --> 05:09.476
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FIGHTING A

05:09.476 --> 05:10.477
DIFFERENT KIND OF WAR.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.611
I MEAN, THEY'RE HAPPY TO KILL

05:11.611 --> 05:14.381
CIVILIANS AT THEIR LEISURE, AND

05:14.381 --> 05:15.682
IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY HARD

05:15.682 --> 05:17.217
FOR ANY PRESIDENT TO PROTECT

05:17.217 --> 05:19.352
EVERY VILLAGE, SCHOOL, AND

05:19.352 --> 05:20.987
MARKET IN A COUNTRY OF 177

05:20.987 --> 05:23.023
MILLION PEOPLE, AND I THINK MANY

05:23.023 --> 05:24.958
NIGERIANS ARE UNDERSTANDING A

05:24.958 --> 05:26.259
NEW PRESIDENT DOESN'T MEAN THE

05:26.259 --> 05:27.527
END OF THE KIND OF CARNAGE THAT

05:27.527 --> 05:29.863
WE'VE SEEN GLAL WITHOUT TRYING

05:29.863 --> 05:31.331
TO SOUND TOO CYNICAL WHAT CAN HE

05:31.331 --> 05:33.600
DO TO FIGHT THIS KIND OF

05:33.600 --> 05:35.669
UNORTHODOX WAR?

05:35.669 --> 05:36.436
>> IT'S TRUE.

05:36.436 --> 05:37.437
IT'S A HARD QUESTION.

05:37.437 --> 05:38.471
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING MORE

05:38.471 --> 05:40.974
SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH TOND WHY

05:40.974 --> 05:43.343
YOUNG PEOPLE FIND THEMSELVES

05:43.343 --> 05:45.178
WILLING TO FIGHT FOR BOKO HARAM,

05:45.178 --> 05:46.613
A GROUP THAT HAS LOST ALMOST ALL

05:46.613 --> 05:48.915
OF ITS POPULAR SUPPORT AND YET

05:48.915 --> 05:50.350
THROUGH A MIXTURE OF KIDNAPPING

05:50.350 --> 05:51.918
AND RECRUITMENT AND A MIXTURE OF

05:51.918 --> 05:53.787
THE TWO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BRING

05:53.787 --> 05:55.155
IN NEW PEOPLE.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.823
THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF BOKO

05:56.823 --> 05:58.658
HARAM MEMBERS AND THE QUESTION

05:58.658 --> 05:59.626
IS WHAT DO WE DO WITH THEM?

05:59.626 --> 06:00.927
DO WE REREET REESE THEM OUT?

06:00.927 --> 06:02.329
DO WE HAVE A REHABILITATION

06:02.329 --> 06:03.663
PROGRAM FOR THEM AND THAT IS A

06:03.663 --> 06:04.931
HARD ISSUE.

06:04.931 --> 06:07.033
>> ONE OF THE OTHER SOOSHZ THE

06:07.033 --> 06:08.501
DISPLACED PEOPLE.

06:08.501 --> 06:13.073
WHAT EFFORTS ARE GOING TOWARDS

06:13.073 --> 06:14.874
HELPING THOSE PEOPLE IN THAT

06:14.874 --> 06:16.076
CRISIS.

06:16.076 --> 06:16.977
>> AGAIN, IT'S A NEW

06:16.977 --> 06:18.044
ADMINISTRATION SO I DON'T THINK

06:18.044 --> 06:19.779
WE KNOW WHAT PRESIDENT BUHARI

06:19.779 --> 06:21.281
WANTS TO DO WITH THAT LARGE

06:21.281 --> 06:22.482
NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

06:22.482 --> 06:23.850
THE ECONOMIC REALITY IS I

06:23.850 --> 06:25.452
IMAGINE MANY OF THEM WILL MOVE

06:25.452 --> 06:27.887
SOUTH TO LAGOS, AND CALAYBAR,

06:27.887 --> 06:30.123
AND HARCOURT, WHERE EMPLOYMENT

06:30.123 --> 06:31.157
OPPORTUNITIES ARE SLIGHTLY

06:31.157 --> 06:32.125
BETTER.

06:32.125 --> 06:35.929
NIGERIA HAS SEVERAL BILLIONAIRES

06:35.929 --> 06:37.130
BUT THE PART WHERE BOKO HARAM IS

06:37.130 --> 06:39.065
OPERATING IS UP NEAR LAKE CHAD,

06:39.065 --> 06:40.267
ONE OF THE POOREST PARTS ON

06:40.267 --> 06:41.868
EARTH.

06:41.868 --> 06:45.105
I IMAGINE PEOPLE BEING UPBRIGHT

06:45.105 --> 06:47.073
WAR AND THE ECONOMIC REALITY OF

06:47.073 --> 06:48.642
THAT PART OF NIGERIA ARE GOING

06:48.642 --> 06:50.343
TO MOVE SOUTH GLAL LET'S TALK A

06:50.343 --> 06:52.245
LITTLE BIT ABOUT AWKWARD I THINK

06:52.245 --> 06:54.047
IS A FAIR DESCRIPTION OF THE

06:54.047 --> 06:55.448
POSITION THE UNITED STATES IS

06:55.448 --> 06:56.883
IN, GIVEN THAT NIGERIA'S

06:56.883 --> 06:59.286
MILITARY HAS THE OWN CASES OF

06:59.286 --> 07:01.921
HUMAN RIGHT ABUSES BHAP CAN THE

07:01.921 --> 07:03.356
UNITED STATES DO, GIVEN THIS

07:03.356 --> 07:04.958
TENSION?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.660
>> LATELY, U.S. OFFICIALS THAT

07:06.660 --> 07:07.961
WE'VE SPOKEN TO SEEM TO BE A

07:07.961 --> 07:09.696
LITTLE BIT MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN

07:09.696 --> 07:10.764
BEFORE.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.766
THEY FEEL THE ARMY IS OPENING UP

07:12.766 --> 07:14.134
TO THE IDEA THAT THEY NEED TO BE

07:14.134 --> 07:15.568
A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT NOT

07:15.568 --> 07:17.537
KILLING AND ALIENATING THE VERY

07:17.537 --> 07:20.640
CIVILIANS THEY NEED TO WIN OVER.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.375
IN THE LONG RUN, HAVING A NEW

07:54.841 --> 07:55.942
CRITICS SAY THAT SOME

07:55.942 --> 07:57.043

07:57.043 --> 07:58.611
USING A LITTLE-KNOWN PRACTICE

EXPENSIVE VERSIONS OF DRUGS FROM

08:19.366 --> 08:21.234
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, A

08:21.234 --> 08:22.736
DEBILITATING DISEASE AFFECTING

08:22.736 --> 08:24.637
THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.272
THE 47-YEAR-OLD MOTHER OF THREE,

08:31.644 --> 08:33.246
FATIGUE.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.750
YOU WAKE UP TIRED.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.151
AND AS THE DAY PROGRESSES, IT

08:38.151 --> 08:40.019
JUST GETS WORSE AND WORSE.

08:40.019 --> 08:41.488
>> Reporter: IN 2005, WINKLER'S

08:41.488 --> 08:43.123
DOCTOR PRESCRIBED A BRAND-NAME

08:43.123 --> 08:45.425
MEDICATION CALLED PROVIGIL.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.027
IT WAS ONE OF THE ONLY DRUGS FOR

08:47.027 --> 08:48.661
FATIGUE ON THE MARKET THAT HAD

08:48.661 --> 08:50.096
MINIMAL SIDE EFFECTS.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.631
IT WAS MADE BY A COMPANY CALLED

08:51.631 --> 08:53.233
CEPHALON, WHICH EARNED

08:53.233 --> 08:56.369
$475 MILLION ON PROVIGIL THAT

08:56.369 --> 08:57.604
YEAR.

08:57.604 --> 08:59.038
WINKLER'S DOCTOR PUT HER ON A

08:59.038 --> 09:00.740
HALF PILL, EVERY DAY.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.475
>> IT WAS PERFECT, YOU KNOW.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.110
I HAD THREE YOUNG KIDS AND I

09:04.110 --> 09:03.910
COULD STILL DO- PRETTY MUCH DO

09:03.910 --> 09:05.512
EVERYTHING THAT I DID.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.679
AND, YOU KNOW, IF I HAD 10

09:06.679 --> 09:08.014
THINGS ON THE TO-DO LIST, YOU

09:08.014 --> 09:09.215
KNOW, I COULD EITHER GET THE 10

09:09.215 --> 09:10.183
THINGS DONE OR AT LEAST EIGHT OR

09:10.183 --> 09:11.151
NINE OF THEM.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.318
>> Reporter: BETTER YET, WINKLER

09:12.318 --> 09:13.386
SAYS HER DOCTOR TOLD HER

09:13.386 --> 09:14.554
PROVIGIL WAS EXPECTED TO GO

09:14.554 --> 09:15.922
GENERIC SOON, POSSIBLY WITHIN A

09:15.922 --> 09:17.791
YEAR, WHICH COULD HAVE SAVED HER

09:17.791 --> 09:20.059
MORE THAN $1,000 A YEAR.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.262
>> THEN IT DIDN'T GO GENERIC.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.163
AND IT WAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT

09:23.163 --> 09:24.197
STORY.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.064
>> Reporter: NOT ONLY DID IT NOT

09:25.064 --> 09:26.332
GO GENERIC, THE PRICE

09:26.332 --> 09:28.435
INEXPLICABLY STARTED TO RISE.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.103
>> IT WAS SIX-SOMETHING A PILL.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.337
AND THEN IT WAS SEVEN-SOMETHING

09:31.337 --> 09:32.839
A PILL.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.674
IN 2010, IT HAD GONE UP TO,

09:34.674 --> 09:37.677
LIKE, 16-SOMETHING A PILL.

09:37.677 --> 09:38.878
>> Reporter: WINKLER'S INSURANCE

09:38.878 --> 09:40.814
ONLY COVERED HALF THE PRICE, AND

09:40.814 --> 09:42.115
HER OUT-OF-POCKET COST FOR A

09:42.115 --> 09:43.883
SIX-MONTH SUPPLY WENT FROM

09:43.883 --> 09:46.619
AROUND $300 IN 2008 TO MORE THAN

09:46.619 --> 09:49.556
$700 IN 2010.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.490
SO, COULD YOU AFFORD THAT?

09:50.490 --> 09:51.524
>> NO.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.593
THAT WAS A CAR PAYMENT AND PLUS.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.361
AND WITH THREE YOUNG KIDS AND,

09:55.361 --> 09:57.197
YOU KNOW, FEEDING THEM, AND I

09:57.197 --> 09:58.465
FELT GUILTY THAT I WAS TAKING

09:58.465 --> 10:00.400
AWAY FROM THE FAMILY BUDGET.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.601
>> Reporter: SO SHE DECIDED TO

10:01.601 --> 10:03.503
GO OFF PROVIGIL, AND TRY A LESS

10:03.503 --> 10:05.138
EXPENSIVE GENERIC VERSION OF A

10:05.138 --> 10:06.372
DIFFERENT DRUG.

10:06.372 --> 10:07.340
IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE AS

10:07.340 --> 10:08.741
EFFECTIVE, AND MADE HER SHAKY

10:08.741 --> 10:10.009
AND JITTERY.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.311
HER REACTION TO NOT GETTING THE

10:11.311 --> 10:12.679
DRUGS SHE SAID SHE NEEDED?

10:12.679 --> 10:14.180
>> I THOUGHT, HOW CAN THIS BE

10:14.180 --> 10:15.482
LEGAL, HOW CAN THIS BE-- IT'S

10:15.482 --> 10:17.450
DEFINITELY NOT MORAL.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.852
IT'S NOT HUMANE.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.119
>> Reporter: WHY HADN'T PROVIGIL

10:20.119 --> 10:21.621
GONE GENERIC?

10:21.621 --> 10:22.822
AND WHY WAS THE PRICE OF IT

10:22.822 --> 10:24.324
RISING SO SHARPLY?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.692
AS WINKLER DISCOVERED THROUGH

10:25.692 --> 10:27.427
ONLINE RESEARCH, THE COMPANY

10:27.427 --> 10:28.862
MANUFACTURING THE DRUG,

10:28.862 --> 10:31.431
CEPHALON, WAS USING TWO COMMON

10:31.431 --> 10:32.565
BUT LITTLE KNOWN BUSINESS

10:32.565 --> 10:34.200
STRATEGIES THAT CRITICS SAY END

10:34.200 --> 10:36.135
UP COSTING CONSUMERS.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.770
FIRST, THERE'S SOMETHING THAT

10:37.770 --> 10:40.139
OPPONENTS CALL, "PAY FOR DELAY."

10:40.139 --> 10:41.274
HERE'S HOW "PAY FOR DELAY"

10:41.274 --> 10:42.342
WORKS.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.610
ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL TRADE

10:43.610 --> 10:45.311
COMMISSION, WHEN GENERIC

10:45.311 --> 10:47.013

10:50.250 --> 10:51.985
THEM COMPENSATION TO DROP THE

10:51.985 --> 10:53.286
CHALLENGE.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.787
IN THE CASE OF KAREN'S DRUG,

10:54.787 --> 10:56.422
CEPHALON OFFERED PAYMENTS AND

10:56.422 --> 10:58.224
BUSINESS DEALS WORTH AROUND $300

10:58.224 --> 11:00.226
MILLION TO FOUR GENERIC

11:02.128 --> 11:03.997
GUARANTEE THAT NO GENERIC WOULD

11:03.997 --> 11:05.732
COME TO MARKET FOR ANOTHER SIX

11:05.732 --> 11:06.833
YEARS.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.167
>> AT ITS SIMPLEST LEVEL, WE'RE

11:08.167 --> 11:09.602
TALKING ABOUT AN AGREEMENT

11:09.602 --> 11:11.070
BETWEEN A BRAND COMPANY AND A

11:11.070 --> 11:12.639
GENERIC COMPANY, IN WHICH THE

11:12.639 --> 11:14.340
BRAND COMPANY PAYS THE GENERIC

11:14.340 --> 11:16.409
COMPANY NOT TO LAUNCH A GENERIC

IN COMPETITION WITH THE BRAND.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.518
HE SAYS FIGHTING THESE SO-CALLED

11:25.518 --> 11:27.153
"PAY FOR DELAY" DEALS IS ONE OF

11:27.153 --> 11:29.822
THE F.T.C.'S TOP PRIORITIES.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.079

11:53.079 --> 11:55.181
ISSUED A MAJOR RULING IN ANOTHER

11:55.181 --> 11:57.183
F.T.C. CASE THAT COULD OPEN THE

11:57.183 --> 11:59.052
DOOR FOR MORE LAWSUITS AGAINST

11:59.052 --> 12:00.820
DRUG MANUFACTURERS INVOLVED IN

12:00.820 --> 12:02.255
SIMILAR PRACTICES.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.623
>> IF YOU CAN KEEP THE GENERIC

12:03.623 --> 12:05.158
OUT, THE BRAND CAN CONTINUE TO

12:05.158 --> 12:06.759
MAKE ALL THE SALES AT THE

12:06.759 --> 12:08.528
MONOPOLY PRICE AND STILL PAY THE

12:08.528 --> 12:10.096
GENERIC TO MAKE IT WORTHWHILE

12:10.096 --> 12:11.331
FOR THEM TO STAY OUT OF THE

12:11.331 --> 12:12.198
MARKET.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.266
WE'VE DONE A STUDY OF THIS BACK

12:13.266 --> 12:15.134
IN 2010 WHERE WE REALLY STUDIED

12:15.134 --> 12:16.769
THIS VERY CAREFULLY AND WE

12:16.769 --> 12:18.071
ESTIMATED THAT IT COST AMERICAN

12:31.451 --> 12:32.652
IT MIGHT NOT SURPRISE YOU THAT

12:32.652 --> 12:34.087
WHAT OPPONENTS CALL "PAY FOR

12:34.087 --> 12:35.855
DELAY" DEALS, THE DRUG COMPANIES

12:35.855 --> 12:37.724
DESCRIBE COMPLETELY DIFFERENTLY.

12:43.997 --> 12:45.098
CONSUMERS WELL.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.432
HOW?

12:46.432 --> 12:47.767
BECAUSE, THEY SAY, UNDER THOSE

12:47.767 --> 12:49.502
DEALS, GENERIC DRUGS HIT THE

12:49.502 --> 12:51.270
MARKET BEFORE THE BRAND DRUG'S

12:53.706 --> 12:55.041
THEY CHALLENGED THOSE PATENTS IN

THE FIRST PLACE.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.644
>> DO WE WORK OUT COMPROMISE?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.192
EIGHT YEARS SOONER.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.227

13:48.227 --> 13:49.595
CAN GET FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN

13:49.595 --> 13:51.330
YEARS, IT'S BETTER TAKING THAT

13:51.330 --> 13:53.232
FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN YEARS

13:53.232 --> 13:55.068
RATHER THAN ROLLING THE DICE AND

14:14.520 --> 14:16.522
HAVE TO COMPARE IT TO THE

14:16.522 --> 14:17.657
LIKELIHOOD THAT THE GENERIC

14:17.657 --> 14:19.325
WOULD HAVE COME EVEN EARLIER.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.427
SO, TAKE, FOR EXAMPLE, PROVIGIL.

14:21.427 --> 14:22.929
IT'S TRUE THAT THERE IS A

14:22.929 --> 14:24.864
GENERIC IN THE MARKET TODAY.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.833
BUT WE CONTEND THAT BUT FOR THIS

14:26.833 --> 14:28.701
AGREEMENT, CONSUMERS WOULD HAVE

14:28.701 --> 14:30.336
HAD ACCESS TO A GENERIC ALL THE

14:30.336 --> 14:32.338
WAY BACK IN 2006.

14:32.338 --> 14:33.506
>> Reporter: BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT

14:33.506 --> 14:35.108
CRITICS DESCRIBE AS THOSE "PAY

14:35.108 --> 14:36.976
FOR DELAY" DEALS, PROVIGIL

14:36.976 --> 14:38.444
DIDN'T GO GENERIC.

14:38.444 --> 14:39.979
SO KAREN WINKLER AND OTHER

14:39.979 --> 14:41.748
CONSUMERS PAID THE PRICE.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.750
AND IT TURNS OUT SHE PAID EVEN

14:43.750 --> 14:45.351
MORE BECAUSE OF THAT SECOND

14:45.351 --> 14:47.420
CONTROVERSIAL BUSINESS STRATEGY

14:47.420 --> 14:49.322
THAT CEPHALON USED THEN AND

14:49.322 --> 14:50.556
OTHER DRUG MANUFACTURERS

14:50.556 --> 14:53.226
CONTINUE TO USE TODAY--

14:53.226 --> 14:54.393
SOMETHING OPPONENTS CALL"

14:54.393 --> 14:55.762
EVERGREENING."

14:55.762 --> 14:57.663
THE IDEA IS TO GET CONSUMERS OFF

14:57.663 --> 14:59.499
THE DRUG THEY'RE TAKING AND ON

14:59.499 --> 15:01.601
TO ANOTHER BRAND DRUG THE SAME

15:01.601 --> 15:03.336
COMPANY IS MAKING.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.538
IN WINKLER'S CASE, OFF PROVIGIL

15:05.538 --> 15:06.672
WHOSE PATENT WAS GOING TO

15:06.672 --> 15:08.775
EXPIRE, AND ONTO A NEW DRUG,

15:08.775 --> 15:10.476
NUVIGIL, WHOSE PATENT HAD

15:10.476 --> 15:12.345
SEVERAL MORE YEARS TO RUN.

15:12.345 --> 15:13.746
COMPANIES SOMETIMES DO THIS BY

15:13.746 --> 15:15.148
RAISING PRICES ON THE FIRST

15:15.148 --> 15:16.115
DRUG.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.450
SURE ENOUGH, WHEN WINKLER

15:17.450 --> 15:18.751
COMPLAINED ABOUT THE RISING

15:18.751 --> 15:20.319
PRICE OF PROVIGIL, HER DOCTOR

15:20.319 --> 15:21.821
SUGGESTED NUVIGIL, WHICH WAS

15:21.821 --> 15:23.222
CHEAPER.

15:23.222 --> 15:24.657
BUT WINKLER SAYS IT GAVE HER

15:24.657 --> 15:26.225
POUNDING HEADACHES.

15:26.225 --> 15:27.927
SO SHE WENT ONLINE TO FIGURE OUT

15:27.927 --> 15:29.595
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.530
>> AND WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO

15:30.530 --> 15:32.732
DO WAS TO GET PATIENTS OFF OF

15:32.732 --> 15:33.966
PROVIGIL, BECAUSE THEY KNEW IT

15:33.966 --> 15:35.034
WAS GOING TO BE GOING GENERIC

15:35.034 --> 15:36.469
SHORTLY, TO START TAKING THIS

15:36.469 --> 15:38.404
NUVIGIL THAT HAD THIS NEW,

15:38.404 --> 15:40.239
EXTENDED PATENT PERIOD.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.774
>> IT'S VERY RARE FOR PATIENTS

15:41.774 --> 15:43.276
TO SWITCH BACK ONCE THE GENERIC

15:43.276 --> 15:44.811
COMES INTO THE MARKETPLACE.

15:44.811 --> 15:46.078
SO, IT'S A STRATEGY FOR THE

15:46.078 --> 15:47.914
BRAND TO BE ABLE TO HOLD ON TO

15:47.914 --> 15:49.215
THE MARKET LONGER, EVEN AFTER

15:49.215 --> 15:50.383
THERE'S A GENERIC IN THE

15:50.383 --> 15:51.751
MARKETPLACE.

15:51.751 --> 15:52.585
>> Reporter: THIS IS ONE AREA

15:52.585 --> 15:53.786
WHERE THE GENERIC PHARMACEUTICAL

15:53.786 --> 15:55.288
ASSOCIATION AND THE F.T.C.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.422
AGREE.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.424
>> THAT'S KEEPING AFFORDABLE

15:58.424 --> 15:59.592
MEDICINE FROM PEOPLE WHO

15:59.592 --> 16:00.927
DESPERATELY NEED IT.

16:00.927 --> 16:03.029
AND WE'RE VERY MUCH AGAINST IT

16:03.029 --> 16:04.197
AND IT'S A BIG ISSUE.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.231
>> Reporter: WHAT DOES

16:05.231 --> 16:06.499
PROVIGIL'S MANUFACTURER,

16:06.499 --> 16:07.767
CEPHALON, HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE

16:07.767 --> 16:09.035
TWO STRATEGIES?

16:09.035 --> 16:10.703
IN 2011, THE COMPANY WAS

16:10.703 --> 16:12.438
ACQUIRED BY TEVA, THE WORLD'S

16:12.438 --> 16:14.774
LARGEST GENERIC DRUG COMPANY.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.142
IN A STATEMENT LAST YEAR TO

16:16.142 --> 16:17.677
NEWSHOUR, TEVA DECLINED TO

16:17.677 --> 16:19.645
COMMENT ON EVERGREENING.

16:19.645 --> 16:20.913
AS FOR THE SO-CALLED "PAY FOR

16:20.913 --> 16:22.548
DELAY" STRATEGY, THE COMPANY

16:22.548 --> 16:24.250
SAID IT BELIEVED THE AGREEMENTS

16:24.250 --> 16:25.651
WERE "LAWFUL AND SERVED TO

16:25.651 --> 16:27.420
INCREASE COMPETITION" AND THAT

16:27.420 --> 16:28.387
IT WOULD "DEFEND THEM

16:28.387 --> 16:29.655
VIGOROUSLY."

16:29.655 --> 16:31.023
BUT JUST LAST WEEK, A MAJOR

16:31.023 --> 16:32.525
DEVELOPMENT IN THE F.T.C.'S

16:32.525 --> 16:33.492
CASE.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.661
>> I WANT TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE

16:35.661 --> 16:36.929
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION HAS

16:36.929 --> 16:39.232
REACHED A LANDMARK SETTLEMENT

16:39.232 --> 16:40.867
RESOLVING OUR ANTITRUST SUIT

16:40.867 --> 16:43.135
AGAINST CEPHALON INCORPORATED.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.036
>> Reporter: TEVA AGREED TO

16:44.036 --> 16:46.372
SETTLE FOR $1.2 BILLION, THE

16:46.372 --> 16:48.341
LARGEST SETTLEMENT EVER IN

16:48.341 --> 16:50.076
F.T.C. HISTORY.

16:50.076 --> 16:50.977
THE MONEY WILL REFUND

16:50.977 --> 16:52.411
WHOLESALERS, PHARMACIES AND

16:52.411 --> 16:54.013
INSURERS THE F.T.C. SAYS

16:54.013 --> 16:55.815
OVERPAID FOR PROVIGIL.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.483
TEVA ALSO AGREED NOT TO ENTER

16:57.483 --> 16:59.385
SIMILAR DEALS IN THE FUTURE.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.520
A SPOKESPERSON SAID, "WE ARE

17:01.520 --> 17:02.788
PLEASED TO HAVE REACHED AN

17:02.788 --> 17:04.123
AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

17:04.123 --> 17:05.358
TEVA BELIEVES IT IS THE RIGHT

17:05.358 --> 17:06.759
PATH FOR OUR COMPANY, FOR THE

17:06.759 --> 17:08.094
INDUSTRY AND FOR THE PATIENTS WE

17:08.094 --> 17:09.228
SERVE."

17:09.228 --> 17:10.630
TEVA ALSO SETTLED THE OTHER,

17:10.630 --> 17:11.998
CLASS-ACTION SUIT EARLIER THIS

17:11.998 --> 17:14.000
YEAR FOR HALF A BILLION DOLLARS,

17:14.000 --> 17:15.468
AN AMOUNT THE F.T.C. WILL FOLD

17:15.468 --> 17:17.703
INTO ITS SETTLEMENT.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.071
>> I BELIEVE THIS SETTLEMENT

17:19.071 --> 17:21.340
BRINGS US ONE STEP CLOSER TO

17:21.340 --> 17:22.708
STOPPING THESE ILLEGAL

17:22.708 --> 17:24.110
ARRANGEMENTS.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.312
>> Reporter: INDIVIDUALS LIKE

17:26.312 --> 17:28.047
KAREN WINKLER LIKELY WON'T SEE

17:28.047 --> 17:29.448
MONEY FROM THE SETTLEMENT

17:29.448 --> 17:30.616
ANYTIME SOON.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.151
BUT, SHE SAYS, SHE HOPES IT WILL

17:32.151 --> 17:33.886
MAKE OTHER COMPANIES THINK TWICE

17:33.886 --> 17:35.721
ABOUT MAKING SIMILAR DEALS.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.291
PROVIGIL DID GO GENERIC IN 2012,

17:38.291 --> 17:40.493
AND THE PRICE FOR WINKLER FELL

17:40.493 --> 17:42.895
FROM MORE THAN $700 TO $16 FOR A

17:42.895 --> 17:44.330
THREE-MONTH SUPPLY.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.932
SHE WENT BACK ON THE DRUG, AND

17:45.932 --> 17:47.333
SAYS IT'S MADE ALL THE

17:47.333 --> 17:49.035
DIFFERENCE.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.139

18:08.921 --> 18:10.589
EVER, WORKERS AT A MAJOR ONLINE

18:10.589 --> 18:12.692
MEDIA OUTLET, GAWKER MEDIA, HAVE

18:12.692 --> 18:14.327
VOTED TO UNIONIZE.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.461
IN FACT, THE VOTE WAS A

18:15.461 --> 18:17.396
LANDSLIDE AMONG THE 100-PLUS

18:17.396 --> 18:18.831
EMPLOYEES WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THE

18:18.831 --> 18:20.466
POPULAR WEBSITES GAWKER,

18:20.466 --> 18:21.834
DEADSPIN and JEZEBEL.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.436
JOINING ME NOW WITH SOME INSIGHT

18:23.436 --> 18:24.737
IS THE HUFFINGTON POST'S SENIOR

18:24.737 --> 18:26.572
MEDIA EDITOR GABRIEL ARANA.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.274
GABRIEL, BY ALL ACCOUNTS,

18:28.274 --> 18:30.209
WORKERS WERE REALLY HAPPY AT

18:30.209 --> 18:32.645
GAWKER MEDIA GENERALLY, SO WHY

18:32.645 --> 18:33.579
GAWKER?

18:33.579 --> 18:34.547
WHY NOW?

18:34.547 --> 18:36.015
>> SO WHEN YOU TALK TO WORKERS,

18:36.015 --> 18:38.084
THE PURPORTED REASON FOR

18:38.084 --> 18:39.552
ORGANIZING BUNDT BECAUSE THEY

18:39.552 --> 18:40.686
WERE UPSET WITH MANAGEMENT.

18:40.686 --> 18:42.088
THEY WEREN'T UNHAPPY.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.823
IT'S BECAUSE THEY WANTED MORE

18:43.823 --> 18:45.558
TRANSPARENCY IN THE WAY THINGS

18:45.558 --> 18:46.959
LIKE SALARIES ARE DECIDED,

18:46.959 --> 18:48.961
THINGS LIKE BONUSES ARE DECIDED.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.196
RIGHT NOW THOSE THINGS ARE

18:50.196 --> 18:51.230
SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL

18:51.230 --> 18:53.265
NEGOTIATIONS, AND NOBODY SORT OF

18:53.265 --> 18:54.734
KNOWS WHAT THE RULES ARE FOR

18:54.734 --> 18:56.235
EVERYBODY.

18:56.235 --> 18:58.204
AND SO, THE GOAL WAS TO BRING

18:58.204 --> 18:59.372
MORE TRANSPARENCY TO THAT

18:59.372 --> 19:01.040
PROCESS.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.575
AND THEN, ALSO, AS THE INDUSTRY

19:02.575 --> 19:05.511
IS MATURING, PEOPLE WANT

19:05.511 --> 19:06.746
SECURITY.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.947
PEOPLE WANT PROTECTION INTO THE

19:07.947 --> 19:08.948
FUTURE.

19:08.948 --> 19:09.915
AND GAWKER MIGHT BE A GREAT

19:09.915 --> 19:11.317
PLACE TO WORK NOW, BUT NOBODY

19:11.317 --> 19:12.852
KNOWS WHAT FUTURE HOLDS, WHAT

19:12.852 --> 19:14.954
SORT OF ECONOMIC CHALLENGES,

19:14.954 --> 19:16.989
STRUCTURAL CHANGES THE COMPANY

19:16.989 --> 19:18.057
GL THROUGH.

19:18.057 --> 19:20.226
SO IT'S REALLY, FOR THE FUTURE,

19:20.226 --> 19:21.994
FOR TRANSPARENCY, AND THEN FOR

19:21.994 --> 19:23.829
STABILITY.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.731
GLAL I'M WONDERING HOW THE IDEA

19:25.731 --> 19:27.933
OF UNIONS WILL MESH WITH THE

19:27.933 --> 19:29.602
FREE-WHEELING SPIRIT OF THE

19:29.602 --> 19:30.703
INTERNET.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.471
>> I THINK THE UNIONS ARE GOING

19:32.471 --> 19:33.506
TO HAVE TO DO MORE OF THE

19:33.506 --> 19:34.573
LEARNING.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.275
TECH WORKERS, HIGH-SKILL

19:36.275 --> 19:38.411
WORKERS, MILLENNIALS -- OF WHICH

19:38.411 --> 19:40.379
I AM ONE-- WE DEPARTMENT GROW UP

19:40.379 --> 19:42.615
IN A UNION ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS

19:42.615 --> 19:43.949
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES THE

19:43.949 --> 19:45.217
EFFORT REALLY EXCITING FOR THE

19:45.217 --> 19:46.852
LABOR MOVEMENT.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.120
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY EFFORTS TO

19:48.120 --> 19:50.256
ORGANIZE THE TECH SECTOR, TO

19:50.256 --> 19:52.124
ORGANIZE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS THAT

19:52.124 --> 19:53.859
HAVE BEEN LARGELY UNSUCCESSFUL,

19:53.859 --> 19:55.461
BUT HERE YOU HAVE A REALLY YOUNG

19:55.461 --> 19:58.731
WORKFORCE VOTING TO UNIONIZE.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.966
AND IN A NASIENT AND THRIVING

20:00.966 --> 20:03.636
INDUSTRY AND THE AS THE UNION

20:03.636 --> 20:07.606
RATE HAVE DECLINED, THIS WILL BE

20:07.606 --> 20:08.641
A SIGN OF LIFE.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.642
>> WILL THIS BE ONE OF THE

20:09.642 --> 20:10.943
MOMENTS WHEN THEY LOOK BACK AND

20:10.943 --> 20:12.812
SAY THAT WAS A TURNING POINT IN

20:12.812 --> 20:14.580
THE INTERNET CULTURE?

20:14.580 --> 20:16.782
>> I THINK SO.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.351
I THINK THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF

20:19.351 --> 20:21.053
A TREND, AND AS THE INDUSTRY

20:21.053 --> 20:22.354
MATURES, AS IT GROWS, YOU'RE

20:22.354 --> 20:23.656
GOING TO SEE MANY MORE

20:23.656 --> 20:25.458
ORGANIZING EFFORTS AT SIMILAR

20:25.458 --> 20:26.892
DIGITAL MEDIA COMPANIES.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.060
>> PLACING LIKE HUFFINGTON POST

20:28.060 --> 20:29.395
OR VOX MEDIA.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.696
THIS IS GOING TO BECOME THE NEW

20:30.696 --> 20:31.730
NORMAL, PERHAPS?

20:31.730 --> 20:33.833
>> I WOULD SAY THERE ARE A FEW

20:33.833 --> 20:36.302
THINGS THAT WERE UNUSUAL ABOUT

20:36.302 --> 20:38.571
THE GAWKER UNION VOTE THAT YOU

20:38.571 --> 20:40.206
MIGHT NOT-- THAT MIGHT NOT BE

20:40.206 --> 20:41.841
THE CASE FOR OTHER COMPANIES.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.375
>> WHAT WERE THEY?

20:43.375 --> 20:45.478
>> SO, THE ENTIRE VOTE AT GAWKER

20:45.478 --> 20:47.546
ACTUALLY WAS REALLY AS YOUY'S.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.381
USUALLY WHEN WORKERS ANNOUNCE AN

20:49.381 --> 20:51.484
AYERST TO ORGANIZE, THERE IS A

20:51.484 --> 20:52.885
CONCERTED CAMPAIGN ON THE PART

20:52.885 --> 20:55.154
OF MANAGEMENT TO CONVINCE

20:55.154 --> 20:57.223
WORKERS NOT TO ORGANIZE.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.457
BUT YOU REALLY SAW NONE OF THAT

20:58.457 --> 20:59.925
IN THIS CASE.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.261
MANAGEMENT TOOK A RELATIVELY

21:02.261 --> 21:05.264
HANDS-OFF APPROACH, AND SORT OF

21:05.264 --> 21:06.565
IN KEEPING WITH GAWKER'S

21:06.565 --> 21:08.000
CULTURE, WITH THEIR COMMITMENT

21:08.000 --> 21:09.702
TO RADICAL TRANSPARENCY,

21:09.702 --> 21:11.804
EMPLOYEES DEBATED OPENLY ABOUT

21:11.804 --> 21:13.772
THE BENEFITS AND DOWNSIDE OF

21:13.772 --> 21:17.476
ORGANIZING ON GAWKER'S OWN SITE

21:17.476 --> 21:19.445
IN PUBLIC VIEW UPON NOT TO SAY

21:19.445 --> 21:20.880
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY PROBLEMS.
