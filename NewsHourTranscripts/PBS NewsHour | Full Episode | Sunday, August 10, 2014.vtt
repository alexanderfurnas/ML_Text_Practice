BATTLEFIELD DEFEAT FOR ISLAMIC

MILITANTS WHO HAVE CAPTURED

00:46.546 --> 00:47.714
LARGE PORTIONS OF THE NORTH AND

00:47.714 --> 00:48.916
WEST OF THE COUNTRY WITH LITTLE

00:48.916 --> 00:50.250
RESISTANCE THE PAST FEW MONTHS.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.551
KURDISH FIGHTERS REPORTEDLY

00:51.551 --> 00:52.886
FORCED THE JIHADISTS TO RETREAT

00:52.886 --> 00:54.421

00:54.421 --> 00:58.225
ABOUT 30 MILES FROM ERBIL.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.326
MANY AMERICANS ARE IN ERBIL.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.661
RESPONDING TO THE GROWING CRISIS

01:00.661 --> 01:01.862
IN NORTHERN IRAQ, THE STATE

01:03.230 --> 01:04.498
PERSONNEL FROM THE U.S.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.067
CONSULATE IN ERBIL.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.035
THE U.S. HAD MOVED SOME

01:08.035 --> 01:10.404
PERSONNEL FROM BAGHDAD TO ERBIL

01:10.404 --> 01:11.505
JUST TWO MONTHS AGO, BECAUSE OF

01:11.505 --> 01:12.439
THE DETERIORATING SECURITY

01:12.439 --> 01:15.309
SITUATION NEAR THE CAPITAL.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.410
EARLIER TODAY, U.S. WARPLANES

01:24.451 --> 01:25.953
MINORITY RELIGIOUS GROUP WHO HAD

01:25.953 --> 01:27.554
FLED THE AREA IN THE FACE OF THE

01:27.554 --> 01:29.423
ISLAMIC STATE ADVANCE.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.224
THE YAZIDIS TOOK REFUGE ON A

01:31.224 --> 01:32.759
MOUNTAIN, WHERE THOUSANDS OF

01:32.759 --> 01:34.461
THEM ARE STILL STRANDED WITH

01:34.461 --> 01:35.963
LITTLE FOOD OR WATER.

WE HAVE A REPORT FROM JONATHAN

01:45.572 --> 01:46.273
FAMILIES CALL HOME.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.709
>> THEY ARE CAMPING UNDER THE

01:48.709 --> 01:51.111
CONCRETE, AFTER ESCAPING THE

01:51.111 --> 01:51.845
JIHADIST ADVANCE WITH THE

01:51.845 --> 01:53.547
CLOTHES ON THEIR BACKS AND

01:53.547 --> 01:56.083
NOTHING MORE.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.819
SWINGING FROM BUILDING WOOD IS

01:58.819 --> 02:00.687
BABY UNI, JUST SIX MONTHS OLD.

HIS MOTHER TOLD ME ISLAMIC

02:06.660 --> 02:09.229
STATE FIGHTERS HAVE CAPTURED HER

02:09.229 --> 02:10.764
HUSBAND IN SINJAR AND THAT SHE

02:10.764 --> 02:12.132
AND HER FOUR CHILDREN COULD

02:12.132 --> 02:15.869
NEVER GO BACK THERE.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.904
>> HAS SIMILAR SAYS THE

02:17.904 --> 02:18.872
JIHADISTS HAVE TAKEN HIS SON.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.440
>> HE WILL EITHER BE CONVERTED

02:20.440 --> 02:22.909
TO ISLAM OR KILLED, HE SAYS.

02:22.909 --> 02:25.012
WE CAN'T LIVE WITH THE ARABS

02:25.012 --> 02:25.912
ANYMORE.

02:25.912 --> 02:28.181
>> AND THIS IS HALI.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.117
>> EXHAUSTED AFTER HER NINE HOUR

02:30.117 --> 02:32.352
TREK DOWN FROM SINJAR MOUNTAIN.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.888
>> ALL HER RELATIVES ARE MISSING

02:34.888 --> 02:37.190
AND PRESUMED DEAD.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.526
>> FROM HIS MOBILE PHONE, HE

MANAGES TO GET THROUGH TO HIS

02:41.661 --> 02:42.829
COUSIN, STILL TRAPPED ON THE

02:42.829 --> 02:44.131
MOUNTAIN.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.767
>> RIGHT NOW, THERE ARE CHILDREN

02:46.767 --> 02:48.568
DYING HE IS TOLD.

02:48.568 --> 02:50.170
OUR ARAB NEIGHBORS HAVE BETRAYED

02:50.170 --> 02:52.539
US, THE WORLD HAS DESERTED US.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.574
>> AND THOSE WHO HAVE ESCAPED TO

02:54.574 --> 02:56.910
THIS BUILDING SITE WITH ALMOST

02:56.910 --> 02:58.812
NOTHING ARE DESPERATELY WAITING

02:58.812 --> 02:59.913
FOR NEWS.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.248
AMID THE FRANTIC CHANTING OF

03:01.248 --> 03:02.416
MOBILE PHONES.

03:02.416 --> 03:04.718
>> SO THAT NEWS CAN GET THROUGH.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.086
>> THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOT ONLY

03:06.086 --> 03:07.621
FLED FOR THEIR LIVES, BUT MANY

03:07.621 --> 03:10.023
OF THEM HAVE LEFT THEIR

03:10.023 --> 03:12.225
RELATIVES MISSING OR DEAD BEHIND

03:12.225 --> 03:13.060
THEM.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.463
>> THEY HAVE ALMOST NOTHING TO

03:16.463 --> 03:18.965
EAT AND UNLESS RELIEF

03:18.965 --> 03:19.800
INTERNATIONAL RELIEF AGENCIES

03:19.800 --> 03:21.835
GET HERE SOON THIS HUMANITARIAN

03:21.835 --> 03:23.336
DISASTER COULD SIGNIFICANTLY

03:23.336 --> 03:24.504
WORSEN.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.174
A PICTURE THEN OF IRAQ'S YAZIDI

03:27.174 --> 03:28.608
COMMUNITY, EXHAUSTED AFTER

03:28.608 --> 03:32.279
WALKING FOR MILES, PERSECUTED TO

03:32.279 --> 03:35.682
THE BRINK OF EXTERMINATION HERE,

03:35.682 --> 03:38.718
EVEN AMID HUH, EVEN IF

03:38.718 --> 03:40.754
HUMANITARIAN AND MILITARY HELP

03:40.754 --> 03:44.057
TURN THE TIDE.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.392
>> Sreenivasan: FOR MORE ABOUT

03:45.392 --> 03:46.359
THIS, WE ARE JOINED ONCE AGAIN

03:46.359 --> 03:47.294
TONIGHT FROM WASHINGTON BY

03:47.294 --> 03:48.795
DOUGLAS OLLIVANT.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.163
HE IS A SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY

03:50.163 --> 03:51.264
STUDIES FELLOW AT THE NEW

03:51.264 --> 03:52.399
AMERICA FOUNDATION AND A PARTNER

03:52.399 --> 03:53.800
AT MANTID INTERNATIONAL.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.101
>> THE QUESTION WE HAVE REFERRED

03:54.101 --> 03:54.401
TO THEM AS MILITANTS, AS

03:54.401 --> 03:54.701
FIGHTERS, AS JIHADISTS BUT

03:54.701 --> 03:55.969
CONSIDERING SOME OF THE

03:55.969 --> 03:57.237
BRUTALITY THAT WE ARE HEARING

03:57.237 --> 04:00.040
REPORTS OF, OF THE BURYING

04:00.040 --> 04:03.210
PEOPLE ALIVE IN MASS GRAVES AND

04:03.210 --> 04:04.911
INDISCRIMINATELY SHOOTING THEM,

04:04.911 --> 04:06.113
IT SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT

04:06.113 --> 04:06.346
DIFFERENT.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.914
>> THEY ARE DIFFERENT, I MEAN,

04:07.914 --> 04:10.283
THEY ARE ISLAMIST TERRORISTS,

04:10.283 --> 04:12.219
THEY ARE ISLAMIST FIGHTERS BUT

04:12.219 --> 04:14.421
THERE IS THIS CORE BRUTALITY TO

04:14.421 --> 04:17.157
THEM, SOMETHING THAT REMINDS US

04:17.157 --> 04:21.061
OF ALMOST KHMERROUGE

04:21.061 --> 04:22.162
EXTERMINATION, THEIR TACTICS,

04:22.162 --> 04:25.065
THEIR TERROR, THE DESTRUCTION OF

04:25.065 --> 04:27.100
CULTURAL HERITAGE, THE RAPE, THE

04:27.100 --> 04:30.003
SLAVE MARKETS WE HEAR, THE

04:30.003 --> 04:31.771
BURYING ALIVE, WE HAVEN'T HEARD

04:31.771 --> 04:33.807
ANY STORIES OF CRUCIFIXIONS IN

04:33.807 --> 04:35.308
IRAQ BUT CERTAINLY WE HAVE SEEN

04:35.308 --> 04:37.277
IT IN SYRIA BY THIS GROUP, THE

04:37.277 --> 04:40.080
ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ AND SYRIA

04:40.080 --> 04:42.549
OR ISIL OR THE ISLAMIC STATE,

04:42.549 --> 04:43.650
THEY ARE SOMETHING VERY

04:43.650 --> 04:44.651
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

04:44.651 --> 04:45.452
BEFORE.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.686
>> AND THEY VERY HAVE BEEN CLEAR

04:46.686 --> 04:47.787
ABOUT EXACTLY WHO THEY WANT TO

04:47.787 --> 04:49.322
TARGET AND EVEN THE GEOGRAPHIC

04:49.322 --> 04:51.124
AREA OF WHAT THEY WANT, I MEAN

04:51.124 --> 04:53.460
IN IS THE CAL FAT, AN EMPIRE

04:53.460 --> 04:54.361
THEY WANT TO RESURRECT.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.428
>> RIGHT.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.831
WELL, THEY DECLARED THE ISLAMIC

04:57.831 --> 04:59.666
STATE A FEW WEEKS AGO SO NOW

04:59.666 --> 05:02.235
EVIDENTLY THEY THINK THEY RULE

05:02.235 --> 05:03.336
ALL MUSLIM AREAS FROM THE WEST

05:03.336 --> 05:05.372
END OF EAST AFRICA AND SPAIN ALL

05:05.372 --> 05:07.307
THE WAY TO INDONESIA.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.775
>> BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT, THERE

05:08.775 --> 05:10.877
WERE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND IRAQ

05:10.877 --> 05:13.446
IN THE LEVANT, YOU LOOK THERE IT

05:13.446 --> 05:15.115
IS VERY CLEAR THEY WANT JORDAN,

05:15.115 --> 05:16.850
THEY WANT LEBANON, THEY WANT

05:16.850 --> 05:17.951
ISRAEL, THE NORTHERN PART OF

05:17.951 --> 05:19.052
SAUDI ARABIA, THE SOUTHERN PART

05:19.052 --> 05:20.720
OF TURKEY, THEY ARE VERY CLEAR

05:20.720 --> 05:21.388
ABOUT THEIR WAR AIMS.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.123
>> AND EITHER THE FRENCH BORN

05:23.123 --> 05:24.457
MINISTER HAD A QUOTE IN THE

05:24.457 --> 05:25.725
PRESS, WE ARE NOT FIGHTING A

05:25.725 --> 05:27.360
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, WE ARE

05:27.360 --> 05:28.461
FIGHTING A TERRORIST STATE, DOES

05:28.461 --> 05:29.396
THAT CHANGE HOW THE

05:29.396 --> 05:30.297
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY RESPONDS

05:30.297 --> 05:31.064
TO THIS?

05:31.064 --> 05:32.365
>> I THINK IT ABSOLUTELY HAS TO,

05:32.365 --> 05:33.400
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.436
THIS IS NO LONGER A TERROR SAFE

05:36.436 --> 05:38.471
HAVEN WITHIN A STATE, IT IS A DE

05:38.471 --> 05:40.073
FACTO STATE THAT IS A TERRORIST

05:40.073 --> 05:40.774
SAFE HAVEN.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.642
AND, AGAIN, GIVEN THE BRUTALITY

05:42.642 --> 05:46.213
OF THIS GROUP, AND THEIR CLEAR

05:46.213 --> 05:47.480
LONG-TERM AIMS, WE DO NEED TO

05:47.480 --> 05:48.748
TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY, RIGHT NOW

05:48.748 --> 05:50.116
THEY ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT THEY

05:50.116 --> 05:54.120
CALL THE NEAR ENEMY, THE MALIKI

05:54.120 --> 05:56.489
AND ASSAD REGIMES BUT THIS TURN

05:56.489 --> 05:57.657
TO THE KURDS TO THE NORTHEAST

05:57.657 --> 05:58.658
DEMONSTRATE THAT'S NOT ALL THEY

05:58.658 --> 05:59.693
ARE FOCUSED ON.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.562
>> TODAY IT WAS KURDISTAN, IF I

06:02.562 --> 06:03.396
WERE JORDAN OR LEBANON I WOULD

06:03.396 --> 06:04.331
BE CONCERNED.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.432
>> EVEN IF THE POLITICIANS ARE

06:05.432 --> 06:07.334
ABLE TO AGREE IN BAGHDAD WHAT IS

06:07.334 --> 06:10.270
TO KEEP THE FORCES ON THE GROUND

06:10.270 --> 06:11.905
FROM TURNING AWAY AND RUNNING

06:11.905 --> 06:13.707
LIKE THEY DID IN THE NORTH, IN

06:13.707 --> 06:14.708
PREVIOUS OCCASIONS?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.409
>> WELL, ONE, I THINK NOW THEY

06:16.409 --> 06:19.412
HAVE SEEN WHAT ISIS IS AND THE

06:19.412 --> 06:20.847
THREAT IT REPRESENTS TO THEIR

06:20.847 --> 06:22.249
COUNTRIES SO HOPEFULLY THAT HAS

06:22.249 --> 06:23.950
PUT MORE BACKBONE INTO THE

06:23.950 --> 06:24.751
FORCES.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.119
WE STILL DON'T ENTIRELY

06:26.119 --> 06:27.520
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED IN

06:27.520 --> 06:31.024
NORTH, SOME COMBINATION OF

06:31.024 --> 06:33.126
INFILTRATION, DESERTIONS, GHOST

06:33.126 --> 06:34.861
SOLDIERS, LOTS OF CORRUPTION,

06:34.861 --> 06:36.796
POOR LEADERSHIP, LOTS OF THINGS

06:36.796 --> 06:37.797
HAPPENED IN THE DISSOLVING OF

06:37.797 --> 06:39.332
THE FORCES IN THE NORTH.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.736
WHAT WE CAN HOPE FOR NOW IS FOR

06:42.736 --> 06:43.903
MORE RELIABLE UNITS TO COME FROM

06:43.903 --> 06:46.640
THE SOUTH FROM THE IRAQI ARMY,

06:46.640 --> 06:49.609
FOR THE KURDISH TO COME FROM THE

06:49.609 --> 06:50.710
NORTHEAST, PERHAPS NOT AS

06:50.710 --> 06:51.878
RELIABLE AS WE WERE ONCE TOLD

06:51.878 --> 06:53.179
THAT MAY BE FOR LACK OF

06:53.179 --> 06:54.381
AMMUNITION AND WEAPONS AND FOR

06:54.381 --> 06:58.151
THE SUNNIS THEMSELVES TO ASS A

06:58.151 --> 06:59.986
FIFTH COLUMN ON BEHALF OF THE

06:59.986 --> 07:01.121
IRAQI GOVERNMENT .. INSIDE THESE

07:01.121 --> 07:02.589
AREAS THAT WILL BE THE

07:02.589 --> 07:03.757
BATTLEGROUNDS AS SOME FIERCE

07:03.757 --> 07:05.125
FIGHT WILLING HAVE TO TAKE PLACE

07:05.125 --> 07:07.427
IN MOSUL, FALLUJAH AND OTHER

07:07.427 --> 07:08.862
CITIES IF IRAQIS ARE GOING TO

07:08.862 --> 07:09.829
RETAKE THIS LAND FROM THE

07:09.829 --> 07:10.563
ISLAMIC STATE.

07:10.563 --> 07:15.068
>> AND WHERE DO THE KURDS OR THE

07:15.068 --> 07:16.770
PESHAWAR GET THAT AMMUNITION IF

07:16.770 --> 07:17.937
THEY ARE TO LAUNCH A FIGHT?

07:17.937 --> 07:19.172
>> THEY WILL HAVE TO CUT A DEAL

07:19.172 --> 07:20.073
WITH BAGHDAD.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.441
IT IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO

07:21.441 --> 07:23.743
ARM THE PESHAWAR DIRECTLY, FOR

07:23.743 --> 07:25.445
THE UNITED STATES TO DO THAT,

07:25.445 --> 07:26.780
BECAUSE OUR LAWS AS I UNDERSTAND

07:26.780 --> 07:28.214
THEM DON'T ALLOW US TO GIVE

07:28.214 --> 07:29.816
MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO A SUB

07:29.816 --> 07:31.551
STATE GROUP IT HAS TO COME

07:31.551 --> 07:33.753
THROUGH A STATE AND GO THROUGH

07:33.753 --> 07:37.023
THEIR MINISTRY OF DEFENSE OR,

07:37.023 --> 07:38.224
BAGHDAD WILL HAVE TO PLAY A

07:38.224 --> 07:39.592
ROLE IN FACILITATING THE ARMING

07:39.592 --> 07:40.460
OF THE KURDS.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.195
FORTUNATELY IT LOOKS LIKE THEY

07:42.195 --> 07:43.430
SEE THAT MAY WELL BE IN THEIR

07:43.430 --> 07:44.698
INTEREST.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.733
>> DOUGLAS OLLIVANT JOINING US

07:46.733 --> 07:47.267
FROM WASHINGTON.

07:47.267 --> 07:47.834
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

07:47.834 --> 07:48.668
>> THANK YOU, HARRY.

07:48.668 --> 07:52.072

07:52.072 --> 07:53.606
>>

07:53.606 --> 07:54.774
>> Sreenivasan: ISRAEL AND HAMAS

07:54.774 --> 07:56.309
TODAY ACCEPTED AN EGYPTIAN PLAN

07:56.309 --> 07:57.444
FOR ANOTHER 72-HOUR CEASE-FIRE,

07:57.444 --> 07:59.012
AND ISRAEL SAID IT'S NEGOTIATORS

07:59.012 --> 08:00.213
WOULD RETURN TO CAIRO TOMORROW

08:00.213 --> 08:01.648
FOR NEGOTIATIONS ABOUT A LONGER-

08:01.648 --> 08:02.816
TERM PEACE PLAN, IF THE TRUCE

08:02.816 --> 08:03.783
HOLDS UNTIL THEN.

08:03.783 --> 08:04.951
EARLIER TODAY, AT THE WEEKLY

08:04.951 --> 08:06.152
CABINET MEETING, PRIME MINISTER

08:06.152 --> 08:07.520
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAID ISRAEL'S

08:07.520 --> 08:11.925
MILITARY OPERATION IN GAZA WOULD

08:11.925 --> 08:13.460
CONTINUE UNTIL IT MET IT'S GOAL,

08:13.460 --> 08:14.694
WHICH HE SAID WAS, QUOTING NOW,

08:14.694 --> 08:15.729
"THE RESTORATION OF QUIET FOR A

08:15.729 --> 08:17.230
LONG PERIOD."

08:17.230 --> 08:18.365
IN TURKEY TODAY, TENS OF

08:18.365 --> 08:19.499
MILLIONS OF VOTERS TURNED OUT

08:19.499 --> 08:20.834
FOR THE NATION'S FIRST DIRECT

08:20.834 --> 08:22.035
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

08:22.035 --> 08:22.902
AND THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN PRIME

08:22.902 --> 08:24.003
MINISTER FOR 11 YEARS, TAYYIP

08:24.003 --> 08:25.372
ERDOGAN WON WITH JUST MORE THAN

08:25.372 --> 08:26.373
50%.

08:26.373 --> 08:27.540
THAT MEANS THERE WILL BE NO

08:27.540 --> 08:28.742
RUNOFF LATER THIS MONTH.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.110
TURKEY IS A MEMBER OF NATO AND A

08:30.110 --> 08:31.444
KEY ALLY OF THE UNITED STATES IN

08:31.444 --> 08:32.712
THE REGION.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.147
A TOP WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION

08:34.147 --> 08:36.282
OFFICIAL SAID TODAY HE THOUGHT

08:36.282 --> 08:37.550
IT VERY UNLIKELY THAT THERE

08:37.550 --> 08:39.519
WOULD BE A MAJOR EBOLA OUTBREAK

08:39.519 --> 08:40.854
IN THE UNITED STATES DESPITE

08:40.854 --> 08:42.288
PEOPLE FLYING INTO THIS COUNTRY

08:42.288 --> 08:43.590
FROM LIBERIA, SIERRA LEONE AND

08:43.590 --> 08:45.291
GUINEA, THREE WEST AFRICAN

08:45.291 --> 08:46.459
NATIONS WHERE NEARLY ONE

08:46.459 --> 08:48.261
THOUSAND PEOPLE HAVE DIED.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.263
>> IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MAY

08:50.263 --> 08:51.297
HAVE SOME FEW CASES ASSOCIATED

08:51.297 --> 08:52.432
WITH THAT, FEW INFECTIONS.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.268
I THINK THAT IN THOSE COUNTRIES

08:55.268 --> 09:00.707
WHICH REALLY HAVE GOOD HEALTH

09:00.707 --> 09:02.175
SYSTEMS, GOOD HEALTH

09:02.175 --> 09:03.676
PROFESSIONALS GOOD SURVEILLANCE

09:03.676 --> 09:04.677
SYSTEMS IT'S VERY UNLIKELY THAT

09:04.677 --> 09:05.745
YOU WOULD HAVE LARGE OUTBREAKS

09:05.745 --> 09:06.980
IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE SEEING

09:06.980 --> 09:08.014
THEM IN THESE COUNTRIES RIGHT

09:08.014 --> 09:11.584
NOW.

09:11.584 --> 09:12.419
>> Sreenivasan: IN THIS COUNTRY:

09:12.419 --> 09:13.620
OUTSIDE SAINT LOUIS LAST NIGHT,

09:13.620 --> 09:14.721
DEMONSTRATORS GATHERED TO

09:14.721 --> 09:16.022
PROTEST THE FATAL SHOOTING BY

09:16.022 --> 09:17.056
POLICE OF AN UNARMED AFRICAN-

09:17.056 --> 09:18.291
AMERICAN TEEN.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.426
THE LOCAL CHAPTER OF THE

09:19.426 --> 09:20.493
N.A.A.C.P. IS CALLING FOR A

09:20.493 --> 09:21.861
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION.

09:21.861 --> 09:23.630
THE OFFICER WHO FIRED THE FATAL

09:23.630 --> 09:25.365
SHOT HAS BEEN PLACED ON PAID

09:25.365 --> 09:26.633
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.067
POLICE SAID TODAY THAT THE

09:28.067 --> 09:29.502
SHOOTING OCCURRED AFTER THE TEEN

09:29.502 --> 09:30.770
ASSAULTED THE OFFICER AND

09:30.770 --> 09:31.971
REACHED FOR THE OFFICER'S GUN.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.306
POLICE IN MIAMI ARE TRYING TO

09:33.306 --> 09:34.441
DETERMINE IF THE FATAL SHOOTING

09:34.441 --> 09:35.475
OF A RABBI YESTERDAY WAS A HATE

09:35.475 --> 09:36.576
CRIME.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.178
JOSEPH RAKSIN WAS GUNNED DOWN EN

09:38.178 --> 09:41.114
ROUTE TO A SYNAGOGUE.

09:41.114 --> 09:43.416
EVEN THOUGH THE INCIDENT

09:43.416 --> 09:44.684
OCCURRED IN AN AREA NEAR NORTH

09:44.684 --> 09:45.952
MIAMI BEACH, WHERE SWASTIKAS

09:45.952 --> 09:47.520
WERE PAINTED ON A SYNAGOGUE LAST

09:47.520 --> 09:49.189
MONTH, AS OF NOW, POLICE SAY THE

09:49.189 --> 09:50.824
EVIDENCE POINTS TO A BOTCHED

09:50.824 --> 09:52.091
ROBBERY.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.326
AND ONE OF AMERICA'S TOP RACE

09:53.326 --> 09:54.794
CAR DRIVERS, TONY STEWART,

09:54.794 --> 09:56.329
WITHDREW FROM AN EVENT TODAY

09:56.329 --> 09:57.597
AFTER THE CAR HE WAS DRIVING

09:57.597 --> 09:59.032
DURING A RACE LAST NIGHT IN

09:59.032 --> 10:00.667
UPSTATE NEW YORK HIT AND KILLED

10:00.667 --> 10:02.335
ANOTHER DRIVER.

10:02.335 --> 10:03.470
THE INCIDENT OCCURRED LESS THAN

10:03.470 --> 10:05.338
A MINUTE AFTER STEWART'S CAR

10:05.338 --> 10:06.840
APPARENTLY BUMPED THE CAR DRIVEN

10:06.840 --> 10:07.974
BY KEVIN WARD JUNIOR, CAUSING

10:07.974 --> 10:13.346
WARD TO SPIN OUT AND CRASH INTO

10:13.346 --> 10:14.581
A WALL.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.515
WARD THEN LEFT HIS CAR,

10:15.515 --> 10:18.218
EVIDENTLY TO CONFRONT STEWART AS

10:18.218 --> 10:19.352
HE CAME BACK AROUND.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.354
THAT'S WHEN STEWART'S CAR HIT

10:21.354 --> 10:22.989
HIM.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.524
AUTHORITIES ARE INVESTIGATING

10:24.524 --> 10:33.933
THE INCIDENT.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.602
A STORY PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS

10:35.602 --> 10:36.970
WEEK IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

10:36.970 --> 10:38.104
GOT OUR ATTENTION.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.939
IT DESCRIBED A GALLUP POLL

10:39.939 --> 10:41.074
MEASURING HOW STUDENT LOAN DEBTS

10:41.074 --> 10:42.509
UNDERMINE THE HAPPINESS AND

10:42.509 --> 10:44.377
WELL-BEING OF BORROWERS YEARS

10:44.377 --> 10:46.813
AFTER THEY GRADUATE COLLEGE.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.281
YESTERDAY, I INTERVIEWED THE

10:48.281 --> 10:49.716
AUTHOR OF THE PIECE, DOUGLAS

10:49.716 --> 10:53.219
BELKIN, WHO JOINED US FROM

10:53.219 --> 10:55.054
CHICAGO.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.389
I BEGAN BY ASKING HIM HOW GALLUP

10:56.389 --> 10:57.257
DEFINED WELL-BEING.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.324
>> GALLUP CAME UP WITH THIS

10:58.324 --> 10:59.659
WELL-BEING INDEX 30 YEARS AGO

10:59.659 --> 11:00.527
AND THEY HAVE A SERIES OF

11:00.527 --> 11:02.428
QUESTIONS THAT LOOKS LIKE SENSE

11:02.428 --> 11:05.164
OF PURPOSE IN LIFE, IF YOU

11:05.164 --> 11:06.199
CONNECTED TO YOUR JOB, HOW WELL

11:06.199 --> 11:08.234
YOU FEEL PHYSICALLY IF YOU HAVE

11:08.234 --> 11:09.369
A LOT OF ENERGY, IF YOU ARE

11:09.369 --> 11:10.436
CONNECTED TO YOUR COMMUNITY IF

11:10.436 --> 11:12.005
YOU ARE CONNECTED, IF YOU HAVE

11:12.005 --> 11:12.805
GOOD SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, SORT

11:12.805 --> 11:15.174
OF A LOT OF SOFTBALL QUESTIONS

11:15.174 --> 11:16.576
LIKE THAT AND ASKED THEM AND

11:16.576 --> 11:18.011
THEY CORRELATE IT WITH HOW MUCH

11:18.011 --> 11:19.913
DEBT YOU HAVE, AND THEY DID

11:19.913 --> 11:24.684
THIS FOR THE 30,000 COLLEGE

11:24.684 --> 11:25.752
GRADUATES, THESE QUESTIONS IN

11:25.752 --> 11:26.786
MARCH AND IT TURNS OUT THAT

11:26.786 --> 11:29.822
EVEN 25 YEARS AFTER YOU HAVE

11:29.822 --> 11:31.791
GRADUATED THE MORE DEBT YOU

11:31.791 --> 11:34.394
CARRIED WHEN YOU GRADUATED, THE

11:34.394 --> 11:35.995
MORE POORLY YOU SCORED ON THOSE

11:35.995 --> 11:38.298
QUESTIONS LATER ON.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.799
>> SO THEY SAID THEY FELT LESS

11:39.799 --> 11:41.234
PHYSICALLY FIT, LESS CONNECTED

11:41.234 --> 11:43.303
TO THEIR JOB, THEIR FAMILY?

11:43.303 --> 11:45.638
HOW BAD IS IT?

11:45.638 --> 11:47.707
>> IT IS WORSE THAN YOU THINK.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.775
THE INTERESTING PART ABOUT THIS,

11:48.775 --> 11:50.677
TO ME, WAS THAT IT CARRIES ON SO

11:50.677 --> 11:52.679
MUCH LONGER.

11:52.679 --> 11:55.181
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHY, I

11:55.181 --> 11:56.783
THINK, BUT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT

11:56.783 --> 11:58.885
DIFFERENCE OF 15 POINTS IN TERMS

11:58.885 --> 12:00.153
OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, THE

12:00.153 --> 12:01.788
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO FEEL

12:01.788 --> 12:03.389
PHYSICALLY FIT, FOR INSTANCE, OR

12:03.389 --> 12:07.093
HAVE A PURPOSE IN THEIR JOB.

12:07.093 --> 12:09.395
SO FOLKS WHO HAVE A STRONG

12:09.395 --> 12:10.830
ANSWER FOR WHAT EXACTLY IS

12:10.830 --> 12:12.265
HAPPENING, EXCEPT IF YOU GET OUT

12:12.265 --> 12:14.267
OF SCHOOL AND OWE A LOT OF MONEY

12:14.267 --> 12:16.469
YOUR OPTIONS ARE LIMITED, YOU

12:16.469 --> 12:18.471
OWE THAT, FIVE OR 6,000 BUCKS

12:18.471 --> 12:21.374
AND YOU WANT TO TAKE A JOB,

12:21.374 --> 12:22.475
MAYBE IN THE HELPING SERVICES OR

12:22.475 --> 12:24.510
HELPING PEOPLE, THAT YOU ARE

12:24.510 --> 12:26.212
DRAWN TOWARD A JOB THAT PAYS

12:26.212 --> 12:27.680
BETTER, YOU LIKE LESS, THESE

12:27.680 --> 12:29.549
SORT OF THINGS INFLUENCE

12:29.549 --> 12:30.617
DECISIONS, YOU KNOW, FOR YEARS.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.286
>> AND IS THERE A TIPPING POINT

12:33.286 --> 12:34.520
NUMBER OF STUDENT DEBT THAT

12:34.520 --> 12:36.155
MAKES PEOPLE WORSE IN IS IT

12:36.155 --> 12:37.290
$25,000?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.257
$50,000?

12:38.257 --> 12:40.493
>> AROUND $25,000 THE NUMBERS

12:40.493 --> 12:42.161
START TO LOOK BLEAKER.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.796
THE AVERAGE DEBT RIGHT NOW FOR A

12:43.796 --> 12:46.599
GRADUATE OF COLLEGE IS 33,000, A

12:46.599 --> 12:48.301
LITTLE OVER $33,000.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.836
AND THAT IS FOR THE 70 ODD

12:49.836 --> 12:51.270
PERCENT OF KIDS WHO GRADUATE

12:51.270 --> 12:53.373
WITH DEBT.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.942
THIS SURVEY LOOKED AT COLLEGE

12:55.942 --> 12:58.978
GRADUATES FOR DECADES, IT PEOPLE

12:58.978 --> 13:00.680
WHO GRADUATED BEFORE 1990 TOOK

13:00.680 --> 13:04.250
OUT SO LITTLE DEBT, THIS SURVEY

13:04.250 --> 13:08.921
LOOKED JUST AT 1990 FORWARD,

13:08.921 --> 13:11.024
RIGHT NOW, THE NUMBERS WERE

13:11.024 --> 13:14.727
WORSE AT $50,000 PLUS, 33-6 OR

13:14.727 --> 13:15.828
33-4, WHERE KIDS ARE GRADUATING

13:15.828 --> 13:16.996
ON AVERAGE NOW HAS ALMOST

13:16.996 --> 13:18.564
DOUBLED IN TEN YEARS AND

13:18.564 --> 13:19.899
PROBABLY GOING TO HIT 50,000

13:19.899 --> 13:21.367
EVENTUALLY.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.301
>> LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

13:22.301 --> 13:24.037
CORRELATION VERSUS CAUSATION,

13:24.037 --> 13:26.305
THESE ARE SUBJECTIVE ANSWERS

13:26.305 --> 13:27.840
THESE PEOPLE ARE GIVING, WHAT

13:27.840 --> 13:28.675
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THERE ARE

13:28.675 --> 13:30.276
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T TAKE OUT DEBT

13:30.276 --> 13:31.277
WERE MAYBE WEALTHIER AND HAPPIER

13:31.277 --> 13:32.211
TO START WITH.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.012
>> THAT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE,

13:33.012 --> 13:34.380
THIS SURVEY DOESN'T AND CAN'T

13:34.380 --> 13:35.648
LOOK AT THAT.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.749
IT ISN'T KNOWN IF THIS IS

13:36.749 --> 13:42.655
CAUSAL OR CORRELATIONAL.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.556
IF YOU ARE JUST MORE ENGAGED

13:43.556 --> 13:45.191
IN LIFE AND MORE UPBEAT YOU DO

13:45.191 --> 13:47.393
BETTER, IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THAT

13:47.393 --> 13:50.430
IS BECAUSE -- IT IS NOT CLEAR

13:50.430 --> 13:52.031
HOW THAT STANDS LATER ON IN

13:52.031 --> 13:53.366
LIFE.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.034
>> AND THEN WHAT ABOUT THE IDEA

13:55.034 --> 13:56.969
OF THE THINGS THAT THE DEBT

13:56.969 --> 13:57.904
MIGHT COMPROMISE IN YOUR LIFE,

13:57.904 --> 13:59.439
IF YOU HAVE A HUGE STUDENT DEBT,

13:59.439 --> 14:02.041
MAYBE YOU ARE PUTTING OFF BUYING

14:02.041 --> 14:04.010
A HOUSE OR ANOTHER MAJOR

14:04.010 --> 14:05.111
PURCHASE AND THAT GIVE YOU SOME

14:05.111 --> 14:06.279
TENSION, TEN, 15 YEARS DOWN THE

14:06.279 --> 14:07.447
LINE.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.248
>> YES IF YOU HAVE BIG DEBT AND

14:09.248 --> 14:11.184
CAN'T SAVE ENOUGH FOR A HOUSE.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.886
RIGHT NOW KIDS ARE PUTTING

14:13.886 --> 14:14.620
OFF BUYING HOUSES MUCH LONGER

14:14.620 --> 14:16.456
THAN THEY WERE, A DECADE OR TWO

14:16.456 --> 14:17.457
AGO, THEY ARE PUTTING OFF

14:17.457 --> 14:18.591
MARRIAGE AND CHILDREN AS WELL,

14:18.591 --> 14:21.360
FURTHERMORE, YOU MAY PAY OFF THE

14:21.360 --> 14:23.196
DEBT AND MOVE INTO A HOUSE BUT

14:23.196 --> 14:24.197
YOU DIDN'T START SAVING ON

14:24.197 --> 14:26.899
RETIREMENT BECAUSE YOU WERE

14:26.899 --> 14:27.934
FOCUSED ON PAYING OFF YOUR DEBT

14:27.934 --> 14:28.968
SO THAT ADDS STRESS TO YOUR LIFE

14:28.968 --> 14:31.904
IN 40s AND 50S.

14:31.904 --> 14:33.473
>> IS, IS THERE A TAKE AWAY

14:33.473 --> 14:34.407
LESSON?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.676
LET'S SAY I AM A PARENT OF A

14:36.676 --> 14:37.877
CHILD ABOUT TO GO INTO COLLEGE

14:37.877 --> 14:39.479
OR ABOUT TO ENTER COLLEGE

14:39.479 --> 14:40.947
MYSELF, IS THERE SOME WAY I

14:40.947 --> 14:42.181
SHOULD STRUCTURE MY DEBT

14:42.181 --> 14:43.082
THINKING FORWARD, THIS MAY MAKE

14:43.082 --> 14:44.083
ME MORE OR LESS HAPPY?

14:44.083 --> 14:46.018
>> I THINK IT IS AN ANTECEDENT

14:46.018 --> 14:49.088
TO STRUCTURING YOUR DEBT AND

14:49.088 --> 14:50.022
YOUR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE, 20

14:50.022 --> 14:51.457
YEARS AGO, THE CONVENTIONAL

14:51.457 --> 14:53.059
WISDOM WAS YOU TAKE OUT AS MUCH

14:53.059 --> 14:54.260
DEBT AS YOU NEED OR YOU GO TO

14:54.260 --> 14:55.862
THE BEST SCHOOL YOU GOT INTO,

14:55.862 --> 14:57.964
AND THAT SORT OF IS WHERE THE

14:57.964 --> 14:59.332
THINKING STOPPED.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.533
NOW, IT IS MORE ABOUT HOW YOU GO

15:00.533 --> 15:02.735
TO COLLEGE, SO WHAT THE SURVEY

15:02.735 --> 15:04.270
HAS FOUND IS THAT IF YOU ARE

15:04.270 --> 15:06.973
CONNECTED TO A PROFESSOR, IF YOU

15:06.973 --> 15:09.475
HAVE A MENTOR AT SCHOOL, IF YOU

15:09.475 --> 15:10.543
HAVE SORT OF EXPERIENTIAL

15:10.543 --> 15:11.811
LEARNING IN SCHOOL, YOU ARE

15:11.811 --> 15:12.845
MUCH MORE ENGAGED IN WORK AS YOU

15:12.845 --> 15:13.846
GO.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.047
SO HOW YOU GO TO SCHOOL, WHAT

15:15.047 --> 15:16.749
YOU DO WHILE YOU ARE THERE IS AS

15:16.749 --> 15:17.850
IMPORTANT OR MORE IMPORTANT THAN

15:17.850 --> 15:18.618
WHERE YOU GO TO SCHOOL.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.520
THERE IS NO RELATIONSHIP TO

15:20.520 --> 15:21.888
BEING MUCH MORE HAPPY IN LIFE

15:21.888 --> 15:23.222
OR ENGAGED IN WORK ACCORDING TO

15:23.222 --> 15:24.323
THE PRESTIGE OF THE SCHOOL THAT

15:24.323 --> 15:25.291
YOU WENT TO.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.626
>> ALL RIGHT.

15:26.626 --> 15:27.794
DOUG BELKIN OF THE WALL STREET

15:27.794 --> 15:28.861
JOURNAL, THANKS SO MUCH.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.763

15:50.516 --> 15:52.151
SOME OF THE WORKS IN THE EXHIBIT

15:52.151 --> 15:53.419
AND TO LOOK BACK AT HIS NOW 60-

15:53.419 --> 15:57.390
YEAR CAREER.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.026
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT INSPIRES

16:00.026 --> 16:01.460
ME, ALL THE THINGS THAT I PAINT

16:01.460 --> 16:03.062
ARE THING THAT I KNOW VERY WELL.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.530
>> Reporter: AND JAMIE WYETH

16:04.530 --> 16:06.132

PAINTER'S WORK ARE NOW ON VIEW

16:10.436 --> 16:11.904
AT THE MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS IN

16:11.904 --> 16:13.406
HIS FIRST MAJOR RETROSPECTIVE.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.874
IT TAKES US FROM WYETH'S BOYHOOD

16:14.874 --> 16:16.375
PROMISE TO LATE-IN-LIFE

16:16.375 --> 16:18.377
REFLECTIONS.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.246
SEEING ALL YOUR WORK FROM VERY

16:20.246 --> 16:22.181
EARLY ON, TO THE MOST RECENT

16:22.181 --> 16:23.449
PIECES, WHAT IS IT LIKE TO SEE

16:23.449 --> 16:25.318
EVERYTHING IN ONE PLACE?

16:25.318 --> 16:27.386
>> THE EMOTION IS SHEER TERROR

16:27.386 --> 16:28.988
ON MY PART, I MEAN I REALLY AM

16:28.988 --> 16:31.624
NOT BEING CUTE ABOUT IT, I TRY

16:31.624 --> 16:33.726
TO TELL A VARIETY OF FRIENDS OF

16:33.726 --> 16:34.994
MINE, IT'S AS IF YOU'RE IN A

16:34.994 --> 16:36.295
ROOM AND EVERYBODY'S READING

16:36.295 --> 16:38.030
YOUR NEW NOVEL OR YOUR NEW POEM,

16:38.030 --> 16:41.200
ALL THE INADEQUACIES STARING AT

16:41.267 --> 16:43.336
IT, I CRINGE AND SAY '¡WHAT WAS
I

16:43.336 --> 16:45.605
THINKING?

16:45.605 --> 16:48.040
WHY DID I GET OBSESSED WITH

16:48.040 --> 16:51.777
THAT?"

16:51.777 --> 16:52.745
SO ITS NOT A PLEASANT

16:52.745 --> 16:54.013
EXPERIENCE, I'M OBVIOUSLY

16:54.013 --> 16:55.381
INCREDIBLY HONORED.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.449
>> Reporter: IN TRUTH, HE'S

16:56.449 --> 16:57.984
ALWAYS BEEN IN THE SPOTLIGHT AS

16:57.984 --> 16:59.452
THE THIRD GENERATION OF THE

16:59.452 --> 17:00.987
FAMED WYETH FAMILY, THE SON OF

17:00.987 --> 17:03.089
ANDREW, THE GRANDSON OF N.C.

17:03.089 --> 17:04.457
WERE YOU CONSCIOUS OF WHO CAME

17:04.457 --> 17:05.825
BEFORE YOU IN TERMS OF YOUR

17:05.825 --> 17:06.893
FATHER AND GRANDFATHER AND WHAT

17:06.893 --> 17:08.928
THEY DEPICTED?

17:08.928 --> 17:10.463
>> WELL, I LOVE THEIR WORK.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.631
I MEAN I, AS A VERY YOUNG CHILD

17:11.631 --> 17:13.432
OF COURSE MY GRANDFATHER, HE

17:13.432 --> 17:15.534
DIED BEFORE I WAS BORN, BUT HERE

17:15.534 --> 17:16.769
WAS THIS PHYSICALLY HUGE STUDIO

17:16.769 --> 17:18.804
UP THE HILL FROM OUR HOUSE, FULL

17:18.804 --> 17:23.309
OF COSTUMES AND CUTLASSES AND

17:23.309 --> 17:26.345
FLINT LIKE RIFLES ALL FROM HIS

17:26.345 --> 17:30.683
PROPS FROM HIS ILLUSTRATIONS, SO

17:30.683 --> 17:35.321
IT WAS MAGICAL TO ME.

17:35.321 --> 17:36.555
AND I ALWAYS SAY, THEN I WOULD

17:36.555 --> 17:37.790
GO BACK TO OUR HOUSE AND THERE

17:37.790 --> 17:38.991
WOULD BE MY FATHER PAINTING A

17:38.991 --> 17:40.026
DEAD CROW OR SOMETHING, AND THAT

17:40.026 --> 17:41.193
WAS KIND OF BORING.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.561
>> Reporter: WYETH'S EARLIEST

17:43.896 --> 17:45.431
HIS MOTHER, REVEAL A CHILD'S

17:45.431 --> 17:46.799
FASCINATION WITH ADVENTURE.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.334
MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THOUGH, THEY

17:48.334 --> 17:49.535
SHOW HIS EARLY MASTERY OF THE

17:49.535 --> 17:50.870
LINE.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.038
HE WAS AN ARTIST TO THE CANVAS

17:52.038 --> 17:53.239
BORN.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.974
IS IT SOMETHING YOU COULD EVER

17:54.974 --> 17:56.409
CONCEIVE OF NOT BEING CENTRAL TO

17:56.409 --> 18:00.579
YOUR LIFE?

18:00.579 --> 18:01.647
>> WELL ACTUALLY I HAVE A

18:01.647 --> 18:02.882
BROTHER NIKKI WHO, AN OLDER

18:02.882 --> 18:03.916
BROTHER, WHO ATE THE SAME BACON

18:03.916 --> 18:05.651
AND EGGS AND HE HAD NO INTEREST

18:05.651 --> 18:06.886
IN PAINTING.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.020
SO IT WASN'T FORCED UPON US, BUT

18:08.020 --> 18:09.121
THE TOOLS WERE THERE.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.623
WE LIVED IN MY FATHER'S STUDIO

18:10.623 --> 18:12.358
SO THERE WERE THE BRUSHES AND

18:12.358 --> 18:13.960
THE PENCILS AND THE PAINTS, SO

18:13.960 --> 18:14.894
IT WAS VERY NATURAL FOR ME TO

18:14.894 --> 18:16.395
WANT TO PAINT.

18:16.395 --> 18:19.665
IT WAS NEVER QUESTIONED.

18:19.665 --> 18:21.267
>> Reporter: BY AGE 17, IN HIS

18:21.267 --> 18:22.835
PORTRAIT OF SHORTY, WYETH'S

18:22.835 --> 18:24.170
SKILL WAS ALREADY LONG CEMENTED

18:24.170 --> 18:25.438
AND CONSUMING.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.539
>> I WOULD JUST GET UP IN THE

18:26.539 --> 18:28.841
MORNING, JUST WANTED TO PAINT.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.676
I'M A VERY BORING PERSON, AND

18:30.676 --> 18:32.878
THEN ALL I DO IS WANT TO PAINT

18:32.878 --> 18:35.181
AND TO RECORD WHAT I FEEL MOVES

18:35.181 --> 18:37.216
ME OR WHAT INTERESTS ME, AND

18:37.216 --> 18:38.985
THAT COULD BE IN THE FORM OF A

18:38.985 --> 18:40.519
PIG OR IN THE FORM OF PRESIDENT

18:40.519 --> 18:43.656
KENNEDY.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.857
>> Reporter: HIS PORTRAIT OF

18:44.857 --> 18:46.492
JOHN F. KENNEDY, RECENTLY

18:46.492 --> 18:47.893
ACQUIRED BY THE MFA, WAS PAINTED

18:47.893 --> 18:49.595
AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S DEATH AT

18:49.595 --> 18:52.498
THE REQUEST OF HIS GRIEVING

18:52.498 --> 18:53.499
FAMILY.

18:53.499 --> 18:54.467
>> I WAS TAKEN BY THE KENNEDYS

18:54.467 --> 18:56.168
AS MUCH AS EVERYONE WAS AT THAT

18:56.168 --> 18:57.169
TIME.

18:57.169 --> 18:58.437
AND THEN I REALIZED I STARTED

18:58.437 --> 18:59.872
DOING THIS SORT OF GLORIFIED

18:59.872 --> 19:02.074
PORTRAIT OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

19:02.074 --> 19:04.610
AND I FELT THE NEED TO HAVE LIFE

19:04.610 --> 19:06.379
SO I DID A LOT OF DRAWINGS THE

19:06.379 --> 19:08.014
TWO BROTHERS, BOB AND TED.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.782
HIS WIDOW JACKIE SHOWED ME ALL

19:09.782 --> 19:15.721
HER FILMS.

19:15.721 --> 19:16.822
I ALWAYS SAY IT ADDED UP TO

19:16.822 --> 19:18.124
MAYBE I HAD SAT WITH HIM FOR TEN

19:18.124 --> 19:19.325
MINUTES, TO AT LEAST TO CREATE A

19:19.325 --> 19:22.461
MEMORY OF A LIVING PERSON.

19:22.461 --> 19:23.662
I DIDN'T WANT TO JUST WORK FROM

19:23.662 --> 19:24.897
PHOTOGRAPHS, AND ACTUALLY

19:24.897 --> 19:26.098
THERE'S A PORTRAIT OF TED UNDER

19:26.098 --> 19:30.636
THE ACTUAL PAINTING

19:30.636 --> 19:31.904
>> Reporter: REALLY?

19:31.904 --> 19:33.072
IN WHAT WAY?

19:33.072 --> 19:34.440
>> I LITERALLY DID HIM AND THEN

19:34.440 --> 19:38.444
CHANGED IT INTO HIS BROTHER,

19:38.444 --> 19:39.345
JUST TO HAVE--

19:39.345 --> 19:40.446
I WAS SO DESPERATE, I DIDN'T

19:40.446 --> 19:42.148
WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE

19:42.148 --> 19:43.783
PREPOSTEROUS PORTRAIT.

19:43.783 --> 19:44.917

19:44.917 --> 19:45.951
NUREYEV THOUGH WAS SOMEONE WYETH

19:45.951 --> 19:47.319
KNEW INCREDIBLY WELL, HAVING

19:47.319 --> 19:48.521
STUDIED THE RUSSIAN BALLET STAR

19:48.521 --> 19:49.622
INTENSELY FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.656
>> ON STAGE HE WAS EXTRAORDINARY

19:50.656 --> 19:51.924
OF COURSE, BUT OFF STAGE HE WAS

19:51.924 --> 19:53.192
AS FASCINATING.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.560
HE WOULD COME AND STAY AT OUR

19:54.560 --> 19:57.329
HOUSE, AND IT WAS LIKE HAVING A

19:57.329 --> 19:58.464
PANTHER IN THE HOUSE.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.232
HE HAD THIS AMAZING PRESENCE,

20:00.232 --> 20:02.935
AND THIS SORT OF REMARKABLE

20:02.935 --> 20:04.136
AND THIS SORT OF REMARKABLE LOOK

20:04.136 --> 20:05.404
AND THAT JUST DREW ME.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.006
HE WAS BEYOND DANCE, HE WAS JUST

20:07.006 --> 20:08.941
THIS AMAZING FIGURE.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.591

WITH HIS WORK, AND THE RESONANCE

20:26.959 --> 20:28.227
HE HAS TODAY I THINK IS

20:28.227 --> 20:29.028
REMARKABLE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE

20:29.028 --> 20:30.463
STILL.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.131
I MEAN THE QUALITY I MOST LOVED

20:32.131 --> 20:34.967
IN WARHOL IT WAS HIS SENSE OF

20:34.967 --> 20:37.069
WONDER, HE WAS ABSOLUTELY, I

20:37.069 --> 20:38.003
MEAN HE WAS, "OH, MY GOD, ISN'T

20:38.003 --> 20:39.438
THAT WONDERFUL?"

20:39.438 --> 20:42.108
IT WASN'T THAT HE WAS COOL AND

20:42.108 --> 20:43.509
KIND OF CALCULATED AT ALL.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.811
HE WAS VERY CHILD-LIKE."

ASIDE, MUCH OF WYETH'S WORK HAS

20:48.681 --> 20:50.649
BEEN ABOUT PAINTING PLACE--

20:50.649 --> 20:52.418
SPECIFICALLY, WHERE HE GREW UP,

21:04.630 --> 21:06.065
DON'T CARE ABOUT SCENES, I DON'T

21:06.065 --> 21:09.735
CARE ABOUT INTERESTING LOOKING

TREES.

21:10.803 --> 21:11.770
WHAT I DO CARE ABOUT ARE TREES

21:14.073 --> 21:15.508
WITH AND TOUCHED.

21:15.508 --> 21:16.775
I JUST THINK IT MAKES THE WORK

MORE MEANINGFUL.
