JUDY WOODRUFF: The climate
decision raises question about
the economy, and so does today's

00:05.066 --> 00:07.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
jobs report.

00:07.633 --> 00:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In it, the unemployment
rate dropped to its
lowest point in 16 years,
causing some economists

00:12.933 --> 00:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to raise the prospect of what
they call full employment.

00:15.800 --> 00:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But job growth seems to
have slowed considerably.

00:19.133 --> 00:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the latest revisions,
the economy is generating an
average, we're told, of about

00:23.633 --> 00:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
120,000 net new jobs each month.

00:26.200 --> 00:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To get some insight into all of
this, we're joined from Chicago
by Diane Swonk, an economist

00:31.033 --> 00:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who runs her own firm.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Diane Swonk, welcome
back to the program.

00:35.266 --> 00:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, overall, what do you
make of these jobs numbers
for the month of May?

00:38.766 --> 00:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE SWONK, Founder, DS
Economics: Well, certainly,
they were a disappointment.

00:41.333 --> 00:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, we don't need to
generate as many jobs as we once
did to keep the unemployment

00:45.733 --> 00:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rate steady or even fall.

00:47.833 --> 00:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, the unemployment
rate itself fell for the wrong
reasons in the month of May.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that is that
the participation
rate fell yet again.

00:54.800 --> 00:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're seeing more people retire
out of the labor force and men
in particular didn't participate

00:59.366 --> 01:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as much in the month of May.

01:01.533 --> 01:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is something we like
to see moving in reverse
at this stage of the game.

01:04.233 --> 01:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When you say,
Diane, that the country, you
said we don't need to generate

01:07.900 --> 01:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as many jobs as we once
did, what do you mean?

01:10.533 --> 01:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE SWONK: Well, basically,
the labor force isn't
growing very rapidly anymore.

01:14.166 --> 01:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even though the economy
is very subdued in its growth
at 2 percent, you just don't

01:18.466 --> 01:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to create very many jobs
to absorb those workers coming
into the labor force and keep

01:22.900 --> 01:24.600 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the unemployment
rate going down.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We have actually seen
job growth slow and the
unemployment rate fall.

01:27.900 --> 01:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is because we're near
what we call full employment.

01:30.900 --> 01:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That sounds good in terms.

01:32.966 --> 01:36.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What it really means
in economist terms and
for the Federal Reserve
is nearly all of those

01:36.966 --> 01:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who are employable
or are employed or who are
looking for a job are now sort

01:41.633 --> 01:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of either between jobs because
they wanted to be between
jobs or are just coming into

01:46.600 --> 01:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the labor force, but it's
not a lot of extra slack
in the U.S. economy.

01:49.800 --> 01:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, it doesn't mean all
those people who want a job
in the U.S. economy or have

01:54.366 --> 01:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dropped out and are not
looking can actually get a job.

01:56.833 --> 02:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Diane, you were
telling us earlier today that
the focus on jobs obscures

02:01.200 --> 02:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the need to look at
raising skill levels.

02:04.966 --> 02:05.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Talk about that.

02:05.966 --> 02:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE SWONK: Exactly.

02:07.966 --> 02:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of -- there are two reasons
why we saw the wage gains
slow in the month of May from

02:11.533 --> 02:12.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a year ago.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is only up at a
2.5 percent rate.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is something we like to see
going in the other direction.

02:16.366 --> 02:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you are near full employment,
wages should be accelerating.

02:19.033 --> 02:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One reason is because
millennials are replacing
older baby boomers
and they're paid less.

02:25.233 --> 02:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is not a bad reason
for wage growth slowing.

02:27.333 --> 02:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other reason is that we are
seeing many employers out there
dip further into lower-skilled

02:33.233 --> 02:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers, but instead of paying
them more, they are actually
investing in training, because

02:35.433 --> 02:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they don't have the skills
necessary to do the jobs they
have or they are leaving job

02:40.400 --> 02:42.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
positions open.

02:42.733 --> 02:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The shortages in construction
are particularly acute
and manufacturing, which
actually contracted.

02:48.533 --> 02:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We still have over 300,000
jobs that aren't filled just
because people don't have the

02:51.533 --> 02:53.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right skills.

02:53.633 --> 02:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we would do much better to
enhance the skills of those out
there who are on the sidelines

02:57.533 --> 03:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not participating right
now to bring them back in, than
just give them tax cuts to cut

03:03.133 --> 03:05.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
low wages.

03:05.066 --> 03:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And very quickly,
finally, Diane, we took note
yesterday when President

03:07.433 --> 03:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trumped talked about the country
having created, I think, he
said a million jobs since the

03:13.166 --> 03:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
election last November.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does that reflect
what's been going on?

03:16.200 --> 03:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DIANE SWONK: It is
a bit of a stretch.

03:18.733 --> 03:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have created 800,000 jobs
since the beginning of the year.

03:22.466 --> 03:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you want to do it
since he's been president,
it's about 600,000 jobs.

03:26.733 --> 03:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, depending on how he wants
to count, I think it is a
little early for him to take

03:30.766 --> 03:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
credit one way or the other,
and might be careful what he
wants to take credit for in

03:34.566 --> 03:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terms of job gains.

03:37.066 --> 03:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is going to
get better going forward,
but the bottom line
is, that is not really

03:40.933 --> 03:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the way to count it.

03:42.900 --> 03:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Diane
Swonk joining us from
Chicago, thanks very much.

03:46.133 --> 03:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE SWONK: Thank you.
