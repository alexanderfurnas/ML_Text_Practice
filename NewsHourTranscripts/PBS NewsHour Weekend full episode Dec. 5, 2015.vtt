THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING

03:27.741 --> 03:30.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:36.917 --> 03:38.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE GROUP OF

PERPETRATORS AND WE CAN LOOK

03:39.953 --> 03:41.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACKWARDS, WE DO REALIZE THAT

03:41.955 --> 03:44.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SHARE SOME COMMON TRAITS.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FORMS OF DEPRESSION OR FORMS OF

03:55.202 --> 03:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MENTAL ILLNESS.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FAMILIARITY OR EXPERIENCE WITH

FIREARMS.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEN, THOSE BEHAVIORS ARE SO

04:03.777 --> 04:05.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERALIZABLE AND THEY APPLY TO

04:05.412 --> 04:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO MANY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

04:06.746 --> 04:08.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK FORWARD

04:10.984 --> 04:12.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND BE ABLE TO POINT OUT AND

04:12.586 --> 04:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY, WELL, YOU, THAT'S SOMEBODY

WE SHOULD REALLY PAY ATTENTION

04:15.021 --> 04:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO, IT'S JUST VERY, VERY

04:17.023 --> 04:18.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

04:18.992 --> 04:19.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DOES AN

04:19.759 --> 04:21.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY PREVENT

04:21.928 --> 04:22.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

04:22.729 --> 04:24.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PREVENT A

04:24.898 --> 04:27.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL SHOOTING OR SHOOTING UP A

04:27.367 --> 04:29.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINIC.

04:29.836 --> 04:32.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IT REALLY IS.

04:32.038 --> 04:34.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, TO MY MIND THE BEST WAY TO

04:34.908 --> 04:36.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRY TO DEAL WITH THESE THINGS IS

04:36.676 --> 04:39.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY TO HAVE DEEP CONNECTIONS

04:39.646 --> 04:41.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:41.548 --> 04:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGENCIES AND COMMUNITIES,

04:43.416 --> 04:45.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO BE

04:45.285 --> 04:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIENDS, RELATIVES, COWORKERS

04:48.488 --> 04:51.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MIGHT PICK UP ON SIGNALS OF

04:51.191 --> 04:52.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY HAVE

04:52.592 --> 04:54.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGED, THEY MAY SAY THINGS

04:54.795 --> 04:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SUGGEST THAT THEY MIGHT

04:57.797 --> 05:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO ENGAGE IN VIOLENCE.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, HAVING THOSE KINDS OF

05:02.169 --> 05:03.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIPS OF TRUST AND

05:03.837 --> 05:06.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONNECTIVITY IN COMMUNITIES IS

05:06.973 --> 05:08.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT CAN POSSIBLY GIVE THE

05:08.575 --> 05:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE SOME SORT OF EARLY

05:10.043 --> 05:12.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WARNING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL IS

05:12.145 --> 05:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEADED DOWN A ROAD TO TOWARDS

05:13.780 --> 05:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIOLENCE.

05:14.514 --> 05:15.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WELL, IN THIS

TALK ABOUT CONNECTIONS AND

05:17.050 --> 05:17.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITIES, I AUTOMATICALLY

05:17.984 --> 05:19.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK OF SOCIAL MEDIA.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT SEEMS THOSE ARE NOW

05:20.587 --> 05:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPEN-SOURCE INDICATORS OF WHAT

05:22.789 --> 05:23.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEONE'S THINKING.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE OPTING INTO SHARING THIS

05:24.724 --> 05:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH PEOPLE.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, ABSOLUTELY.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT ALL THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE

05:29.763 --> 05:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL TRAINED, HARDENED CRIMINAL

TERRORISTS.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF THEM ARE, YOU KNOW,

05:36.503 --> 05:39.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFUSED INDIVIDUALS, AND THEY

05:39.940 --> 05:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE MISTAKES.

05:41.575 --> 05:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONCEAL

05:44.177 --> 05:45.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR INTENTIONS.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, INDEED, THEY WANT TO BRAG

05:47.080 --> 05:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO OTHERS, TO TALK ABOUT, AND SO

05:50.884 --> 05:52.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'LL LEAVE CLUES ON SOCIAL

05:52.018 --> 05:52.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDIA.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'LL SAY THINGS, AND I THINK

05:55.155 --> 05:56.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A VERY FRUITFUL WAY FOR

05:56.923 --> 05:58.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO DEAL

05:58.592 --> 05:59.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OPEN-SOURCE MATERIALS, BUT ALSO

06:02.429 --> 06:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BE EVERYWHERE

06:04.464 --> 06:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE INTERNET.

06:06.066 --> 06:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:10.570 --> 06:11.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE INTERNET

06:11.438 --> 06:12.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:15.141 --> 06:17.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTED IN VIOLENCE, SHOULD

06:17.210 --> 06:18.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRING IT TO THE ATTENTION OF

PRACTICAL TERMS IT'S NOT GOING

07:24.344 --> 07:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO MAKE A HUGE AMOUNT OF

STILL GOING TO BE DOING THE BULK

THEY VERY SPECIFICALLY SAID

07:41.995 --> 07:42.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO

07:42.929 --> 07:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

07:43.997 --> 07:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID IT DOES NOT WANT TO PUT

07:45.598 --> 07:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA AS

07:46.700 --> 07:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:44.731 --> 12:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DELEGATES FROM 195 NATIONS

12:47.400 --> 12:49.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPROVED A DRAFT TEXT THEY HOPE

12:49.902 --> 12:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL BE THE BASIS FOR AN

12:52.739 --> 12:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARBON EMISSIONS.

12:53.973 --> 12:55.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE FRENCH CLIMATE

12:55.008 --> 12:56.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMBASSADOR CAUTIONED THAT THERE

12:56.542 --> 12:58.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE STILL MAJOR POLITICAL ISSUES

12:58.511 --> 13:00.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:00.246 --> 13:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SKYPE FROM PARIS BY MATT DALTON

13:04.550 --> 13:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."

13:05.551 --> 13:07.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, MATT, HOW MUCH CLOSER ARE WE

13:07.520 --> 13:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO AN AGREEMENT NOW THAN A WEEK

13:09.255 --> 13:10.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGO?

13:10.390 --> 13:11.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: FRANKLY, I DON'T

13:11.157 --> 13:12.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK WE'RE THAT MUCH CLOSER.

13:12.925 --> 13:16.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY PRODUCED A TEXT.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TEXT HAS LOTS OF BRACKETS,

13:18.831 --> 13:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND BRACKETS MEANS THAT THERE'S

13:21.034 --> 13:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT AN AGREEMENT ON THE LANGUAGE

13:22.268 --> 13:24.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WITHIN THE BRACKETS.

13:24.203 --> 13:25.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, FRANKLY, MOST OF THE TEXT

13:25.538 --> 13:26.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS WITHIN BRACKETS.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THERE

13:28.608 --> 13:30.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A TEXT, BUT THEY REALLY

13:30.209 --> 13:32.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVEN'T PRODUCED ANY CONSENSUS

13:32.779 --> 13:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR ANY AGREEMENT ON ALL THE

13:34.313 --> 13:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES PROVING TO BE THE MOST

13:35.715 --> 13:36.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT IN THE TALKS.

13:36.883 --> 13:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: COMPARED TO

13:37.550 --> 13:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

13:39.052 --> 13:42.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLIMATE, IS THERE ANY MORE SENSE

13:42.722 --> 13:45.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF URGENCY IN THIS SERIES?

13:45.591 --> 13:47.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REASON WHY THIS MEETING IS

13:47.026 --> 13:48.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCH A BIG DEAL IS THERE IS HOPE

13:48.494 --> 13:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, AND THE HOPE COMES FROM THE

13:50.396 --> 13:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THAT TWO BIGGEST EMITTERS

13:52.732 --> 13:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE WORLD, THE UNITED STATES

13:54.367 --> 13:57.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND CHINA, HAVE BOTH AGREED TO

13:57.537 --> 14:00.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIMIT THEIR GLOBAL WARMING

14:00.106 --> 14:02.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMISSIONS, AND IN FACT TO REDUCE

14:02.041 --> 14:03.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR EMISSIONS AT SOME POINT.

14:03.776 --> 14:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS ALWAYS THE BIG STICKING

14:04.877 --> 14:06.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT, THE BIG PROBLEM IN THESE

14:06.546 --> 14:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGOTIATIONS BEFORE.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THAT HAS UNLOCKED THE

14:09.649 --> 14:10.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGOTIATIONS.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REST OF THE WORLD HAS SAID,

14:11.451 --> 14:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"WELL, THE TWO BIGGEST EMITTERS

14:12.685 --> 14:13.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE GOING TO DO THIS, THEN WE'RE

14:13.619 --> 14:17.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAME TO TALK," AND I THINK

14:17.957 --> 14:18.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A LOT OF POLITICAL

14:18.858 --> 14:20.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOMENTUM BEHIND AN AGREEMENT.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S JUST THE QUESTION OF

14:21.294 --> 14:22.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THEY CAN SORT OUT THESE

14:22.729 --> 14:23.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETAILS.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHAT ARE THE

14:24.330 --> 14:26.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST DIFFICULT STICKING POINTS?

14:26.499 --> 14:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER

14:27.700 --> 14:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRIES SHOULD BE LIMITING

14:29.802 --> 14:32.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLOBAL WARMING TO LESS THAN TWO

14:32.505 --> 14:34.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEGREES SINCE THE START OF THE

14:34.674 --> 14:36.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDUSTRIAL AGE OR LESS THAN 1.5

14:36.509 --> 14:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEGREES CELSIUS SINCE THE START

14:38.478 --> 14:39.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE INDUSTRIAL AGE.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,

14:42.682 --> 14:43.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY COUNTRIES THAT ARE

14:43.549 --> 14:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE

14:45.017 --> 14:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE, SAY THAT IF WE GET TO

14:47.353 --> 14:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO DEGREES OF WARMING, LARGE

14:50.456 --> 14:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SWATHS OF OUR TERRITORIES WILL

14:52.258 --> 14:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE UNINHABITABLE.

14:53.292 --> 14:54.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME NATIONS WILL BE COMPLETELY

14:54.794 --> 14:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNINHABITABLE AND WILL HAVE TO

14:55.962 --> 14:56.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVE.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THEY'RE ARGUING THAT THIS

14:58.931 --> 14:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREEMENT NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE

14:59.899 --> 15:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMBITIOUS.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT NEEDS TO KEEP GLOBAL WARMING

15:02.502 --> 15:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELOW 1.5 DEGREES.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN, THERE'S THE ISSUE OF

15:06.506 --> 15:07.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINANCE.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONEY IS GOING TO MAKE THIS

15:08.341 --> 15:09.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHOLE AGREEMENT WORK, MONEY FROM

15:09.575 --> 15:12.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:16.048 --> 15:17.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLOBAL WARMING.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:18.117 --> 15:20.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$100 BILLION ANNUALLY BY 2020.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHAT

15:21.621 --> 15:23.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENS AFTER 2020.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH NATIONS ARE GOING TO PAY?

15:26.125 --> 15:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S., THE EUROPEAN UNION

15:27.727 --> 15:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OTHERS ARGUE THAT CHINA,

WHICH WAS ONCE CONSIDERED TO BE

15:30.563 --> 15:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A DEVELOPING COUNTRY, IS NOW

15:32.965 --> 15:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICH ENOUGH THAT IT SHOULD

15:34.333 --> 15:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY BE CALLED UPON TO PAY

15:36.469 --> 15:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
