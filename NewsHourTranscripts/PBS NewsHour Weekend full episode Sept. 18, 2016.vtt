REALLY GET STARTED UNTIL LAST

FRIDAY.

05:27.733 --> 05:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HAPPENED IN BETWEEN?

05:29.467 --> 05:30.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO YEAH, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

05:30.667 --> 05:32.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE HAD IS THAT A LOT OF THE

05:32.967 --> 05:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GASOLINE IN THE PIPELINE SORT OF

05:34.667 --> 05:36.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POOLED IN THESE MANMADE PONDS.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S LEAD TO HIGH

05:38.500 --> 05:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCENTRATIONS OF VAPORS THAT

05:40.000 --> 05:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR

05:42.400 --> 05:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKERS TO WORK IN THE AREA, FOR

05:45.500 --> 05:46.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A SUSTAINED PERIOD.

05:46.467 --> 05:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON THEY

05:48.033 --> 05:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEGAN THE EXCAVATION, FINALLY,

05:49.933 --> 05:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT'S ALL TAKEN LONGER THAN

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTICIPATED.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE HAVE BEEN RULES WAIVED

05:55.700 --> 05:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY CERTAIN AGENCIES TO SORT OF

05:57.133 --> 05:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL WITH POTENTIAL DOMINO

05:58.833 --> 05:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFECT.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

06:00.533 --> 06:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

06:01.067 --> 06:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SURE.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE EPA HAS WAIVED CERTAIN

06:03.233 --> 06:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEG RAISE-- REGULATIONS, THE

06:05.700 --> 06:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTEMPT IS TO ALLOW MORE

06:07.367 --> 06:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GASOLINE TO COME TO THE AREA TO

06:08.333 --> 06:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE SOLD TO PREVENT SHORTAGES.

06:11.233 --> 06:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEVERAL SOUTH EASTERN STATES

06:13.233 --> 06:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNORS HAVE ISSUED EXECUTIVE

06:14.667 --> 06:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORDERS THAT ARE ALSO AIMED AT

06:16.233 --> 06:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF

06:17.400 --> 06:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GASOLINE IN THE REGION.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WAIVING REGULATIONS

06:20.933 --> 06:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEMPORARILY THAT WOULD PREVENT

06:22.667 --> 06:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUCKERS FROM DRIVING LONG

06:23.667 --> 06:24.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENOUGH HOURS TO MAKE IT.

06:24.867 --> 06:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE INTENT IS REALLY TO MAKE

06:27.233 --> 06:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURE THAT GASOLINE CAN COME

06:30.233 --> 06:31.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM-- SOMETIMES FROM LONG

06:31.067 --> 06:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTANCES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE

06:32.300 --> 06:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THERE AREN'T SHORTAGES.

06:34.233 --> 06:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HAVE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL

06:35.367 --> 06:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNS BEEN ADDRESSED YET?

06:37.400 --> 06:40.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO THE PIPELINE OF HAZARDOUS

06:40.367 --> 06:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATERIALS SAFETY, THE FEDERAL

06:41.500 --> 06:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGENCY THAT REGULATES

06:43.233 --> 06:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PIPELINES, THEY ISSUED A

06:44.100 --> 06:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORRECTIVE ACTION ORDER ON

06:45.633 --> 06:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIDAY.

06:46.133 --> 06:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WILL REQUIRE THE PIPELINE

06:47.000 --> 06:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANY TO TAKE CERTAIN STEPS

06:49.367 --> 06:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE RESTARTING THE PIPELINES,

06:50.700 --> 06:53.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY BECAUSE OF THE ISSUES WE

06:53.267 --> 06:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCUSSED EARLIER WITH THE

06:54.467 --> 06:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VAPORS, THEY ARE WORKING NOW TO

06:56.400 --> 06:57.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCAVATE THE PIPELINE AND IT

06:57.867 --> 06:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WON'T BE UNTIL THEN THAT THEY

06:59.433 --> 07:00.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

07:00.367 --> 07:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE MEAN TIME IT SEEMS THAT

07:02.067 --> 07:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GASOLINE HAS REALLY POOLED

07:03.367 --> 07:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THESE MANNED MADE PONDS AND

07:05.800 --> 07:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LUCKILY I'M BEING TOLD IT HASN'T

07:07.567 --> 07:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESCAPED THOSE PONDS AND FLOWED

07:09.100 --> 07:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO LOCAL RIVERS.

07:10.233 --> 07:12.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND WE TALKED ABOUT A

07:12.067 --> 07:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEMPORARY FIX, WHAT WILL THAT BE

07:13.700 --> 07:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET

07:15.233 --> 07:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS PIPELINE BACK UP AND

07:16.400 --> 07:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUNNING.

07:16.933 --> 07:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE FIX THAT THE COMPANY IS

07:18.600 --> 07:20.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROPOSING IS TO BUILD SORT OF A

07:20.367 --> 07:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BYPASS PIPELINE THE SAME SIZE

07:21.567 --> 07:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ORIGINAL AND JUST GO AROUND

07:22.933 --> 07:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AREA THAT BROKE.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT HOPEFULLY THAT WILL HELP

07:27.600 --> 07:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM GET IT UP AND RUNNING AGAIN

07:29.233 --> 07:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE QUICKLY.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COMPANY HAS SAID THEY ARE

07:31.267 --> 07:32.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AIMING TO GET IT RESTARTED THIS

07:32.767 --> 07:33.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEK, THOUGH THEY HAVEN'T PUT AN

07:33.967 --> 07:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXACT DATE ON IT YET AND OF

07:35.633 --> 07:37.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURSE THE LONGER THE PIPELINE

07:37.767 --> 07:39.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMAINS OUT OF COMMISSION, THE

07:39.067 --> 07:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREATER THE IMPACT WILL BE.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AS WE STARTED THIS WE

07:41.700 --> 07:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESCRIBED THIS HAPPENING ON A

07:43.467 --> 07:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROUTINE INSPECTION.

07:45.100 --> 07:46.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHY IT LEAKED

07:46.067 --> 07:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

07:47.600 --> 07:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, I DON'T THINK THAT IS

07:48.700 --> 07:50.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOWN YET; ONCE THEY ARE ABLE

07:50.767 --> 07:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO EXCAVATE THE PIPELINE THEY

07:52.233 --> 07:53.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL BE ABLE TO GET A CLOSER

07:53.567 --> 07:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK AT THE METAL AND UNDERSTAND

07:55.267 --> 07:56.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WENT WRONG AND PERFORM

07:56.867 --> 07:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAIN TESTS.

07:58.033 --> 07:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT BECAUSE OF THE VAPOR IN THE

07:59.900 --> 08:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREA, IT'S BEEN HARD FOR THEM TO

08:01.667 --> 08:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE WORKER THERE ON A

08:03.467 --> 08:04.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSTAINED, OVER SUSTAINED

08:04.467 --> 08:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERIODS.

08:05.233 --> 08:06.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING
