WHAT DOES THE PICTURE TELL YOU

05:29.733 --> 05:30.467
THIS YEAR?

05:30.467 --> 05:32.067

05:32.067 --> 05:33.500
SECOND WORST YEAR ON RECORD WITH

05:33.500 --> 05:35.367
MORE THAN 200 JOURNALISTS IN

05:35.367 --> 05:35.500
JAIL

05:35.500 --> 05:36.967
SO GOVERNMENTS ARE CONTINUING TO

05:36.967 --> 05:39.067
USE IMPRISONMENT AS A WAY OF

05:39.067 --> 05:40.900
CENSORING JOURNALISTS AN

05:40.900 --> 05:41.767
SILENCING CRITICS.

>> I REMEMBER THE WORST YEAR WAS

05:43.333 --> 05:44.233
LAST YEAR, CORRECT

05:44.233 --> 05:45.967
>> YES, A FEW JOURNALISTS HAVE

05:45.967 --> 05:48.000
BEEN RELEASED, AND THAT'S DUE IN

05:48.000 --> 05:49.567
PART TO THE ADVOCACY OF GROUPS

05:49.567 --> 05:51.500
LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO PROTEC

05:51.500 --> 05:52.567
JOURNALISTS AND OTHE

05:52.567 --> 05:53.933
JOURNALISTS PUTTING PRESSURE O

05:53.933 --> 05:55.067
GOVERNMENTS, BUT THE TREND I

05:55.067 --> 05:57.400
STILL FOR A VERY HIGH.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.600
>> ANY TIME THERE'S A LIST, WH

05:58.600 --> 06:01.467
IS NUMBER ONE ON THE LIST, A

06:01.467 --> 06:02.200
IMPRISONING THE MOST

06:02.200 --> 06:04.100
AND WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS

06:04.100 --> 06:08.433
>> WELL, THE TOP JOURNAL O

06:08.433 --> 06:09.233
JOURNALISTS IS TURKEY.

06:09.233 --> 06:11.167
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED BY

06:11.167 --> 06:12.600
THAT, TURKEY IS A DEMOCRACY,

06:12.600 --> 06:14.100
MEMBER OF NATO, WANTS TO JOI

06:14.100 --> 06:15.000
THE EUROPEAN UNION

06:15.000 --> 06:16.700
BUT TURKEY HAS A GOVERNMEN

06:16.700 --> 06:18.667
WHICH DOES NOT WANT TO B

06:18.667 --> 06:19.433
CRITICIZED INTERNALLY.

06:19.433 --> 06:21.367
AND SO IT USES JAILING O

06:21.367 --> 06:22.900
JOURNALISTS TO SILENCE PEOPLE.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.033
TO INTIMIDATE THEM

06:24.033 --> 06:25.667
>> I REMEMBER LAST YEAR, CHINA

06:25.667 --> 06:26.867
I BELIEVE AND IRAN WERE ALSO I

06:26.867 --> 06:27.933
THE TOP THREE.

06:27.933 --> 06:29.600
HOW DO THEY FARE THIS YEAR

06:29.600 --> 06:31.133
>> THEY'RE STILL UP THERE.

06:31.133 --> 06:32.133
THEY'RE STILL IN THE TOP THREE

06:32.133 --> 06:33.600
AND BETWEEN THEM, THOSE THRE

06:33.600 --> 06:35.867
COUNTRIES ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY

06:35.867 --> 06:36.533
HALF OF THE TOTAL.

06:36.533 --> 06:39.167
SO THERE'S A CLEAR PATTERN HER

06:39.167 --> 06:41.567
OF AUTHORITY TEARIAN COUNTRIES

06:41.567 --> 06:43.467
THAT WANT TO PUT JOURNALISTS

06:43.467 --> 06:44.800
BEHIND BARS, RATHER THAN DEA

06:44.800 --> 06:46.067
WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT THE

06:46.067 --> 06:47.133
JOURNALISTS ARE REPORTING ON

06:47.133 --> 06:48.633
>> ESPECIALLY IN CHINA, WE HEA

06:48.633 --> 06:50.767
A NUMBER OF THINGS THESE DAYS.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.567
WHAT TYPE OF REPORTING IS TH

06:52.567 --> 06:54.267
CHINESE GOVERNMENT TARGETING

06:54.267 --> 06:56.700
>> OF CHINESE JOURNALISTS, IT'

AND YOUR COVERING CRUX OR BA

07:05.867 --> 07:06.000
GOVERNMENT

07:06.000 --> 07:07.900
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF STORIES

07:07.900 --> 07:09.233
THAT MANY CHINESE OFFICIAL

07:09.233 --> 07:10.667
DON'T WANT PUBLISHED

07:10.667 --> 07:12.067
AND THE PICTURE IS VERY MIXED.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.233
THERE ARE PARTS OF CHINA WHERE

07:13.233 --> 07:15.367
THERE ARE SOME GOOD JOURNALIST

07:15.367 --> 07:16.067
GETTING OUT GOOD INFORMATION

07:16.067 --> 07:17.233
AND THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF

07:17.233 --> 07:19.400
CHINA WHERE THINGS ARE VER

07:19.400 --> 07:19.700
REPRESSIVE

07:19.700 --> 07:21.200
>> WHAT ABOUT AMERICAN REPORTERS

07:21.200 --> 07:23.100
THAT ARE EITHER MISSING OR

07:23.100 --> 07:24.933
SOMEHOW BEING THREATENED

07:24.933 --> 07:25.033
OVERSEAS

07:25.033 --> 07:27.067
>> WELL, THE WORST PLACE TO BE A

07:27.067 --> 07:28.333
JOURNALIST AT THE MOMENT I

07:28.333 --> 07:28.467
SYRIA.

07:28.467 --> 07:29.533

AMERICAN JOURNALISTS WHO HAV

07:34.667 --> 07:35.800
BEEN TAKEN HOSTAGE

07:35.800 --> 07:37.433
SOME OF THEM FOR THE LAST YEAR

07:37.433 --> 07:37.700
AND A HALF

07:37.700 --> 07:39.433
WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO NEWS ABOUT

07:39.433 --> 07:39.667
THEM

07:39.667 --> 07:41.533
WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE ALIVE, OR

07:41.533 --> 07:43.233
WE THINK WE KNOW THAT THEY'R

07:43.233 --> 07:43.367
ALIVE.

DISTRESSING SITUATION FOR THEI

THE PICTURES, YOU SAY YES, THI

11:33.433 --> 11:34.167

HOW CAN WE USE CHILDREN JUST T

11:37.500 --> 11:38.567
SELL PRODUCTS?

11:38.567 --> 11:41.433
HOW CAN WE USE CHILDREN AS

11:41.433 --> 11:42.500
SEXUALIZED PEOPLE?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.500
>> THE "VOGUE" CONTROVERSY GOT

11:43.500 --> 11:44.733
SO BIG IN FRANCE THAT TH

11:44.733 --> 11:48.167
MINISTER FOR FAMILY AFFAIR

11:48.167 --> 11:49.933
ASKED THE SENATOR TO INVESTIGATE

11:49.933 --> 11:51.533
WHETHER THERE WAS A PROBLEM OF

11:51.533 --> 11:53.733
FRENCH CHILDREN BECOMING

11:53.733 --> 11:53.867
HYPERSEXUALIZED.

11:53.867 --> 11:56.867
AND IF SO, WHAT DO DO ABOUT IT

SHOW, WHICH ARE ALL BASED ON

12:06.667 --> 12:06.800
HYPERSEXUALIZATION

12:06.800 --> 12:08.500
>> SHE IS A MOTHER OF THRE

12:08.500 --> 12:08.800
KIDS

12:08.800 --> 12:10.367
AND SHE WAS SURPRISED TO

12:10.367 --> 12:11.967
DISCOVER THAT MILLIONS OF KIDS

12:11.967 --> 12:14.300
IN FRANCE JUST LIKE IN THE U.S.,

12:14.300 --> 12:16.533
ROUTINELY SEE IMAGES THAT PB

TYPICALLY WOULDN'T PUT ON TH

12:20.100 --> 12:21.000

12:21.000 --> 12:22.333
IMAGES OF YOUNG WOMEN PORTRAYE

IN HIGHLY SEXUAL WAYS.

♪♪

12:29.400 --> 12:29.567
♪♪

12:29.567 --> 12:30.667
>> ONLINE, ON TV, IN MUSIC

12:30.667 --> 12:35.033
VIDEOS

12:35.033 --> 12:38.933
SHE EVEN FOUND SEXUALIZED IMAGES

12:38.933 --> 12:42.467
INFILTRATING TOYS AND CARTOONS

12:42.467 --> 12:44.300
>> I WAS SURPRISED BY THE THINGS

12:44.300 --> 12:45.300
MY OWN CHILDREN COULD SEE.

12:45.300 --> 12:48.500
AND I WAS SURPRISED TO

12:48.500 --> 12:49.900
UNDERSTAND WHY

12:49.900 --> 12:50.467
HYPERSEXUALIZATION COULD BE

12:50.467 --> 12:51.933
PROBLEM FOR THEM

12:51.933 --> 12:53.933
>> AT THE END OF HER

12:53.933 --> 12:55.833
INVESTIGATION, SHE ISSUED THIS

12:55.833 --> 12:55.967
REPORT

12:55.967 --> 12:59.500
IT ARGUED THAT THE LEVEL O

12:59.500 --> 13:01.433
SEXUALIZED UNREALISTIC BOD

13:01.433 --> 13:04.400
IMAGES WAS SO PERFECTS VASIVE IN

13:04.400 --> 13:06.733
FRENCH SOCIETY, THAT IT AMOUNTED

13:06.733 --> 13:08.133
TO A QUOTE FORM OF VIOLENC

13:08.133 --> 13:10.200
AGAINST KIDS, ONE THAT NOT ONL

13:10.200 --> 13:11.267
OBJECTIFIES GIRLS, BUT CAUSE

13:11.267 --> 13:13.300
THEM TO JUDGE THEMSELVES

13:13.300 --> 13:13.433
HARSHLY.

13:13.433 --> 13:15.433
FOR EXAMPLE, ACCORDING TO TH

13:15.433 --> 13:16.933
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, 27%

13:16.933 --> 13:20.000
OF 11-YEAR-OLD EUROPEAN GIRL

13:20.000 --> 13:22.633
THINK THEY'RE TOO FAT THAT

13:22.633 --> 13:24.867
PERCENTAGE RISES TO 40% FO

13:24.867 --> 13:26.233
15-YEAR-OLDS B. A QUARTER OF

THOSE GIRLS SAY THEY'RE NO

13:28.767 --> 13:28.933
DIETING.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.400
SO HER REPORT COMES OUT AND IT

13:31.400 --> 13:32.067
CONTAINS 12 DIFFEREN

13:32.067 --> 13:33.400
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO

13:33.400 --> 13:34.067
PROTECT KIDS

13:34.067 --> 13:36.100
IT WOULD PROHIBIT COMPANIES FROM

13:36.100 --> 13:38.300
USING CHILDREN AS THEIR SPOKES

13:38.300 --> 13:38.533
MODELS

13:38.533 --> 13:39.900
IT WOULD CREATE A WEBSITE THAT

13:39.900 --> 13:40.867
WOULD NAME AND SHAME COMPANIES

13:40.867 --> 13:42.700
THAT DON'T GO ALONG.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.600
AND IT WOULD CREATE AN

13:44.600 --> 13:45.933
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOR PARENT

13:45.933 --> 13:48.667
AND IT PROPOSED BANNING THOS

13:48.667 --> 13:50.567

14:06.100 --> 14:07.733
PUT A PREMIUM ON THEIR LOOKS

14:07.733 --> 14:10.367

14:10.367 --> 14:12.100
RECOMMENDATION, TO BAN BEAUT

14:12.100 --> 14:13.400
PAGEANTS, SO THAT THE SOCIET

14:33.067 --> 14:36.067
TALENTS AS SINGING, AS DANCING

14:36.067 --> 14:38.333
>> BUT NOT ONLY BASED ON YOU

HAPPY WHEN SHE HEARD ABOUT THE

14:44.500 --> 14:48.033
PROPOSED BAN

14:48.033 --> 14:49.433
SHE THINKS THE SENATOR CONFUSING

14:49.433 --> 14:51.167
THE PAGEANTS SHE DOES, WITH TH

14:51.167 --> 14:53.133
KIND THAT HAPPEN IN THE U.S.

14:53.133 --> 14:55.333
LIKE THOSE SEEN IN TLC'S HIT

14:59.733 --> 15:01.100

WOMAN, I'M NOT SURE WHAT HER

15:05.867 --> 15:06.500

15:06.500 --> 15:10.467
BUT SHE WANTS TO FORBID THE MINI

15:10.467 --> 15:12.167
MISS PAGEANTS, BECAUSE SHE

15:12.167 --> 15:13.867
BELIEVES IT'S JUST LIKE IN THE

15:13.867 --> 15:14.300
U.S.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.300
WE PUT ON MAKEUP AND SHOW OU

15:16.300 --> 15:17.867
BUTTS AND SHOW OUR MOUTH AND OUR

15:17.867 --> 15:21.100

15:23.700 --> 15:24.400
KIDS ARE OFTEN EXPOSED TO TO

15:24.400 --> 15:27.700
MUCH, TOO SOON

15:27.700 --> 15:31.167
SHE SAYS SHE AND HER HUSBAND

15:31.167 --> 15:32.100
PHILIPPE WORK VERY HARD TO

15:32.100 --> 15:33.067
PROTECT THEIR KIDS FROM TH

15:33.067 --> 15:34.067
OUTSIDE WORLD.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.400
BUT SHE DOESN'T THINK PAJTSS ARE

15:35.400 --> 15:37.200
PART OF THE PROBLEM, AND SHE'S

15:37.200 --> 15:38.300
FURIOUS AT THE SENATOR'S

15:38.300 --> 15:40.200
SUGGESTION THAT BY LETTING ANAIS

15:40.200 --> 15:41.967
COMPETE SHE'S SOMEHOW HARMIN

15:41.967 --> 15:44.700
HER DAUGHTER

15:44.700 --> 15:46.233
>> Translator: I WAS ANGRY FOR

15:46.233 --> 15:46.367
SURE

15:46.367 --> 15:48.100
BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WHAT SHE'S

15:48.100 --> 15:49.533
SAYING IS, WE'RE DUMB AND WE

15:49.533 --> 15:51.033
CAN'T TAKE CARE OF OUR KIDS.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.267
WE DON'T LET OUR KIDS WEAR

15:53.267 --> 15:53.867
ANYTHING INDECENT.

15:53.867 --> 15:55.467
SHE CAN COME AND HAVE A LOOK

15:55.467 --> 15:57.467
I WANT HER TO COME AND SEE

15:57.467 --> 16:01.667
OUR DAUGHTERS ARE NOT BARBIES.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.967
>> THE PARENTS WHO SUPPORT THE

16:03.967 --> 16:05.733
PAGEANTS ARGUE IT'S NOT NEARLY

16:05.733 --> 16:07.733
AS EXTREME AS WHAT WE SEE IN THE

16:07.733 --> 16:09.367
UNITED STATES.

16:09.367 --> 16:11.300
IT'S NOT SO MUCH MAKEUP, HIG

16:11.300 --> 16:11.567
HEELS.

16:11.567 --> 16:13.667
THEY THINK OF IT AS A HARMLESS

16:13.667 --> 16:17.733
SIMPLE COMPETITION
