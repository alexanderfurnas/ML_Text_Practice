INDICTED ON FELONY CHARGES.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.291
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

00:24.291 --> 00:25.492
AND UNCONVENTIONAL EFFORTS TO

00:25.492 --> 00:26.760
BOOST DECLINING MUSEUM

00:26.760 --> 00:28.095
ATTENDANCE BY TRYING TO ATTRACT

00:28.095 --> 00:30.597
YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:30.597 --> 00:31.865
>> IF PEOPLE COME TO THE MUSEUM

00:31.865 --> 00:33.634
AND THEY ARE NOT ENTERTAINED,

00:33.634 --> 00:34.401
THEN THEY ARE GONNA BE TUNED

00:34.401 --> 00:35.402

00:35.402 --> 00:38.472
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:47.648 --> 00:48.815
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:48.815 --> 00:49.716
AMERICAN JETS TODAY HIT

00:49.716 --> 00:50.784
POSITIONS NEAR A KEY DAM IN

00:50.784 --> 00:51.718
NORTHERN IRAQ THAT THAT HAD BEEN

00:51.718 --> 00:52.586
CAPTURED RECENTLY BY ISLAMIC

00:52.586 --> 00:53.854
EXTREMISTS.

00:53.854 --> 00:54.721
THIS, A DAY AFTER THE EXTREMISTS

00:54.721 --> 00:55.956
MEMBERS OF THE ISLAMIC STATE ARE

00:55.956 --> 00:56.490
SAID TO HAVE MASSACRED DOZENS OF

00:56.490 --> 00:57.991
YAZIDIS.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.026
THE EXTREMISTS REPORTEDLY HAD

00:59.026 --> 01:00.360
DEMANDED MEMBERS OF THAT

01:00.360 --> 01:01.495
RELIGIOUS MINORITY CONVERT TO

01:01.495 --> 01:03.363
ISLAM.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.032
FOR ABOUT ALL OF THIS, WE ARE

01:05.032 --> 01:06.033
JOINED NOW VIA SKYPE FROM DUHOK

01:06.033 --> 01:07.234
IN NORTHERN IRAQ BY LIZ SLY OF

01:07.234 --> 01:12.172
THE WASHINGTON POST.

01:12.172 --> 01:12.506
SO, WE’VE HEARD ABOUT SEVERAL

01:12.506 --> 01:13.206
MORE AIR STRIKES IN THE REGION

01:13.206 --> 01:13.707
THIS MORNING.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.376
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?

01:16.376 --> 01:18.845
>> Reporter: ALL WE KNOW IS

01:18.845 --> 01:20.647
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME BIG

01:20.647 --> 01:22.082
EXPLOSIONS AROUND THAT DAM AT

01:22.082 --> 01:23.116
ISIS POSITIONS.

01:23.116 --> 01:24.551
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING REPORTS

01:24.551 --> 01:25.552
FROM RESIDENTS ABOUT THAT.

01:25.552 --> 01:26.820
IT IS NOT CLEAR AT THIS MOMENT

01:26.820 --> 01:27.955
WHETHER THE U.S. HAS BEEN

01:27.955 --> 01:29.289
INVOLVED BUT WE KNOW THEY HAVE

01:29.289 --> 01:30.991
BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THE

01:30.991 --> 01:32.125
OTHER AIR STRIKES GOING ON

01:32.125 --> 01:33.226
AROUND THAT AREA AND I THINK IT

01:33.226 --> 01:35.162
IS EXPECTED THESE WERE U.S.

01:35.162 --> 01:35.395
STRIKES.

01:35.395 --> 01:35.862
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT DO WE

01:35.862 --> 01:39.933
KNOW ABOUT THE AREA WHERE THE

01:39.933 --> 01:41.034
MOST RECEIPT MASSACRE OCCURRED?

01:41.034 --> 01:44.504
>> THIS IS A SMALL VILLAGE

01:44.504 --> 01:47.140
SOUTHEAST OF SIN JAR, THE

01:47.140 --> 01:48.408
ASSAULT ON THE YEZIDIS A COUPLE

01:48.408 --> 01:51.144
OF WEEKS AGO TRIGGERED THIS

01:51.144 --> 01:51.278
CRISIS.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.680
IT’S IN A VERY SMALL VILLAGE, A

01:53.680 --> 01:54.948
REMOTE AREA.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.416
REPORTS HAVE BEEN SKETCHY BUT WE

01:56.416 --> 01:58.585
KNOW AT ABOUT 1:00 YESTERDAY

01:58.585 --> 02:00.520
FIGHTERS WITH THE ISLAMIC STATE

02:00.520 --> 02:02.222
DID GO INTO THAT VILLAGE AND

02:02.222 --> 02:03.056
THEY APPARENTLY KILLED-- WE HAVE

02:03.056 --> 02:05.625
A NUMBER OF 84 MEN.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.127
THEY LINED THEM UP AND EXECUTED

02:07.127 --> 02:09.096
THEM AND THEY TOOK AWAY AROUND

02:09.096 --> 02:09.496
300 WOMEN.

02:09.496 --> 02:10.263
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE ANY

02:10.263 --> 02:11.498
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TIMING OF

02:11.498 --> 02:12.299
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT

02:12.299 --> 02:14.334
THE HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS ON

02:14.334 --> 02:16.303
THE MOUNTAIN ARE DONE?

02:16.303 --> 02:17.771
>> THE SITUATION ON THE MOUNTAIN

02:17.771 --> 02:19.940
HAS GREATLY IMPROVED.

02:19.940 --> 02:20.741
>> Sreenivasan: AND WHEN THESE

02:20.741 --> 02:22.776
PEOPLE WENT IN FOR THE MASSACRE?

02:22.776 --> 02:24.644
>> Reporter: YES, THAT’S WHAT

02:24.644 --> 02:27.147
A LOT OF YEZIDIS AND SOME KURDS

02:27.147 --> 02:28.248
ARE TELL US.

02:28.248 --> 02:29.649
THEY BELIEVE IT’S A DIRECT

02:29.649 --> 02:30.250
CONNECTION BETWEEN PRESIDENT

02:30.250 --> 02:31.818
OBAMA CALLING OFF THE

02:31.818 --> 02:33.620
HUMANITARIAN AIR LIFT OF YEZIDIS

02:33.620 --> 02:34.988
WHICH HAD BEEN PLANNED IN THE

02:34.988 --> 02:35.922
MOUNTAIN NEARBY AND THE ISLAMIC

02:35.922 --> 02:37.024
STATE FIGHTERS GOING IN AND

02:37.024 --> 02:38.125
KILLING THESE PEOPLE.

02:38.125 --> 02:39.993
THEY HAD BEEN SURROUNDING THESE

02:39.993 --> 02:41.461
PEOPLE FAIR WEEK, DEMANDING THEY

02:41.461 --> 02:42.896
CONVERT OR RISK DEATH.

02:42.896 --> 02:43.897
SO IT COULD BE THAT THEY WERE

02:43.897 --> 02:45.465
PLANNING TO GO IN ANYWAY, BUT A

02:45.465 --> 02:47.801
LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT WAS A

02:47.801 --> 02:48.769
SENSE THAT THEY WERE OFF THE

02:48.769 --> 02:50.871
HOOK, A GREEN LIGHT, IF YOU

02:50.871 --> 02:52.672
LIKE, FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA TO

02:52.672 --> 02:54.341
CONTINUE KILLING IN THE AREA.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.609
>> Sreenivasan: HAVE THEY MADE

02:55.609 --> 02:56.476
MORE ADVANCED IN THE REGION

02:56.476 --> 02:57.844
SINCE THE HUMORITARIAN CRISIS

02:57.844 --> 02:59.212
THAT REALLY OCCUPIED MOST OF OUR

02:59.212 --> 03:01.782
HEADLINES HERE IN THE WEST?

03:01.782 --> 03:03.316
>> Reporter: THEY HAVE BEEN

03:03.316 --> 03:04.117
CONTINUING TO ADVANCE THROUGHOUT

03:04.117 --> 03:04.751
THIS TIME.

03:04.751 --> 03:05.552
THEY NEVER REALLY STOPPED.

03:05.552 --> 03:08.021
THE AIR STRIKES DID HELP THEM ON

03:08.021 --> 03:12.692
THE OUTSKIRT OFS OF ERBIL BUT

03:12.692 --> 03:16.663
THEY MADE GAINS DOWN NEAR THE

03:16.663 --> 03:17.664
IRANIAN BORDER, AND THEY’VE BEEN

03:17.664 --> 03:19.800
MAKING A LOT OF GAINS RECENTLY

03:19.800 --> 03:22.769
IN THE NORTHERN ALEPPO COUNTRY,

03:22.769 --> 03:24.104
IN SYRIA, A FURTHER EDGE OF THE

03:24.104 --> 03:25.572
AREA THEY CONTROL.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.673
THEY’VE BEEN TAKING A LOT OF

03:26.673 --> 03:28.175
SMALL TOWNS AND VILLAGES AROUND

03:28.175 --> 03:29.476
ALEPPO IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, AND

03:29.476 --> 03:31.311
PEOPLE ARE VERY AFRAID THAT THE

03:31.311 --> 03:32.579
SYRIAN REBELS THERE ARE GOING TO

03:32.579 --> 03:34.581
LOSE CONTROL OF THE BORDER WITH

03:34.581 --> 03:36.349
TURKEY AND PERHAPS THE TOWN OF

03:36.349 --> 03:36.716
ALEPPO ITSELF.

03:36.716 --> 03:37.984
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT THE

03:37.984 --> 03:39.686
TALK THAT PERHAPS THE U.S.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.221
MILITARY AID COULD COME TO

03:41.221 --> 03:42.756
KURDISTAN OR OTHER EUROPEAN

03:42.756 --> 03:44.958
COUNTRIES COULD ASSIST IN THIS

03:44.958 --> 03:45.125
FIGHT?

03:45.125 --> 03:46.393
>> Reporter: WELL, IT’S MY

03:46.393 --> 03:48.161
UNDERSTANDING THAT U.S. MILITARY

03:48.161 --> 03:50.097
AID HAS ALREADY ARRIVED IN

03:50.097 --> 03:50.263
KURDISTAN.

03:50.263 --> 03:51.164
IT WAS ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS

03:51.164 --> 03:52.666
WEEK THAT THE U.S. WAS PREPARED

03:52.666 --> 03:56.403
TO SEND THE AID DIRECTLY TO

03:56.403 --> 03:56.570
KURDISTAN.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.604
THEY ARE COORDINATING THIS WITH

03:57.604 --> 03:57.771
BAGHDAD.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.372
THEY ARE NOT BYPASSING THE

03:59.372 --> 04:00.874
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN BAGHDAD.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.609
THEY’RE NOT CUTTING A SEPARATE

04:02.609 --> 04:03.944
DEAL WITH KURDISTAN, IF YOU

04:03.944 --> 04:04.244
LIKE.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.278
BUT THEY ARE SENDING ARMS.

04:05.278 --> 04:06.646
IT’S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SOME

04:06.646 --> 04:08.148
HAVE ALREADY ARRIVED.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.116
>> Sreenivasan: LIZ SLY OF THE

04:09.116 --> 04:10.450
"WASHINGTON POST" JOINING US

04:10.450 --> 04:11.818
HAVE A SKYPE FROM IRAQ, THANKS

04:11.818 --> 04:12.552
SO MUCH.

04:12.552 --> 04:13.954
>> Reporter: THANK YOU.

04:13.954 --> 04:14.387
>> Sreenivasan: IN TEXAS TODAY,

04:14.387 --> 04:15.455
GOVERNOR RICK PERRY SAID HE IS

04:15.455 --> 04:16.556
INNOCENT OF ANY WRONGDOING.

04:16.556 --> 04:17.491
YESTERDAY, A GRAND JURY IN

04:17.491 --> 04:18.525
AUSTIN INDICTED THE PRESIDENTIAL

04:18.525 --> 04:19.392
HOPEFUL ON TWO FELONY COUNTS OF

04:19.392 --> 04:20.494
ABUSE OF POWER SOMETHING HE SAYS

04:20.494 --> 04:27.167
HE IS ACTUALLY A VICTIM OF.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.635
>> WE DON’T SETTLE POLITICAL

04:28.635 --> 04:29.569
DIFFERENCES WITH INDICTMENTS IN

04:29.569 --> 04:32.005
THIS COUNTRY.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.773
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT SOME WOULD

04:33.773 --> 04:35.942
USE PARTISAN POLITICAL THEATRICS

04:35.942 --> 04:37.377
TO RIP AWAY AT THE VERY FABRIC

04:37.377 --> 04:38.845
OF OUR STATE’S CONSTITUTION.

04:38.845 --> 04:41.114
THIS INDICTMENT AMOUNTS TO

04:41.114 --> 04:42.482
NOTHING MORE THAN ABUSE OF POWER

04:42.482 --> 04:43.517
AND I CANNOT, AND I WILL NOT,

04:43.517 --> 04:55.362
ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.196
>> Sreenivasan: WE’LL HAVE AN

04:56.196 --> 04:57.664
INTERVIEW FROM AUSTIN RIGHT

04:57.664 --> 04:57.998
AFTER THE NEWS SUMMARY.

04:57.998 --> 04:58.498
IN MISSOURI TODAY, GOVERNER JAY

04:58.498 --> 05:01.768
NIXON DECLARED A STATE OF

05:01.768 --> 05:02.169
EMERGENCY AND IMPOSED A MIDNIGHT

05:02.169 --> 05:02.602
TO 5:00 A.M. CURFEW IN FERGUSON

05:02.602 --> 05:05.772
TO TRY TO END THE VIOLENCE

05:05.772 --> 05:06.106
THERE.

05:06.106 --> 05:06.439
FOLLOWING THE FATAL SHOOTING

05:06.439 --> 05:09.776
OF A WEEK AGO OF AN UNARMED

05:09.776 --> 05:10.443
AFRICAN AMERICAN TEENAGER.

05:10.443 --> 05:10.744
THERE WERE PEACEFUL PROTEST THIS

05:10.744 --> 05:14.848
AFTERNOON AFTER RENEWED UNREST

05:14.848 --> 05:16.483
OVERNIGHT.

05:16.483 --> 05:17.350
PROTESTERS DEIFIED POLICE CALLS

05:17.350 --> 05:18.618
TO DISBURSE AND LOOTED AT LEAST

05:18.618 --> 05:19.219
THREE STORES.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.454
SOME STORE OWNERS

05:21.454 --> 05:22.389
COMPLAINED THE POLICE, ACCUSED

05:22.389 --> 05:23.390
OF USING EXCESSIVE FORCE EARLIER

05:23.390 --> 05:24.324
IN THE WEEK DID NOT DO ENOUGH TO

05:24.324 --> 05:28.728
STOP THE LOOTERS LAST NIGHT.

05:28.728 --> 05:29.729
TURNING NOW BACK OVERSEAS

05:29.729 --> 05:30.497
TENSIONS REMAIN HIGH ALONG THE

05:30.497 --> 05:31.765
BORDER BETWEEN UKRAINE AND

05:31.765 --> 05:33.033
RUSSIA, AFTER REPORTS YESTERDAY

05:33.033 --> 05:33.033
THAT THE UKRAINIAN MILITARY HAD

05:33.033 --> 05:34.301
DESTROYED AN ARMED RUSSIAN

05:34.301 --> 05:40.640
CONVOY THAT HAD ENTERED UKRAINE.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.641
FOR MORE ABOUT THE CONFLICT AND

05:41.641 --> 05:42.709
EFFORTS TO END IT BEFORE IT

05:42.709 --> 05:43.743
ESCALATES FURTHER, WE ARE JOINED

05:43.743 --> 05:44.744
FROM MOSCOW VIA SKYPE BY JAMES

05:44.744 --> 05:45.612
MARSON OF THE WALL STREET

05:45.612 --> 05:49.182
JOURNAL.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.450
SO, YESTERDAY THERE WAS SOME

05:50.450 --> 05:51.318
CONFUSION ON WHETHER OR NOT THE

05:51.318 --> 05:52.819
EVENT HAPPENED AT ALL.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.955
THE UKRAINIANS SAY THEY DID AWAY

05:54.955 --> 05:56.923
WITH A RUSSIAN MILITARY CONVOY.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.425
THE RUSSIAN CALL IT A FANTASY.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.026
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT IT?

06:00.026 --> 06:02.896
>> Reporter: THAT’S RIGHT.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.532
THIS CALL-UP OF ABOUT 20 ARMORED

06:05.532 --> 06:07.701
VEHICLE CROSSED OVER THE

06:07.701 --> 06:09.002
RUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN BORDER

06:09.002 --> 06:10.303
THURSDAY EVENING, SPOTTED BY TWO

06:10.303 --> 06:13.340
BRITISH REPORTERS.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.708
THEY SNUCK AROUND THE BORDER

06:14.708 --> 06:16.509
POST AND ENTERED UKRAINE.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.713
UKRAINE YESTERDAY SAID THAT IT

06:19.713 --> 06:23.216
HAD DESTROYED THIS ARMORED

06:23.216 --> 06:23.516
COLUMN.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.086
RUSSIA DISMISSED THIS AS A

06:26.086 --> 06:26.253
FANTASY.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.621
AND UKRAINE HAS SO FAR PROVIDED

06:27.621 --> 06:32.525
NO PICTURES OF THIS.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.861
IT ROYALED THE MARKET BECAUSE

06:34.861 --> 06:36.696
EVERYONE WAS FEARFUL THE

06:36.696 --> 06:37.664
DESTRUCTION OF THE COLUMN WOULD

06:37.664 --> 06:41.568
LEAD TO A WIDER CONFLICT IN

06:41.568 --> 06:42.736
RUSSIA AND UKRAINE.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.138
BUT IN FACT, TODAY, UKRAINE HAS

06:45.138 --> 06:46.473
TRIED TO PLAY IT DAY SAYING THIS

06:46.473 --> 06:48.942
IS QUITE A REGULAR OCCURRENCE,

06:48.942 --> 06:50.677
THAT RUSSIA KEEPS SEND THESE

06:50.677 --> 06:52.312
COLUMNS ACROSS.

06:52.312 --> 06:52.812
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT’S IN

06:52.812 --> 06:54.948
THEIR INTEREST TO MAKE THIS UP?

06:54.948 --> 06:56.583
>> Reporter: WELL, UKRAINE,

06:56.583 --> 06:58.418
OBVIOUSLY, WANTS TO MAKE IT SEEM

06:58.418 --> 07:00.120
LIKE IT WAS HAVING MILITARY

07:00.120 --> 07:01.655
SUCCESS AGAINST THE SEPARATISTS.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.589
IT DOESN’T WANT TO LOOK LIKE

07:02.589 --> 07:03.923
IT’S EASY FOR THE RUSSIANS TO

07:03.923 --> 07:07.394
SEND WEAPONS AND MEN INTO THE

07:07.394 --> 07:07.494
EAST.

07:07.494 --> 07:10.130
UKRAINE HAS BEEN FIGHTING THIS

07:10.130 --> 07:11.998
PRO-RUSSIAN INSURGENCY FOR

07:11.998 --> 07:12.799
AROUND FOUR MONTHS.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.100
IT’S BEEN HAVING SIGNIFICANT

07:14.100 --> 07:15.669
SUCCESSES IN RECENT WEEKS.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.270
IT’S MANAGED TO PUSH THE REBELS

07:17.270 --> 07:18.772
OUT OF A LOT OF TOWNS AND

07:18.772 --> 07:20.340
CITIES, AND THEY WANT TO KEEP

07:20.340 --> 07:21.608
THAT MOMENTUM GOING.

07:21.608 --> 07:22.442
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT

07:22.442 --> 07:23.810
THAT AID CONVOY?

07:23.810 --> 07:24.978
WE’VE SEEN THOSE PICTURES OF

07:24.978 --> 07:25.912
THOSE HUNDREDS OF TRUCKS THAT

07:25.912 --> 07:27.447
ARE WAITING ON THE BORDER.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.783
ARE THEY ANY CLOSER TO GETTING

07:29.783 --> 07:29.916
THROUGH?

07:29.916 --> 07:30.784
>> Reporter: THEY SEEM TO BE

07:30.784 --> 07:33.820
STUCK ON THE BORDER AT THE

07:33.820 --> 07:34.054
MOMENT.

07:34.054 --> 07:34.921
THEY’RE PARKED UP IN A FIELD A

07:34.921 --> 07:36.556
FEW MILES FROM THE BORDER

07:36.556 --> 07:36.723
CROSSING.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.958
THE UKRAINIANS SAY THEY’RE

07:38.958 --> 07:40.627
WAITING FOR PAPERWORK WHICH WILL

07:40.627 --> 07:41.461
ALLOW THEM TO CROSS.

07:41.461 --> 07:45.999
THE RUSSIANS SAY THE UKRAINE

07:45.999 --> 07:48.768
RANS ARE NOT ALLOWING THEM TO GO

07:48.768 --> 07:48.868
ACROSS.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.771
THERE’S A LOT OF FINGER

07:51.771 --> 07:51.971
POINTING.

07:51.971 --> 07:56.476
UKRAINE IS SENDING THEIR OWN AID

07:56.476 --> 07:58.211
COLUMN, SO THERE ARE A LOT OF

07:58.211 --> 08:00.814
PEOPLE IN BESIEGED TOWNS WAITING

08:00.814 --> 08:02.415
FOR AID AND NOT RECEIVING IT.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.883
>> Sreenivasan: ANY ADVANCING

08:03.883 --> 08:05.051
ON THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT?

08:05.051 --> 08:07.087
>> THE DIPLOMATIC FRONT WAS

08:07.087 --> 08:09.022
FROZEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT

08:09.022 --> 08:11.057
NOW IT APPEARS TO BE COMING BACK

08:11.057 --> 08:11.825
TO LIFE.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.909
DIPLOMATIC PUSH TO FIND A

08:29.909 --> 08:30.710
RESOLUTION HERE.

08:30.710 --> 08:31.945
NOW, IT COULD BE DIFFICULT TO

08:31.945 --> 08:34.514
FIND THAT RESOLUTION.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.783
UKRAINE HAS BEEN PUSHED WITH ITS

08:36.783 --> 08:40.453
MILITARY OPERATIONS AS IT SEEMS

08:40.453 --> 08:43.690
SOFEEL IT CAN PUSH THE REBELS

08:43.690 --> 08:43.790
OUT.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.378
BEATIFICATION IS ONE OF THE

09:05.378 --> 09:06.413
STEPS TOWARD SAINTHOOD.

SEND ONE THOUSAND GUARDSMEN TO

09:46.519 --> 09:50.390

SUSPECT.

09:55.862 --> 09:56.863
THE U.S. HAS BEEN SHARPLY

MORE THAN 1,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED

10:23.690 --> 10:24.724
THE NEW REGULATIONS, WHICH GO

10:40.507 --> 10:42.208
A MILESTONE OF SORTS ABOUT HOW

10:42.208 --> 10:43.376
AMERICANS ARE GETTING OUR

10:43.376 --> 10:44.844

SUBSCRIBERS THAN TV SUBSCRIBERS

10:51.885 --> 10:54.521
EACH AT JUST UNDER 50 MILLION.

10:54.521 --> 10:55.955
CABLE TV SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE DOWN

10:55.955 --> 10:57.724
BECAUSE OF COMPETITION FROM

10:57.724 --> 10:59.025
SATELLITE TV PROVIDERS AND

10:59.025 --> 11:06.032
TELEPHONE COMPANIES.

11:06.032 --> 11:06.566

11:12.171 --> 11:13.406
THE AREA WAS THE SCENE OF

11:13.406 --> 11:14.674
MILITARY ACTIVITY FOR NEARLY A

11:14.674 --> 11:15.475
QUARTER CENTURY, STARTING WITH

11:15.475 --> 11:17.810
THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR IN

11:37.096 --> 11:38.264
GOVERNOR IN TEXAS TO BE INDICTED

11:38.264 --> 11:39.632
IN A HUNDRED YEARS, THOSE WERE

11:39.632 --> 11:41.000
THE HEADLINES LATE LAST NIGHT

11:41.000 --> 11:42.168
ABOUT GOVERNOR RICK PERRY AND

11:42.168 --> 11:43.269
WHAT A GRAND JURY SAYS WAS HIS

11:43.269 --> 11:44.470
ABUSE OF POWER.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.338
TO EXPLAIN WHAT’S BEHIND IT ALL

11:45.338 --> 11:46.706
IS TONY PLOHETSKI FROM THE

AUSTIN AMERICAN STATESMAN.

11:49.842 --> 11:50.677
LET’S TALK ABOUT THE INCIDENT IN

11:50.677 --> 11:51.077
QUESTION.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.746
WHAT IS IT THAT RICK PERRY

11:53.746 --> 11:55.014
ALLEGEDLY DID THAT WAS AN ABUSE

11:55.014 --> 11:55.982
OF HIS POWER?

11:55.982 --> 11:57.150
>> Reporter: WELL, IT ALL

11:57.150 --> 11:59.085
STARTED MORE THAN A YEAR AGO IN

11:59.085 --> 12:00.019
APRIL, 2013.

12:00.019 --> 12:01.187
THE SITTING DISTRICT ATTORNEY

12:01.187 --> 12:03.790
HERE IN TRAVIS COUNTY, ROSEMARY

12:03.790 --> 12:05.091
LINDBERG, WAS ARRESTED AND

12:05.091 --> 12:06.059
CHARGED WITH DRUNK DRIVING.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.627
TWO MONTHS AFTER THAT, WHILE THE

12:07.627 --> 12:10.096
LEGISLATURE WAS FINISHING THEIR

12:10.096 --> 12:11.297
SESSION, GOVERNOR RICK PERRY WAS

12:11.297 --> 12:13.800
ABOUT TO SIGN THE STATE’S BUDGET

12:13.800 --> 12:15.535
AND DURING THAT TIME, HE IS

12:15.535 --> 12:18.304
ACCUSED OF SENDING WORD TO

12:26.412 --> 12:28.748

12:28.748 --> 12:30.083
ROSEMARY LINDBERG, THE DISTRICT

12:30.083 --> 12:31.217
ATTORNEY, IS A DEMOCRAT.

12:31.217 --> 12:34.554
RICK PERRY IS, OF COURSE, A

12:34.554 --> 12:34.787
REPUBLICAN.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.055
SPHWHRAR SO WHY IS THAT AN APUCE

12:36.055 --> 12:36.823
OF POWER?

12:36.823 --> 12:38.024
IS THAT NOT WITHIN HIS RIGHT AS

12:38.024 --> 12:39.158
A GOVERNOR TO VETO ITEMS FROM

12:39.158 --> 12:39.726
THE BUDGET?

12:39.726 --> 12:41.260
>> Reporter: WELL, THAT IS THE

12:41.260 --> 12:42.428
KEY QUESTION HERE.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.931
THE GOVERNOR’S CAMP STEADFASTLY

12:44.931 --> 12:47.200
SAYS, "LISTEN, THE GOVERNOR WAS

12:47.200 --> 12:48.034
DOING JUST THAT.

12:48.034 --> 12:50.169
HE WAS EXERCISING HIS LINE ITEM

12:50.169 --> 12:50.870
VETO AUTHORITY."

12:50.870 --> 12:55.274
BUT WHAT THE PROSECUTION AND

12:55.274 --> 12:56.709
THESE GRAND JURORS ESSENTIALLY

12:56.709 --> 12:59.112
HAVE SAID, "WELL, YES, GOVERNOR,

12:59.112 --> 12:59.946
YOU MAY HAVE BEEN DOING THAT,

12:59.946 --> 13:01.347
BUT YOU ALSO ATTACHED A THREAT

13:01.347 --> 13:04.117
TO IT, SO THAT CHANGES THE

13:04.117 --> 13:04.317
DYNAMIC.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.352
YES, YOU MAY HAVE LEGALLY USED

13:06.352 --> 13:07.754
YOUR VETO AUTHORITY, BUT

13:07.754 --> 13:09.922
POTENTIALLY YOU DID SOMETHING

13:09.922 --> 13:12.892
ILLEGAL BY ATTACHING A THREAT TO

13:12.892 --> 13:14.160
THAT VETO."

13:14.160 --> 13:14.794
>> Sreenivasan: NONE OF THIS

13:14.794 --> 13:16.663
HAPPENS IN A POLITICAL VACUUM.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.664
THERE ARE REPUBLICANS WHO SAY

13:17.664 --> 13:18.998
THE PUBLIC INTEGRITY UNIT THAT

13:18.998 --> 13:20.033
WAS UNDERNEATH THIS PROSECUTOR

13:20.033 --> 13:22.669
WENT AFTER REPUBLICANS FAR MORE

13:22.669 --> 13:24.470
AGGRESSIVELY THAN IT DID

13:24.470 --> 13:24.671
DEMOCRATS.

13:24.671 --> 13:25.138
>> Reporter: RIGHT.

REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATIC

THE D.A.’S OFFICE HERE IN TRAVIS

COUNTY OPERATES THE PUBLIC

13:35.248 --> 13:35.648
INTEGRITY UNIT.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.383
THE MONEY THAT THE GOVERNOR

13:37.383 --> 13:39.552
VETOED WAS EAR MARK FORWARD THAT

13:39.552 --> 13:39.986
UNIT.

INVESTIGATING STATE ETHICS

VIOLATIONS AMONG ALL STATE

THEIR JURISDICTION IS NOT JUST

13:47.527 --> 13:48.628
TRAVIS COUNTY.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.363
AND SO FOR YEARS REPUBLICANS

13:50.363 --> 13:52.298
HAVE ALLEGED THAT THE D.A.’S

13:52.298 --> 13:54.333
OFFICE IS GOING AFTER

JUST NORMALIZED BEHAVIOR.

16:32.091 --> 16:33.326
MAYBE THEY WERE TAKEN TO MUSEUMS

AS KIDS, AND IT WAS A SNOOZE

16:34.393 --> 16:35.595

SEE HOW THERE’S THE "V" BETWEEN

18:53.933 --> 18:55.034
THEIR SHOULDERS?

18:55.034 --> 18:56.836
IT LOOKS LIKE THERE’S SOME

18:56.836 --> 18:58.304
ORANGE THING SORT OF SPURTING UP

18:58.304 --> 18:58.871
THERE.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.473
THERE’S A FIREPLACE BACK THERE.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.741
SO PART OF WHERE THE LIGHT IS

19:01.741 --> 19:03.542
COMING FROM, IS THAT THE

19:03.542 --> 19:05.077
FIREPLACE IS BOUNCING OFF THE

19:05.077 --> 19:05.845
DUDE’S CHEST AND SHINING ONTO

19:05.845 --> 19:06.812

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART, AND

19:29.602 --> 19:31.871

19:31.871 --> 19:32.571
KIM KARDASHIAN.

19:32.571 --> 19:33.506
AND HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT OTHER

19:33.506 --> 19:34.407
OBJECTS IN THE MUSEUM AND PUT

19:34.407 --> 19:35.975
THEM IN A LIGHT THAT PEOPLE CAN

19:35.975 --> 19:38.677
UNDERSTAND AND CAN LAUGH ABOUT?

19:38.677 --> 19:39.879
IT’S CREATING THESE POINTS OF

19:39.879 --> 19:41.247
ACCESSIBILITY THAT ONLY GET

19:41.247 --> 19:42.615
PEOPLE TO BE EXCITED AND SORT OF

19:42.615 --> 19:44.784
ENERGIZED.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.519

19:46.519 --> 19:47.920
TO CRITICS WHO MIGHT SAY, "YOU

19:47.920 --> 19:49.188
KNOW, THAT’S A LITTLE

19:49.188 --> 19:50.923
DISRESPECTFUL TO ART TO KIND OF

19:50.923 --> 19:52.091
LINK IT TO POP CULTURE LIKE KIM

19:52.091 --> 19:53.893
KARDASHIAN?

19:53.893 --> 19:55.227
THAT IT’S SORT OF IRREVERENT."

19:55.227 --> 19:56.529

19:56.529 --> 19:57.797
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK

19:57.797 --> 19:59.198
ABOUT, IS WHAT WE’RE DOING JUST

19:59.198 --> 20:00.766
DUMBING DOWN THE MUSEUM

20:00.766 --> 20:02.001
EXPERIENCE?

20:02.001 --> 20:03.135
AND I DON’T SEE IT LIKE THAT.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.570
I SEE THAT WE’RE GONNA GET

20:04.570 --> 20:05.104
PEOPLE EXCITED TO COME BACK TO

20:05.104 --> 20:06.338
THE MUSEUM.

20:11.043 --> 20:12.378
WAY OF GIVING TOURS?

20:12.378 --> 20:13.979
>> I’D SAY THE AVERAGE MUSEUM

20:13.979 --> 20:15.881
TOUR IS FIRST RUN BY A VOLUNTEER

20:15.881 --> 20:17.650
WHO WORKS AND GIVES THEIR TIME

20:17.650 --> 20:20.486
FREELY AT THE MUSEUM.

20:20.486 --> 20:21.787
AND I BLESS THESE PEOPLE AND I

20:21.787 --> 20:23.155
THANK THEM SO MUCH FOR WHAT THEY

20:23.155 --> 20:24.757
DO.

20:24.757 --> 20:25.825
HOWEVER, I DON’T THINK THAT

20:25.825 --> 20:27.059
THOSE ARE THE BEST PEOPLE TO PUT

20:27.059 --> 20:28.494
IN FRONT OF A DISENGAGED

20:28.494 --> 20:30.629
AUDIENCE.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.665
THE TOURS THAT MY COMPANY IN

20:34.500 --> 20:35.968

20:35.968 --> 20:37.470
IS PURELY BASED ON THINGS THAT

20:37.470 --> 20:39.205
THEY LOVE.

20:39.205 --> 20:40.906
IT’S A ROUTE THAT IS BASED ON

20:40.906 --> 20:42.441
AMAZING PIECES THAT HAVE CRAZY

20:42.441 --> 20:44.043
STORIES.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.177
>> Reporter: DO YOU FEEL LIKE

20:45.177 --> 20:46.779
THAT’S A GOOD STRATEGY OR IS

20:46.779 --> 20:48.447
THAT A GOOD WAY TO CULTIVATE AN

20:48.447 --> 20:49.448
INTEREST IN ART IN YOUR OPINION?
