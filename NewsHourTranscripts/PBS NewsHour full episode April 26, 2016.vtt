JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.541 --> 00:11.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Voters in five Eastern states
hit the polls

00:11.311 --> 00:16.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today. What's at stake as
candidates fight
for some of the largest delegate
hauls left

00:16.850 --> 00:18.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the race?

00:18.752 --> 00:22.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Tuesday:
Today marks 30 years since the
worst nuclear

00:22.189 --> 00:26.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disaster in history -- a look at
how Chernobyl's
effects can still be seen.

00:26.460 --> 00:31.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how Chicago
artist Theaster
Gates is breathing new life into
the city's

00:31.999 --> 00:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Side by transforming
crumbling buildings
into spaces for creativity.

00:37.271 --> 00:41.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES, Artist: Poor
people have a
right to beautiful things, but
people have

00:41.608 --> 00:47.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the right not to be poor
anymore. I think
that feels like it's worth
making art about

00:47.247 --> 00:48.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and fighting for.

00:48.682 --> 00:55.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:56.056 --> 00:58.792 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.892 --> 01:08.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Five more states,
five more
wins, that's what Donald Trump
and Hillary

01:08.669 --> 01:14.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton are looking for in this
latest Super
Tuesday of the 2016 presidential
race.

01:14.708 --> 01:20.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters turned out today in
Connecticut, Delaware,
Maryland Pennsylvania and Rhode
Island. The

01:20.747 --> 01:25.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front-runners hope to run up big
margins and
big delegate numbers.

01:25.285 --> 01:32.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Trump went into the
day with 845
delegates. It takes 1,237 to win
the party's

01:32.359 --> 01:41.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nomination. On the Democratic
side, Clinton
already has 1,946 delegates. She
needs 2,383

01:41.435 --> 01:47.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be nominated. Even with a
good night, and
a delegate sweep, Trump could
still face a

01:47.474 --> 01:53.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
contested GOP convention.
Clinton aims to
make a Democratic victory all
but inevitable

01:53.947 --> 01:55.515 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take an extended look at
what's at
stake tonight after the news
summary.

01:57.951 --> 02:02.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
Opponents of North Carolina's
voter I.D. law

02:02.122 --> 02:07.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said they will keep up their
court fight against
it. The statute requires voters
to show a

02:07.761 --> 02:12.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
photo I.D. A federal judge
upheld it on Monday,
saying the state has a
legitimate interest

02:12.599 --> 02:16.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in trying to prevent voter
fraud. Opponents
argue the law targets
minorities.

02:16.870 --> 02:22.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A major storm
system is sweeping
through the Great Plains states
this evening,

02:22.275 --> 02:29.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
putting some 50 million people
at risk. Tornado
watches are up for parts of
Kansas, Nebraska,

02:29.316 --> 02:31.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oklahoma, and Texas.

02:31.218 --> 02:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier, high winds, rain, and
lightning whipped
across Kansas City, and
pebble-sized hail

02:37.457 --> 02:39.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pelted airliners at the city's
airport.

02:39.893 --> 02:44.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Iraq,
Parliament approved
a partial reshuffling of the
cabinet, under

02:44.331 --> 02:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pressure to adopt reforms.
Before the vote,
shouting matches broke out on
the Parliament

02:48.635 --> 02:52.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
floor. And that came as
thousands of followers
of an influential Shiite cleric
protested

02:52.806 --> 02:56.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Baghdad, demanding an end to
corruption.

02:56.243 --> 03:01.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thousands of
so-called junior
doctors in England walked off
the job today

03:01.782 --> 03:07.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a contract dispute, leaving
senior counterparts
to fill in. The all-out strike
by the British

03:08.021 --> 03:13.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medical Association was the
first ever against
the national health service.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Victoria Macdonald of
Independent Television
News reports.

03:16.596 --> 03:21.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTORIA MACDONALD: On any other
day, the
ambulance would be bringing its
patients back

03:21.735 --> 03:26.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the junior doctors. Instead,
they were
here on the picket line again,
this time,

03:26.940 --> 03:28.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all emergency coverage
withdrawn.

03:28.742 --> 03:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. YEZEN SHEENA, Junior Doctor:
Each one
of these doctors has had to
think really long

03:32.245 --> 03:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and hard about taking this
position. Unfortunately,
the majority of us have realized
that we have

03:36.817 --> 03:38.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
got no option left.

03:38.785 --> 03:42.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTORIA MACDONALD: Emergency
coverage was,
of course, provided in
hospitals, but by other

03:42.422 --> 03:44.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
staff, including consultants.

03:44.491 --> 03:50.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite the fact this all-out
strike is unprecedented,
all the planning does seem to
have paid off.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hospitals have coped just fine.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the question is, what next?
Apart from
tomorrow's action, the BMA
doesn't have anything

03:58.805 --> 04:05.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else planned, and the health
secretary, well,
he is showing no signs of
backing down.

04:05.345 --> 04:10.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEREMY HUNT, Health Minister:
The total refusal
of the BMA to negotiate on a
perfectly straightforward

04:10.383 --> 04:16.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
matter of weekend pay and
antisocial hours
pay is, I think, sadly driven by
some elements,

04:16.289 --> 04:20.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not the majority, but some
elements within
the BMA who are looking at this
as a political

04:20.794 --> 04:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
battle with the government.

04:22.662 --> 04:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been briefing the
media over the
last 24 hours that the BMA wants
nothing more

04:25.966 --> 04:28.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
than to bring down the
government. Completely
ridiculous.

04:28.802 --> 04:33.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTORIA MACDONALD: In the
meantime, 125,000
operations and outpatient
appointments have

04:34.007 --> 04:40.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been postponed or canceled over
the two days
of the strike. And yet there is
still no signs

04:40.447 --> 04:42.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that either side will blink
first.

04:42.716 --> 04:47.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The contract
dispute involves
plans to expand care on
weekends.

04:48.054 --> 04:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In economic
news, Apple
reported its revenue fell in the
first quarter

04:52.526 --> 04:57.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the first time in 13 years.
The company
was hurt by falling sales of
iPhones. And

04:57.531 --> 04:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wall Street had a quiet day.

04:59.332 --> 05:03.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 13
points to close at 17990. The
Nasdaq fell

05:03.236 --> 05:06.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seven points, and the S&amp;P 500
added close
to four.

05:06.973 --> 05:12.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the Olympic
Flame visited
a refugee camp in Athens,
Greece, today, carried

05:12.579 --> 05:18.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a Syrian swimmer who's been
granted asylum
there. Ibrahim Al-Hussein lost
part of his

05:18.652 --> 05:24.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leg in a bombing. He carried the
flame through
a camp that holds around 1,500
people. He

05:25.091 --> 05:29.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hopes to compete with the Greek
team at the
Summer Games in Brazil.

05:29.129 --> 05:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
how today's elections will shape
the final

05:32.899 --> 05:38.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leg of the presidential primary;
Chernobyl's
impact 30 years later; practical
advice on

05:38.872 --> 05:45.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
preparing for life after
college; and much
more.

05:45.345 --> 05:58.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There was no
last-minute stumping
today by the Republican
candidates for president,

05:58.158 --> 06:02.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as voters in five Mid-Atlantic
states cast
their presidential primary
ballots.

06:02.696 --> 06:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was different, however, for
the two Democratic
contenders. Vermont Senator
Bernie Sanders,

06:07.667 --> 06:14.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the underdog in that race, was
courting voters
today in Philadelphia. That was
after he insisted,

06:14.107 --> 06:18.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on ABC this morning, that he
will keep on
campaigning at least into June.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
The election is not over yet. We
are here

06:22.849 --> 06:28.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today competing in five states.
We have 10
more states to go after this. We
are going

06:29.022 --> 06:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fight through California, and
then we see
what happens.

06:31.825 --> 06:37.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
Democratic front-runner,
Hillary Clinton, paid a visit to
a steel factory

06:37.230 --> 06:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Indiana, which votes next
Tuesday. There,
she backed away, once again,
from attacking

06:43.637 --> 06:47.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders, and instead aimed
criticism at two
of her Republican rivals.

06:47.507 --> 06:51.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm just bewildered when I hear
the Republican

06:51.478 --> 06:55.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
front-runner, Donald Trump,
actually say that
wages are too high in America.
That's why

06:55.782 --> 07:01.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he doesn't support raising the
minimum wage.
Ted Cruz has called for a
national right-to-work

07:01.488 --> 07:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law. Well, right-to-work is
wrong for workers
and it's wrong for America.

07:06.359 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on
tonight's Northeast
primary contests, we turn now to
Amy Walter,

07:11.631 --> 07:17.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national editor of The Cook
Political Report,
and, in Philadelphia, Dave
Davies. He's senior

07:17.203 --> 07:21.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reporter for public radio
station WHYY.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

07:23.643 --> 07:28.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Amy, start us off, and let's
talk about
the Republicans. Remind us how
many delegates

07:28.114 --> 07:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are up tonight, and what are
going to understand
after tonight's results?

07:31.384 --> 07:35.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
we have 172 delegates at stake.
The biggest

07:35.155 --> 07:40.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of those is Pennsylvania,
although the majority
of those delegates actually are
not bound

07:40.694 --> 07:44.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the winner. We can get to
that later on,
but the bottom line is there are
a lot of

07:44.297 --> 07:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big states in the Northeast up
today, and
Donald Trump is the favorite in
all of these

07:49.135 --> 07:50.904 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He can come out of this with a
pretty big
delegate haul. Now, this isn't
going to close

07:53.340 --> 08:00.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the door on any attempt to oust
him from the
ability to be the nominee, but
it's going

08:00.680 --> 08:06.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get really close to that door
coming close
to being shut. And then we're
going to focus

08:06.453 --> 08:11.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next on Indiana to see if the
momentum that
Trump -- if he does as well as
the polls say

08:11.391 --> 08:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's doing right now, if that
momentum carries
him to another victory in
Indiana.

08:15.729 --> 08:19.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I think we can pretty
confidently
say that Donald Trump is
probably going to

08:19.299 --> 08:22.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get to the 1,237 he needs before
we hit Cleveland.

08:22.635 --> 08:26.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Dave Davies,
a little bit
-- take us a little bit closer
into what's

08:26.606 --> 08:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been going on in Pennsylvania.
What kind of
campaign have you seen there?
And is the fact

08:31.611 --> 08:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that most of these Republican
delegates being
chosen tonight are not bound to
any candidate,

08:37.117 --> 08:38.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has that affected the campaign?

08:38.718 --> 08:41.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVE DAVIES, WHYY: Oh, yes, it's
created a
lot of confusion.

08:41.321 --> 08:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Pennsylvania has a
pretty peculiar
system. There are really going
to be two elections

08:45.091 --> 08:49.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. One will be the election
for the popular
vote. And the winner of that
will get 17 of

08:49.529 --> 08:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those of those delegates on a
winner-take-all
basis.

08:53.533 --> 08:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the others, most of the
delegation will
go to Cleveland uncommitted.
They will be

08:58.772 --> 09:03.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elected directly by voters,
three per congressional
district, and they will go
uncommitted to

09:03.376 --> 09:08.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the convention, but, in fact,
many are privately
deeply committed to candidates.
Many were

09:08.982 --> 09:11.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recruited by the Trump or Cruz
campaigns.

09:11.918 --> 09:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tough thing for voters here
is that nothing
on the ballot tells them who is
for whom.

09:18.391 --> 09:23.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You may want to vote for Trump
delegates,
but you can't tell from the
ballot. So we

09:23.129 --> 09:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have had this crazy period where
the campaigns
have been distributing lists
through e-mail

09:27.667 --> 09:30.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and robo-calls and even lawn
signs.

09:30.603 --> 09:33.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's likely to happen is
we're going
to end up at the end of the day
with a lot

09:33.606 --> 09:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of confusion. We will have some
Trump delegation
elected out of those 54, some
Cruz, and then

09:39.379 --> 09:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot will be party regulars,
some of whom
say they will abide by the
popular vote. Some

09:44.818 --> 09:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them say they're going to
make their decision
later.

09:47.620 --> 09:53.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In any case, we will have 10
weeks in which
any of them may be persuaded to
change their

09:53.259 --> 09:54.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
minds.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, how did the
system get
to be so crazy? This is supposed
to be an

09:57.730 --> 10:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election. You go, you vote. But,
instead,
as we just heard from Dave, I
mean, some of

10:02.368 --> 10:04.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these rules are really hard to
understand.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, every state --
I mean, this
is what we're learning again.
Every four years,

10:07.140 --> 10:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we get a reintroduction into how
the process
really works.

10:10.777 --> 10:16.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're learning in this
stage is that
the Republican primary process
is really a

10:16.783 --> 10:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crazy patchwork quilt. Every
state has its
own rules. Some states, like
Pennsylvania,

10:21.488 --> 10:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are unbound, but you know
who they're
running -- or who they're
supporting. It's

10:25.792 --> 10:28.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in parentheses next to their
name.

10:28.127 --> 10:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that Dave brings up
a very good
point, which is that there is
going to be

10:31.798 --> 10:36.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a ton of confusion. These
delegates are also
going to get an incredible
amount of pressure.

10:36.336 --> 10:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we forget that these are
actual human
beings that have to go back to
these communities

10:41.241 --> 10:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once the primary season, once
the convention
is over.

10:44.444 --> 10:48.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so while they may be
publicly saying or
declaring who they're supporting
or telling

10:48.948 --> 10:52.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporters what they're going to
do, they're
going to be getting a great deal
of pressure

10:52.685 --> 10:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just from the people in their
own lives to
figure out what they're going to
do.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:57.290 --> 10:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dave, go ahead.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVE DAVIES: One issue, in
Pennsylvania, they
are not in -- the presidential
candidates

11:00.360 --> 11:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not in parentheses next to
the delegate
names.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right. That's
right.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVE DAVIES: They're only under
their own
names. So, it really is
confusing.

11:05.765 --> 11:08.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the way this happened in
Pennsylvania
was, years ago, the party
leaders decided

11:08.635 --> 11:14.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if -- we come so late in the
primary process
in April, we usually don't
matter. If we have

11:14.274 --> 11:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the public elect our delegates,
but they're
really going to be our own
people, because

11:18.044 --> 11:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who pays attention to these
invisible elections,
we will go to the convention
with 54 uncommitted

11:23.917 --> 11:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegates, so if there's a fight
about anything,
the platform plank or whatever,
we have got

11:28.288 --> 11:30.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leverage.

11:30.256 --> 11:33.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, this year, they might have
some leverage
on something much more
important, if, if Indiana

11:33.860 --> 11:37.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes differently. As Amy says,
we could be
at a point where this thing
could be over

11:37.597 --> 11:39.365 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
soon.

11:39.465 --> 11:41.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it does add
credence to
that argument we hear from the
candidates,

11:42.068 --> 11:46.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and specifically Donald Trump,
Amy, that this
process isn't always on the
level.

11:46.940 --> 11:51.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, so let's switch over to the
Democrats.
Amy, what are we looking at in
these five

11:51.244 --> 11:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states between Hillary Clinton
and Bernie
Sanders?

11:52.979 --> 11:54.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're looking at 384 delegates,
again, another
big haul, with Pennsylvania,
Maryland two

11:58.518 --> 12:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the biggest states, Hillary
Clinton up
in both of those states. But
this is really

12:02.589 --> 12:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- for Bernie Sanders, this
really could be
the end of the line. It's going
to be almost

12:07.894 --> 12:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impossible for him to catch up
if she does
as well as predicted by the
polling.

12:13.032 --> 12:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question I think we're
going to be
talking about tomorrow is, where
does Bernie

12:17.437 --> 12:22.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders go now? We have been
hearing the questions
about, what is his off-ramp?
What is he going

12:22.308 --> 12:27.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do after it becomes clear
that he can't
catch Hillary Clinton? Is his
tone going to

12:27.246 --> 12:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change? Is his focus going to
change?

12:29.816 --> 12:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is he going to be spending
the rest of
his time doing, and how is he
going to get

12:33.853 --> 12:39.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
those people who have so
fervently supported
him to turn and support a
candidate that he's

12:39.425 --> 12:42.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been attacking pretty strongly
throughout
this campaign?

12:42.362 --> 12:46.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dave Davies, how
you have seen
that play out in Pennsylvania?
What are voters

12:46.633 --> 12:52.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- what have voters been looking
to Sanders
and to Hillary Clinton to tell
them?

12:52.538 --> 12:56.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVE DAVIES: Hillary is
enormously popular
here, and her campaign has
poured it on.

12:56.743 --> 13:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen Hillary and Bill
and Chelsea
and the countless surrogates and
field offices

13:00.947 --> 13:04.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and commercials. And I think
that she wants
to get a huge win here. But
Sanders just simply

13:04.917 --> 13:08.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not so well-known to people,
particularly
in the African-American
community, and that's

13:08.688 --> 13:12.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to make it hard for him to
rack up a
respectable total.

13:12.291 --> 13:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that what he and his
people are
about goes beyond an election
cycle. I think

13:17.030 --> 13:23.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they really do believe that we
need transformational
change in the country, and they
think that

13:23.636 --> 13:28.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using the rest of this election
campaign to
raise that issue just as
strongly as they

13:28.941 --> 13:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have is what they want to do,
whether or not
he has a good showing at the
convention.

13:34.747 --> 13:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I kind of don't think it's
going to change
that much. And I think --
eventually, I think

13:39.252 --> 13:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he will support Hillary, and a
lot of his
supporters will follow her. But
I wouldn't

13:43.623 --> 13:46.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expect the tone of things to
change that much
before the convention.

13:46.659 --> 13:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, that's a
really good point,
because let's remember Bernie
Sanders is not

13:50.630 --> 13:55.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a Democrat. He only just
recently announced
his allegiance to the party.

13:55.802 --> 14:00.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These primaries, as we're
learning now, they
are all about the party trying
to exert some

14:00.540 --> 14:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control over the process. And at
the end of
the day, the thinking is, well,
everybody

14:05.278 --> 14:08.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a member of the party, they
want to help
the party, and help the party's
nominee. Well,

14:09.015 --> 14:10.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that only goes so far.

14:11.017 --> 14:15.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in this case, of course,
you have a candidate
who, I agree with Dave that he
is much more

14:15.588 --> 14:19.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a movement than he is
about protecting
the party. Now, he's obviously
going to want

14:19.692 --> 14:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do anything he can to stop
the Republicans
from winning, but that's very
different from

14:24.731 --> 14:29.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
marshaling his forces and
embracing the front-runner
on the Democratic side.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in just a few seconds, we're
also going
to be looking to see -- you
mentioned, we're

14:33.005 --> 14:35.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking to see what Bernie
Sanders does from
here. And we're also going to be
looking to

14:35.942 --> 14:40.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see what Hillary Clinton does
from here on
out. How does she -- does she
change her message?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does she hone it? What argument
does make?

14:42.582 --> 14:44.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

14:44.550 --> 14:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has to make the argument
that she speaks
for the entire Democratic base,
but also that

14:48.154 --> 14:53.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she can win over the independent
voters that
right now are giving her very
high negative

14:53.359 --> 14:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marks across the board, and
she's losing those
independent-leaning Democrats to
Bernie Sanders.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter, Dave
Davies with
WHYY, we thank you.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVE DAVIES: Thank you.

15:03.402 --> 15:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

15:10.977 --> 15:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, 30 years
on from the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the
fallout from

15:21.554 --> 15:26.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that fateful day still haunts
Europe as a
somber anniversary is marked.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(BELL TOLLING)

15:29.262 --> 15:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Bells tolled
30 times in
Kiev, once for each year since
the world's

15:35.835 --> 15:38.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
worst nuclear disaster.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president of Ukraine spoke
at Chernobyl
itself.

15:40.807 --> 15:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETRO POROSHENKO, Ukrainian
President (through
translator): The Chernobyl
accident will for

15:45.711 --> 15:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a long time remain an event of a
worldwide
scale that is a challenge to the
whole of

15:51.217 --> 15:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
humanity. Such catastrophes do
not respect
state borders.

15:54.220 --> 15:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The city of
Pripyat, where
the nuclear plant was located,
is now a ghost

15:59.725 --> 16:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town. It sits in the middle of
an uninhabitable
exclusion zone, where hundreds
of towns and

16:04.997 --> 16:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
villages in Ukraine and Belarus
were forced
to evacuate.

16:09.335 --> 16:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ukraine was still part of the
old Soviet Union
when Chernobyl's number four
reactor suffered

16:13.873 --> 16:22.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a catastrophic power surge on
April 26, 1986.
That triggered a meltdown and
explosion, spewing

16:22.148 --> 16:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
huge amounts of radioactive
material into
the atmosphere. Millions of
people across

16:27.353 --> 16:30.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eastern Europe were exposed to
dangerously
high radiation.

16:31.023 --> 16:36.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it took two days for Soviet
authorities
to acknowledge the incident
publicly. Some

16:36.329 --> 16:42.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
600,000 troops and volunteers
were sent in
to fight the fire and clean up
contamination,

16:42.335 --> 16:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and 30 died from radiation
poisoning.

16:45.004 --> 16:49.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I went
in there
when everyone was fleeing. We
were going right

16:49.842 --> 16:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the heat. And, today,
everything is forgotten.
It's a disgrace.

16:53.813 --> 16:58.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The stricken
reactor was
encased in a concrete
sarcophagus. Work is

16:59.085 --> 17:04.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now under way on a steel-clad
structure to
enclose the site and prevent
further radioactive

17:04.757 --> 17:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaks, at a cost of more than $2
billion.

17:08.060 --> 17:13.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The human toll is less clear,
but the World
Health Organization estimates
long-term radiation

17:13.132 --> 17:17.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effects will claim at least
9,000 lives.

17:17.403 --> 17:22.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some further perspective on the
impact of
Chernobyl, first more on the
science, consequences,

17:22.808 --> 17:27.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fears and risks of nuclear power
from our
science correspondent, Miles
O'Brien, who's

17:27.113 --> 17:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done extensive reporting in
Chernobyl and
at the more recent accident site
in Fukushima,

17:31.183 --> 17:33.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Japan.

17:33.152 --> 17:36.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles, you're one of the few
people that have
gone to both of these places.
You were reporting

17:36.155 --> 17:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Chernobyl just four or five
years ago.
Put this disaster in
perspective.

17:41.694 --> 17:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, Hari,
Chernobyl, by any
measure, had a greater impact.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the radiation released
from Chernobyl
was about six times greater than
what we saw

17:53.572 --> 17:58.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
released from Fukushima. Both of
them were
so-called level seven accidents,
which is

17:58.177 --> 18:02.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the worst kind of accident on
the scale that
the international community puts
upon them.

18:02.982 --> 18:09.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Chernobyl, because it had an
explosion
and a fire, caused the spread of
radioactive

18:09.622 --> 18:14.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
material over a much broader
area. Much of
Europe was affected by it. And
so it had a

18:15.061 --> 18:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tremendous impact, not only
potentially health-wise,
but also politically and
emotionally, and

18:21.334 --> 18:23.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had a great impact on how people
viewed nuclear
power.

18:24.036 --> 18:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right. I mean,
Americans
remember sort of Three Mile
Island, but Chernobyl

18:28.174 --> 18:31.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was as important in the timeline
of how the
world perceives it.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans had sort of made up
their mind about
nuclear power already. We made
up our mind

18:36.315 --> 18:39.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in the mid-'70s that we
were scared of
it, "China Syndrome" and then,
of course,

18:39.318 --> 18:41.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Three Mile Island.

18:41.187 --> 18:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, Three Mile Island,
there was a
barely measurable amount of
radiation that

18:45.524 --> 18:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
escaped from the containment
vessel. In the
case of Chernobyl, there was no
containment

18:49.829 --> 18:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vessel whatsoever. And so there
was a big
amount of radiation which came
out.

18:54.433 --> 19:00.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it really laid the
groundwork for the
reaction that many Europeans had
toward Fukushima

19:00.306 --> 19:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
25 years later. You saw the
Germans, most
notably, pulling the plug on
their nuclear

19:04.944 --> 19:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program. A lot of that has its
roots in the
fact they were under a cloud of
cesium-137

19:09.482 --> 19:11.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
30 years ago.

19:11.584 --> 19:15.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That
sarcophagus that you
mentioned, that was only
supposed to be there

19:15.421 --> 19:18.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
15 years. It's still there now,
and it's still
leaking.

19:19.091 --> 19:24.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It is. And seeing
it with my
own two eyes five years ago, I
was -- it was

19:24.330 --> 19:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pretty scary, frankly. It looked
like something
from "Mad Max."

19:28.901 --> 19:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was hastily built, to say
the least,
by these liquidators, true
heroes, 600,000

19:34.507 --> 19:38.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conscripts who went in there and
shoveled
for short periods of time, many
of them with

19:38.377 --> 19:44.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devastating consequences later
in the form
of cancer. And it is still
there. It is not

19:44.283 --> 19:46.018 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
safe.

19:46.118 --> 19:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this new structure which
eventually will
cover will be an improvement,
for sure.

19:48.687 --> 19:52.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, where is
nuclear now,
five years after Fukushima, 30
years after

19:52.491 --> 19:54.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Chernobyl?

19:54.460 --> 19:57.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's interesting,
Hari. Things
have changed a little bit on
people's perceptive

19:57.830 --> 19:59.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of nuclear.

19:59.799 --> 20:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's easy to take Chernobyl out
of the mix,
for one thing. That was a bad
reactor design.

20:04.236 --> 20:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can all agree it was unsafe
to have any
reactor without a containment
structure. There

20:08.107 --> 20:13.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are still 11 of those types of
reactors running
in Russia now. But the West
never adopted

20:13.746 --> 20:17.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this type of graphite, moderated
reactor.

20:17.349 --> 20:22.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So what has happened,
interestingly, even
five years after Fukushima, is a
lot of people

20:22.988 --> 20:28.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are coming around to the
conclusion that in
order to truly fight climate
change, the type

20:28.861 --> 20:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of base load power, power that
stays on all
the time, at night, that is zero
carbon emission,

20:35.968 --> 20:37.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is in fact nuclear.

20:37.903 --> 20:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's interest in the
business community
in this. A D.C. think tank
recently conducted

20:42.074 --> 20:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a study. They found 50 start-ups
in the U.S.
in the nuclear space attracting
$1.5 billion

20:48.147 --> 20:51.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in investment. So, it's kind of
an odd outcome,
actually.

20:51.183 --> 20:54.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
science correspondent
Miles O'Brien joining us from
Boston tonight,

20:54.553 --> 20:55.221 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

20:55.321 --> 20:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome.

20:57.223 --> 21:01.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now an
on-the-ground look.
We get that from Michal
Huniewicz, a Polish

21:01.427 --> 21:06.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
photographer living in England.
He visited
Chernobyl last year and
documented the effects

21:06.165 --> 21:10.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the radiation on surrounding
villages,
plants, and animals.

21:10.336 --> 21:14.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was personal for and you
your family.
Tell me a little bit about how
they were affected

21:14.607 --> 21:16.342 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after the blast.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAL HUNIEWICZ, Photographer:
I was 2 years
old when it happened, so I don't
remember

21:18.577 --> 21:20.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a great deal.

21:20.446 --> 21:23.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I do know from my
parents was that,
when I was 2 years old, someone
knocked on

21:24.049 --> 21:30.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our door in the middle of the
night and woke
up my parents. And they had to
wake me up

21:30.122 --> 21:34.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and give me something to drink,
which was
called the Lugol's solution, but
we didn't

21:34.693 --> 21:36.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know at the time exactly what it
was.

21:36.662 --> 21:39.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they didn't offer any
explanation to my
parents, other than, there was
some sort of

21:40.032 --> 21:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
environmental problem, and your
son, due to
his very young age, has to drink
it.

21:44.403 --> 21:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After that, they disappeared,
because they
had to distribute it to other
children. It

21:48.140 --> 21:52.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was only for people who were
very young, because,
when you're done, your thyroid
is unable to

21:52.278 --> 21:57.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
handle large doses of radiation.
If you're
a grownup, it is -- so it was
distributed

21:57.516 --> 21:59.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to children like myself.

21:59.385 --> 22:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tell me a bit
about some
of the pictures that stand out
for you. I'm

22:02.188 --> 22:08.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking at a photo of a piano
that was left
in the same place. It looks like
a hospital

22:08.160 --> 22:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
infirmary and then what would be
baby bassinets.

22:11.263 --> 22:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAL HUNIEWICZ: That was in a
place called
the Piano Shop. It wasn't
actually a piano

22:14.934 --> 22:19.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shop in reality. That is just
the nickname
that the place was given.

22:19.104 --> 22:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of those places which
contains objects
which were never taken away.
There was quite

22:23.142 --> 22:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a large number of pianos. And
maybe you can
still play them, although I
suspect they are

22:27.313 --> 22:29.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of tune by now.

22:29.215 --> 22:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hospital that you mentioned
was probably
the most eerie place, because we
do know for

22:34.286 --> 22:39.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fact that there was where the
firefighters
were taken right after the
accident when they

22:39.758 --> 22:45.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
felt sick. They were brought to
the Moscow
hospital. They were shaved,
stripped. And

22:45.397 --> 22:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later, they would be taken to
the Moscow Hospital
Number Six, which specializes in
radiation

22:50.936 --> 22:54.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
poisoning, acute radiation
poisoning.

22:54.673 --> 23:00.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the gear that those
firefighters were
wearing was dumped into basement
of the hospital.

23:00.179 --> 23:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That basement is pretty much
freely available.
It's probably one of the most
contaminated

23:04.683 --> 23:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
places on the planet, and you
can just walk
in there.

23:08.254 --> 23:16.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a piece of headgear was
dragged up from
the basement to the lobby of
that building

23:16.795 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by someone. And it's lying on a
ledge, and
it's very highly radioactive.
So, there is

23:22.067 --> 23:28.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a picture of my hand with a
dosing meter getting
close to that piece of headgear.
I was really

23:28.674 --> 23:32.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stressed, because the dosing
meter was very
loud. It was telling us, don't
go any nearer.

23:32.778 --> 23:37.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was very highly radioactive.
So, that's
one of the most memorable
moments for me,

23:37.716 --> 23:39.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it was my hand close to
that object.

23:39.652 --> 23:44.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, it
looks like Mother
Nature is winning. I mean,
everything that's

23:45.090 --> 23:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unclaimed is being taken over by
plants.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAL HUNIEWICZ: That's right.

23:49.828 --> 23:54.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would imagine that the zone
would be destroyed
with nuclear fallout, but,
actually, it's

23:54.300 --> 24:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
become more of a sanctuary for
wildlife. There
is the Przewalski horses which
were brought

24:00.773 --> 24:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the accident, and half of
them died.
They didn't adjust. But the
other half has

24:05.477 --> 24:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lived and they remain in the
zone.

24:07.846 --> 24:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They live wild. People do hunt
them, but they're
more or less allowed to live
undisturbed.

24:14.086 --> 24:19.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, indeed, the number of those
animals has
been growing, and they are doing
perfectly

24:19.892 --> 24:21.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

24:21.794 --> 24:27.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke to a scientist who
worked in the zone
trying to establish what the
impact was of

24:27.700 --> 24:32.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
radiation on those animal
species. And he
told me it was minuscule. There
was nothing

24:32.171 --> 24:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he could detect. So, the
animals and
the plants live there without
any problems.

24:37.776 --> 24:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are much better off without
humans.

24:39.845 --> 24:45.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you said, they are
taking over the
zone. There are trees growing
inside of buildings.

24:45.317 --> 24:49.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I suspect, within a few
decades, there
will be not much left of the
zone, other than

24:49.822 --> 24:50.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the nuclear plant itself.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

24:52.558 --> 24:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Photographer Michal Huniewicz,
joining us
from London tonight, thanks so
much.

24:56.395 --> 25:06.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAL HUNIEWICZ: Thank you for
having me.

25:06.905 --> 25:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:10.743 --> 25:16.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

by choices made before students
even enroll,

25:33.665 --> 25:36.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and why it can matter for their
financial
futures.

25:36.368 --> 25:40.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
education segment,
Making the Grade.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William Brangham has our
conversation.

25:42.941 --> 25:46.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a big week for high school
seniors across
the country. They have got to
make those final

25:46.712 --> 25:51.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decisions on where they will go
to college
next year. To celebrate,
celebrities and athletes

25:51.717 --> 25:55.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
joined first lady Michelle Obama
for a signing
day ceremony in New York City
today.

25:55.120 --> 26:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA, First Lady: No
matter what
path any of us on the stage took
to our success,

26:01.193 --> 26:07.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we all know that completing your
education
past high school is the most
important thing

26:07.299 --> 26:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can do to reach your dreams.
That's why
we're here. So, while you all
might be in

26:12.204 --> 26:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
awe of us, let me tell you, we
are in awe
of you.

26:16.842 --> 26:20.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: High schoolers
and their
parents are obviously focused on
what school

26:20.379 --> 26:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they will go to, but a new book
argues there
are more important things to
consider.

26:25.217 --> 26:29.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The book is called "There Is
Life After College."
Jeffrey Selingo is the author. I
talked with

26:29.955 --> 26:31.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him yesterday.

26:31.757 --> 26:35.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff, if I can discern a basic
thesis from
you book, it's not so much where
you go to

26:35.794 --> 26:38.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college, but it's what you do
while you're
in college. Is that right?

26:38.997 --> 26:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY SELINGO, Author, "There
Is Life After
College": That's right.

26:40.966 --> 26:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It used to be as long that, as
you had a bachelor's
degree from a college, any
college, really,

26:45.070 --> 26:49.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you would be golden in the job
market. It
was really the way that you got
jobs years

26:49.408 --> 26:51.310 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now the fact of the matter
is that there's
a lot of noise around the signal
of a bachelor's

26:53.846 --> 26:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
degree. So it's really important
what you
do while you're there, the
experiential learning

26:57.416 --> 27:03.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you get, internships,
projects, study
abroad, and activities like
that, cocurricular

27:03.989 --> 27:05.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
activities, whether it's
athletics or clubs.

27:05.924 --> 27:09.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, most importantly, you don't
take on too
much debt. The more debt that
you take on

27:09.695 --> 27:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in college, the fewer options
you have after
college to take essentially any
job you want

27:14.366 --> 27:17.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anywhere in the country, which
would be good
for your career, and instead
you're basing

27:17.803 --> 27:20.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your career decisions on how
much money you're
going to make.

27:20.506 --> 27:24.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In one of the
early chapters
of your book, you categorize
graduates after

27:24.877 --> 27:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
college into three categories.

27:26.745 --> 27:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have the sprinters, the
wanderers, and
the stragglers. What do those
delineations

27:31.250 --> 27:33.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tell us about post-college life
today?

27:33.919 --> 27:36.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY SELINGO: Well, it used
to be that,
again, as long as you went to
college, you

27:36.822 --> 27:39.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were a sprinter. You would come
out of college
and you would have a job. You
would usually

27:39.858 --> 27:44.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
work in one occupation,
sometimes for one
employer, for most cases.

27:44.963 --> 27:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact of the matter is
that only about
a third of students now launch
from college

27:48.800 --> 27:54.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that way. So two-thirds are
either wanderers
or the stragglers. They take
half their 20s

27:54.406 --> 27:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get going in a career. In
some cases, those
are the wanderers. In other
cases, they're

27:59.311 --> 28:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stragglers, and they take most
of their 20s.

28:01.313 --> 28:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what are the markers of
those different
people? Well, for one thing,
sprinters intern

28:06.251 --> 28:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least 80 percent of the time
in college.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: While they are
in college?

28:10.355 --> 28:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY SELINGO: Yes, 80 percent
have at least
one internship while in college,
as opposed

28:15.260 --> 28:19.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the wanderers. Only about 50
percent of
them intern. And the stragglers,
only about

28:19.765 --> 28:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
20 percent of them intern.

28:21.600 --> 28:26.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other big marker is debt.
So, sprinters
have less than $10,000 worth of
debt when

28:26.572 --> 28:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they come out of college. The
average today
is about $30,000. The more you
debt you have,

28:31.109 --> 28:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the fewer options you have after
college.

28:33.712 --> 28:37.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other big marker of the
stragglers is,
99 percent of them have some
college credit,

28:37.849 --> 28:42.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but they don't yet have a
degree. And this
is one of the bigger concerns
right now, is

28:42.220 --> 28:47.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that 70 percent of students go
right on to
college after high school, but
only about

28:47.626 --> 28:49.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
50 percent of them end up
graduating.

28:49.861 --> 28:54.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So we have a number of
millennials now with
some college credit and no
degree. And, in

28:54.399 --> 28:58.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact, they make up the bulk of
people today
in the United States who have
some college

28:58.537 --> 29:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
credit and no degree to show for
their efforts.

29:01.039 --> 29:05.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You report
that a lot of
employers feel like colleges are
not doing

29:05.277 --> 29:10.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very good job of preparing
graduates for
the work world. You quote one
employer saying

29:10.949 --> 29:13.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that these student have been
syllabused to
death. What does that mean?

29:13.952 --> 29:17.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY SELINGO: It means that
college has
a certain cadence to it, right?

29:17.222 --> 29:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You start in September, you end
in May, you
get a syllabus and a course
catalog at the

29:21.660 --> 29:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning of the semester. It
kind of lays
out what you need to do. The
syllabus tells

29:25.163 --> 29:29.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you when things are due, when
papers are due,
when tests are due. It's
essentially a recipe

29:29.701 --> 29:31.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get an A.

29:31.536 --> 29:33.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have plenty of breaks.
There's a certain
cadence to it. Then these
students get into

29:34.072 --> 29:39.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the work force, and the work
force is a mash-up
of activities. You know, it's
not task-based

29:39.611 --> 29:42.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anymore. It used to be that
jobs, you would
get a list of things to do every
day, you

29:43.081 --> 29:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would clock in at 9:00 and clock
out at 5:00.
No job works like that anymore,
but yet our

29:47.753 --> 29:50.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
education system is still very
task-based
in that way.

29:50.956 --> 29:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But you write
also that
employers as a whole often feel
that colleges

29:55.627 --> 29:58.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be doing a better job of
this, but
the colleges push back and say,
no, these

29:58.630 --> 30:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies are simply offshoring
and making
us job-train them, when that
should be their

30:03.068 --> 30:04.202 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who should -- where should this
responsibility
lay?

30:06.138 --> 30:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY SELINGO: Well, really,
the responsibility
lies really with all three
groups.

30:09.441 --> 30:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really lies with colleges to
give people
both the broad skills they need
to succeed

30:14.880 --> 30:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only in the workplace of
today, but tomorrow,
but also to give them some
opportunities for

30:19.351 --> 30:23.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hands-on training. And it's also
lies with
the students to go out and get
that. Many

30:23.789 --> 30:26.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students just sleepwalk through
college. They
go there and they think college
is going to

30:26.892 --> 30:28.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happen to them.

30:28.827 --> 30:33.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it's also the role of
the employers.
And many employers are not --
they are kind

30:33.565 --> 30:37.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of -- they confuse students on
this front.
In other words, you have the
CEOs of some

30:37.369 --> 30:41.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies saying, go out and get
a broad liberal
arts education and then we will
train you

30:41.339 --> 30:43.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when you get here.

30:43.308 --> 30:47.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then the people hiring at
employers, either
the line managers or the chief
H.R. officers,

30:47.312 --> 30:50.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are then telling students, we
need specific
skills. We need you to have
specific skills.

30:50.749 --> 30:54.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: If you were to
build a recipe
for the things that college
students really

30:54.453 --> 30:59.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to be focused on to do to
succeed in
however you want to categorize
success, what

30:59.658 --> 31:01.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are some of those things?

31:01.593 --> 31:04.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY SELINGO: When students
are picking
a college, they should pick a
place, a campus

31:04.296 --> 31:08.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and even a city or an urban area
where they
are going to be able to get
hands-on opportunity.

31:08.834 --> 31:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if they go to a place in a
faraway place,
they should figure out, how am I
going to

31:12.404 --> 31:16.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get those hands-on experience?
So, it's not
just about what you get in the
classroom,

31:16.408 --> 31:18.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's also important what you
get outside
the classroom.

31:19.044 --> 31:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second piece, don't take on too
much debt.
Make sure you go to a place
where you're going

31:22.214 --> 31:26.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to graduate, hopefully in four
years, and
where you're not going to take
on too much

31:26.485 --> 31:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debt. And then the third piece
is picking
a major.

31:29.187 --> 31:32.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some ways, it doesn't matter
what major
you pick, because most careers
are not related

31:32.491 --> 31:36.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to majors, but you should pick a
major where
you're going to work hard, where
you're going

31:36.762 --> 31:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to read a lot, where you're
going to write
a lot, where the homework is
going to be tough,

31:40.298 --> 31:43.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where you're going to meet some
of the best
professors and, most important,
where your

31:43.401 --> 31:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
classmates are going to push
you.

31:45.203 --> 31:48.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: When there is
such a focus
on figuring out what your career
is going

31:48.373 --> 31:52.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be, and trying to be one of
those sprinters
who dives right into it right
away, is there

31:52.244 --> 31:57.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the risk that we might be losing
some of the
more -- some of the richer
experiences of

31:57.249 --> 32:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
college, to learn how to think,
how to open
your mind, to explore, to simply
grow up into

32:01.386 --> 32:02.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a human being?

32:02.821 --> 32:05.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY SELINGO: It used to be
that college
was for exploration.

32:05.724 --> 32:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea was that you would go
to college,
explore for four years, get that
broad education,

32:09.728 --> 32:13.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then move into the work
force and get
specific training. Now much of
that is supposed

32:13.832 --> 32:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to happen in those four years of
college.

32:15.801 --> 32:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem with exploring too
much in college
is, it's very expensive. The
cost of college

32:19.771 --> 32:24.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has gone way up. Half of
students don't end
up graduating. A third of
students end up

32:24.676 --> 32:29.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transferring institutions. So,
there's a lot
of friction in the system that
we have today.

32:29.781 --> 32:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why a lot of this
exploration,
trying to figure out what you
want out of

32:33.652 --> 32:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life, trying to figure out a
career should
actually happen outside of the
walls of college,

32:38.723 --> 32:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this idea of taking a gap year
between high
school and college or even
taking time off

32:43.528 --> 32:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in college to try to find
yourself, to try
to find a career, because the
more that happens

32:48.300 --> 32:52.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in college, the fewer
experiences you're going
to have outside the classroom,
because you're

32:52.838 --> 32:55.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be so focused on those
inside-the-classroom
experiences.

32:55.373 --> 32:56.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Jeff Selingo.

32:57.075 --> 32:58.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The book is "There Is Life After
College."

32:59.044 --> 33:00.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY SELINGO: It was great to
be here.
Thank you.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Later tonight,
PBS' new debate
program, "Point Taken," asks, is
a college

33:08.520 --> 33:15.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
degree worth the price tag?
Check your local
listings.

33:15.493 --> 33:27.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even with
advances in technology,
farmers are continuing to look
for ways to

33:27.339 --> 33:33.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cut energy costs. Fuel and
electricity are
the main big-ticket items, but
there are others.

33:33.678 --> 33:38.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Harvest Public Media in
Nebraska, Grant
Gerlock looks at some of the
many ways farmers

33:38.750 --> 33:42.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are trying to keep fossil fuel
usage down
in the cornfield.

33:42.487 --> 33:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: Greg and Sandy
Brummond live
and work on their farm in
Northeast Nebraska,

33:47.325 --> 33:50.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just outside the town of Craig.

33:50.528 --> 34:03.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG BRUMMOND, Farmer: This is
our shop that
we do most of our repair work,
and just literally

34:03.942 --> 34:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about live up here for 10 hours
a day, it
seems like.

34:07.379 --> 34:11.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: This shop is the
epicenter
of the Brummond farm, and its
energy use.

34:11.850 --> 34:16.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the lights, machinery for
equipment repair
and other implements, it uses
more power than

34:16.855 --> 34:19.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their home. In fact, sometimes,
it is their
home.

34:20.091 --> 34:23.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDY BRUMMOND, Farmer: We
actually added
an office and a kitchen. We
don't even have

34:23.762 --> 34:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go back down to the house. We
can fully
function up here.

34:26.898 --> 34:32.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: It's like having
your house
on top of your shop and
everything. It's all

34:32.737 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that stuff that uses power that
you would
think of.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SANDY BRUMMOND: Oh yes, is in
here.

34:37.175 --> 34:41.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: The shop and its
high energy
needs are why the Brummonds made
a recent

34:41.379 --> 34:43.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investment in solar energy.

34:43.148 --> 34:47.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG BRUMMOND: We have got 36
panels down
there. The angle was good for
the sun.

34:47.919 --> 34:52.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: These panels are
capable of
supplying 10 kilowatts, enough
power for all

34:52.490 --> 34:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those lights and machines in the
shop. They
were put up a few months ago by
Graham Christensen,

34:57.395 --> 34:59.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who runs a small business
installing solar
panels.

34:59.564 --> 35:04.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG BRUMMOND: Well, you can see
even on today,
which is a cloudy day outside,
we're still

35:04.869 --> 35:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
producing 506 watts of energy
currently. We'd
like to see it more up around
that seven to

35:11.042 --> 35:12.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
12 points.

35:12.911 --> 35:16.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: Christensen grew
up on a farm
in Burt County, not far from the
Brummonds.

35:16.648 --> 35:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, he's back in the area
with an electrician
to survey another farm looking
to cut energy

35:21.353 --> 35:23.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
costs.

35:23.188 --> 35:25.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN ANDERSON, Nebraska: Down
this side of
the lane, we might put in some
geothermal

35:25.123 --> 35:26.925 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wells.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: Kevin Anderson
would like to
install enough solar panels to
generate 25

35:29.494 --> 35:31.196 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kilowatts.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRAHAM CHRISTENSEN, President,
GC Resolve:
Basically, with 25 kilowatts, it
would get

35:33.131 --> 35:38.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soaked up right into these
buildings, this
grain elevator, all the fans on
the grain

35:38.169 --> 35:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elevator. The dryer that they
have connected
there, I believe is electrical.
And all the

35:45.176 --> 35:48.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out-buildings around, and then
as well as
their home.

35:48.213 --> 35:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the energy that the solar
panels would
produce would just get sucked up
right into

35:52.417 --> 35:54.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this area right here.

35:54.552 --> 35:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: Federal tax
credits and government
grants are making renewable
energy more affordable.

35:58.857 --> 36:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Solar is the popular choice for
farmers looking
to cut energy expenditures.

36:02.994 --> 36:09.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to a 2013 USDA report
on agriculture
and energy, 93 percent of farms
that produce

36:09.634 --> 36:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
renewable energy use solar.
Anderson wants
to take advantage of the
financial incentives

36:17.175 --> 36:19.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while they are available, but
that isn't his
only motivation.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN ANDERSON: It seems like,
as you get
a little older, you get a little
more concerned

36:22.580 --> 36:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it, legacy we're leaving
our kids and
what type of environment they're
going to

36:26.384 --> 36:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
live in, grandkids, their kids.
I think it's
the right thing to do.

36:29.888 --> 36:34.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: Back on the
Brummonds' farm,
they have got hopes of adding
more panels

36:34.559 --> 36:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and using less energy from the
local utility,
which generates power mostly
from coal.

36:39.597 --> 36:44.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG BRUMMOND: And I flew over
Gillette, Wyoming,
and that's where a lot of our
coal comes from.

36:44.202 --> 36:48.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to get that perspective of
looking over
those humongous holes in the
ground where

36:48.907 --> 36:53.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the coal is taken out, I was
like, wow, I
wonder when this is going to run
out.

36:53.545 --> 37:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: U.S. agriculture
used around
1,600 trillion BTUs of energy in
2011, enough

37:00.351 --> 37:05.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to power the energy needs for a
state the
size of Iowa or South Carolina
for a year.

37:06.024 --> 37:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of that energy is for
direct uses, such
as electricity for buildings or
gasoline for

37:11.362 --> 37:13.264 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tractors.

37:13.364 --> 37:17.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But farms also use a lot of a
energy in indirect
ways. For instance, farmers
apply synthetic

37:17.368 --> 37:22.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fertilizers containing nitrogen
to keep plants
healthy, allowing crops such as
corn to show

37:22.607 --> 37:29.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big yields every year. But most
nitrogen fertilizer
production comes from natural
gas. After fuel

37:29.347 --> 37:34.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for trucks and tractors,
fertilizer is the
second largest energy component
on farms and

37:34.886 --> 37:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of the biggest expenses for
farmers.

37:39.824 --> 37:44.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Bladen, Nebraska, Keith Berns
and his brother
Brian have developed a business
selling seeds

37:44.729 --> 37:49.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for plants that can restore soil
health and
curb a reliance on synthetic
fertilizers.

37:49.801 --> 37:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH BERNS, Business Owner: We
can produce,
you know, anywhere from 100
pounds to 200

37:54.305 --> 37:57.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pounds of nitrogen from a cover
crop.

37:57.308 --> 37:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: What are cover
crops, and why
are they called that?

38:00.078 --> 38:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH BERNS: Well, cover crops
are basically
crops that a farmer would plant
in between

38:06.317 --> 38:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
periods of their normal cash
crop. We're taking
that carbon dioxide out of the
atmosphere

38:12.290 --> 38:16.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we're putting that carbon
into the soil
through the photosynthetic
process. And that

38:17.095 --> 38:21.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carbon that gets put into the
soil is what
becomes the immediate food
source for all

38:21.232 --> 38:23.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these microorganisms.

38:23.101 --> 38:27.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: This is a winter oats. And
I pulled up
a chunk here just to show you
the roots.

38:27.805 --> 38:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH BERNS: Even without any
scientific equipment,
you can take a good, healthy
soil, and you

38:34.412 --> 38:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can smell it, and it just has
that really
good, earthy smell.

38:37.549 --> 38:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: Instead of yields
above the
ground, the Berns brothers point
to a harvest

38:41.653 --> 38:47.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking place below the ground,
carbon transferred
from the atmosphere, nitrogen
fixed in roots

38:47.125 --> 38:48.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and in soil.

38:48.993 --> 38:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH BERNS: This whole thing
right here is
very high in nitrogen. When it
decomposes

38:53.665 --> 38:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the spring, it will release
quite a bit
of nitrogen for my next corn
crop.

38:58.203 --> 39:03.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: With the right
cover crops,
farmers can grow more fertilizer
for themselves,

39:03.575 --> 39:06.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which means that much less needs
to come from
fossil fuels.

39:06.878 --> 39:12.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH BERNS: There's a lot of
petroleum, a
lot of oil needed to make any
type of fertilizer.

39:12.717 --> 39:16.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So any time we don't need it to
produce it,
we don't need it to haul it, we
don't need

39:16.821 --> 39:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it to apply it if we can grow it
naturally
through a cover crop.

39:20.358 --> 39:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: For farmers
across the country,
finding energy savings from
solar panels and

39:24.729 --> 39:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cover crops means it could take
fewer fossil
fuels to get food to your dinner
table.

JUDY WOODRUFF: It has been one
year since
Burundi's president, Pierre
Nkurunziza, announced

39:50.855 --> 39:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was running for a third term,
a move widely
considered unconstitutional. His
announcement

39:56.561 --> 40:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
triggered a failed coup, a
questioned election,
mass protests, and a violent
crackdown on

40:03.201 --> 40:04.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the opposition.

40:05.069 --> 40:12.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, at least 400 people
have been
killed and 3,500 arrested. More
than 220,000

40:12.277 --> 40:18.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people fled the country.
Divisions between
Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups
have characterized

40:18.216 --> 40:24.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past violence in Burundi, but,
on Sunday,
Marguerite Barankitse was
honored for her

40:24.622 --> 40:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work helping Burundian orphans
and refugees,
regardless of ethnicity. She
received a million

40:31.896 --> 40:37.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dollars from an Armenian group.
The money
will be donated to the
organization of her

40:37.502 --> 40:39.337 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
choice.

40:39.437 --> 40:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, ethnic identity can be a
matter of
life or death for Burundians,
even those outside

40:44.342 --> 40:46.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

with the Pulitzer Center on
Crisis Reporting,

40:51.382 --> 40:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found Burundian refugees 900
miles from home,
in Nairobi, Kenya, where they
thought they'd

40:58.122 --> 41:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be safe. But their enemies have
tracked them
down.

41:01.993 --> 41:07.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It's just past
midnight. We're
in Nairobi,, Kenya, and this
isn't only a

41:07.165 --> 41:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cornfield. This is a kind of
protection because,
right behind me, there's a house
full of men,

41:12.770 --> 41:18.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and all night, every night, two
of them are
in the field standing guard,
using old weapons

41:18.376 --> 41:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like a crowbar and a rusty
knife.

41:22.413 --> 41:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are too scared to sleep,
and too scared
to show their faces. They are
Burundian refugees

41:29.120 --> 41:31.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who say they're being hunted.

41:31.289 --> 41:36.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The men who are guarding the
house, can they
really defend you from the
people who are

41:37.028 --> 41:38.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hunting you?

41:38.830 --> 41:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
weapons you
see here can only be used
against the dogs

41:42.166 --> 41:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you hear barking. If there were
an enemy coming
here with a grenade or a machine
gun, we wouldn't

41:46.971 --> 41:48.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

41:55.346 --> 41:59.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with seven other refugees. It's
a 150-square-foot
church library.

41:59.917 --> 42:05.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
have no mattresses,
no food. As refugees, we can't
find jobs,

42:05.423 --> 42:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we are scared of being
arrested and sent
back from where we were.

42:09.227 --> 42:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Where they were
was Burundi's
capital, Bujumbura. A systematic
campaign

42:16.634 --> 42:21.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
targeted the government's
political opponents,
leaving some of their bodies in
the street.

42:21.506 --> 42:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. warns that President
Nkurunziza is
helping lead the country to a
second civil

42:25.843 --> 42:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war by transforming politics
into ethnic conflict
between Hutus and Tutsis. That's
the same

42:33.484 --> 42:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ethnic divide in Rwanda that
sparked the 1994
genocide.

42:38.723 --> 42:43.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the last year, 225,000
Burundians have
fled the violence to cities they
hoped were

42:43.227 --> 42:46.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
safe. But, even here, they hide
their faces.

42:46.564 --> 42:51.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, here in Nairobi, which of
you is afraid?

42:51.769 --> 42:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of these men escaped from
Burundi. Kenyan
activist Tom Oketch brought them
together

42:57.041 --> 42:59.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to discuss their rights and try
to calm their
fears.

42:59.477 --> 43:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM OKETCH, Community Organizer:
Some are
saying they don't even care even
if they are

43:03.214 --> 43:08.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed, because there is no hope
in life.
Some of them have seen their
colleagues, their

43:08.753 --> 43:12.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brother, their friends being
slaughtered like
cows.

43:12.256 --> 43:17.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And on New Year's
Day, that
violence arrived in Kenya.
Burundian refugee

43:17.728 --> 43:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Juma says this is where he found
the body
of Jean de Dieu Kabura, a member
of Burundi's

43:22.567 --> 43:24.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
opposition.

43:24.302 --> 43:27.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): He was
naked, and
his body had cuts all over. Then
he spoke

43:27.772 --> 43:29.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and he said, "Juma, they have
killed me."

43:29.674 --> 43:33.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Those killers
accidentally
left behind their hit list,
I.D.s of Burundian

43:34.045 --> 43:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugees they have already
killed.

43:36.080 --> 43:40.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): These
are some I.D.s
of the men. This one is stained
with his blood.

43:40.551 --> 43:44.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: You were supposed
to look for
members of the opposition; is
that right?

43:45.022 --> 43:49.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This 23-year-old Hutu says the
government
sent him to follow the Tutsi
opposition members,

43:49.527 --> 43:51.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and kill them.

43:51.496 --> 43:55.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): First,
we were supposed
to establish relationships with
these people,

43:55.500 --> 43:58.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and after becoming friends with
them, we were
going to use poison.

43:58.369 --> 44:01.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Pierre was a
medical student,
conscripted into the
government's youth militia,

44:02.039 --> 44:06.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
known as the Imbonerakure. The
name translates
to Those Who See Far.

44:06.711 --> 44:13.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you got to Nairobi and
you realized
what your job was, why did you
refuse to do

44:13.851 --> 44:15.620 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

44:15.720 --> 44:19.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): When
they showed
us the list, I saw a person I
knew. He was

44:19.957 --> 44:25.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually a friend. I was in a
political party
different from his. But, for me,
that doesn't

44:25.296 --> 44:27.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean I should hate this person
or kill him.

44:27.265 --> 44:32.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALBERT, Refugee: We are afraid
to be killed
by those person who were sent by
the government.

44:32.904 --> 44:34.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Albert is a
Burundian journalist.

44:34.872 --> 44:40.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALBERT: They said that they will
stay in the
roads until the president
reverses his decision

44:40.511 --> 44:42.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to run for a third term.

44:42.346 --> 44:44.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He covered
clashes between
the government and opposition
protesters.

44:44.515 --> 44:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALBERT: I was on the ground to
report, to
get the story about the
demonstration. After

44:50.321 --> 44:59.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one day, all independent media
were burned
by policemen, by the government.
Imagine policemen

44:59.130 --> 45:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who killed who are honored by
the president.

45:02.900 --> 45:08.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Kenya, these
men went to
the local police, and say they
were ignored.

45:08.205 --> 45:10.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Police spokesman Charles Owino
denies that.

45:10.174 --> 45:14.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES OWINO, Police Spokesman:
If there
are accusations that a person
has killed another

45:14.579 --> 45:19.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and we have evidence that
justify it, then
the person must face the law. It
doesn't matter

45:19.417 --> 45:23.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where he comes from. It doesn't
matter whose
interests he's serving.

45:23.220 --> 45:28.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That reassurance
holds even
less comfort than sleeping in
shifts, and

45:28.993 --> 45:31.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cooking cornmeal in a donated
bedroom.

45:31.596 --> 45:33.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do you miss home?

45:33.564 --> 45:37.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Before
the crisis
in Burundi, we had enough
resources to have

45:37.835 --> 45:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a better life. We are here
because we have
nowhere else to go.

45:41.372 --> 45:48.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Nick Schifrin in Nairobi.

45:48.946 --> 46:03.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: From clay pots
to entire
cities, a most unusual and
influential artist.

46:03.494 --> 46:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has this profile
from Chicago.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what is this?

46:07.732 --> 46:11.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THEASTER GATES, Artist: So, this
is the ceramics
studio.

46:11.135 --> 46:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When you make a
pot, the artist
Theaster Gates told me recently
in his studio,

46:16.474 --> 46:19.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you think about the material and
how to shape
it.

46:19.176 --> 46:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: If it's clay,
then I have
to learn a lot about the
minerals that are

46:23.781 --> 46:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the earth. And what happens
when two chemicals
work together in relationship to
heat? How

46:29.553 --> 46:31.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does heat work in relationship
to time?

46:32.023 --> 46:37.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But, unlike most
artists, Gates
goes further, into a whole other
realm. Just

46:37.328 --> 46:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we learn to reshape clay into
pots, he
says, we might learn to reshape
buildings

46:42.566 --> 46:45.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and neighborhoods into a
revitalized urban
life.

46:45.770 --> 46:49.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: If you were to
apply that
to a city, you would say, what's
the relationship

46:49.273 --> 46:56.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between a commercial district
and a residential
area? And how might those things
be a collision

46:56.180 --> 46:58.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at first? But they need to
slowly cool.

46:58.849 --> 47:00.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Same processes,
but different
material?

47:00.751 --> 47:06.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: I think so, in
that it implies
that one has to also continue to
get to know

47:06.457 --> 47:09.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a thing by being directly
engaged with the
thing.

47:09.560 --> 47:14.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Gates is a
successful commercial
artist on the international
gallery scene.

47:14.699 --> 47:20.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But much of the focus of his
work is here,
on Chicago's South Side, in
neighborhoods

47:20.204 --> 47:24.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
filled with vacant lots,
abandoned buildings,
poor and dangerous streets.

47:24.408 --> 47:29.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gates has bought buildings, like
these on
Dorchester Avenue, refurbished
and turned

47:29.580 --> 47:35.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them into community gathering
places for music,
films, talk. He's also developed
low-cost

47:36.020 --> 47:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
housing, including for artists,
who contribute
hours of community service in
return.

47:40.758 --> 47:43.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: There were two of them
when the exhibiters
opened.

47:43.594 --> 47:47.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We happened on a
weekly session
in which residents talked about
a local art

47:48.099 --> 47:54.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exhibition and more. Gates likes
to take things
that are falling apart or
abandoned, and give

47:54.505 --> 47:59.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
them new life, like these
floorboards from
a community youth gymnasium that
was being

47:59.677 --> 48:00.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
torn down.

48:01.078 --> 48:03.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: Instead of
demolishing it
and just kind of...

48:03.280 --> 48:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, instead of
throwing it
away.

48:05.149 --> 48:09.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: You pull it one
board at a
time, the installation, and then
they sit.

48:09.787 --> 48:13.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like clay, it's nothing, until
it is something.

48:14.024 --> 48:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right. In this
case, it's something
because you then put them back
together into

48:20.164 --> 48:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a kind of abstract work of art.

48:22.833 --> 48:24.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: Sure. Yes.

48:24.435 --> 48:27.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And not only
that, but a work
of art with an embedded meaning.

48:27.872 --> 48:32.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: It's a shame
that the building
is abandoned. Well, that's only
part of it.

48:32.843 --> 48:37.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a shame that young men and
women aren't
learning what it means to work
together as

48:37.314 --> 48:45.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a team. It's a shame that all of
the skill
that went into hand-painting of
these floors

48:45.356 --> 48:50.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is no longer done by very many
people. There
are all these shames embedded.

48:50.761 --> 48:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But Gates, who
has degrees
in urban planning, also creates
on a bigger

48:56.133 --> 49:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
canvas, as with his largest
project to date,
the Stony Island Bank, a
once-thriving institution

49:03.274 --> 49:08.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a beautiful neo-classical
building that
sat empty for more than 30 years
and was scheduled

49:09.046 --> 49:11.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be torn down.

49:11.148 --> 49:15.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gates bought it from the city
for $1, raised
several million to fix it up,
and turned it

49:16.086 --> 49:22.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
into an arts bank, with
exhibition and performance
spaces, a gorgeous library, with
books from

49:22.560 --> 49:27.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the collection of the publisher
of "Jet" and
"Ebony" magazines, slides once
used to teach

49:27.965 --> 49:35.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
art history, and vinyl albums
from disc jockey
Frankie Knuckles, the godfather
of house music.

49:35.372 --> 49:41.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The art is in the idea, that
black culture
and black spaces should be
preserved and cherished.

49:41.312 --> 49:46.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: I'm excited
about collections
because they start to
demonstrate that black

49:46.116 --> 49:51.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people have the capacity to care
about black
things, that we have the ability
to make space

49:52.022 --> 49:59.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for these incredible
collections, and make
room for people to enjoy them
where normal

49:59.430 --> 50:05.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people live. And I feel really
fortunate that
that kind of poetry can live on
the South

50:05.669 --> 50:06.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Side of Chicago.

50:06.871 --> 50:08.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have you guys been doing this
all day, by
the way?

50:08.806 --> 50:13.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: His newest
project, undertaken
in his position as director of
arts and publics

50:13.744 --> 50:20.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life at the nearby University of
Chicago,
extends the idea to an entire
city block,

50:20.384 --> 50:27.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a burgeoning art block in the
Washington Park
neighborhood. It includes an
arts incubator

50:27.892 --> 50:32.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for cultural groups and classes
in woodworking
and more for young people.

50:32.162 --> 50:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: As you finish
high school
and go to college, come back for
the summer,

50:36.533 --> 50:41.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go back to college, come back
after you graduate,
that it's really that
relationship that will

50:41.105 --> 50:43.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make these buildings work over
time.

50:44.074 --> 50:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's also a
cafe and a bookstore
where musicians regularly
perform. On the

50:51.849 --> 50:56.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
drawing table, a large
performance space for
plays and concerts.

50:56.420 --> 51:00.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's the idea behind it,
an anchor or
an engine to grow, or how do you
see it?

51:01.091 --> 51:05.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: So, maybe words
like engines
and anchors are good words. But
I think first

51:05.562 --> 51:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it needed to just be a place
where culture
could happen, that before we had
to think

51:09.934 --> 51:14.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about it as an economic
generator or a cultural
anchor, it's just like, can I
have a place

51:15.005 --> 51:16.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to rehearse my play?

51:16.373 --> 51:17.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Simple? Yes.

51:17.574 --> 51:19.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

51:19.476 --> 51:22.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: Yes, absolutely.
Can we have
a place to make our music? Can
our kids learn

51:22.212 --> 51:24.014 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
art here?

51:24.114 --> 51:27.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Gates' work is
now expanding
beyond Chicago. His team at the
university

51:27.851 --> 51:34.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was recently awarded grants to
tackle redevelopment
projects in distressed areas of
Gary, Indiana;

51:34.558 --> 51:39.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Akron, Ohio; and Detroit, all of
it grounded
in his ideas of what art is.

51:39.663 --> 51:45.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEASTER GATES: What I love
about art is that
the power of the symbolic work
has so much

51:45.970 --> 51:49.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
potential to do more than the
thing on the
ground.

51:49.740 --> 51:56.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think about ripples. I
think about
affect. I think about symbolism.
But I don't

51:56.680 --> 52:03.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that there are limits on
what's possible.
Not only do poor people have a
right to beautiful

52:03.220 --> 52:09.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things, but people have the
right not to be
poor anymore. And I think that
that feels

52:09.760 --> 52:13.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like it's work making art about
and fighting
for.

52:13.497 --> 52:18.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's art mixed
with activism
and urban development.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: What
do Oprah Winfrey and Warren
Buffett have in

52:38.555 --> 52:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
common? Well, they are both
calculated risk-takers.
Our Making Sense columnist
Denise Cummins

52:44.128 --> 52:50.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
writes that successful
entrepreneurs are not
simply risk-takers, but
calculated risk-takers.

52:50.467 --> 52:52.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

And our jobs guru answers a
reader who wants
to know why, would a prospective
employer

52:57.975 --> 53:02.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keep the firm's benefits package
a secret?
It's one of the more
discouraging parts of

53:02.913 --> 53:06.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a job search, and we address it
in our Ask
the Headhunter column.
