00:01.466 --> 00:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's turn
now to our three panelists.

00:03.533 --> 00:05.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Carrie Cordero, I'm
going to start with you.

00:05.566 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you make of that answer
that he really didn't have an
explanation for leaving the

00:09.766 --> 00:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
room, whether he thought that
was unusual, leaving the Oval
Office when the president

00:13.733 --> 00:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanted to be alone with the
then FBI director, and he didn't
seem terribly upset about the

00:20.800 --> 00:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that the FBI director
was concerned the next day
when he told him about it?

00:22.966 --> 00:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CARRIE CORDERO, Former
Department of Justice
Official: Right.

00:24.966 --> 00:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, these memos that he's
talking about, this longstanding
Department of Justice policy,

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has to do with, in recent
history, there was a
memo that an Attorney
General Mukasey issued,

00:35.000 --> 00:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Eric Holder issued that
restrict the contacts between
the White House and the Justice

00:37.933 --> 00:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Department and the
FBI investigators on
ongoing investigations.

00:42.133 --> 00:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it was still an
odd answer, because, given
the fact that there was
this major investigation

00:49.133 --> 00:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going on that the attorney
general himself knew that he
was recused from, it would be

00:54.566 --> 00:56.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unusual.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why would the president need
to hold back the FBI director
about something that the

01:02.666 --> 01:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attorney general couldn't
be present for, other than
the Russia investigation?

01:05.366 --> 01:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, anything else
that the FBI director and the
president needed to discuss

01:12.300 --> 01:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a substantive nature,
one would think the attorney
general could be there for it.

01:15.366 --> 01:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: George
Terwilliger, what about that?

01:17.466 --> 01:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER, Former U.S.
Deputy Attorney General: Well,
I don't think it's that unusual

01:19.033 --> 01:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a president to talk
to an FBI director alone.

01:22.700 --> 01:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it would probably be
worth asking a number of former
FBI directors if they ever

01:29.033 --> 01:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had one-on-one conversations
with the president.

01:31.266 --> 01:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even in this
-- in the middle of this
kind of an investigation?

01:33.300 --> 01:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: Yes.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I think, in hindsight,
anybody that looks at it would
go, it would have been better

01:37.733 --> 01:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for that not to have occurred,
but the fact that the president
asked and the attorney

01:44.133 --> 01:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
general -- I just -- I
mean, he's a courteous man.

01:46.566 --> 01:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think he respected
the president's wishes.

01:49.700 --> 01:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And more than anything, Judy,
I -- what came through to me
today, more than an attorney

01:54.600 --> 01:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general, was I saw a man who
said, you're not going to
play political football with

01:59.000 --> 02:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my integrity, and said
that very, very firmly
even as to that question.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Walter Dellinger,
what did you take away from
the hearing overall, and

02:06.800 --> 02:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what about the specific
point about the president
asking everybody to
clear the room while he

02:12.533 --> 02:14.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
talked to James Comey?

02:14.400 --> 02:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ÑMD-BOÑWALTER DELLINGER,
Former Acting Solicitor
General: Well, I think what was

02:16.433 --> 02:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particularly improper about that
conversation was the content
of it, that is, the president

02:21.100 --> 02:25.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
saying, I hope you will
end this investigation
into General Flynn.

02:27.833 --> 02:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even if that wasn't a directive,
that statement that you should
end it because he's a good

02:34.266 --> 02:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guy undercuts our basic notion
of equal justice under law.

02:41.100 --> 02:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We shouldn't be investigating
or stopping investigations
because the president thinks

02:43.933 --> 02:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
someone is a good guy or
a U.S. attorney thinks
someone is a good guy.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's number one.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My larger takeaway
is that the attorney
general seemed relatively
passionate in defending

02:55.633 --> 02:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his own lack of involvement
with the Russians
and quite convincing.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He did.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WALTER DELLINGER: He
showed much less concern
about this extraordinary
event that the Russian,

03:06.633 --> 03:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a foreign military
hostile power, tried to
interfere in our elections.

03:10.133 --> 03:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He referred to it as
improper, but he didn't seem
to have any energy about
where that investigation

03:17.133 --> 03:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should go, didn't seem to
suggest that the president of
the United States is concerned

03:19.833 --> 03:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what was really a foreign
attack by a hostile power on
the core of our democracy.

03:24.666 --> 03:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we have got
a little excerpt of that coming
up, and I want to ask you that.

03:27.500 --> 03:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just quickly, on this point,
Carrie Cordero, again, on --
is there a precedent for the

03:35.433 --> 03:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attorney general basically
saying, it's OK for me to remove
myself from a conversation

03:40.400 --> 03:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and let the president talk
to the head of the FBI
about something sensitive?

03:43.233 --> 03:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARRIE CORDERO: Well, so,
in other circumstances,
if, for example, the
FBI director was at the

03:48.233 --> 03:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House to give a
counterterrorism briefing,
on some really substantive
matter, then, sure.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there would be other
aides in the room, too.

03:55.733 --> 04:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That type of briefing wouldn't
take place just with the
president and the FBI director.

04:00.733 --> 04:05.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But those are the types
of scenarios that would
be more routine types
of meetings between

04:07.533 --> 04:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a president and an FBI
director, if it was some
substantive type of briefing.

04:11.133 --> 04:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and -- and
keep all that in mind, because
we want to turn to another

04:15.266 --> 04:18.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
aspect of what came out
in today's testimony.

04:18.233 --> 04:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is that more
than one senator asked
the attorney general
about the firing of James

04:23.700 --> 04:26.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Comey.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attorney general
testified that he didn't
talk to the FBI director
about his job performance

04:29.300 --> 04:31.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before the president
dismissed him.

04:31.400 --> 04:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did detail for California
Democrat Dianne Feinstein the
issues that he had with Comey,

04:37.866 --> 04:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he declined to answer
a later question from Maine
independent Senator Angus King.

04:41.666 --> 04:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF SESSIONS: We
had problems there.

04:44.566 --> 04:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was my best judgment that
a fresh start at the FBI was
the appropriate thing to do.

04:53.933 --> 04:56.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when asked, I said
that to president.

04:56.866 --> 04:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's something I had adhered to.

04:59.200 --> 05:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Deputy Rosenstein's letter
dealt with a number of things.

05:03.233 --> 05:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When the -- Mr. Comey declined
the Clinton prosecution,
that was really a usurpation

05:13.300 --> 05:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the authority of the
federal prosecutors in
the Department of Justice.

05:19.166 --> 05:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a stunning development.

05:21.133 --> 05:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The FBI -- the investigative
team, they don't decide
prosecution policies.

05:28.266 --> 05:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that was a thunderous thing.

05:31.366 --> 05:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also commented at some
length on the declination
of the Clinton prosecution,
which you shouldn't

05:39.533 --> 05:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
normally -- you shouldn't do.

05:41.233 --> 05:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The policies have been historic.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you decline, you decline
and you don't talk about it.

05:46.233 --> 05:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were other things that
had happened that indicated
to me a lack of discipline.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it caused controversy
on both sides of the aisle.

05:56.700 --> 06:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I had come to the
conclusion that a fresh
start was appropriate.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

06:01.466 --> 06:04.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:04.133 --> 06:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS KING (I), Maine: In
any of your discussions
about the firing of James
Comey, did the question

06:05.433 --> 06:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Russian
investigation ever come up?

06:07.500 --> 06:12.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFF SESSIONS: I cannot
answer that because
it was a communication
by the president, or,

06:13.900 --> 06:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
if any such occurred, it
would be a communication
that he has not waived.

06:17.900 --> 06:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, a number
of people, George Terwilliger,
were struck by the fact that

06:22.000 --> 06:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the attorney general wouldn't
talk about these conversations
he had with the president.

06:26.233 --> 06:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: Well, to
me, that makes perfect sense.

06:30.400 --> 06:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The privilege belongs to the
president, and it wouldn't be
up to a subordinate official

06:37.266 --> 06:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take it upon himself to
waive it by answering the
question at that time and place.

06:43.200 --> 06:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Otherwise, the president
loses the ability to assert
or preserve that privilege.

06:47.366 --> 06:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
and I were discussing this
earlier, Walter Dellinger.

06:51.600 --> 06:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were trying to understand,
to what extent is there a
precedent for not answering some

06:58.166 --> 07:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of these questions?

07:00.333 --> 07:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard the attorney general
say -- at one point, he said,
I think there's even a piece

07:02.900 --> 07:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of paper at the Justice
Department that refers
to privileged or
confidential conversations

07:09.300 --> 07:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between the president
and the attorney general.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: You know,
he was very well-prepared,
but he didn't bring
any such piece of paper

07:14.333 --> 07:16.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with him.

07:16.366 --> 07:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would be surprised,
because I don't believe there
is any privilege of refusing

07:20.200 --> 07:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to answer questions from
a congressional committee,
unless the president is
going to invoke executive

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
privilege.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he didn't want to say that.

07:28.066 --> 07:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Through a dozen iterations of
the question, he would simply
say, it was confidential,

07:32.166 --> 07:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
without asserting any privilege.

07:34.233 --> 07:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, he suggested -- and the
committee should follow up on
this -- here are the questions

07:39.433 --> 07:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we want answered.

07:41.533 --> 07:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you discuss the Russian
investigation in connection
with the firing of Comey?

07:47.433 --> 07:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if the president then wants
to assert executive privilege,
he can do so in writing

07:50.466 --> 07:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
communicated to the committee.

07:52.366 --> 07:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, if not, then the
question ought to be answered
by the attorney general.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Carrie
Cordero, this really does get to
the heart of a lot of what we're

07:58.766 --> 08:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about today, and that
is, the president has not so
far exerted executive privilege.

08:05.666 --> 08:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has not said to the
attorney general, you cannot
answer these questions.

08:08.200 --> 08:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the attorney general said,
at least on two occasions today,
that he's trying to protect

08:13.166 --> 08:18.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the president's right to
later on exert executive
privilege, which is a
way of looking at this,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.366 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I think, some of
us haven't seen.

08:21.366 --> 08:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CARRIE CORDERO: Right.

08:23.433 --> 08:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is the second week in
a row that senior administration
officials have had difficulty

08:28.133 --> 08:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
answering this question.

08:30.133 --> 08:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DNI Coats, Director of National
Intelligence Coats, and
Director of NSA Rogers last week

08:36.966 --> 08:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a similar problem,
where they didn't seem
to have been advised by
the White House Counsel's

08:42.466 --> 08:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Office that they should
exert executive privilege,
and yet they were
uncomfortable giving answers

08:46.666 --> 08:48.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to questions.

08:48.233 --> 08:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Attorney General
Sessions handled it a
little bit differently.

08:50.866 --> 08:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He did say that he was trying
to protect a potential exertion
of executive privilege,

08:57.066 --> 08:58.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but he also raised
other privileges.

08:58.566 --> 09:00.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said maybe there are
some other privileges.

09:00.766 --> 09:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so that reminded
me a little bit more of
the attorney-client-type
privilege that

09:05.200 --> 09:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes the Department of
Justice asserts, but that's
when the Justice Department is

09:12.166 --> 09:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
giving legal advice to the
president, and they don't then
want to provide information

09:16.600 --> 09:18.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Congress.

09:18.666 --> 09:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he was still vague and
unclear about which privileges
he was potentially asserting.

09:24.666 --> 09:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that sounded
like a different question.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm coming back to
you, George Terwilliger,
to ask, on just how
solid is this ground that

09:33.566 --> 09:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the attorney general stands on
when he says, I'm protecting
the president's right to exert

09:36.466 --> 09:37.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
executive...

09:37.733 --> 09:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: I
think it's very solid.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And both Democrat and Republican
officials have asserted that
privilege over the years,

09:42.933 --> 09:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as recently as in the Obama
administration through
Attorney General Holder.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's really quite
simple, I think, Judy.

09:51.200 --> 09:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the president has a privilege
to have confidential discussions
with his advisers, which include

09:58.633 --> 10:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cabinet officials, the
Cabinet officials shouldn't
be the ones to decide the
waive the confidentiality

10:03.633 --> 10:05.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of those communications.

10:05.733 --> 10:09.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he doesn't know what
questions he is going
to be asked before he
gets up there, to ask

10:11.900 --> 10:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
permission ahead of time,
can I talk about this,
can I talk about that?

10:13.633 --> 10:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think it's just
a very practical issue.

10:15.766 --> 10:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, there is
another important part of this,
what came out today in today's

10:19.666 --> 10:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testimony that we
want to look at.

10:21.700 --> 10:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is on the attorney --
on the issue of the attorney
general's recusing himself

10:25.700 --> 10:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the Russia investigation.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Sessions clashed at
one point with Oregon
Democratic Senator Ron
Wyden, who challenged

10:34.133 --> 10:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him on whether he
adhered to that recusal.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:37.766 --> 10:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN (D), Oregon: The
question is, Mr. Comey said that
there were matters with respect

10:43.200 --> 10:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to recusal that were problematic
and he couldn't talk about them.

10:48.233 --> 10:49.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What are they?

10:49.533 --> 10:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF SESSIONS: Why
don't you tell me?

10:52.500 --> 10:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are none, Senator Wyden.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There are none.

10:56.333 --> 11:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can tell you that
for absolute certainty.

11:00.600 --> 11:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a secret innuendo
being leaked out there about
me, and I don't appreciate it.

11:07.566 --> 11:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have tried to give my
best and truthful answers to any
committee I've appeared before.

11:13.633 --> 11:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's really -- people are
suggesting through innuendo that
I have been not honest about

11:20.600 --> 11:22.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
matters, and I've
tried to be honest.

11:22.633 --> 11:25.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON WYDEN: Why did you
sign a letter recommending
the fire -- firing of
Comey, when it violated

11:30.500 --> 11:31.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your recusal?

11:31.700 --> 11:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFF SESSIONS: It didn't
violate my recusal.

11:34.333 --> 11:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It didn't violate my recusal.

11:37.433 --> 11:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That would be answer to that.

11:39.866 --> 11:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the letter that I signed
represented my views that had
been formulated for some time.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN: Mr. Chairman, just
if I can finish, that answer,
in my view, doesn't pass the

11:51.700 --> 11:53.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
smell test.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Walter
Dellinger, this is getting at
the -- what you heard, the tug

12:00.000 --> 12:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pull about all afternoon,
and that is that letter that
the attorney general signed

12:06.233 --> 12:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the deputy attorney
general signed criticizing
then FBI Director Comey
as the grounds for

12:11.133 --> 12:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his dismissal was all about
how he handled the Hillary
Clinton, or largely about how

12:14.933 --> 12:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he handled the Hillary
Clinton e-mail investigation.

12:17.266 --> 12:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later on, the president said he
fired him mainly over Russia,
the Russia investigation.

12:22.100 --> 12:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the attorney general
is basically saying, I
recused myself from the
Russia investigation,

12:26.733 --> 12:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but that's not a problem here.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: Well, the
attorney general makes the
point that he's responsible for

12:31.866 --> 12:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the entire department, and he
has to make personnel decisions.

12:35.133 --> 12:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, this one got awfully
close to his recusal issue.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And maybe he should
have stepped aside.

12:42.533 --> 12:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, to me, the most interesting
question that wasn't fully
answered was, were you aware

12:49.600 --> 12:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - when you sent the letter
to the president recommending
that Comey be fired, were you

12:55.166 --> 12:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aware that the president had
already decided to fire him?

12:58.266 --> 13:02.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that question, he
-- the answer got evaded
in the back-and-forth.

13:02.466 --> 13:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that will be an
interesting question for
someone to follow up with.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is
your take on this exchange?

13:08.066 --> 13:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARRIE CORDERO: Well, the
nut of it is, is, was former
Director Comey fired because of

13:13.433 --> 13:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Russia investigation?

13:15.433 --> 13:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has said in an
interview that it was, that
Russia is what was on his mind.

13:19.033 --> 13:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Attorney General Sessions
is clinging to this argument
that his -- his justification,

13:26.466 --> 13:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is that it was
because of the handling of
the Hillary Clinton case.

13:31.133 --> 13:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And because he didn't answer
the one question, which was, in
the context of discussing with

13:38.166 --> 13:41.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the president the firing
of the FBI director,
did you also discuss the
Russia investigation,

13:43.566 --> 13:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was the question that
really needed to be answered
to tie these pieces together.

13:46.366 --> 13:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we don't
have the answer to the question?

13:48.166 --> 13:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: I don't
think he's clinging to anything.

13:50.333 --> 13:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very possible -- I don't
know the answer, but it's very
possible that there could be

13:54.866 --> 13:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two very different reasons
on the part of the president
and the attorney general and

13:58.533 --> 14:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the deputy attorney general
for dismissing Mr. Comey.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Indeed, I know you may have
to be sort of part of the
Justice family or cognoscenti

14:09.933 --> 14:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to appreciate this, but what
Jim Comey did last July in terms
of usurping, as the attorney

14:16.166 --> 14:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general put it, the authority
of the Justice Department to
make a prosecution decision,

14:20.933 --> 14:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then the utter trashing
of Hillary Clinton that he did
along with that, that is so far

14:27.833 --> 14:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside the mainstream, that
the attorney general said today
that he and Mr. Rosenstein

14:33.833 --> 14:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had been talking about
that for some time and the
need to replace Mr. Comey.

14:39.033 --> 14:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that that may have
been, or not, I don't know,
convenient to the president

14:42.766 --> 14:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for other reasons is something,
you know, that I'm sure the
Senate will want to explore,

14:49.366 --> 14:52.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but it doesn't impugn
the attorney general's
integrity at all.

14:52.066 --> 14:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But just to
quickly follow up, if the Russia
investigation was any part

14:56.333 --> 15:01.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the reason for the
president's firing the
FBI director, and the
attorney general was

15:02.733 --> 15:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - attached himself to that
decision, that wasn't a problem?

15:07.800 --> 15:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That didn't violate his recusal?

15:09.866 --> 15:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE TERWILLIGER: Well, it
might have if, in fact, you
know, he thought that was the

15:15.333 --> 15:16.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reason or he acted as
that -- the reason.

15:16.800 --> 15:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think Walter a few minutes
ago made a very good point.

15:19.700 --> 15:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The recusal is as to one case
out of thousands in the Justice
Department, albeit an important

15:25.166 --> 15:27.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one.

15:27.666 --> 15:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attorney general
still has a responsibility
to run the department,
not the least of which

15:29.533 --> 15:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is to make sure he has the
right people in the top jobs.

15:32.100 --> 15:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just very
quickly, Walter Dellinger,
what is the -- what
the -- do you think we

15:36.066 --> 15:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can get to the bottom of this
question of whether the recusal
was violated in some way?

15:43.466 --> 15:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: I think
we will, because I think
the special counsel,
follow-up hearings

15:49.100 --> 15:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are going to say, look, either
the president formally invoke
executive privilege or answer

15:54.633 --> 15:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the question about whether you
knew already that the president
made up his mind to fire

15:59.766 --> 16:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey, and to deal with the
fact that it is extremely
unusual for a president to have

16:04.433 --> 16:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
half-a-dozen conversations
with an FBI director directly.

16:10.333 --> 16:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Walter Dellinger,
Carrie Cordero, George
Terwilliger, we thank you all.

16:15.666 --> 16:17.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Remarkable day,
another remarkable day.
