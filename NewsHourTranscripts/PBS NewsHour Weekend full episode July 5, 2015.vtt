>> Sreenivasan: ON THIS EDITION

00:11.867 --> 00:13.500
FOR SUNDAY, JULY 5:

00:13.500 --> 00:14.867
GREEK VOTERS REJECT THE TERMS OF

00:14.867 --> 00:20.367
THE EUROPEAN BAILOUT PLAN.

00:20.367 --> 00:21.267
IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT, UNABLE

00:21.267 --> 00:22.033
TO FIND WORK AND BEING FORCED

00:22.033 --> 00:22.767
INTO POVERTY BECAUSE OF A

00:22.767 --> 00:23.767
CRIMINAL RECORD.

00:23.767 --> 00:24.967
>> I DID MY PROBATION.

00:24.967 --> 00:25.933
NO VIOLATIONS.

00:25.933 --> 00:26.833
MODEL CITIZEN.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.033
I GO TO SCHOOL AND TRY TO

00:28.033 --> 00:30.767
BETTER MYSELF, AND IT'S LIKE

00:30.767 --> 00:32.167
EVERY TIME I APPLY FOR A JOB, I

00:32.167 --> 00:33.567
FEEL LIKE I'M COMMITTING A

00:33.567 --> 00:35.167
CRIME ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:35.167 --> 00:36.567
>> Sreenivasan: AND A CLOSE

00:36.567 --> 00:37.900
LOOK AT NATIVE AMERICAN FASHION.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.867
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:39.867 --> 00:40.733
>>FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS

00:40.733 --> 00:44.167
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:44.167 --> 00:47.667
THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:47.667 --> 00:48.533
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:48.533 --> 00:49.167
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:49.167 --> 00:50.767
I'M HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.033
WE START WITH GREECE, WHERE

00:52.033 --> 00:53.633
OFFICIALS ARE PROJECTING THAT

00:53.633 --> 00:55.933
MORE THAN 60% OF VOTERS HAVE

00:55.933 --> 00:57.100
REJECTED AUSTERITY MEASURES

00:57.100 --> 00:59.167
PROPOSED BY CREDITORS.

00:59.167 --> 01:00.733
CROWDS ARE RALLYING IN THE

01:00.733 --> 01:02.367
STREETS, CELEBRATING THE EARLY

01:02.367 --> 01:03.800
RETURNS.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.333
THE "NO" VOTE MEANS GREEKS DO

01:05.333 --> 01:07.000
NOT WANT TO MAKE THE DEEP BUDGET

01:07.000 --> 01:08.800
CUTS IN ORDER TO GET EMERGENCY

01:08.800 --> 01:09.833
BAILOUT MONEY AS THE NATION

01:09.833 --> 01:12.133
FALLS DEEPER INTO DEBT.

01:12.133 --> 01:16.400
GREEK PRIME MINISTER ALEXIS

01:16.400 --> 01:17.700
TSIPRAS SAID THAT QUOTE THE

01:17.700 --> 01:19.300
MANDATE ASKING CALL FOR A BREAK

01:19.300 --> 01:21.333
REQUEST EUROPE BUT RATHER GIVES

01:21.333 --> 01:25.600
ME GREATER NEGOTIATING STRENGTH.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.800
JOINS US FROM ATHENS FIRST OF

01:27.800 --> 01:29.300
ALL THE REACTION ON THE STREETS

01:29.300 --> 01:30.333
I CAN ALMOST

01:30.333 --> 01:31.267
PBS NEWSHOUR SPECIAL

01:31.267 --> 01:32.333
CORRESPONDENT MALCOLM BRABANT

01:32.333 --> 01:33.467
JOINS US NOW FROM ATHENS.

01:33.467 --> 01:34.467
HEAR THEM BEHIND YOU IN THE

01:34.467 --> 01:35.100
CONSTITUTION SQUARE.

01:35.100 --> 01:35.867
>> THERE IS EUPHORIA OFTEN THE

01:35.867 --> 01:36.633
STREETS OF ATHENS TONIGHT

01:36.633 --> 01:39.833
BECAUSE THIS RESULT IS ENTIRETY

01:39.833 --> 01:41.867
CONSISTENT WITH THE GREEKS

01:41.867 --> 01:43.100
NATURAL TENDENCY TOWARDS

01:43.100 --> 01:44.133
RESISTANCE.

01:44.133 --> 01:46.033
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT APPEALS

01:46.033 --> 01:47.467
TO THEIR NATIONAL CHARACTER.

01:47.467 --> 01:49.167
AT THIS STAGE PEOPLE REALLY

01:49.167 --> 01:50.533
THOUGHT THEY HAD NOTHING MORE TO

01:50.533 --> 01:51.433
LOSE.

01:51.433 --> 01:54.767
THEY HAVE ENDURED FIVE YEARS OF

01:54.767 --> 01:56.067
AUSTERITY, REALLY TOUGH TIMES.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.467
THE GENUINE FEELING HERE IS

01:57.467 --> 01:59.200
THINGS CAN'T GET ANY WORSE.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.000
BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING TONIGHT IS

02:01.000 --> 02:02.833
REALLY A STEP INTO THE UNKNOWN

02:02.833 --> 02:05.533
BECAUSE NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHAT

02:05.533 --> 02:08.300
IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.433
>> ARE YOU CLEAR ON WHAT A NO

02:11.433 --> 02:13.133
VOTE MEANT AND WHAT A YES VOTE

02:13.133 --> 02:13.800
MEANT WHEN THEY WENT TO THE

02:13.800 --> 02:14.833
POLLS?

02:14.833 --> 02:17.033
>> I THINK MOST PEOPLE DISTILLED

02:17.033 --> 02:19.767
THIS DOWN TO A YES VOTE MEANING

02:19.767 --> 02:21.533
THERE WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY MORE

02:21.533 --> 02:22.900
AUSTERITY, YEARS OF PAIN.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.600
WHEREAS SOME PEOPLE BELIEVED A

02:24.600 --> 02:26.200
NO VOTE WOULD BELIEVE THERE

02:26.200 --> 02:28.267
WOULD BE A RENEGOTIATION,

02:28.267 --> 02:29.200
PERHAPS THE TERMS MAY HAVE BEEN

02:29.200 --> 02:30.033
BETTER.

02:30.033 --> 02:31.567
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO THINK BY

02:31.567 --> 02:33.267
VOTING NO, THEY WILL BASICALLY

02:33.267 --> 02:34.533
BE WRITING OFF THIS DEBT.

02:34.533 --> 02:35.867
BUT THEY SEEM TO BELIEVE THE

02:35.867 --> 02:41.000
GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY SAY THAT

02:41.000 --> 02:43.167
MR. TSIPRAS WILL BE ABLE TO GO

02:43.167 --> 02:45.700
BACK TO BRUSSELS WITH A BETTER

02:45.700 --> 02:46.667
HAND.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.600
I WAS TALKING TO A FINANCIAL

02:48.600 --> 02:50.667
CONSULTANT TONIGHT WHO SAID THE

02:50.667 --> 02:52.500
BANKS ARE RUNNING OUT OF PAPER

02:52.500 --> 02:54.933
MONEY AND THERE MAY BE

02:54.933 --> 02:56.667
NATIONALIZATION OF THE BANKS IF

02:56.667 --> 02:57.433
THE SITUATION CONTINUES.

02:57.433 --> 02:59.733
>> BECAUSE EVEN WITH THIS VOTE

02:59.733 --> 03:01.833
GREECE STILL HAS ANOTHER LOAN

03:01.833 --> 03:03.200
PAYMENT COMING IN A COUPLE OF

03:03.200 --> 03:03.700
WEEKS RIGHT?

03:03.700 --> 03:05.833
>> SEVERAL PAYMENTS COMING UP

03:05.833 --> 03:08.333
AND WITHOUT ANY NEW MONEY COMING

03:08.333 --> 03:09.733
IN, THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY

03:09.733 --> 03:11.433
THAT GREECE CAN MAKE THOSE

03:11.433 --> 03:12.533
PAYMENTS SO THEY'RE GOING TO

03:12.533 --> 03:13.867
CONTINUE TO BE IN DEFAULT.

03:13.867 --> 03:15.667
BUT WHAT I THINK THE GREEKS ARE

03:15.667 --> 03:17.367
HOPING FOR IS THAT SOMETHING

03:17.367 --> 03:19.100
THAT THE IMF LAST MENTIONED OVER

03:19.100 --> 03:21.067
THE PAST WEEK OR SO THAT THERE

03:21.067 --> 03:23.000
IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE SOME SORT

03:23.000 --> 03:25.567
OF DEBIT RESTRUCTURING

03:25.567 --> 03:26.667
BECAUSE -- DEBT RESTRUCTURING

03:26.667 --> 03:30.900
BECAUSE ALL THE MONEY THROWN

03:30.900 --> 03:34.800
INTO THE TROIKA, ALL THE MONEY

03:34.800 --> 03:36.600
HAS GONE INTO SERVICING THE DEBT

03:36.600 --> 03:38.567
AND ONLY A VERY, VERY SMALL

03:38.567 --> 03:40.000
PERCENTAGE HAS ACTUALLY DONE TO

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
BOOSTING THE ECONOMY.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.467
SO BASICALLY WHAT THE IMF IS

03:42.467 --> 03:44.000
SAYING IS THAT GREECE HAS TO

03:44.000 --> 03:45.767
HAVE MAYBE A TEN OR 15 OR 20

03:45.767 --> 03:47.967
YEAR BREAK FROM PAYING BACK ANY

03:47.967 --> 03:49.467
MONEY SO THAT IT CAN BASICALLY

03:49.467 --> 03:51.100
HAVE A BREATHING SPACE AND GET

03:51.100 --> 03:52.467
BACK ON ITS FEET.

03:52.467 --> 03:53.733
AND NOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S

03:53.733 --> 03:56.100
GOT TO BE WORKED IDENTITY WITH

03:56.100 --> 03:57.933
THE EUROPEANS, THEY DON'T LIKE

03:57.933 --> 03:58.667
THAT IDEA AT ALL.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.600
>> WHEN YOU TALK TO VOTERS

04:00.600 --> 04:02.467
TONIGHT AFTER THEY WENT TO THE

04:02.467 --> 04:04.167
POLLS, AFTER THEY CAST THE

04:04.167 --> 04:05.767
BALLOTS DID YOU SEE ANY PATTERNS

04:05.767 --> 04:09.533
HOW IT BROKE DOWN, THE YOUNG

04:09.533 --> 04:10.533
VERSUS THE OLD, ONE VERSUS THE

04:10.533 --> 04:11.267
OTHER?

04:11.267 --> 04:13.833
>> YOU DO HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE

04:13.833 --> 04:16.000
HAVING A VERY, VERY STRONG VOICE

04:16.000 --> 04:18.033
BASE THEY HAVE BEEN THE MOST

04:18.033 --> 04:20.100
DISADVANTAGED IN THIS AREA OF

04:20.100 --> 04:20.700
AUSTERITY.

04:20.700 --> 04:24.567
THE OTHER, TOTALLY INTOLERABLE

04:24.567 --> 04:26.267
FOR THEM.

04:26.267 --> 04:29.000
MOST PEOPLE UNDER 35 ARE

04:29.000 --> 04:29.667
UNEMPLOYED.

04:29.667 --> 04:30.867
50% OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

04:30.867 --> 04:31.667
UNEMPLOYED.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.500
THIS IS A COUNTRY WITH A HIGHLY

04:33.500 --> 04:34.733
EDUCATED YOUNG POPULATION AND

04:34.733 --> 04:38.833
THERE'S BEEN A HUGE BRAIN DRAIN.

04:38.833 --> 04:41.700
THIS IS A COUNTRY OF OLD PEOPLE.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.633
WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE

04:43.633 --> 04:44.933
SAYING, WE ARE NEGOTIATING FOR

04:44.933 --> 04:45.467
OUR FUTURE.

04:45.467 --> 04:48.967
IF IT MEANS FIGHTING AND

04:48.967 --> 04:50.467
BIT -- SUFFERING A LITTLE BIT

04:50.467 --> 04:51.633
LONGER, WE'RE PREPARED TO DO

04:51.633 --> 04:52.400
THAT.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.300
THIS IS A STEP INTO THE UNKNOWN.

04:54.300 --> 04:59.700
>> MALCOLM IS BRABANT, THANK YOU

04:59.700 --> 05:05.367
SO MUCH.

05:05.367 --> 05:06.233
>> Sreenivasan: SECRETARY OF

05:06.233 --> 05:07.000
STATE JOHN KERRY MET WITH

05:07.000 --> 05:07.767
DIPLOMATS FOR A RECORD NINTH-

05:07.767 --> 05:08.600
STRAIGHT DAY OF NUCLEAR TALKS IN

05:08.600 --> 05:11.000

THE U.S., FRANCE, THE U.K.,

05:14.200 --> 05:15.000
CHINA PLUS GERMANY, ARE HOPING

05:15.000 --> 05:15.700
TO MAKE A DEAL BY JULY 7.

05:15.700 --> 05:16.567
THE U.S. WANTS TO KEEP IRAN FROM

05:16.567 --> 05:17.433
BUILDING A NUCLEAR WEAPON, AND

05:17.433 --> 05:18.433
GIVE U.N. WEAPONS INSPECTORS

05:18.433 --> 05:19.533
ACCESS TO MILITARY SITES.

05:19.533 --> 05:20.700
THE MAIN STICKING POINT IS

05:20.700 --> 05:23.733
IRAN'S DEMAND THAT ECONOMIC

05:23.733 --> 05:25.167
SANCTIONS BE LIFTED BEFORE IT

05:25.167 --> 05:26.567
MAKES CHANGES TO ITS NUCLEAR

05:26.567 --> 05:27.233
PROGRAM.

05:27.233 --> 05:28.100
SECRETARY KERRY CAUTIONED TODAY

05:28.100 --> 05:29.033
THAT THE TALKS COULD STILL GO

05:29.033 --> 05:30.000
EITHER WAY.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.033
>> IF WE DON'T GET A DEAL, IF WE

05:31.033 --> 05:32.600
DON'T HAVE A DEAL, IF THERE'S

05:32.600 --> 05:34.533
ABSOLUTE INTRANSIGENCE , IF

05:34.533 --> 05:35.833
THERE'S AN UNWILLINGNESS TO MOVE

05:35.833 --> 05:37.000
ON THE THINGS THAT ARE

05:37.000 --> 05:37.967
IMPORTANT, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS

05:37.967 --> 05:38.867
ALWAYS SAID WE'LL BE PREPARED TO

05:38.867 --> 05:39.800
WALK AWAY.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.067
>> Sreenivasan: IN THE MIDDLE

05:41.067 --> 05:42.267
EAST, U.S.-LED COALITION

06:02.167 --> 06:05.000
THROUGH SYRIA AND INTO IRAQ.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.867

FIGHTERS DECLARED AN ISLAMIC

GLOBAL INVESTORS ARE ALSO

07:43.000 --> 07:45.033
HE GETS TO BRITAIN.

07:45.033 --> 07:47.233

07:47.233 --> 07:48.533
CLEARLY SEEN WHERE THEY ARE

07:48.533 --> 07:49.933
THOUGHT MEANT TO BE.

07:49.933 --> 07:56.767
NOBODY SEES THEM, DELIVERING

07:56.767 --> 07:58.767
CARGO DIRECTLY INTO THE U.K.

07:58.767 --> 08:02.900
THIS GROUP IS WALKING CASUALLY

08:02.900 --> 08:04.733
UNCONCERNED BEING RUSHED AND

08:04.733 --> 08:05.367
UNCHALLENGED.

08:05.367 --> 08:06.800
THEY EACH QUEUE UP IN SINGLE

08:06.800 --> 08:09.000
FILE AND HAVE TIME TO LOOK

08:09.000 --> 08:10.633
AROUND FOR BEST SPOT TO HIDE.

08:10.633 --> 08:14.733
IN THE HOURS THAT FOLLOWED, 150

08:14.733 --> 08:18.000
MIGRANTS DESPERATELY STORMED THE

08:18.000 --> 08:20.033

08:20.033 --> 08:21.333
SERVICES TO BE DELAYED AND

08:33.800 --> 08:35.667
THEY APPEAR TO WORK OUT THIS

08:35.667 --> 08:38.133
FRENCH PORT BUT THEY DON'T STEP

08:38.133 --> 08:39.200

08:39.200 --> 08:41.533
INSTEAD, A THUMBS UP AND A WAVE.

08:41.533 --> 08:44.000
THE MAN WHO RECORDED THESE

08:44.000 --> 08:44.933
INCREDIBLE PICTURES TOLD US WHY

08:44.933 --> 08:46.133
HE DECIDED TO CAPTURE IT ON HIS

09:49.000 --> 09:50.067
HOW FAR BACK SHOULD THEY GO?

09:50.067 --> 09:51.667
A GROWING NUMBER OF STATES ARE

OPTING TO BAN THE BOX THAT ASKS

09:53.133 --> 09:54.067
ABOUT CRIMINAL RECORDS ON JOB

09:54.067 --> 09:57.367
APPLICATIONS.

09:57.367 --> 09:58.600
BUT WITH EVIDENCE CRIMINAL

09:58.600 --> 10:00.333
RECORDS COULD BE DRIVING PEOPLE

10:00.333 --> 10:02.100
INTO POVERTY, A NEW PROPOSAL TO

SEAL PAST OFFENSES IS NOW ON THE

10:04.967 --> 10:06.800
THE NEWSHOUR'S STEPHEN FEE HAS

10:06.800 --> 10:07.733
OUR STORY FROM PHILADELPHIA,

10:07.733 --> 10:08.567
WHICH WE ORIGINALLY BROUGHT YOU

10:08.567 --> 10:11.800
IN JANUARY.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.900
>> Reporter: EVERY AFTERNOON, AT

10:13.900 --> 10:15.667
HIS DINING ROOM TABLE, 36-YEAR-

10:15.667 --> 10:16.333
OLD RONALD LEWIS DOES HIS

10:16.333 --> 10:19.133
HOMEWORK.

10:19.133 --> 10:20.767
BY DAY, HE'S A STUDENT, LEARNING

10:20.767 --> 10:22.200
TO FIX HEATING AND AIR

10:22.200 --> 10:23.200
CONDITIONING SYSTEMS, AND HE

10:23.200 --> 10:25.067
LOOKS AFTER HIS THREE KIDS.

10:25.067 --> 10:26.633
HE ALSO WORKS THE NIGHT SHIFT,

10:26.633 --> 10:28.233
RUNNING HIGH PRESSURE BOILERS AT

10:28.233 --> 10:29.300
A CHEMICAL PLANT HERE IN HIS

10:29.300 --> 10:30.500
HOMETOWN, PHILADELPHIA.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.400
>> I'M A FATHER.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.500
I'M A HARD WORKER.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.733
I'M VERY AMBITIOUS.

10:35.733 --> 10:36.800
>> Reporter: HE'S ALSO GOT A

10:36.800 --> 10:39.567
CRIMINAL RECORD.

10:39.567 --> 10:41.433
A DECADE AGO, LEWIS HAD TWO

10:41.433 --> 10:43.233
MAJOR RUN-INS WITH THE LAW THAT

10:43.233 --> 10:45.200
HE SAYS HAVE INTERFERED WITH HIS

10:45.200 --> 10:48.000
JOB PROSPECTS EVER SINCE.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.867
IN AUGUST 2004, HE WAS PICKED UP

10:49.867 --> 10:50.867
DURING A DRUG ARREST ALONGSIDE

10:50.867 --> 10:52.300
HIS BROTHER.

10:52.300 --> 10:53.167
LEWIS WAS CARRYING A

10:53.167 --> 10:55.233
.9 MILLIMETER HANDGUN.

10:55.233 --> 10:56.800
DAYS LATER HE WAS NABBED FOR

10:56.800 --> 10:57.567
STEALING A POCKETBOOK FROM A

10:57.567 --> 10:59.600
DEPARTMENT STORE.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.800
SO WHAT WAS THAT LIKE, AND WHAT

11:00.800 --> 11:01.733
HAPPENED AT THAT STAGE AFTER

11:01.733 --> 11:03.233
THEY ARRESTED YOU?

11:03.233 --> 11:04.600
>> IT WAS LIFE CHANGING.

11:04.600 --> 11:05.967
BUT IT WASN'T A GOOD FEELING.

11:05.967 --> 11:07.133
IT WASN'T A GOOD FEELING,

11:07.133 --> 11:08.400
BECAUSE YOU FELT LIKE YOU

11:08.400 --> 11:10.067
DISAPPOINTED YOUR FAMILY, AND

11:10.067 --> 11:10.767
YOU DISAPPOINTED YOUR MOTHER,

11:10.767 --> 11:11.700
WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

11:11.700 --> 11:13.067
PERSON IN MY LIFE.

11:13.067 --> 11:14.333
>> Reporter: ON THE SUGGESTION

11:14.333 --> 11:15.067
OF HIS LAWYER, LEWIS TOOK A

11:15.067 --> 11:16.733
DEAL.

11:16.733 --> 11:18.433
FOR BOTH CASES, HE PLED GUILTY

11:18.433 --> 11:20.200
TO A TOTAL OF THREE MISDEMEANORS

11:20.200 --> 11:21.367
AND WAS SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS'

11:21.367 --> 11:22.133
PROBATION.

11:22.133 --> 11:24.367
NO JAIL TIME.

11:24.367 --> 11:25.367
AT THAT TIME, WERE YOU WORRIED

11:25.367 --> 11:26.233
AT ALL ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHT

11:26.233 --> 11:27.233
IMPACT YOUR FUTURE?

11:27.233 --> 11:29.767
>> NO.

11:29.767 --> 11:30.800
BECAUSE THE LAWYER HAD TOLD ME,

11:30.800 --> 11:31.800
"IT'S ONLY A MISDEMEANOR.

11:31.800 --> 11:32.667
IT'S NEVER GOING TO HURT YOU.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.433
DON'T EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT."

11:34.433 --> 11:36.300
SO NO, I REALLY DIDN'T THINK

11:36.300 --> 11:38.767
THAT MUCH INTO IT AT THAT POINT.

11:38.767 --> 11:39.800
>> Reporter: A SHORT TIME LATER,

11:39.800 --> 11:40.467
LEWIS BEGAN LOOKING FOR NEW

11:40.467 --> 11:42.067
WORK.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.367
HE WAS OVERJOYED WHEN HE GOT A

11:43.367 --> 11:44.100
TENTATIVE JOB OFFER FROM A

11:44.100 --> 11:45.700
BUILDING COMPANY.

11:45.700 --> 11:46.833
>> I WORKED THERE FOR ABOUT A

11:46.833 --> 11:48.700
MONTH, WAS HONEST WITH THEM.

11:48.700 --> 11:49.467
TOLD THEM, YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS ON

11:49.467 --> 11:50.333
MY RECORD.

11:50.333 --> 11:51.433
THEY STILL HIRED ME.

11:51.433 --> 11:52.500
WE'RE WORKING.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.700
SO I WORK THERE ABOUT A MONTH.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.567
THEY CALLED ME IN THE OFFICE AND

11:55.567 --> 11:56.667
SAID, "YOUR RECORD CAME BACK.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.200
WE'VE GOT TO LET YOU GO."

11:58.200 --> 11:59.233
>> Reporter: AND THAT WAS IT?

11:59.233 --> 12:00.367
EVEN THOUGH YOU HAD DISCLOSED

12:00.367 --> 12:01.167
EVERYTHING?

12:01.167 --> 12:02.100
YOU WERE NEVER DISHONEST IN THE

12:02.100 --> 12:02.667
HIRING PROCESS?

12:02.667 --> 12:03.267
>> NEVER DISHONEST.

12:03.267 --> 12:04.200
NEVER.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.067
THEY LOOKED SO SCARED OF ME, IT

12:05.067 --> 12:05.900
WAS A SHAME.

12:05.900 --> 12:07.100
>> Reporter: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

12:07.100 --> 12:08.100
>> WHEN THEY, WE'VE GOT TO GET

12:08.100 --> 12:08.867
YOU OUT OF HERE.

12:08.867 --> 12:09.900
WE'VE GOT TO GET YOU OFF THE

12:09.900 --> 12:11.167
PREMISES.

12:11.167 --> 12:12.167
>> Reporter: LEWIS SAYS THAT

12:12.167 --> 12:13.100
SCENARIO PLAYED OUT OVER AND

12:13.100 --> 12:14.800
OVER AGAIN.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
LATER ON, HE HAD TWO OFFERS THAT

12:15.800 --> 12:17.333
WERE THEN REVOKED.

12:17.333 --> 12:18.800
HE HAD PROMISING PHONE CALLS

12:18.800 --> 12:19.500
WITH ANOTHER COMPANY THAT WENT

12:19.500 --> 12:21.233
NOWHERE.

12:21.233 --> 12:22.933
HE SAYS THE ONLY EXPLANATION HE

12:22.933 --> 12:24.067
RECEIVED: THE EXISTENCE OF

12:24.067 --> 12:26.100
CRIMES IN HIS PAST.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.533
FOUR OF THOSE COMPANIES DECLINED

12:27.533 --> 12:30.067
TO DISCUSS LEWIS' CASE WITH US.

12:30.067 --> 12:30.967
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING

12:30.967 --> 12:31.933
TO WATCH THIS, AND THEY'RE GOING

12:31.933 --> 12:32.767
TO SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:32.767 --> 12:34.067
YOU WEREN'T A KID.

12:34.067 --> 12:35.067
YOU WERE 25.

12:35.067 --> 12:36.533
YOU WERE AN ADULT.

12:36.533 --> 12:38.400
YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.367
AND THAT THIS IS A CONSEQUENCE,

12:39.367 --> 12:40.300
THIS IS A CONSEQUENCE OF YOUR

12:40.300 --> 12:42.267
ACTIONS."

12:42.267 --> 12:43.700
>> IF YOU SHOW ME ONE PERSON

12:43.700 --> 12:45.667
THAT HASN'T MADE A MISTAKE, THEN

12:45.667 --> 12:48.133
I WON'T APPLY NOWHERE ELSE.

12:48.133 --> 12:49.533

13:00.700 --> 13:02.267

13:02.267 --> 13:03.800
THEY SAY IT'S DRIVING A GROWING

13:03.800 --> 13:05.400
NUMBER OF PEOPLE INTO POVERTY.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.367
AND THAT RONALD LEWIS' CASE IS

13:06.367 --> 13:08.400
HARDLY UNIQUE.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.200
>> IT'S VERY COMMON.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.767
WE SEE CLIENTS COME IN WITH

13:11.767 --> 13:12.700
VARIATIONS OF HIS STORY ON A

13:32.967 --> 13:34.667
REASON PEOPLE COME TO US FOR

13:34.667 --> 13:36.100

TO END UP IN POVERTY AS THEIR

13:51.667 --> 13:53.700
PEERS.

22:24.533 --> 22:26.233
FOLLOWING LAST WEEK'S STORY

22:26.233 --> 22:27.867
ABOUT TOXIC STRESS AND THE

22:27.867 --> 22:29.733
EFFECT THAT STRESS CAN HAVE ON

22:29.733 --> 22:30.667
THE DEVELOPING BRAINS OF

22:30.667 --> 22:31.567
CHILDREN.

22:31.567 --> 22:32.500
LEE ELIOTT SPOKE ABOUT HER

22:32.500 --> 22:34.100
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE:

22:34.100 --> 22:35.567
"I WAS A SINGLE MOTHER MAKING

22:35.567 --> 22:37.767
$4.10 AN HOUR.

22:37.767 --> 22:39.233
MY MIND WAS CONSTANTLY

22:39.233 --> 22:41.067
STIMULATED BY THINKING OF DECENT

22:41.067 --> 22:42.867
MEALS FOR MY CHILDREN, KEEPING

22:42.867 --> 22:44.300
MY HOME AND MY CHILDREN CLEAN

22:44.300 --> 22:45.567
AND CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR WAYS

22:45.567 --> 22:47.467
TO IMPROVE OUR LIVES.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.533
MY CHILDREN ARE NOW HARD WORKING

22:48.533 --> 22:50.567
COLLEGE GRADUATES.

22:50.567 --> 22:51.667
YOU CAN TRIUMPH OVER POVERTY IF

22:51.667 --> 22:53.467
YOU SET YOUR MIND ON IT."

22:53.467 --> 22:54.733
DIANA MOSES ASKED ABOUT THE

22:54.733 --> 22:55.500
PROCESS OF ASSISTING THOSE IN

22:55.500 --> 22:57.567
STRESSFUL SITUATIONS:"

22:57.567 --> 22:59.167
... I WONDER WHETHER THE SOCIAL

22:59.167 --> 23:01.067
AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER

23:01.067 --> 23:02.933
ADULT HUMAN BEINGS LIGHTENING

23:02.933 --> 23:04.300
THE LOAD BY THEIR INVOLVEMENT

23:04.300 --> 23:05.000
ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS

23:05.000 --> 23:06.867
MOTHER'S PROGRESS.

23:06.867 --> 23:08.633
I MEAN, SUPPOSE THE MEDS AND

23:08.633 --> 23:11.167
CAMP REFERRALS AND PARENTING

23:11.167 --> 23:12.533
TIPS (AND SO ON) HAD BEEN

23:12.533 --> 23:13.800
PROVIDED WITH MUCH LESS HUMAN-

23:13.800 --> 23:14.733
TO-HUMAN CONTACT, WOULD THE SAME

23:14.733 --> 23:16.100
PROGRESS HAVE BEEN MADE?"

SONIA LEVY KUNGLI ADDED SIMPLY:

23:17.900 --> 23:18.967
"LABELING THE STRESS "TOXIC" IS

23:18.967 --> 23:21.700
TOXIC."

23:21.700 --> 23:23.500
BRANDI JOHNSON BAILEY SAID:

23:23.500 --> 23:24.333
"POVERTY IS LIKE LIVING IN AN

23:24.333 --> 23:26.500
INVISIBLE CAGE.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.700
EVENTUALLY IT BREAKS THEIR

23:27.700 --> 23:30.100
SPIRIT AND ULTIMATELY, THEM."

23:30.100 --> 23:31.367
SOME COMMENTED THAT THE EFFECT

23:31.367 --> 23:32.133
OF STRESS ISN'T LIMITED TO THE

23:32.133 --> 23:34.333
UNDERPRIVILEGED:

23:34.333 --> 23:35.500
GRACE CURRAN BROCK SAID:

23:35.500 --> 23:36.333
"THIS ISN'T JUST HAPPENING TO

23:36.333 --> 23:37.733
POOR KIDS.

23:37.733 --> 23:38.933
MIDDLE CLASS AND RICH KIDS CAN

23:38.933 --> 23:41.133
GROW UP WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE."

23:41.133 --> 23:43.333
BETTY SCARPELLINO ADDED:

23:43.333 --> 23:45.000
"UNFORTUNATELY UNEARNED EARLY

23:45.000 --> 23:46.933
WEALTH SEEMS TO HAVE A SAD

23:46.933 --> 23:48.267
IMPACT ON MANY BRAINS TOO.

23:48.267 --> 23:50.100
EMPATHY DESTROYED!"

AND THERE WAS THIS FROM ROBERT

23:50.800 --> 23:52.133
PHILLIPS:

23:52.133 --> 23:53.067
"I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE RESEARCH

23:53.067 --> 23:53.933
ON THIS SUBJECT FOR DIFFERENT

23:53.933 --> 23:56.233
AGE GROUPS.

23:56.233 --> 23:57.933
I'D BET EVEN LATE ONSET (I.E.

23:57.933 --> 23:59.667
ADULTS WHO GREW UP WELL PROVIDED

23:59.667 --> 24:01.633
THEN LOST CAREERS LATER IN LIFE)

24:01.633 --> 24:03.300
HAVE MAJOR BRAIN ADAPTATION OVER

24:03.300 --> 24:05.033
A SEVERAL YEAR PERIOD."
