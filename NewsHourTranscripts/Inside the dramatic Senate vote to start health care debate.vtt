JUDY WOODRUFF: Denial and
defense, the president's
son-in-law offered both
today in the Russia

00:06.100 --> 00:08.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

00:08.133 --> 00:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spoke privately for members
of the U.S. Senate staff and
briefly publicly for news

00:12.200 --> 00:13.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

00:15.500 --> 00:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Outside the White
House West Wing, Jared Kushner
did something he rarely does:

00:22.400 --> 00:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
speak to reporters.

00:24.133 --> 00:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JARED KUSHNER, Senior
Presidential Adviser:
Let me be very clear.

00:26.200 --> 00:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did not collude with Russia,
nor do I know of anyone else
in the campaign who did so.

00:32.666 --> 00:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I had no improper contacts.

00:35.166 --> 00:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He dismissed the
idea that his father-in-law
benefited from Russian meddling

00:40.033 --> 00:42.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the election.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED KUSHNER: Donald Trump
had a better message and ran a
smarter campaign and that is why

00:47.066 --> 00:49.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he won.

00:49.300 --> 00:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Suggesting otherwise ridicules
those who voted for him.

00:53.233 --> 00:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Kushner
took no questions from
reporters, but said he
had answered all questions

01:00.266 --> 01:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Senate Intelligence
Committee investigators in a
two-hour closed-door session.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His 11-page prepared
remarks gave the first
public explanation of
four meetings he had

01:10.733 --> 01:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Russians during the
campaign and transition.

01:13.133 --> 01:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he didn't know the
purpose of the June 9, 2016,
meeting Donald Trump Jr. set

01:20.066 --> 01:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up with Russian attorney Natalia
Veselnitskaya, campaign chairman
Paul Manafort and others

01:24.666 --> 01:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in hopes of getting
dirt on Hillary Clinton.

01:27.200 --> 01:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kushner said he arrived late
and "quickly determined that
my time wasn't well-spent.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was," he said, "a
waste of our time," a
judgment his brother-in-law
has also expressed.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR., Son of Donald
Trump: It was literally just
a wasted 20 minutes, which

01:40.200 --> 01:42.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was a shame.

01:42.266 --> 01:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Less than a month
after President Trump won the
election, on December 1, Kushner

01:48.600 --> 01:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and national security
adviser-designate Michael
Flynn met with Russian
ambassador, Sergey

01:51.833 --> 01:53.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kislyak.

01:53.866 --> 01:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to Kushner, the envoy
said he wanted to talk about
Syria and convey information

01:58.433 --> 02:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from his generals.

02:00.233 --> 02:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Kislyak asked if there
was a secure line in
the transition office.

02:04.066 --> 02:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Told that there wasn't, Kushner
asked if the Russians had an
existing communications channel

02:08.766 --> 02:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at his embassy we could use.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The ambassador said that
wouldn't be possible.

02:14.233 --> 02:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On December 13, Kushner met,
at Kislyak's insistence, with
Sergey Gorkov, the head of

02:20.433 --> 02:23.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a Russian bank that is
under U.S. sanctions.

02:23.233 --> 02:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said Gorkov told him he
was friendly with President
Putin and expressed hopes for a

02:29.333 --> 02:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
better relationship
in the future.

02:30.966 --> 02:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kushner said he has not been
in contact with Gorkov since.

02:34.633 --> 02:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for the matter of Kushner's
original security clearance
application not including any of

02:39.333 --> 02:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his foreign contacts, the
president's son-in-law
said it was an accident.

02:44.266 --> 02:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said it was submitted
prematurely due to
a miscommunication
with an assistant.

02:50.466 --> 02:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been updated at
least three times.

02:53.400 --> 02:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Sunday, the White House
appeared ready to accept a new
sanctions bill scheduled for

02:57.600 --> 02:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a House vote tomorrow.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would target Russia and
limit Mr. Trump's ability
to lift the penalties.

03:02.966 --> 03:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, White
House Press Secretary: We
support where the legislation

03:04.933 --> 03:06.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is now.

03:06.966 --> 03:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will continue working with
the House and Senate to put
those tough sanctions in place.

03:10.166 --> 03:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But late today,
White House Press Secretary
Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the

03:13.866 --> 03:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president is still studying
the legislation, which was
introduced because of questions

03:18.500 --> 03:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
raised by the Russia
investigation, which has
now entered a new phase.

03:25.433 --> 03:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kushner will be back on Capitol
Hill tomorrow for a private
session with members of the

03:28.366 --> 03:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House Intelligence Committee.

03:29.666 --> 03:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

03:32.733 --> 03:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
said later that President
Trump was -- quote -- "very

03:36.300 --> 03:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proud" of his son-in-law's
actions today.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will go deeper on all of this
right after the news summary.
