Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.208 --> 00:11.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

a flurry of
meetings to fill his Cabinet,
president-elect

of the ACA
to head an offensive against
Obamacare.

00:17.384 --> 00:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, inside Aleppo's battle --
16,000 Syrians
flee as government forces are
poised to take

00:23.724 --> 00:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
back the rebel-held city.

00:25.893 --> 00:31.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the impact of a Trump
presidency on Mexico's
economy -- how the future
commander in chief

00:31.198 --> 00:34.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plans to restructure trade with
our southern
neighbor.

00:34.067 --> 00:38.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VALERIA MOY, Economics
Professor: That flat-screen
that you bought that's like 60
inches' huge,

00:38.171 --> 00:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with sound surround, and it's
really nice,
and it cost you $1,000, guess
what?

00:42.910 --> 00:46.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not going to have that
anymore, because
that was made in Mexico.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's

HARI SREENIVASAN:
President-elect Trump whittled
down his options for key
administration positions

01:05.999 --> 01:06.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

JOHN YANG: Traffic in the Trump
Tower lobby
was heavy today, as the Trump
Cabinet takes

01:20.714 --> 01:22.616 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shape.

01:22.649 --> 01:26.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Representative Tom Price was
picked as health
and human services secretary
tasked with fulfilling

01:26.987 --> 01:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a key campaign promise, repeal
and replace
Obamacare.

01:31.959 --> 01:35.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The six-term Georgia congressman
is an orthopedic
surgeon.

01:35.429 --> 01:40.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chairman of the House Budget
Committee, he's
one of Obamacare's most
outspoken critics,

01:40.500 --> 01:45.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
introducing a detailed plan to
replace it
in every Congress since 2009.

01:45.872 --> 01:50.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Chuck Schumer, the
incoming Democratic
leader, signaled a tough
confirmation fight.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES SCHUMER (D), New York:
He is going
to get a lot of very strong and
very thorough

01:54.715 --> 01:58.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions about the kinds of
things that he
has proposed.

01:58.485 --> 02:05.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he sticks with them, I
think there
is a chance that his nomination
will fail.

02:05.592 --> 02:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Health policy expert
Seema Verma

She runs a consulting firm
called SVC.

02:13.667 --> 02:18.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She worked closely with vice

requires participants
to make monthly payments to get
the most coverage.

02:24.311 --> 02:28.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has become a model for other
Republican
governors.

02:28.248 --> 02:33.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still a big question: Who will
Mr. Trump pick
for secretary of state?

02:33.086 --> 02:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney now targeted by

is to have dinner with the

BOB CORKER (R), Tennessee: The
secretary of
state's role is so important to
a president.

02:52.439 --> 02:57.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He needs to choose someone who
he's very comfortable
with, that he knows there's
going to be no

02:57.277 --> 02:59.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
daylight between him and them.

02:59.479 --> 03:04.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The world needs to know that the
secretary
of state is someone who speaks
fully for the

03:04.618 --> 03:06.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

03:06.386 --> 03:10.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President-elect Trump
also picked
Elaine Chao for transportation
secretary.

03:10.090 --> 03:15.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Chao is an experienced
administrator, restoring
public trust to the United Way
after a financial

scandal, and serving as labor
secretary under
President George W. Bush, the
first Asian

03:21.468 --> 03:23.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
American woman Cabinet member.

03:23.837 --> 03:27.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's also married to Senate
Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell.

03:27.240 --> 03:33.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump hits the road again
for a campaign-style
rally in Cincinnati on Thursday,
a way for

03:33.113 --> 03:37.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him to meet face-to-face with
voters who propelled
him to victory.

03:37.617 --> 03:41.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:41.321 --> 03:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: A
chartered plane
carrying a top Brazilian soccer
team crashed

03:44.758 --> 03:47.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overnight in Colombia, killing
71 people on
board.

03:47.894 --> 03:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plane went down in the
mountains near
Medellin, as the athletes and a
group of journalists

03:51.565 --> 03:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
covering them were en route to a
major tournament.

03:54.201 --> 03:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three of the team's players were
among the
six survivors.

03:57.304 --> 04:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both of the plane's flight
recorders have
been located, and should help
determine what

04:01.408 --> 04:06.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
caused the crash.

04:06.746 --> 04:12.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were ready to play in the
biggest game
in the history of the upstart
soccer club.

04:12.619 --> 04:17.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was the Brazilian soccer
club, Chapecoense,
moments before they boarded the
fated flight

04:17.224 --> 04:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the South American Cup
tournament in Colombia;
21 journalists were also on
board to cover

04:22.596 --> 04:24.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the game.

04:24.431 --> 04:28.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The charter flight was only five
minutes from
landing when it crashed into a
mountainside.

04:29.002 --> 04:32.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First-responders combed through
the wreckage
in the middle of the night and
during a torrential

04:32.772 --> 04:37.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
downpour, looking for anyone
left alive.

04:37.110 --> 04:41.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The few survivors, including
players, flight
crew members and one journalist,
were rushed

04:41.414 --> 04:44.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the nearest hospital.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Daylight revealed the scope of
the devastation.

04:46.286 --> 04:53.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Today,
we will officially
begin the task of identifying
the dead, and,

04:53.059 --> 04:54.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unfortunately, moving the
bodies.

04:54.961 --> 04:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The cause is
under investigation,
and Colombia's aviation agency
said signs

04:59.099 --> 05:02.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pointed to a possible electrical
failure.

05:02.502 --> 05:07.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colombian President Juan Manuel
Santos said
he was coordinating emergency
response efforts

05:07.174 --> 05:09.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Brazilian leader Michel
Temer.

05:09.042 --> 05:13.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUAN MANUEL SANTOS, Colombian
President (through
translator): Sadly, all we can
do, beyond

05:13.713 --> 05:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crying for those who have left
us, is to take
measures that support the
families who are

05:18.752 --> 05:20.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in mourning.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The relatives,
in the team's
home city of Chapeco, in
Southern Brazil,

05:23.023 --> 05:25.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gathered at the club's
headquarters.

05:25.492 --> 05:29.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This afternoon, local fans held
a vigil at
the club's stadium.

05:29.462 --> 05:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on soccer pitches around the
world, there
were moments of silence for the
victims.

05:34.301 --> 05:39.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Islamic State has now
claimed responsibility
for yesterday's attack by a
Somali-born student

05:39.172 --> 05:41.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Ohio State University in
Columbus.

05:41.741 --> 05:46.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That comes as the Associated
Press reported
the attacker, Abdul Razak Ali
Artan, had complained

05:46.680 --> 05:50.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Facebook about American
interference in
Muslim countries.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he wasn't on the FBI's
radar.

05:53.119 --> 05:56.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three of yesterday's 11 victims
remain hospitalized.

05:56.289 --> 06:00.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Weeks of severe drought across
the Southeast
gave way to fast-growing
wildfires in eastern

06:00.794 --> 06:02.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tennessee overnight.

06:02.462 --> 06:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least three people have died,
and more
than a dozen were hospitalized,
including

06:06.433 --> 06:08.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some with burns.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

06:09.569 --> 06:13.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Huge fire, blowing out of
control right
now with the gusts.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The air around
the Great
Smoky Mountains was filled with
flames and

06:17.377 --> 06:19.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
acrid smoke.

06:19.279 --> 06:23.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fast-moving blazes damaged
or destroyed
hundreds of homes and other
buildings, including

06:23.216 --> 06:25.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an entire resort.

06:25.285 --> 06:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tens of thousands of residents
and tourists
were forced to evacuate
Gatlinburg, Pigeon

06:29.889 --> 06:33.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Forge, and other parts of Sevier
County, near
the Smoky Mountains.

06:33.126 --> 06:36.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We were aware of the fires
in the area,
but we didn't know that they
were anywhere

06:36.529 --> 06:37.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
close to where we were.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the wind blowing like it
was, we needed
to leave.

06:39.966 --> 06:44.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Gatlinburg
Fire Chief Greg
Miller said close to 200
firefighters battled

06:44.271 --> 06:46.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through near-impossible
conditions.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GREG MILLER, Gatlinburg,
Tennessee, Fire Chief:
There were times last night that
we had wind

06:48.942 --> 06:52.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gusts in excess of 87 miles an
hour.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is hurricane-force.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is nowhere to be when
trying to fight
a fire.

06:56.950 --> 07:03.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a fire for the history
books, because
it is unlike anything most have
ever seen.

07:03.523 --> 07:07.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Tennessee
National Guard
was also deployed, but Miller
said the worst

07:07.861 --> 07:10.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is -- quote -- "definitely
over."

07:10.363 --> 07:15.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fires also closed Dollywood,
country music
star Dolly Parton's theme park.

07:15.302 --> 07:20.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Gatlinburg, the Ripley's
Aquarium of
the Smokies remained untouched
and its more

07:20.940 --> 07:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than 10,000 animals were safe.

07:23.943 --> 07:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wind speeds dropped to about 15
miles per
hour today, and rain is in the
forecast for

07:28.315 --> 07:30.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some of the hardest-hit areas.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

HARI SREENIVASAN: South Korea's
embattled
President Park Geun-hye offered
a conditional

07:37.357 --> 07:40.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resignation today, in a bid to
stave off impeachment.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Park has been embroiled in a
corruption scandal
in which she has been accused of
providing

07:43.496 --> 07:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
special favors to a childhood
friend.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That touched off massive
demonstrations demanding
her ouster.

07:49.202 --> 07:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a national address today in
Seoul, Park
said she's ready to step down if
Parliament

07:54.040 --> 07:55.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
arranges the technical details.

07:55.975 --> 08:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PARK GEUN-HYE, South Korea
President (through
translator): I will leave
everything, including

08:00.413 --> 08:03.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the shortening of my
presidential term, to
the Parliament's decision.

08:03.783 --> 08:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will resign, along with a
schedule and procedure
that is decided by political
parties that

08:08.421 --> 08:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can minimize any confusion
arising from the
unexpected transfer of power.

08:12.192 --> 08:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Opposition
parties immediately
called the offer a stall tactic
to avoid impeachment

08:17.364 --> 08:19.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before her term ends in early
2018.

08:19.933 --> 08:25.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Korea's National Assembly
could vote
on a motion to impeach her as
early as Friday.

08:25.105 --> 08:29.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in the U.S., thousands of
low-wage workers
staged protests and sit-ins
today in hundreds

08:29.909 --> 08:33.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of cities, demanding a $15
minimum wage.

08:33.279 --> 08:38.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They included employees of fast
food restaurants,
Uber drivers, child care
providers, and airport

08:38.818 --> 08:40.653 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers.

08:40.687 --> 08:44.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Chicago's O'Hare, hundreds of
protesters
gathered outside terminals,
chanting and waving

08:44.524 --> 08:46.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
signs.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a press conference later,
striking employees
voiced their frustrations.

08:48.661 --> 08:52.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KISHA RIVERA, Airport Employee:
We are not
asking for special treatment.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are asking for decent
treatment.

08:54.734 --> 08:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are asking for decent wages.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're asking -- no, we're not
asking.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're demanding respect.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: That's right!

09:01.207 --> 09:02.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Yes!

09:03.009 --> 09:06.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile, in
Los Angeles,
police arrested several
protesters picketing

09:06.413 --> 09:08.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a McDonald's for blocking
traffic.

09:08.281 --> 09:12.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All told, dozens of people were
arrested across
the country.

09:12.652 --> 09:16.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And stocks rose on Wall Street
today, led
by a rally in the health care
sector.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained more
than 23 points to close at
19121.

09:20.059 --> 09:26.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 11 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added nearly three.

09:26.366 --> 09:29.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what Donald
Trump's pick for health and
human services

09:30.003 --> 09:37.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary means for Obamacare;
Syrian government
forces gain ground in Aleppo;
expanding charter

09:37.477 --> 09:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
schools into black communities;
and much more.

09:47.520 --> 09:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
schools into black communities;
and much more.

09:52.826 --> 09:56.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As president-elect Trump's pick
to lead the
Health and Human Services
Department, Congressman

09:56.763 --> 10:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Price would oversee programs
as wide-ranging
as Medicare and Medicaid.

10:00.233 --> 10:04.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, he would help lead
efforts to
carry out one of Mr. Trump's
signature campaign

10:04.604 --> 10:09.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pledges: repeal and replace the
Affordable
Care Act, also known as
Obamacare.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For more, we turn to Sarah
Kliff.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has written extensively on
the topic for
the Web site Vox.

10:13.012 --> 10:16.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What do we know about
Congressman Price and
the plans that he has already
had in mind?

10:16.216 --> 10:19.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF, Vox: So, he's a
congressman who
has spent a lot of time thinking
about repeal

10:19.652 --> 10:21.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and replace of Obamacare.

10:21.554 --> 10:26.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the author of a 242-page
replacement
plan for Obamacare.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the guy you would pick if
you're quite
serious about moving forward on
Obamacare

10:30.630 --> 10:32.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
repeal.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Republicans
have tried to
do repeal and replace before.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Even Speaker Ryan has a plan.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do these plans have in
common?

10:37.103 --> 10:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: So, they generally
cover fewer
people than Obamacare.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They would leave a few million
people uninsured.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The exact number depends on the
plan.

10:44.611 --> 10:48.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're generally better for
young, healthy
people and worse for sick, older
people.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How so?

10:50.416 --> 10:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: They have a lot
less protections
for people with preexisting
conditions.

10:53.152 --> 10:57.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They make it possible for
insurance companies
to charge more to those who are
sick.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be a really big
change from Obamacare,
which outlaws those provisions.

11:00.994 --> 11:05.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And then what
does the pick
say of Seema Verma, who is going
to run Medicare

11:05.331 --> 11:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Medicaid, say about this new
team that
he's putting in place?

11:08.935 --> 11:12.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She's worked on Medicaid
expansion as a consultant
for different states?

11:12.205 --> 11:14.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: She's incredibly
experienced
in Medicaid policy.

11:15.008 --> 11:18.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It suggests to me that the Trump
administration
is thinking about making some
big changes

11:18.845 --> 11:23.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Medicaid, possibly adding
premiums into
the program, which serves
low-income Americans.

11:23.416 --> 11:27.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And is there
-- when we
talk about the changes that
could affect millions

11:27.954 --> 11:31.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people -- we know Obamacare
gets this big
umbrella thing, but really on
brass tacks

11:31.324 --> 11:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it comes to specific
policies that impact
folks, so let's, for example,
take contraception

11:37.230 --> 11:38.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How could that change?

11:40.066 --> 11:42.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: That's something
that's very
easy for a Trump administration,
for Congressman

11:42.368 --> 11:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Price in office to really turn
back on day
one.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's something that the Obama
administration
did in regulations.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not in the law.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They could rewrite those
regulations to say
that contraceptives are no
longer covered

11:53.813 --> 11:55.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under Obamacare.

11:55.615 --> 11:59.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the
congressman is against
abortion, Congressman Price is,
right?

11:59.152 --> 12:03.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it takes something else to
try to get
even your personal view put into
legislation

12:04.023 --> 12:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that gets passed by all of
Congress.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF: Sure.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is going to be a lot of
back-and-forth,
a lot of heated battles just
like we had around

12:10.396 --> 12:12.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obamacare in 2010.

12:12.231 --> 12:17.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There will be a lot of
infighting and figuring
out what does the Republican
agenda on health

12:17.670 --> 12:19.606 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care look like?

12:19.639 --> 12:23.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is one that Trump and
senators and Representative
Price at HHS now, what can they
agree on?

12:23.576 --> 12:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about
Medicare?

12:24.978 --> 12:27.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That affects a huge population
also covered
under this.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: The Republicans
have a pretty
cohesive view for Medicare.

12:30.016 --> 12:34.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to switch it to more
of a voucher
program, where seniors get a set
amount of

12:34.053 --> 12:36.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
money, they shop for different
plans.

12:36.222 --> 12:38.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of those plans might be a
government-run
Medicaid.

12:38.191 --> 12:42.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There would also be private
competitors and
they would kind of be using
their set amount

12:42.161 --> 12:44.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of money to pick whatever plan
they could
afford.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how about
the health
-- I guess the health insurance
that most

12:47.500 --> 12:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of us get through employer
coverage?

12:49.202 --> 12:52.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH KLIFF: There is a big
change to that
in Representative Price's plan
as well.

12:52.872 --> 12:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would cap the tax exclusion
we right now
for insurance, meaning that the
cost of insurance

12:58.177 --> 13:02.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you get at work, that could
go up pretty
significantly under
Representative Price's

13:02.448 --> 13:03.950 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plan.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And so all of
these of course
have political consequences.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When you feel it in your
personal pocketbook,
you might choose to vote a
different way.

13:09.155 --> 13:10.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF: Yes.

13:10.923 --> 13:13.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there will be things
that Republican
legislators like, that they like
in policy

13:13.993 --> 13:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and in theory, that are quite
politically
difficult to implement.

13:17.497 --> 13:21.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The cap on employer-sponsored
insurance is
a great example of that.

13:21.834 --> 13:25.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats wanted to make the
same change in
2010, but they found it was
politically impossible

13:25.938 --> 13:26.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do so.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Republicans will face
similar barriers.

13:28.741 --> 13:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Sarah Kliff from
Vox, thanks so much.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARAH KLIFF: Thank you.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
let's dig a little
deeper now on the potential
fallout for Obamacare

13:35.648 --> 13:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the people who use its
benefits.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sabrina Corlette specializes in
health insurance
markets, as a research professor
at Georgetown

13:41.954 --> 13:43.856 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
University.

13:43.890 --> 13:46.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bob Moffit is a senior
fellow at the Heritage
Foundation's center for Health
Policy Studies.

13:46.392 --> 13:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump team has been meeting
with people
at Heritage Foundation during
this transition.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Bob Moffit, what does this
appointment
signal to you?

13:51.998 --> 13:55.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT MOFFIT, Heritage
Foundation: It signals
that president-elect Trump is
very serious

13:55.902 --> 14:00.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the promise to repeal and
replace Obamacare.

14:00.373 --> 14:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The appointment of Congressman
Price is the
appointment of an individual who
has a long

14:07.280 --> 14:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experience in health policy in
the House and
has introduced legislation to
repeal Obamacare

14:12.719 --> 14:15.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and to replace it with
provisions of his own.

14:15.722 --> 14:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think from the standpoint
of the administration,
this is a very serious
appointment.

14:19.759 --> 14:25.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a very, very big signal to
both the House
and the Senate that the Trump
administration

14:26.032 --> 14:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is very serious about this
issue.

14:27.834 --> 14:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sabrina
Corlette, he has
had a 240-plus page plan already
on the books.

14:32.672 --> 14:35.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's in addition to all the
other Republican
plans that are out there to
repeal and replace.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA CORLETTE, Center on
Health Insurance
Reforms, Georgetown University:
Right.

14:37.744 --> 14:42.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one thing that Mr.
Moffit and I would
absolutely agree on is that the
nomination

14:42.148 --> 14:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Mr. Price is a clear signal
that the repeal
of Obamacare is a top priority
for this new

14:49.055 --> 14:50.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

14:50.990 --> 14:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, I don't think that we
can say anything
that the Republicans have put
forward, including

14:56.329 --> 15:02.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Price, constitutes a
replacement of the
Affordable Care Act, because
none of the proposals,

15:02.335 --> 15:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including Mr. Price's proposal,
would cover
nearly the same number of people
that the

15:07.673 --> 15:12.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Affordable Care Act covers, nor
would it provide
the same consumer protections
for people with

15:12.044 --> 15:13.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
preexisting conditions.

15:13.479 --> 15:16.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, Robert
Moffit, again,
a plan does not exist.

15:16.415 --> 15:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about based on
what he's proposed
before and what other
Republicans have proposed

15:19.986 --> 15:20.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT MOFFIT: Right.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's the
cost that maybe
the new administration is
willing to tolerate

15:25.291 --> 15:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the number of people that
got...

15:27.260 --> 15:31.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MOFFIT: Well, I think
that the president-elect
himself made a comment at the
very beginning

15:31.264 --> 15:36.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this, and actually put it in
print, that,
in fact, nobody should fall
through the cracks.

15:36.702 --> 15:42.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember that Tom Price is an
orthopedic surgeon,
so I think what we're looking at
is a surgical

15:42.341 --> 15:45.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approach to the Affordable Care
Act.

15:45.578 --> 15:48.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think what you will see
is any kind
of massive disruption.

15:49.015 --> 15:53.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the major concern right
now for those
of us in health policy is that
we are already

15:53.719 --> 15:59.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facing a massive instability in
the insurance
markets, particularly in the
small group and

15:59.392 --> 16:01.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the individual markets.

16:01.194 --> 16:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With premiums jumping 25 percent
nationwide,
average premiums in the
exchanges, and then

16:07.433 --> 16:12.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with these breathtaking
deductibles -- for
a family with a bronze plan,
you're talking

16:12.371 --> 16:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a $12,000 deductible --
health insurance
is becoming less and less
affordable for millions

16:18.177 --> 16:19.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Americans.

16:20.012 --> 16:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people in the exchanges is
only one part
of this problem -- or only one
part of this

16:24.250 --> 16:26.185 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
problem.

16:26.219 --> 16:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you got about 10 million
people in the
individual market outside of the
exchanges

16:29.856 --> 16:34.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who do not get any subsidies at
all who are
being affected by this, and then
you also

16:34.694 --> 16:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have another 15 million people
in the group
market, so -- small group
market.

16:39.799 --> 16:45.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this problem that we have
right now with
affordability and cost and the
instability

16:45.504 --> 16:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the insurance market is
affecting millions
of people.

16:49.008 --> 16:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What that means is, is that the
administration
cannot waste time on this.

16:53.679 --> 16:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to come to the rescue
of people
to make sure that those who have
coverage

16:57.550 --> 17:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't actually lose it, and we
have higher
rates of uninsurance as a result
of it.

17:01.587 --> 17:05.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sabrina
Corlette, how do
you take a surgical approach,
but also contain

17:05.391 --> 17:07.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
costs?

17:07.159 --> 17:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA CORLETTE: Well, I'm not
sure how you
take a surgical approach, based
on what we

17:10.229 --> 17:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have heard Mr. Price and other
congressional
leaders, as well as the
president-elect, say.

17:14.734 --> 17:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have called for a wholesale
repeal of
the Affordable Care Act.

17:18.771 --> 17:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would include expansion of
Medicaid,
which is the program that covers
low-income

17:22.608 --> 17:24.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

17:24.477 --> 17:29.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would include a repeal of
the tax credits
that help moderate-income people
afford coverage,

17:29.649 --> 17:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as the individual
mandate, which is
supposed to get healthy people
into the pool

17:33.119 --> 17:35.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and make coverage more
affordable across the
board.

17:35.955 --> 17:42.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once you repeal all of that,
that's going
to cause massive disruption in
the market.

17:42.361 --> 17:46.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's going to throw as
many as 22 million
people off of coverage.

17:46.299 --> 17:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, Mr. Price has put forward a
bill.

17:49.602 --> 17:56.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, the tax credits that it
provides
are a tiny fraction of what the
Affordable

17:56.108 --> 17:57.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Care Act provides to people.

17:57.944 --> 18:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also not income-based,
so they heavily
favor higher-income people over
lower-income

18:03.015 --> 18:04.817 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

18:04.850 --> 18:08.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then if you have a
preexisting condition
and you have even a tiny lapse
in coverage,

18:08.421 --> 18:10.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you're left out in the cold.

18:10.222 --> 18:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mr. Moffit,
this is also
on the heels of president-elect
Trump coming

18:12.558 --> 18:17.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out and saying, listen, he'd
like to preserve
the clause that says you can't
discriminate

18:17.596 --> 18:18.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on preexisting conditions.

18:18.831 --> 18:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's almost universally
agreed.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is nobody that wants that.

18:21.701 --> 18:24.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MOFFIT: There is nobody
who is arguing
that we should exclude
individuals from health

18:24.704 --> 18:28.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insurance coverage because they
are sick or
they have a preexisting
condition.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's nonsense.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's never been the debate.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, what is the
best way to do
it?

18:32.378 --> 18:34.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how do you
pay for that?

18:34.180 --> 18:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MOFFIT: Well, you're
going to have
to pay for it in any event,
because we're

18:35.982 --> 18:37.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
paying for it one way or
another.

18:37.850 --> 18:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If people do not get access to
health insurance
and they end up in the hospital
emergency

18:41.520 --> 18:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room, the most expensive place
on the planet,
tax players are stuck with the
bill.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we have got to address this.

18:47.526 --> 18:52.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Frankly, I think that a
mainstream proposal
right now that is circulating
among House

18:52.765 --> 18:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans is to adopt one of
the practices
that we have in group insurance
right now

18:58.404 --> 19:02.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under the Health Insurance
Affordability and
Accountability Act, which is
this, is that

19:02.675 --> 19:07.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you have credible coverage,
creditable
coverage, and you move from one
job to another

19:07.713 --> 19:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and join different types of
groups, you cannot
be rated up, regardless of any
kind of preexisting

19:13.419 --> 19:14.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
condition.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MOFFIT: We do not have
any kind of
crisis of preexisting conditions
in employment-based

19:18.924 --> 19:19.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health insurance.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The problem is in the individual
market.

19:22.094 --> 19:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're going to be personally
responsible
and buy insurance at an
affordable rate, you

19:26.499 --> 19:27.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can do that.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Otherwise, you can be rated up.

19:29.635 --> 19:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That puts the responsibility
where it belongs,
on the individual who is buying
the insurance.

19:34.373 --> 19:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SABRINA CORLETTE: Well, for
people who have
come off an employer-based plan,
that typically

19:39.945 --> 19:42.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
means they have come off because
they have
lost their job.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It can be very difficult for
those people
to afford the premiums that you
have to pay

19:46.786 --> 19:51.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to maintain health insurance
coverage, particularly
given the fact that the tax
credits that some

19:51.857 --> 19:55.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of these Republican proposals
are talking
about are paltry.

19:55.461 --> 20:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what would happen is, if you
skip some
time and go without coverage
because you can't

20:01.200 --> 20:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afford it, you can't afford the
premium, what
some of these proposals would do
would effectively

20:05.504 --> 20:10.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lock you out until you either
get back into
an employer-based plan or become
eligible

20:10.276 --> 20:12.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Medicare.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
this is a conversation,
and legislation will eventually
make its way

20:14.814 --> 20:15.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Capitol Hill.

20:15.815 --> 20:16.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will have you back then.

20:16.916 --> 20:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robert Moffit, Sabrina Corlette,
thank you
both.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT MOFFIT: Pleasure.

20:24.190 --> 20:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SABRINA CORLETTE: Thank you.

20:27.493 --> 20:30.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a pleasure.

20:30.796 --> 20:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT MOFFIT: All right.

20:34.066 --> 20:39.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Overseas now:
Thousands
more civilians fled the eastern
rebel-held

20:39.705 --> 20:45.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sectors of Syria's largest city,
Aleppo, this
week, as the war there took an
even more violent

20:45.111 --> 20:46.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
turn.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Syrian Civil Defense Rescue
Group reported
that at least 50 people were
killed today

20:49.882 --> 20:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and 150 injured, amid relentless
shelling
and bombing.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner reports.

20:57.389 --> 21:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In the last few
days, Syrian
government forces have retaken a
large swathe

21:03.062 --> 21:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Eastern Aleppo, long a
stronghold for fighters
opposed to President Bashar
al-Assad.

21:08.501 --> 21:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aid groups say shortages of food
and medical
care there are the gravest yet.

21:15.407 --> 21:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION (through translator):
How did your
mother die?

21:18.777 --> 21:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): She
died of hunger.

21:21.313 --> 21:23.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We haven't had any water or food
for five
months.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They didn't feed us.

21:25.317 --> 21:27.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They ate bread, and we were
hungry.

21:27.753 --> 21:33.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: As the death
toll keeps mounting,
the top U.N. envoy to Syria
suggested today

21:33.392 --> 21:36.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rebels may not be able to
hold out.

21:36.128 --> 21:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAFFAN DE MISTURA, Special
United Nations
Envoy for Syria: This is a
military acceleration,

21:40.132 --> 21:43.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I can't tell you how long
Eastern Aleppo
will last.

21:43.269 --> 21:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Major aid
groups are still
being denied entry to help
civilians remaining

21:48.307 --> 21:50.176 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the city.

21:50.209 --> 21:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETTINA LUESCHER, World Food
Program: We are
ready to mobilize food,
preposition in warehouses

21:52.244 --> 21:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Western Aleppo, or across the
border from
Turkey, to the people trapped in
Eastern Aleppo,

21:59.485 --> 22:01.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if access is granted.

22:01.153 --> 22:06.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, once again, we join -- like
everybody
else, let us get into Eastern
Aleppo.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can help the people there.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let us in.

22:10.296 --> 22:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: There is not a
single working
hospital left in East Aleppo
either.

22:14.900 --> 22:19.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Medical structures that we
have been
supporting for many years that
have been bombed

22:19.038 --> 22:23.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now almost a dozen times over
the last year.

22:23.409 --> 22:25.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just incredible.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And Russian and
Syrian planes
reportedly have dropped leaflets
on East Aleppo,

22:28.814 --> 22:34.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warning: "If you do not leave
these areas
urgently, you will be
annihilated.

22:34.253 --> 22:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know that everyone has given
up on you.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They left you alone to face your
doom."

22:38.924 --> 22:41.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANIA ABOUZEID, Journalist: You
know, the
Syrian rebels have always felt
abandoned.

22:41.794 --> 22:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Journalist
Rania Abouzeid
in Beirut keeps in contact with
Western-backed

22:47.132 --> 22:48.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rebel commanders.

22:48.901 --> 22:52.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANIA ABOUZEID: They felt
abandoned by an
international community that
said Assad must

22:52.504 --> 22:55.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go, but didn't really help them
to see that
through.

22:55.741 --> 23:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there's a great sense of
abandonment, there
is a sense of anger.

23:00.379 --> 23:05.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The battlefield
tilted sharply
in Assad's favor when Russia
entered the war

23:05.417 --> 23:07.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
14 months ago.

23:07.186 --> 23:12.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Russian airpower, and
Shiite militias
from Iran, Lebanon and Iraq on
the ground,

23:12.691 --> 23:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Assad regime has regained
its footing
and territory.

23:15.961 --> 23:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANIA ABOUZEID: We have seen
several instances
in the recent past, over the
past year, when

23:20.532 --> 23:28.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it looked like Aleppo might
fall, but certainly
nothing in terms of the scale
and the speed

23:28.474 --> 23:33.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at which we have seen regime
gains in the
eastern part of the city over
the past 24

23:33.979 --> 23:35.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to 48 hours.

23:35.814 --> 23:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it certainly looks like this
might be the
decisive moment for the future
of rebel-held

23:40.953 --> 23:42.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Aleppo at this point.

23:42.788 --> 23:47.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Secretary of
State John Kerry
keeps pushing for a cease-fire
for Aleppo,

23:47.059 --> 23:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
negotiating with Russia and
regional powers
backing different rebel
factions.

23:51.297 --> 23:55.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANIA ABOUZEID: The Syrians have
some hope
that if the bigger guys, the
bigger players

23:55.167 --> 23:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can find some sort of agreement.

23:57.002 --> 24:00.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then perhaps that might trickle
down to mean
something in terms of the
battlefield on the

24:00.806 --> 24:02.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ground.

24:02.541 --> 24:05.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But other top
Obama officials
suspect Russia wants to cement a
military

24:05.944 --> 24:10.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
victory on the ground now, in
the administration's
final weeks.

24:10.282 --> 24:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Said one: "If you're sitting in
Moscow, would
you rather deal with President
Obama, or present

24:15.054 --> 24:18.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a fait accompli to new President
Trump?"

24:18.290 --> 24:22.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For now, it looks like the
rebels want to
fight on in Aleppo.

24:22.494 --> 24:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANIA ABOUZEID: Well, certainly
the rebels
will try and win it back.

24:25.097 --> 24:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the question is, will they
have the means
to do that?

24:28.200 --> 24:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will they have the international
support to
do that?

24:30.569 --> 24:35.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And will this change anything in
terms of
the calculus of their
international backers?

24:35.307 --> 24:39.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Questions that
will have
to be faced by Syria, its
neighbors and the

24:39.611 --> 24:41.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
new American president alike.

24:41.814 --> 24:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm

Coming up on the "NewsHour":
economic ties
between the U.S. and Mexico
under a President

25:03.702 --> 25:07.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump; and athletes who are
having an impact
off the field.

25:07.806 --> 25:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: the battle over
school choice and
public education is likely to
intensify under

25:13.645 --> 25:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Trump administration.

25:15.447 --> 25:19.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His choice for education
secretary, Betsy
DeVos, is a big supporter of
vouchers and

25:19.852 --> 25:24.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charter schools, both of which
use tax dollars
that would normally go to
neighborhood public

25:24.490 --> 25:26.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

25:26.258 --> 25:29.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fight over these issues is
already building
within the African-American
community.

25:29.995 --> 25:35.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The NAACP is calling for a
moratorium on new
charter schools, but some black
parents are

25:35.434 --> 25:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pushing back against that.

Special correspondent Lisa Stark
of our partner
Education Week reports from
Memphis, part

25:41.607 --> 25:44.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of our weekly series Making the

25:44.543 --> 25:53.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: At Freedom
Preparatory Academy
in Memphis, there's a constant
beat echoing

25:53.118 --> 25:56.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through the hallways.

25:56.488 --> 26:04.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not just from the
African drum class
required of every middle
schooler here.

26:04.129 --> 26:11.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's being drummed into these
charter school
students is that education, a
college degree

26:11.904 --> 26:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and proper behavior are critical
to getting
ahead.

26:20.212 --> 26:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I ask you to describe Freedom
Prep in one
word, what would it be?

26:23.882 --> 26:24.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TYLER VAUGHN, Student: College.

26:24.883 --> 26:25.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRIANNA TODD, Student:
Preparation.

TALY ORDONEZ, Student: Life.

LISA STARK: Senior Tyler Vaughn,
eighth grader
Brianna Todd and fifth grader
Taly Ordonez

26:31.356 --> 26:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all came to Freedom Prep after
stints in traditional
public schools.

26:35.794 --> 26:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TYLER VAUGHN: Since sixth grade,
they always
instilled in us that we would be
going to

26:40.766 --> 26:42.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
college and we would excel in
college.

26:42.568 --> 26:46.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIANNA TODD: It definitely
teaches us to
be responsible throughout out
entire life.

26:46.238 --> 26:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TALY ORDONEZ: Charter school, it
prepares
you for college and life.

26:51.877 --> 26:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Nearly three million
students
in the U.S. attend charter
schools in 42 states

26:57.349 --> 27:03.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the District of Columbia,
about 6 percent
of all public school students
nationwide.

27:03.455 --> 27:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in more than a dozen cities,
at least
30 percent of the students
attend charters.

27:08.660 --> 27:13.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As in many cities,
African-American parents
in Memphis are voting with their
feet.

27:13.699 --> 27:18.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was a struggling elementary
school three
years ago, when the state asked
Freedom Prep

27:18.770 --> 27:19.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to take it over.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The charter school came in.

27:21.773 --> 27:26.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Enrollment doubled.

27:26.678 --> 27:32.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charter schools are often open
in poor neighborhoods,
and predominantly serve children
of color.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they have a mixed record.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Some are excellent.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Others fall far short.

27:37.256 --> 27:40.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some states have strict
standards for charters.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Others do not.

27:42.027 --> 27:44.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CORNELL WILLIAM BROOKS,
President, NAACP:
The issue for us is just simply
making sure

27:44.696 --> 27:46.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyone operates by the same
rules.

27:46.498 --> 27:52.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: The NAACP is calling
for a moratorium
on new charter schools,
concerned about a

27:52.771 --> 27:58.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
host of issues, including
charters that seem
to cherry-pick students or have
high suspension

27:58.443 --> 28:00.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rates for children of color.

28:00.746 --> 28:02.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The group wants reforms.

28:02.481 --> 28:06.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNELL WILLIAM BROOKS: Make
sure kids aren't
being suspended or expelled
unfairly.

28:06.451 --> 28:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Make sure you have standards of
accountability
and transparency, and let's make
sure that

28:12.291 --> 28:18.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we don't cream the best
students, to the disservice
of all the students.

28:18.096 --> 28:24.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: NAACP President
Cornell William
Brooks insists the group is not
anti-charter,

28:24.403 --> 28:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he stresses accountability
for these schools,
which receive public education
dollars, but

28:30.042 --> 28:33.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are often run by private
organizations and
boards.

28:33.545 --> 28:41.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNELL WILLIAM BROOKS: If we
think that setting
up a system without standards,
like an educational

28:41.153 --> 28:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wild, Wild West, is going to
save public education
-- by public education, I mean
education for

28:46.191 --> 28:48.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all children -- we are sadly
mistaken.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Do you think there's
a schism,
a break in the black community
over this?

28:51.463 --> 28:53.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH CARPENTER, Memphis Lift: I
know it is.

28:53.365 --> 28:59.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Sarah Carpenter
believes in charter
schools and worries that the
NAACP is out

28:59.705 --> 29:01.006 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of touch.

29:01.039 --> 29:06.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH CARPENTER: Most of these
people live
in suburban areas.

29:06.044 --> 29:09.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They look like me, but they are
not connected
to me.

29:09.815 --> 29:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Carpenter lives in
North Memphis,
an area of high poverty, with
both traditional

29:15.253 --> 29:17.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and charter schools.

29:17.189 --> 29:22.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She sent her oldest
granddaughter to a charter
more than a decade ago, inspired
by the school's

29:22.060 --> 29:23.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
focus on college.

29:23.862 --> 29:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH CARPENTER: It changed my
life, because
they made our kids believe that
they could

29:27.966 --> 29:29.401 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do this.

29:29.434 --> 29:33.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And growing up in this
neighborhood, my mom
didn't talk about college.

29:33.505 --> 29:38.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Carpenter's
granddaughter did
go on to college, and Carpenter
now runs Memphis

29:38.443 --> 29:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lift, an education advocacy
group for parents
funded partly by groups that
support charters.

29:48.153 --> 29:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She led a noisy protest at the
NAACP board
meeting in Cincinnati this fall,
as the board

29:53.558 --> 29:56.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ratified the charter moratorium
resolution.

29:56.094 --> 30:01.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH CARPENTER: We were
screaming to the
top of our voice: You're not
speaking for

30:01.900 --> 30:03.602 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH WILLIAMS, Memphis Teachers
Union: I
don't think they have the full
understanding

30:05.137 --> 30:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and exposure of what a proper,
adequate education
is for their children.

30:09.775 --> 30:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Keith Williams is
the executive
director of Tennessee's largest
local teachers

30:14.279 --> 30:18.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
union, and he believes parents
are often hoodwinked
by charters.

30:18.350 --> 30:22.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it sounds to me like you're
saying parents
shouldn't have a choice, aren't
smart enough

30:22.921 --> 30:24.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to know where their kid should
go to school.

30:24.790 --> 30:32.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH WILLIAMS: I'm saying that
some parents
are not capable of determining
venues that

30:32.130 --> 30:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be the most advantageous
for their children.

30:35.100 --> 30:39.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's a fact.

30:39.571 --> 30:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Teachers unions have
long opposed
charters, which in most cases
can hire and

30:45.077 --> 30:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fire teachers at will, and
Williams believes
charters have harmed public
education as a

30:51.349 --> 30:53.452 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
whole.

30:53.485 --> 30:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEITH WILLIAMS: If we didn't
have the competitive,
economic interests of these
self-serving entrepreneurs

30:59.391 --> 31:04.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in charters, public schools
would be in a
better condition, they would be
more academically

31:04.596 --> 31:07.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sound, certainly more
financially sound.

31:07.065 --> 31:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: But for parents such
as Kimberly
McNeal, there is no debate.

31:11.937 --> 31:16.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She even moved just so she could
easily get
her daughters, Cassidy (ph) and
Kai (ph),

31:16.675 --> 31:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a nearby charter school,
Vision Prep.

31:19.444 --> 31:25.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY MCNEAL, Parent: Me
coming from a
Memphis city school, I wanted
something different,

31:25.617 --> 31:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something more challenging for
my children.

31:28.754 --> 31:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: It's important for
you to have
a choice?

31:30.489 --> 31:32.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KIMBERLY MCNEAL: It is.

31:32.224 --> 31:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important for anybody to
have a choice,
whether it's public, private or
charter.

31:37.796 --> 31:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everybody should have a choice
in where they
feel like their children would
do better and

31:42.768 --> 31:44.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
succeed at.

31:44.736 --> 31:50.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: At Vision Prep,
which is well-regarded,
you will find the hallmark of
many charters:

31:50.275 --> 31:55.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Students are called scholars,
and college
is emphasized, from pennants to
classroom

31:55.647 --> 32:00.185 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cheers.

32:00.218 --> 32:06.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And like many charters, this is
a no-excuses
school, stressing high standards
in academics

32:06.892 --> 32:14.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and behavior, practices that
don't always
sit well with charter opponents,
but appeal

32:14.232 --> 32:15.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to many parents.

32:15.767 --> 32:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIMBERLY MCNEAL: I think it's
good because
it's teaching children focus.

32:18.036 --> 32:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's teaching them to be on one
accord at
school.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're trying to be uniform.

32:24.409 --> 32:27.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're trying to be more
organized and put
together, which is a good thing,
because it

32:27.879 --> 32:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not only teaches them here; it
teaches them
how to be like that at home.

32:33.485 --> 32:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: The battle over
charters is only
likely to heat up.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President-elect Trump is a big
supporter of
school choice.

32:41.927 --> 32:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many argue this is the wrong
debate, that
what's critical is finding
schools that work,

32:48.300 --> 32:50.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no matter how they're set up.

32:50.068 --> 32:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH CARPENTER: I feel so sad,
because we
shouldn't have to fight for our
kids to get

32:54.472 --> 32:55.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a quality education.

32:55.841 --> 32:58.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why do we have to keep fighting
as a race
of people, black people?

32:58.577 --> 33:01.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's wrong with us wanting
what's best
for our kids?

33:01.379 --> 33:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just because we are black and
poor do not
mean that we don't want what's
best for our

33:06.151 --> 33:07.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kids.

33:07.953 --> 33:11.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: So, when
African-American parents
and students find what they hope
is the best

33:11.990 --> 33:16.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school, it's no wonder they're
celebrating.

33:16.094 --> 33:20.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Memphis, I'm Lisa Stark of

is responding

HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to
president-elect Trump's
focus on Mexico, and how Mexico
is responding

33:38.717 --> 33:40.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to his victory.

33:40.552 --> 33:45.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, we examined Trump's
promises to
build a wall and deport
undocumented immigrants.

33:45.290 --> 33:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, in part two of our
series, his economic
pledges and threats to derail
trade deals

sent from the U.S. to Mexico.

Special correspondent Nick
Schifrin and producer
Zach Fannin, again with the help
of the Pulitzer

33:59.671 --> 34:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Center on Crisis Reporting,
begin our story
well north of the border, in
Columbus, Ohio.

34:05.410 --> 34:10.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What would you
have described
this community as when you were
growing up?

34:10.348 --> 34:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF FERRELLI, Restaurant Owner:
Blue-collar,
hardworking, good schools, just
good, honest

34:15.620 --> 34:17.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

34:17.455 --> 34:20.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For 49 years,
Jeff Ferrelli,
his sister and their father have
run an Italian

34:20.792 --> 34:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
restaurant at the center of a
neighborhood
where everybody knows your name.

34:24.129 --> 34:27.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF FERRELLI: Same people
sitting in the
same booths at the same time
every day, and

34:27.732 --> 34:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of like that Cheers kind of
atmosphere,
you know?

34:30.335 --> 34:33.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Just down the
block was the
neighborhood's heart and soul.

34:33.104 --> 34:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This huge space used to be the
Delphi auto
plant, the area's largest
employer.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ferrelli worked there for 15
years.

34:39.477 --> 34:41.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF FERRELLI: It was hot.

34:41.646 --> 34:43.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It smelled.

34:43.214 --> 34:45.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But everybody in there worked
hard, and were
proud of what they were doing.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But, by the early
'90s, the
economy started declining.

34:48.186 --> 34:50.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
By 2007, the plant closed.

34:50.455 --> 34:54.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They ripped it down to build a
casino, and
the community never regained its
prosperity

34:54.626 --> 34:55.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or pride.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the Macy's is still
barren, other than
the graffiti.

34:58.997 --> 35:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The nearby movie theater has
gone dark.

35:01.199 --> 35:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Once-thriving businesses can't
find new owners.

35:03.134 --> 35:07.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: We're living
through the greatest jobs theft
in the history

35:07.339 --> 35:08.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the world.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Delphi laid off 5,805.

35:11.376 --> 35:13.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's with Delphi?

35:13.178 --> 35:19.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration will
stop the jobs
from leaving Ohio and from
leaving America.

35:19.451 --> 35:23.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The message
during the campaign
that Trump put out while in
Ohio, did that

35:23.121 --> 35:24.489 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
appeal to you?

35:24.522 --> 35:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF FERRELLI: The incentives
are to put your
businesses overseas.

35:28.593 --> 35:33.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hopefully, some groundwork will
be put in
place to correct that.

35:33.365 --> 35:36.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Ferrelli knows
that there are
many reasons for the closed
plant, but his

35:36.501 --> 35:41.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nostalgia allows for an easy
target: the neighborhood's
growing number of Hispanic and
Somali immigrants.

35:41.573 --> 35:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF FERRELLI: The influx of new
people doesn't
match the ones that have left.

35:48.279 --> 35:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I guess that's kind of the
big thing.

35:50.782 --> 35:54.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: President-elect
Donald Trump
links those immigrants with jobs
lost to some

35:54.719 --> 35:55.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the same countries.

35:55.920 --> 35:59.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: They get the jobs,
the plants,
the money.

35:59.624 --> 36:00.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We get the drugs.

36:00.759 --> 36:01.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We get the unemployment.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a one-way street.

36:03.528 --> 36:04.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Not going to happen anymore,
folks.

36:04.562 --> 36:06.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Not going to happen anymore.

36:06.931 --> 36:13.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Twenty-three
hundred miles
south, in the Mexican city of
Juarez, the

36:13.571 --> 36:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Delphi plant occupies pride of
place.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This 24-year-old works on the
factory floor.

36:18.977 --> 36:21.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Delphi declined an interview
request, so he
felt he had to stay anonymous.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He invited us for breakfast
burritos.

36:24.182 --> 36:28.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How important are the Delphi
plants to you
and this community?

36:29.020 --> 36:34.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It's
my means of
work, my means of sustaining my
family, and

36:34.592 --> 36:36.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's the means of sustaining the
community.

36:36.961 --> 36:41.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Early every
morning, he and
hundreds of people file out via
bus after

36:41.633 --> 36:43.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Delphi's overnight shift.

36:43.701 --> 36:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Delphi is Mexico's largest
private employer,
and has helped lift up the
working and middle

36:47.772 --> 36:49.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
classes here.

36:49.607 --> 36:53.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's provided the collective
pride that Western
Columbus lost, even if his
starting salary

36:53.611 --> 36:55.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was only $12 a day.

36:55.413 --> 37:00.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How have American companies that
have come
in here like Delphi helped
changed the city?

37:00.585 --> 37:03.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It's
much more stable
economically.

37:04.022 --> 37:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have better houses, better
cars.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even the school system has
improved.

37:07.859 --> 37:12.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On the campaign,
Trump argued
Delphi's gains in moving to
Mexico came at

37:12.163 --> 37:16.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the expense of American losses,
because of
the North American Free Trade
Agreement, or

37:16.334 --> 37:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NAFTA, the 1994 trade deal
between the U.S.,
Canada and Mexico.

37:20.805 --> 37:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the nonpartisan
Congressional
Research Service, NAFTA's
benefits have been

37:24.576 --> 37:26.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spread out, and not widely felt.

37:26.711 --> 37:32.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But its costs have been
concentrated and helped
accelerate U.S. manufacturing
losses.

37:32.183 --> 37:36.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In order to protect that
manufacturing, Trump
has promised to pull out of
NAFTA, or impose

37:36.521 --> 37:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heavy tariffs on Mexican goods.

37:38.423 --> 37:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: This wave of
globalization has
wiped out totally, totally our
middle class.

37:45.196 --> 37:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't have to be this way.

37:47.999 --> 37:51.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We can turn it around, and we
can turn it
around fast.

37:51.703 --> 37:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Juarez Mayor
Armando Cabada
can't even imagine Trump
enacting all his

37:56.374 --> 37:58.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
campaign pledges.

37:58.076 --> 38:03.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What impact would changing NAFTA
have on the
people of Juarez and the city of
Juarez?

38:03.348 --> 38:07.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARMANDO CABADA, Mayor of Juarez,
Mexico: We
are the principal makers of TVs
in the world,

38:07.652 --> 38:11.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the principal providers
for the car
industry in the world.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How can he halt this?

38:13.224 --> 38:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Only a crazy man would do that.

38:14.792 --> 38:18.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: From his roof,
Juarez is only
a few feet from El Paso, Texas.

38:18.763 --> 38:20.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The two economies are just as
interdependent.

38:20.832 --> 38:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. buys nearly 80 percent
of Mexican
exports.

38:24.202 --> 38:27.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Mexico is the U.S.' second
largest trading
partner.

38:27.438 --> 38:30.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ARMANDO CABADA (through
translator): He's
going against the current.

38:30.875 --> 38:35.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a misunderstanding of the
world we live
in now, the globalized world in
which we are

38:35.079 --> 38:36.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all immersed.

38:36.881 --> 38:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Since NAFTA, in
cities like
Juarez, American companies line
the streets.

38:41.452 --> 38:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The stores and supply chains are
completely
integrated across the border.

38:46.257 --> 38:49.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mexican workers now manufacture
parts that
American workers need.

38:49.761 --> 38:53.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two weeks ago, Delphi's CFO said
if Trump
closes the border -- quote --
"In less than

38:53.498 --> 38:59.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a week, all the people who voted
for him in
Michigan and Ohio would be out
of work."

38:59.304 --> 39:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Economics professor Valeria Moy
agrees.

39:00.972 --> 39:05.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VALERIA MOY, Economics
Professor: You are
going to disrupt all the supply
chains.

39:05.476 --> 39:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's going to be huge, not
only for
Mexico.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, for Mexico, it's
going to be huge.

39:09.247 --> 39:11.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But for the States, it's going
to be huge.

39:11.983 --> 39:15.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: She points out
NAFTA hasn't
only helped Mexico.

39:15.286 --> 39:18.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those American companies in
Mexico are profitable.

39:18.289 --> 39:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAFTA helps employ six million
or more Americans
and provides Americans with
cheap products.

39:22.527 --> 39:27.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIA MOY: That flat-screen
that you bought
that's like 60 inches' huge,
with sound surround,

39:27.699 --> 39:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it's really nice, and it
cost you $1,000,
guess what?

39:31.703 --> 39:34.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not going to have that
anymore, because
that was made in Mexico.

39:34.505 --> 39:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And that means
Mexico's economy
is now much more dependent on
its ability

39:38.743 --> 39:40.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to send products north.

39:40.612 --> 39:46.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIA MOY: Many parts of the
country will
be very, very significantly
damaged if Donald

39:46.351 --> 39:48.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump enacts any measure of
protectionism.

39:48.987 --> 39:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And every time I
see a Delphi,
and every time I see these
companies leaving,

39:55.260 --> 39:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that wall gets a little bit
higher and it
keeps going up.

39:57.929 --> 40:01.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: To try and force
Mexico to
pay for the promised southern
border wall,

40:01.733 --> 40:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has threatened a second
blow to the
Mexican economy and to people
like Marta Garcia.

40:07.705 --> 40:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She runs a Mexico City food
truck and makes
a few dollars a day.

40:11.342 --> 40:15.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, her oldest daughter
fled to the
U.S. and sends money home.

40:15.280 --> 40:19.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every year, Mexicans send $25
billion of remittances.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is promising to halt or
tax that money.

40:21.786 --> 40:27.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What would happen if your
daughter couldn't
send any money, or could only
send only a

40:27.492 --> 40:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fraction of the money that she
has been sending
recently?

40:30.828 --> 40:34.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTA GARCIA, Mexico (through
translator):
I would have to tell my other
children that

40:34.265 --> 40:37.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am very sorry, but I would
take them out
of school so they could work.

40:37.969 --> 40:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Every few days,
the family
walks together to pick up the
daughter's money

40:41.639 --> 40:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the local Western Union.

40:43.641 --> 40:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marta hopes the money keeps
flowing, so her
children receive the education
she never did.

40:48.079 --> 40:52.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTA GARCIA (through
translator): You have
to have education, an education,
so that they

40:52.517 --> 40:54.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can pay you a little more.

40:54.319 --> 40:57.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you don't have an education,
they will
not pay you enough, and that's
why many people

40:57.955 --> 40:59.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leave to the U.S.

40:59.324 --> 41:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That's a warning
that many
here make.

41:01.926 --> 41:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cutting remittances, curtailing
trade, and
imposing tariffs could
exacerbate the very

41:06.597 --> 41:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problems that Trump is vowing to
stop.

41:08.566 --> 41:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIA MOY: It will enhance the
idea of illegal
immigration, because the
situation in Mexico

41:14.572 --> 41:16.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is going to be worse.

41:16.341 --> 41:19.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Enrique Krauze is
one of the
country's most prominent
historians, and goes

41:19.210 --> 41:21.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even further.

41:21.079 --> 41:24.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ENRIQUE KRAUZE, Historian:
NAFTA, immigration,
deportations, the wall, yes,
those are very

41:24.549 --> 41:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important issues socially and
economically,
but, first of all, dignity and
respect.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need an apology.

41:32.090 --> 41:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He says Mexicans
overwhelmingly
oppose Trump, not only because
of his policies,

41:36.427 --> 41:40.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but because of the most negative
rhetoric
by any U.S. president since the
late 1920s,

41:40.898 --> 41:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when president Calvin Coolidge
considered
Mexico a communist enemy.

41:44.369 --> 41:51.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ENRIQUE KRAUZE: Those wounds are
now part
of the remote history, truly
remote.

41:51.876 --> 41:55.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now those wounds, incredibly,
would be opened.

41:55.947 --> 42:00.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: We saw signs of
those festering
wounds on an otherwise normal
Tuesday at a

42:00.685 --> 42:03.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
quintessentially Mexican store.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump has sparked a pinata
renaissance.

42:05.423 --> 42:09.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We thought Mexicans would, well,
bash Trump,
but they were measured and
deeply fearful.

42:09.827 --> 42:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
don't like that
he was elected, because the
situation is already

42:14.065 --> 42:16.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hard and will become harder next
year.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It's
not fair.

42:18.636 --> 42:21.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump talked about many
things that
offended us Mexicans.

42:21.406 --> 42:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The truth is, I don't like he
came into power.

42:23.574 --> 42:27.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For many
Mexicans, Trump's
victory is a nightmare.

42:27.078 --> 42:30.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For some Americans in the
struggling Midwest,
it's an opportunity.

42:30.848 --> 42:34.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The relationship hasn't been
this fraught
in nearly a century.

42:34.385 --> 42:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick
Schifrin
in Mexico City.

42:39.924 --> 42:51.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will be
back in a moment
with a look at how college
athletic teams

42:51.903 --> 42:54.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are helping kids with
life-threatening illnesses.

42:54.639 --> 42:58.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

42:58.643 --> 43:05.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on
the air.

43:05.683 --> 43:08.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

43:08.820 --> 43:18.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to a
"NewsHour" Shares:
something that caught our eye
that we thought

HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to a
"NewsHour" Shares:
something that caught our eye
that we thought

43:26.370 --> 43:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you might find interesting as
well.

43:29.240 --> 43:38.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A program called Team IMPACT is
trying to
bring normalcy to what can be a
stressful

43:38.683 --> 43:41.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation for parents and
children fighting
sometimes life-threatening
diseases.

43:42.019 --> 43:46.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The organization has matched
more than 1,000
children with college athletes
across the

43:46.224 --> 43:48.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

43:48.059 --> 43:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From PBS station WGBH in Boston,
Tina Martin
introduces us to one little girl
who is feeling

43:52.563 --> 43:54.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the team spirit.

43:54.332 --> 43:58.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: This is 7-year-old
Ava Girolimetti.

43:58.803 --> 44:03.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She loves to cook and eat.

44:03.608 --> 44:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AVA GIROLIMETTI, 7 Years Old:
Cheese is one
of my favorite foods.

44:10.882 --> 44:14.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: She has a
collection of fancy
hats with flowers.

44:14.452 --> 44:15.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AVA GIROLIMETTI: Let's see.

44:15.820 --> 44:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, I
think?

44:18.923 --> 44:20.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: And she loves
soccer.

44:20.992 --> 44:22.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AVA GIROLIMETTI: We play all
positions.

44:23.027 --> 44:30.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Outwardly, Ava's a
pretty normal
little girl, but she was
diagnosed with leukemia

44:31.002 --> 44:32.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last spring.

44:32.737 --> 44:37.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON GIROLIMETTI, Mother of
Ava Girolimetti:
Everything moved so quickly from
when she

44:37.174 --> 44:38.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was diagnosed.

44:38.643 --> 44:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We went to the hospital on
Saturday, and didn't
come home for six weeks.

44:42.246 --> 44:48.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Doctors started
chemotherapy
immediately, and Ava was
sidelined her from

44:48.152 --> 44:49.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her favorite sport.

44:49.987 --> 44:55.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC GIROLIMETTI, Father of Ava
Girolimetti:
At home, we have scheduled
medications that

44:55.526 --> 44:58.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she has to take on a near daily
basis.

44:58.996 --> 45:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Ava may have been
too sick to
play soccer, but that doesn't
mean she can't

45:09.473 --> 45:15.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be part of a team.

45:15.446 --> 45:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both she and her sister Sophia
are part of
the Babson College Women's
soccer team through

45:29.193 --> 45:33.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a program called Team IMPACT.

45:33.664 --> 45:43.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON GIROLIMETTI: For her,
its been a great
experience, because she plays
soccer herself

45:43.708 --> 45:51.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON GIROLIMETTI: For her,
its been a great
experience, because she plays
soccer herself

45:51.215 --> 45:54.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and she's not able to play this
season.

45:54.118 --> 46:00.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: Based in
Massachusetts, Team
IMPACT matches college sports
teams with critically

46:00.057 --> 46:03.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or chronically ill children all
over the country.

46:03.427 --> 46:14.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIKA LOOMER, Team IMPACT: We
are currently
in 45 states, 427 campuses,
30,000 student

46:14.939 --> 46:16.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
athletes.

46:16.807 --> 46:27.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: Here in
Massachusetts, Team IMPACT
currently has 118 children like
Ava matched

46:27.551 --> 46:31.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with all kinds of college teams.

46:31.222 --> 46:40.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIKA LOOMER: You don't see that
battle on
her face, when she's around
these student

46:40.297 --> 46:41.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
athletes.

46:42.033 --> 46:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Babson junior
Colleen Beggan
understands Ava's battle better
than most.

46:48.639 --> 46:57.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLLEEN BEGGAN, College Student:
My sister
was also a soccer player and she
had cancer

46:57.048 --> 46:58.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in her ribs.

46:58.649 --> 47:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Being at Babson
takes on a special
meaning for Marc and Allison.

47:03.454 --> 47:07.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's where they went to college
and fell in
love.

47:07.525 --> 47:11.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they see their daughter
finding a
safe haven from her disease.

47:11.962 --> 47:23.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC GIROLIMETTI: It means
everything to see
your child sort of in a much
more natural

47:23.274 --> 47:27.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
environment, with the
understanding that,
without her having cancer, we
probably wouldn't

47:27.111 --> 47:29.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
