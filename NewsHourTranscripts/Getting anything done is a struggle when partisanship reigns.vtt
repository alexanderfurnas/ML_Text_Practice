HARI SREENIVASAN: From the
White House to Capitol Hill.

00:03.466 --> 00:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For seven months, congressional
Republicans have taken a
sharply partisan route on health

00:06.833 --> 00:08.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

00:08.766 --> 00:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have made several attempts
to repeal and replace the
Affordable Care Act, which

00:11.766 --> 00:13.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have failed.

00:13.266 --> 00:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But why did Republicans go
partisan in the first place?

00:16.033 --> 00:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of a cultural
shift in Congress years in
the making for both parties.

00:20.466 --> 00:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins explains.

00:22.133 --> 00:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Congress these
days has an obvious theme.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:27.866 --> 00:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS (I),
Vermont: I should think
that every Republican
should be embarrassed.

00:30.466 --> 00:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Our Democratic friends
are trying to make it more
difficult for President Trump

00:37.333 --> 00:38.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do his job.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:40.433 --> 00:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: We urge our Republican
colleagues to change their

00:41.500 --> 00:43.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tune.

00:43.033 --> 00:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: More blame
than legislation on the floor.

00:45.600 --> 00:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Veteran GOP Senator Susan
Collins of Maine has
long been considered one
of its most bipartisan

00:51.233 --> 00:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
members, but she admits
it's becoming harder.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:54.633 --> 00:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: We are
in a time of hyper-partisanship
that is unlike any other

01:00.000 --> 01:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that I have seen in
my time in the Senate.

01:03.500 --> 01:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Some
examples this year?

01:06.233 --> 01:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans going it alone on
health care, with a partisan
House vote and a Republican-only

01:13.633 --> 01:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closed-door process in
the Senate, Democrats
forcing symbolic late-night
sessions and boycotting

01:18.566 --> 01:22.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
committee hearings,
slowing the legislative
process to a near stop.

01:22.366 --> 01:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this month, Republican
Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell blamed
Democrats for his decision

01:28.433 --> 01:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to postpone the
Senate's August recess.

01:29.966 --> 01:32.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: Due
to this unprecedented
level of obstruction

01:33.933 --> 01:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have been experiencing,
we will be in session the
first two weeks of August.

01:37.933 --> 01:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All just five
weeks after this: a gunman
opening fire on a Republican

01:44.966 --> 01:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
baseball practice, leaving House
Majority Whip Steve Scalise
initially in critical condition,

01:50.266 --> 01:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and still recovering.

01:52.133 --> 01:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The attack brought a chorus
of calls for bipartisanship.

01:55.033 --> 01:57.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:57.033 --> 01:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader: We are not
one caucus or the other in this

01:57.900 --> 01:58.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House today.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:00.466 --> 02:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: We are united.

02:02.466 --> 02:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Later that day,
the managers of the Republican
and Democratic teams urged

02:05.500 --> 02:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an end to the sharp divide.

02:06.933 --> 02:09.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE BARTON (R), Texas: We
have an R or a D by our name,
but our title -- our title is

02:18.500 --> 02:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
United States representative.

02:20.900 --> 02:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: We caught up
with Representatives Joe Barton
and Mike Doyle again, and asked

02:27.600 --> 02:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if things have changed.

02:28.733 --> 02:30.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE DOYLE (D), Pennsylvania:
There's no cure for this.

02:31.433 --> 02:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's not just
our responsibility.

02:34.733 --> 02:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bipartisanship either gets
fanned or, you know, encouraged
by outside forces, too.

02:41.566 --> 02:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But both
say too many members get
attention now with sharp words.

02:43.933 --> 02:45.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:45.900 --> 02:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE BARTON: At the end of
every two years, do you want
to go home and say, man, I gave

02:48.733 --> 02:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a heck of a press conference,
or do you want to put something
else on your wall, that you

02:53.033 --> 02:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have got a bill signed into law?

02:55.033 --> 02:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Barton admits
he was once a young bomb
thrower, and accepts some blame

02:58.666 --> 02:59.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for his party.

02:59.666 --> 03:01.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE BARTON: When I got elected,
I joined the Gingrich group.

03:02.933 --> 03:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I was a part of the
problem at the time.

03:06.500 --> 03:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the
1994 Republican Revolution,
then-new Speaker Gingrich
made partisan battles

03:12.300 --> 03:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a central strategy.

03:14.266 --> 03:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Years later, in 2013, Democrats
upped the partisan ante,
changing Senate rules to push

03:20.566 --> 03:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through some nominees
with no Republican votes.

03:23.133 --> 03:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, partisanship, even
partisanship, is as old as
Congress itself, from duels,

03:30.133 --> 03:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a near fatal beating inside
the Senate chamber, to this
staircase outside the House

03:35.566 --> 03:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chamber, where you can still
see what is said to be blood
stains from where a newspaper

03:37.266 --> 03:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reporter shot a former
member of Congress in 1890.

03:46.233 --> 03:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But divide can have a
purpose, says Amy Walter of
The Cook Political Report.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: I don't
think partisanship in
and of itself is a bad

03:52.833 --> 03:55.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
thing.

03:55.333 --> 03:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The challenge is when that
alone is what prevents
people from working
together to do other things.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Part of the
trouble, fewer moderates.

04:05.033 --> 04:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Data from The Cook Political
Report shows that, 20 years
ago, more than a third of all

04:09.800 --> 04:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House districts were
moderate, voting similarly
to the nation as a whole.

04:14.333 --> 04:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, since then, House districts
have become more partisan,
red or blue, and the number

04:20.700 --> 04:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of moderate or swing
seats has fallen by half.

04:23.133 --> 04:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And they have all
been replaced by ideologues
either on the left or the right.

04:27.633 --> 04:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: One reason,
special interest groups on the
left and the right are spending

04:32.066 --> 04:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
record amounts of money
in ads, and increasingly
scoring lawmakers' votes
on sometimes narrow

04:38.166 --> 04:39.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

04:39.166 --> 04:40.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Again, Susan Collins:

04:40.166 --> 04:42.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:42.233 --> 04:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS: Unfortunately,
there's a lot of pressure
from outside special interest

04:47.700 --> 04:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
groups to toe the party line.

04:51.066 --> 04:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want 100 percent fidelity,
100 percent of the time, to
100 percent of their views.

05:00.200 --> 05:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, if you deviate, you are
going to feel the consequences.

05:07.166 --> 05:11.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: All
this underscores how a
major issue like health
care remains unresolved,

05:12.866 --> 05:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it sets up a great struggle.

05:14.833 --> 05:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To get anything done,
Republicans in power may soon
have to work with Democrats.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.
