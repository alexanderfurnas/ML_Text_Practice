GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

00:06.039 --> 00:07.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:08.976 --> 00:12.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Hurricane
Matthew pummels Haiti, as fierce
145-mile-an-hour

00:12.913 --> 00:16.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
winds and torrential rains carve
a devastating
path.

00:16.717 --> 00:22.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Tuesday: Tim
Kaine and Mike Pence take center
stage.

00:22.456 --> 00:25.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What to watch for in tonight's
vice presidential
debate.

00:25.659 --> 00:30.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And from the
classroom to the
campaign trail -- why Oklahoma
teachers are

00:30.931 --> 00:35.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running for political office to
turn the state's
failing education system around.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA CLARK LITTLE, Oklahomans
for Public
Education: A lot of legislators
feel like

00:37.704 --> 00:40.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they went to school,
they are education
experts.

00:40.374 --> 00:43.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I have been to a Thunder
game, and I
can't play basketball.

00:43.443 --> 00:44.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's a difference.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to bring the subject
matter experts
to the table.

00:46.914 --> 00:50.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.484 --> 00:54.755 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:54.788 --> 01:07.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reports are just
beginning
to trickle in tonight, but
already it's clear

01:07.534 --> 01:12.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hurricane Matthew has sent
long-suffering
Haiti even deeper into misery.

01:12.739 --> 01:16.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's word of at least seven
dead and widespread
wreckage.

01:16.376 --> 01:18.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: This is Matthew.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pray for us!

01:20.414 --> 01:26.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's one of the
fiercest Caribbean
storms in years, and its
powerful core roared

01:26.920 --> 01:35.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the southwestern tip of
Haiti before
dawn, with winds of 145 miles an
hour.

01:35.095 --> 01:41.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Emergency officials reported
major damage,
roots ripped apart, trees torn
out of the

01:41.568 --> 01:46.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ground, and roads and bridges
underwater.

01:46.606 --> 01:51.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Forecasters had said the storm
would dump
as much as 40 inches of rain on
the poorest

01:51.745 --> 01:53.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
country in the Americas.

01:53.780 --> 01:57.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jacqueline Charles is a reporter
from The
Miami Herald.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She spoke from Port-au-Prince,
the Haitian
capital.

02:00.420 --> 02:05.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACQUELINE CHARLES, The Miami
Herald: We have
rivers that are beginning to
rise.

02:05.959 --> 02:09.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's one major bridge that
connects the
capital with the north.

02:09.196 --> 02:14.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And police basically blocked
traffic from
using that bridge because it's
now become

02:14.034 --> 02:16.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a dangerous situation.

02:16.103 --> 02:21.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After crossing
Haiti, the hurricane's
center moved on during the day
to strike Eastern

02:21.541 --> 02:27.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cuba tonight, not far from the
U.S. Naval
base at Guantanamo Bay.

02:27.881 --> 02:32.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its approach sent people fleeing
across the
region.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Last
night was terrible.

02:35.689 --> 02:40.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The waves were enormous, to the
point where
I thought they were going to
enter the house.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were very big.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were worse than now.

02:43.263 --> 02:47.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Overnight, the
slow-moving
Matthew is set to barrel through
the Eastern

02:47.367 --> 02:49.202 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bahamas.

02:49.236 --> 02:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's projected to head toward
Florida at the
end of the week, and push its
way up the U.S.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
East Coast over the weekend.

02:56.176 --> 03:01.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Florida Governor Rick
Scott was out
telling people to start getting
ready without

03:01.748 --> 03:02.716 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
delay.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK SCOTT (R), Florida: Once
this storm comes,
we cannot put our
first-responders in harm's

03:06.153 --> 03:07.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You must leave before it's too
late.

03:09.489 --> 03:13.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can rebuild a home, you can
rebuild a
business, you cannot rebuild a
life.

03:13.226 --> 03:18.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hurricane watches
are now up
for the southeastern parts of
Florida.

03:18.198 --> 03:23.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And farther up the coast, South
Carolina's
governor has announced plans to
evacuate one

03:23.870 --> 03:25.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
million people.

03:25.806 --> 03:29.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the very latest on
Matthew, we turn
to the National Hurricane
Center.

03:29.409 --> 03:34.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with its director, Rick
Knabb, in
Miami just a short time ago.

03:34.347 --> 03:36.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rick Knabb, welcome.

03:36.049 --> 03:39.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First of all, where is this
storm right now?

03:39.586 --> 03:43.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK KNABB, Director, National
Hurricane Center:
Right now, Hurricane Matthew is
centered in

03:43.890 --> 03:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between Haiti and Eastern Cuba,
will clip
the eastern tip of Cuba this
evening.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then it will be headed toward
the Bahamas.

03:51.231 --> 03:55.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's still going to be
impacting Haiti
and Cuba for many, many hours to
come.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not just a point on a map.

03:56.403 --> 04:00.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a pretty big and powerful
hurricane,
still a Category 4.

04:00.273 --> 04:05.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not just about wind either,
heavy rainfall,
likely flash floods and
mudslides affecting

04:05.145 --> 04:09.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Haiti and the Dominican
Republic, and that
could spread into Eastern Cuba,
and then the

04:10.016 --> 04:12.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bahamas, hurricanes warning for
the entire
length of the Bahamas.

04:12.319 --> 04:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're going to be impacted
starting tomorrow.

04:14.421 --> 04:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You said it's a
powerful storm.

04:18.325 --> 04:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Compared to other hurricanes,
how do you describe
it?

04:21.695 --> 04:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK KNABB: It is similar to
many other past
major hurricanes that are
Category 3 or stronger

04:28.435 --> 04:31.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on our five-tier hurricane wind
scale.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Matthew's sustain winds are
140 miles
per hour.

04:35.375 --> 04:40.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So those are the maximum winds,
but the tropical
storm-force winds can extend out
to almost

04:40.113 --> 04:41.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
200 miles from the center.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's a big and powerful
system.

04:44.317 --> 04:48.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're really concerned
about is a
large number of folks in the
Bahamas being

04:48.388 --> 04:51.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impacted, but also then we're
forecasting
this turn to the northwest.

04:51.791 --> 04:57.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Florida, and Georgia, South
Carolina, North
Carolina are all threatened,
with Florida

04:57.430 --> 05:02.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being first, hurricane watches
in effect for
portions of the southeast coast
of Florida.

05:02.302 --> 05:06.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We even had to extend that a
little farther
south to include Broward County,
the Fort

05:06.072 --> 05:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lauderdale area, here at 5:00
p.m.

05:08.441 --> 05:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what are you
able to determine
in terms of how strong it's
going to stay?

05:15.549 --> 05:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK KNABB: It's not going to
interact with
land enough to significantly
weaken it.

05:21.488 --> 05:25.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's good that it's not spending
too much
time over Eastern Cuba tonight.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, as it's over the
Bahamas, that's
mostly a water environment.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The islands there probably are
not going to
cause it to weaken.

05:31.665 --> 05:36.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The waters are very warm, the
atmosphere conditions
still conducive for this to
remain a major

05:36.536 --> 05:39.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hurricane for the next few days.

05:39.639 --> 05:46.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that means it's not
impossible for a major
hurricane to make landfall
somewhere in the

05:46.112 --> 05:48.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
state of Florida this week.

05:48.048 --> 05:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's also possible for
hurricanes to directly
or indirectly impact Georgia,
South Carolina,

05:52.886 --> 05:54.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and North Carolina.

05:54.788 --> 05:58.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have been talking to
emergency managers
in all of these areas today, and
we urge folks

05:58.892 --> 06:01.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pay attention, do whatever
their local
officials are telling them to
do.

06:02.028 --> 06:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here in South Florida, where
we live,
today and tomorrow and tomorrow
night is the

06:07.500 --> 06:12.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time left to prepare before the
weather starts
going downhill down here on
Thursday morning.

06:12.272 --> 06:16.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Rick Knabb,
when is the
next alert you're going to be
issuing?

06:16.643 --> 06:22.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK KNABB: We issue full
updates, with a
complete new forecast every six
hours.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that will happen again at
11:00 p.m. Eastern
time tonight.

06:26.386 --> 06:30.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do issue intermediate public
advisories
every three hours in between to
update on

06:30.957 --> 06:36.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the intensity and on the
position as we continue
to fly hurricane hunter aircraft
into and

06:36.162 --> 06:37.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the hurricane.

06:38.031 --> 06:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the next complete forecast
and major changes
that we would potentially
communicate with

06:42.202 --> 06:46.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
watches and warnings will happen
again at
11:00 p.m. and then again at
5:00 a.m.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, people on the East Coast of
the U.S.,
just don't tune out.

06:49.542 --> 06:52.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And take preliminary
preparations, so you
know what you're going to do if
watches and

06:52.679 --> 06:54.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
warnings are issued for your
area later.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I know
everyone is going
to be paying very close
attention.

06:57.984 --> 07:00.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rick Knabb with the National
Hurricane Center,
we thank you.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICK KNABB: Thank you, Judy.

07:03.590 --> 07:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: The way
is now clear for the Paris
climate change

07:08.561 --> 07:09.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
accord to take effect.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European Union lawmakers gave
their endorsement
today.

07:13.400 --> 07:18.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The overwhelming vote means the
accord has
the backing of countries
accounting for 55

07:18.338 --> 07:20.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent of global emissions,
more than enough.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SCHULZ, President,
European Parliament
(through translator): Our vote
opens the way

07:24.277 --> 07:29.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to ensuring that the whole
agreement can achieve
the necessary threshold figures
so as to come

07:29.516 --> 07:31.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into worldwide implementation.

07:31.351 --> 07:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The E.U.'s member
states are to
make the approval official on
Friday, and

07:36.323 --> 07:37.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
present it to the U.N.

07:38.024 --> 07:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Paris accord formally takes
effect 30
days later.

07:41.127 --> 07:45.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's a new
surge in the
flow of migrants trying to reach
Italy from

07:45.565 --> 07:47.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Libya.

07:47.334 --> 07:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Italian coast guard reports
more than
6,000 people were rescued on
Monday alone,

07:52.339 --> 07:55.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

GWEN IFILL: Russia airstrikes
blasted Eastern
Aleppo in Syria again today.

08:11.524 --> 08:15.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But rebels said they repelled a
ground assault
on the southern part of the
city.

08:15.929 --> 08:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Just yesterday, the U.S.
suspended direct
talks with Russia on the
conflict.

08:19.499 --> 08:24.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, Secretary of State
John Kerry
said that doesn't mean the Obama
administration

08:24.904 --> 08:26.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is giving up.

08:26.873 --> 08:30.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: We will
continue, as we have before, to
pursue a meaningful,

08:30.343 --> 08:36.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sustainable, enforceable
cessation of hostilities
throughout the country, and that
includes

08:36.549 --> 08:43.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the grounding of Syrian and
Russian combat
aircraft in designated areas.

08:43.123 --> 08:50.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Russia knows exactly what it
needs to
do in order to get that
cessation implemented

08:50.964 --> 08:53.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a fair and reasonable way.

08:53.133 --> 08:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Moscow announced
it has deployed
an advanced surface-to-air
missile system

08:58.505 --> 09:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Syria for the first time.

JUDY WOODRUFF: A U.S. military
service person
was killed by a roadside bomb in
Afghanistan

09:05.779 --> 09:07.280 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

09:07.313 --> 09:10.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened during operations
against Islamic
State militants in the east.

09:10.750 --> 09:16.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in the north, Afghan
forces in
Kunduz regained control of most
of the city.

09:16.689 --> 09:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government troops drove back
Taliban militants
who attacked a day earlier.

09:21.728 --> 09:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It came nearly a year after
Taliban gunmen
held the city for three days.

09:26.166 --> 09:31.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In economic news,
new worries
about Britain's exit from the
European Union

09:31.171 --> 09:32.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
weighed on Wall Street.

09:32.772 --> 09:38.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 85 points
to close at 18168.

09:41.981 --> 09:47.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And three
British-born scientists
who teach in the U.S. have won
this year's

09:47.320 --> 09:49.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nobel Prize in physics.

09:49.522 --> 09:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Thouless, Duncan Haldane
and Michael
Kosterlitz were recognized for
their research

09:54.928 --> 09:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into rare states of matter.

09:57.163 --> 10:02.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It paved the way for designing
new materials
for electronics and future
quantum computers.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Haldane is now a physics
professor at Princeton.

10:05.839 --> 10:09.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUNCAN HALDANE, Nobel Prize
Winner: It's a
very gratifying recognition of
the work.

10:09.642 --> 10:15.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's -- I don't think
one goes into
the business for prizes.

10:15.815 --> 10:19.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're kind of trying to find
neat stuff,
basically.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everyone wants to find neat
stuff.

10:21.521 --> 10:26.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other
recipients are affiliated
with the University of
Washington and Brown

10:26.259 --> 10:28.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
University.

10:28.094 --> 10:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump
and Hillary Clinton focus on the
swing states,

10:32.298 --> 10:37.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as their running mates prepare
for tonight's
debate; what to expect from the
only vice

10:37.570 --> 10:47.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential face-off; plus, the
implications
of a deadlocked Supreme Court;
and much more.

10:47.313 --> 10:58.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The vice
presidential nominees
step out of the shadows tonight
for their

10:58.658 --> 11:00.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lone debate.

11:00.393 --> 11:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are at Longwood College in
Farmville,
Virginia, for their 90-minute
face off.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins is there, and
she begins our
coverage.

11:07.534 --> 11:13.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They previewed
the Virginia
debate site less than an hour
apart, first

11:13.172 --> 11:18.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Mike Pence, then
Democrat Tim Kaine,
scouting out the Longwood
University stage

11:18.311 --> 11:21.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ahead of their one and only vice
presidential
showdown.

11:21.948 --> 11:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For both, it's an opportunity to
help the
ticket, while trying to avoid
pitfalls.

11:27.253 --> 11:32.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Consider 1988, when Republican
Dan Quayle
likened himself to a youthful
John F. Kennedy,

11:32.825 --> 11:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and drew that famous rebuke from
Democrat
Lloyd Bentsen.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LLOYD BENTSEN (D), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Jack Kennedy was a friend of
mine.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator, you are no Jack
Kennedy.

11:41.301 --> 11:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Then there was
2000, when
two experienced politicians and
debaters met,

11:47.774 --> 11:49.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrat Joe Lieberman and
Republican Dick
Cheney.

11:49.642 --> 11:52.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOE LIEBERMAN (D), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
I can see my wife, and I think
she's thinking,

11:52.378 --> 11:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gee, I wish he would go out into
the private
sector.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DICK CHENEY (R), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Well, I'm going to try to help
you do that,

11:56.950 --> 11:57.917 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Joe.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.953 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

11:59.986 --> 12:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: While this
year's debate
participants were prepping
today, their top-of-the-ticket

12:03.556 --> 12:05.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
running mates were out stumping.

12:05.491 --> 12:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, not far from
Philadelphia,
talked about her proposals to
help families,

12:09.896 --> 12:12.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and went after Donald Trump on
the way he
talks about women.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Think about it.

12:15.635 --> 12:20.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My opponent insulted Miss
Universe.

12:20.306 --> 12:26.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, how do you get more
acclaimed than
that?

12:26.646 --> 12:28.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it wasn't good enough.

12:28.448 --> 12:33.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to laugh at it, we need
to refute
it, we need to ignore it, and we
need to stand

12:33.920 --> 12:35.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up to it.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: First lady
Michelle Obama
was also campaigning for Clinton
again, this

12:38.558 --> 12:39.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time in Charlotte, North
Carolina.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA, First Lady:
Hillary Clinton
is tough.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
See, I have watched her.

12:42.395 --> 12:47.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When she gets knocked down, she
doesn't complain.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She doesn't cry foul.

12:50.303 --> 12:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No, she gets right back up.

12:54.273 --> 12:59.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for Trump,
he was in a
traditional Republican
stronghold, Arizona.

12:59.045 --> 13:03.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
She complains about how I have
used the tax

13:03.082 --> 13:06.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
laws of this country to my
benefit.

13:06.185 --> 13:14.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then I ask a simple question:
Why didn't she
ever try to change those laws,
so I couldn't

13:14.160 --> 13:15.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
use them?

13:16.029 --> 13:19.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This morning,
campaign manager
Kellyanne Conway defended him
against a New

13:19.198 --> 13:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
York Times report that he might
have paid
no income taxes for 18 years.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She insisted he paid plenty in
taxes.

13:26.005 --> 13:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Manager:
The fact is, this man has paid
hundreds of

13:29.042 --> 13:34.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millions of dollars in taxes
over decades,
excise taxes, federal payroll
taxes, city

13:34.647 --> 13:37.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state and local taxes, real
estate taxes,
property taxes.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: You didn't say income
taxes.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But you didn't say income taxes.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, he
certainly has,
in the years that he made a
profit.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like anybody else, he paid
income taxes.

13:44.323 --> 13:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile,
Libertarian nominee
Gary Johnson raised more
questions today,

13:49.128 --> 13:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arguing that his admitted lack
of foreign
policy knowledge is a positive,
that it could

13:54.200 --> 13:55.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prevent wars.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON, Libertarian
Presidential Candidate:
You know what?

13:57.370 --> 14:00.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that somebody can
dot the I's
and cross the T's on a foreign
leader or a

14:00.540 --> 14:06.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
geographic location then allows
them to put
our military in harm's way.

14:06.746 --> 14:10.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For tonight,
though, the
focus is on the V.P. face-off.

14:10.483 --> 14:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it's full speed ahead
to the second
Trump-Clinton debate, on Sunday
night.

14:15.655 --> 14:21.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, Gwen and Judy, late
tonight, we asked
Gary Johnson's campaign to
respond to his

14:21.928 --> 14:23.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quote today.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they responded to us late
tonight saying
that Gary Johnson wasn't making
a serious

14:26.999 --> 14:30.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argument, that he was being
tongue-in-cheek
-- back to you.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: OK, Lisa.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, that's an interesting
response.

14:33.606 --> 14:37.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me ask you about the scene
down there
in Farmville, Virginia.

14:37.276 --> 14:39.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last weekend, we worked up to
the first presidential
debate.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was so much excitement
about how many
people would be watching, about
what would

14:43.015 --> 14:44.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
happen, what wouldn't happen.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it fair to say it's not
exactly the same
tonight?

14:47.053 --> 14:51.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think that's
right, but
maybe in a good way.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is actually an incredibly
relaxed atmosphere.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of all the debates that I have
covered, Gwen
and Judy, I have never been at
one that sort

14:56.729 --> 14:58.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of had this kind of nice feeling
to it.

14:58.731 --> 15:02.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe it's because we have got
these two Midwesterners
debating tonight, maybe because
it's the vice

15:02.635 --> 15:05.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential debate, maybe
because people
are just tired of all the
attacks.

15:05.772 --> 15:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a very almost
casual atmosphere
here that I haven't experienced
at a debate

15:10.042 --> 15:11.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

15:12.011 --> 15:15.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One example, I was walking in
the spin room,
and noticed some very
high-ranking Trump campaign

15:15.348 --> 15:17.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
officials just walking around.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one was noticing them, not
any reporters.

15:19.685 --> 15:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was the only reporter who went
up to talk
to them.

15:22.021 --> 15:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also seemed more at ease
than you would
expect in a spin room just hours
before a

15:26.426 --> 15:28.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate, so a very different
atmosphere indeed.

15:28.294 --> 15:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, is the
expectation
we are going to hear more
tonight about these

15:32.298 --> 15:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vice presidential candidates,
the running
mates, or about the folks at the
top of the

15:37.703 --> 15:38.671 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ticket?

15:38.704 --> 15:39.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

15:41.741 --> 15:45.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think that we
will hear
about both, but I think that
when you talk

15:45.545 --> 15:49.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the campaigns,
representatives of both
campaigns told me today that
they are hoping

15:49.916 --> 15:53.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a policy debate, but that
they don't expect
one.

15:53.219 --> 15:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These two vice presidential
candidates have
had a lot they have had to
defendant in the

15:57.190 --> 16:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past month-and-a-half, and we
expect that
to continue tonight.

16:00.259 --> 16:04.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, a lot depends on the
questions,
but then the candidates can turn
those questions

16:04.530 --> 16:06.232 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
around.

16:06.265 --> 16:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will see if either one of
them goes
on the attack tonight, maybe
some policy,

16:09.268 --> 16:12.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but maybe it's a case of fasten
your seat
belt.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to be a politely
bumpy night, something
like that.

16:16.008 --> 16:16.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

16:17.009 --> 16:17.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A politely bumpy
night.

16:18.010 --> 16:18.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thanks.

16:19.011 --> 16:19.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will ask you about that later
on.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins, thank you very
much.

16:22.014 --> 16:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the campaigns prepare for
tonight's debate,
we turn to representatives of
both parties

16:26.819 --> 16:28.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to tell us what to expect.

16:28.321 --> 16:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We begin with Matt Schlapp,
chairman of the
American Conservative Union.

16:32.091 --> 16:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also served as political
director in the
George W. Bush White House.

16:35.795 --> 16:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we talked a short time ago,
I began by
asking what Mike Pence needs to
accomplish

16:40.499 --> 16:42.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

16:42.201 --> 16:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White House
Director
of Political Affairs: You know,
I think his

16:44.003 --> 16:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
job, his primary job is to
connect with that
heart and soul of the Republican
Party, and

16:48.207 --> 16:50.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's the conservative base.

16:50.142 --> 16:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that conservative base is
trying to get
to know this guy, Donald Trump,
and be comfortable

16:54.247 --> 16:55.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with him.

16:55.982 --> 16:59.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's Mike Pence's number one
priority
to connect with them, to close
the deal with

16:59.252 --> 17:03.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
them, bring back those
conservatives and Republicans
who are still thinking about who
they're going

17:03.456 --> 17:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to vote for on Election Day.

17:05.291 --> 17:09.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I have heard more
analogies having
to do with Mike Pence's role in
this debate

17:09.462 --> 17:16.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tonight, from cleanup to
Swiffer, to -- none
of them complimentary, all of
them about Mike

17:16.602 --> 17:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pence having to defend Donald
Trump.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that his principal role here
tonight?

17:21.641 --> 17:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes, well, all
vice presidents
have to be the number one
cheerleader for

17:26.345 --> 17:27.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the top of the ticket.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I actually don't think
that's what this
debate is going to be about
tonight.

17:31.017 --> 17:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think actually what we're
going to have
tonight is a very conservative
public servant

17:35.688 --> 17:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against a very liberal public
servant.

17:38.257 --> 17:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in our own ratings, Mike
Pence has a 99
percent and Tim Kaine has a zero
percent.

17:43.562 --> 17:48.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we might have a very solid
ideological
conversation of what it means to
be a conservative

17:48.367 --> 17:52.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what it means to be a
liberal and why
one philosophy is the right
philosophy in

17:52.838 --> 17:54.840 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2016.

17:54.874 --> 17:58.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Matt Schlapp, one of
the big differences
between the two candidates
tonight, for instance,

17:58.210 --> 18:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on taxes is that Donald Trump
will not release
his income tax statements, but
Mike Pence

18:03.749 --> 18:04.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
already has.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does he explain that?

18:06.819 --> 18:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes, I think
that's probably
-- I think that's going to be
one of Kaine's

18:09.221 --> 18:13.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strategies, to try to put Mike
Pence on the
defense.

18:13.292 --> 18:17.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm sure Mike Pence, who I
know well,
and I'm sure he is very ready
for this moment,

18:17.196 --> 18:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to be ready to also put
Tim Kaine
on the defense, for the fact
that Hillary

18:21.300 --> 18:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton has been involved in
scandal after
scandal after scandal.

18:25.171 --> 18:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's one of the reasons why
the American
voters in all the polls show
that they don't

18:29.342 --> 18:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
find her honest and trustworthy.

18:31.177 --> 18:34.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's her number one problem that
she has got
to find a way to mend between
now and Election

18:34.847 --> 18:36.549 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I think it's fair to
say that
Mike Pence and Donald Trump come
from opposite

18:38.351 --> 18:40.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ends of the personality
spectrum.

18:40.319 --> 18:45.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Do you think that their
differences help or
hurt the Trump-Pence candidacy?

18:45.424 --> 18:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think the
differences make
for a good team.

18:50.329 --> 18:56.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pence is kind of a steady
Midwesterner
who comes from kind of a base of
the -- he's

18:56.135 --> 18:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an ideological firebrand.

18:57.937 --> 19:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He understands the conservative
philosophy
well.

19:00.873 --> 19:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump is a complete
outsider, is
a relatively new Republican, and
he doesn't

19:07.380 --> 19:08.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even talk like politicians.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He talks like a New York
businessman.

19:11.684 --> 19:17.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, together, I actually think
Trump is reaching
out to these blue-collar
working-class Americans

19:17.690 --> 19:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across the country like the
Republican Party
has never been able to do
before.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have always had trouble with
that bloc.

19:23.095 --> 19:28.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Mike Pence is able
to reach out
to those steady conservatives,
those lifelong

19:29.001 --> 19:34.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans and say, look, take
a chance with
this guy because, together,
we're going to

19:34.607 --> 19:35.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make a great team for the
country.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Taking a chance.

19:37.710 --> 19:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's one of the things about
vice presidential
debates, and that people often
expect a vice

19:42.314 --> 19:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential candidate to do
fine, as long
as he or she doesn't make a
mistake.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

19:48.821 --> 19:52.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, is it a good
night for Mike
Pence if he simply gets away
without making

19:52.191 --> 19:53.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a mistake?

19:53.192 --> 19:54.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think so.

19:54.994 --> 20:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think -- actually, I think,
for both of
them, I don't think either one
of them has

20:00.599 --> 20:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to worry too much about -- I
mean, they're
going to make a mistake, Gwen.

20:03.769 --> 20:04.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have been there.

20:04.770 --> 20:05.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have seen it.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're going to make small
mistakes.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't see either one of them
making a big,
huge gaffe.

20:09.542 --> 20:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're pretty steady political
pros.

20:13.245 --> 20:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also think, if Tim Kaine's
number one
job is to help Hillary Clinton
be a little

20:17.716 --> 20:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more likable and smile and be
charming and
be himself, that's a pretty low
bar for someone

20:24.857 --> 20:26.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to have to pass.

20:26.625 --> 20:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, for Mike Pence, his
job is to
once again hit those themes
which he lives

20:30.229 --> 20:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and understands and passionately
believes
in.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Matt Schlapp, thanks
so much.

20:34.433 --> 20:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Thanks, Gwen.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we hear
from the Democrats.

20:38.404 --> 20:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donna Brazile is interim chair
of the Democratic
National Committee.

20:42.508 --> 20:44.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome to the program, Donna
Brazile.

20:44.376 --> 20:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we just heard Matt Schlapp
say that Tim
Kaine's main job is going to be
make Secretary

20:49.882 --> 20:51.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton more likable.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

20:52.918 --> 20:55.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA BRAZILE, Interim Chair,
Democratic National
Committee: I think, tonight, Tim
Kaine is

20:55.554 --> 21:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to build upon what I
believe was a terrific
debate by Hillary Clinton last
week.

21:00.059 --> 21:03.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She outlined her plans for the
American people.

21:03.462 --> 21:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She talked about job creation.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She talked about keeping us safe
and secure.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She talked about making sure
that college
is more affordable.

21:10.769 --> 21:16.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Mike Pence has a tough
job tonight
explaining to the American
people all of the

21:16.308 --> 21:20.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ridiculous things Donald Trump
has said, from
veterans, insulting veterans, to
insulting

21:20.246 --> 21:23.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women of a certain size, to
banning Muslims.

21:23.349 --> 21:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Mike Pence has a more
difficult job
tonight explaining the
differences between

21:28.220 --> 21:30.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him and Donald Trump on so many
issues.

21:30.556 --> 21:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tim Kaine tonight, who is a
reasonable, down-home,
what I call a great public
servant, will be

21:37.296 --> 21:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to tell the American people
what the
Clinton-Kaine ticket will be
able to do to

21:42.001 --> 21:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
build upon the great success and
legacy of
Barack Obama as well.

21:44.803 --> 21:48.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, again
quoting Mr. Schlapp,
he said he thinks what Tim Kaine
is going

21:48.674 --> 21:55.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to have to do is defend
Secretary Clinton
tonight, and he said, in that
she's been involved

21:55.414 --> 21:57.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in -- quote -- "scandal after
scandal."

21:57.416 --> 22:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONNA BRAZILE: I mean, what is
the biggest
scandal?

22:00.986 --> 22:06.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of not paying your tax, not
releasing your
taxes, saying that you're smart
because you

22:06.091 --> 22:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't abide by the rules, like
most of us,
and making sure that we can pay
for our roads,

22:11.964 --> 22:13.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
making sure that we can educate
our children.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's the greatest
scandal.

22:15.701 --> 22:21.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also think that Donald Trump's
comments
again that he made overnight at
3:00 a.m.,

22:21.140 --> 22:25.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there were different things
he said on
the campaign trail -- how does
Mike Pence

22:25.077 --> 22:26.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
defend that?

22:26.946 --> 22:30.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does he defend this notion
that President
Obama was somehow or another not
born in America,

22:30.916 --> 22:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the whole birther nonsense?

22:32.818 --> 22:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think Tim Kaine's job
tonight is to
focus his remarks on the
American people.

22:38.123 --> 22:40.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is about the future, having
a conversation
with the American people.

22:40.993 --> 22:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Tim Kaine will be
able to get
the message across that we're
stronger together

22:44.730 --> 22:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
when we come together as
Americans to solve
our problems.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what tonight's debate
is going
to be about.

22:49.501 --> 22:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned
what Donald Trump
has said on the trail.

22:52.238 --> 22:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that former President
Bill Clinton
said on the trail yesterday,
made some comments

22:57.343 --> 23:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the health care reform
law, Obamacare.

23:00.879 --> 23:08.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that it's a crazy system
in which
half the American people,
hardworking people

23:08.153 --> 23:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have seen their premiums go up,
become more
expensive.

23:12.625 --> 23:17.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did walk that back a little
bit today,
but is that something that
Hillary Clinton

23:17.630 --> 23:19.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is going to have to explain
herself?

23:19.632 --> 23:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA BRAZILE: Well, look, I'm
sure that Tim
Kaine will be able to explain it
tonight.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been a strong supporter of
the Affordable
Care Act.

23:28.140 --> 23:31.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over 20 million Americans now
have health
insurance because of that.

23:31.543 --> 23:33.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bill Clinton has been a champion
for health
care reform.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So has Hillary Clinton over the
years.

23:36.448 --> 23:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think it's important to
understand
that the law is good.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's strong.

23:41.954 --> 23:46.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
People with preexisting
conditions are now
able to have access to health
care.

23:46.258 --> 23:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Millions of Americans who live
below the poverty
line have access to what I call
life quality

23:51.363 --> 23:55.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
medicine, Medicaid expansion
that I just saw
in my home state of Louisiana.

23:55.834 --> 23:59.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what Bill Clinton was
talking about, I
believe, are the improvements
that we'd like

23:59.772 --> 24:04.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to see in expanding the
marketplace, ensuring
that people have that people
have subsidies

24:04.209 --> 24:06.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be able to afford it.

24:06.111 --> 24:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those Americans who own
small businesses
and others who are not able to
get the subsidies

24:11.717 --> 24:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they need or to have what I
call more
marketplace protections, there's
no question

24:17.589 --> 24:21.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that even President Obama said
that we have
to focus on cost containment.

24:21.226 --> 24:25.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, look, the issue tonight is
that the Democrats
believe in expanding health care
for all.

24:25.864 --> 24:29.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We believe in making sure that
people have
lifesaving medicines.

24:29.735 --> 24:33.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republicans want to repeal,
and Donald
Trump said he wants to replace
it with something

24:33.505 --> 24:36.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terrific that we don't know what
that means.

24:36.108 --> 24:40.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donna Brazile,
finally, we
saw Hillary Clinton in last
week's debate

24:40.112 --> 24:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Donald Trump at the last
minute, in effect,
set a trap for him.

24:43.282 --> 24:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She brought up the comments
about Miss Universe.

24:47.052 --> 24:49.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe Tim Kaine does something
like that tonight?

24:49.588 --> 24:51.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:51.290 --> 24:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA BRAZILE: You know, Tim is
smart on his
feet, and he also -- he is
bilingual.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So maybe he will say it in
Spanish.

24:58.297 --> 25:04.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, regardless of how he says
it, most Americans
will see Tim Kaine as a man of
principle,

25:04.203 --> 25:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone that Hillary Clinton
picked because
he's a future leader, he's a
visionary, and

25:09.007 --> 25:10.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he's a strong leader.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And let me just say something.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Tim Kaine is going to
bring up the
fact tonight that, when it comes
to women

25:14.813 --> 25:20.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this society, we're the
majority of voters,
the majority of college
graduates.

25:20.119 --> 25:24.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine
believe in equal
pay, and Mike Pence doesn't.

25:24.656 --> 25:28.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there are many issues,
whether it's making
-- Mike Pence went out of his
way to say that

25:28.827 --> 25:31.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Planned Parenthood shouldn't be
funded.

25:31.130 --> 25:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pence went out of his way
to put forward
policies that were discriminated
against the

25:36.902 --> 25:38.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
LGBTQ community.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Tim Kaine has a great
record.

25:40.406 --> 25:42.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is a great
leader, a visionary.

25:42.508 --> 25:46.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, tonight, you are going
to see a contrast
in two candidates, one who is
optimistic and

25:46.879 --> 25:50.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has a plan for the future, and
another one
who is trying to drag us back to
someplace

25:50.883 --> 25:52.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the past that nobody wants to
go to.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's Mike Pence.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tim Kaine is the candidate of
the future.

25:55.687 --> 25:58.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donna Brazile,
it's great to
have you with us.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

25:59.525 --> 26:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONNA BRAZILE: Always good to
hear your voice
and see you, Judy.

26:02.795 --> 26:06.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: For more on
tonight's debate,
we're joined now by syndicated
columnist Mark

26:06.598 --> 26:11.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shields, Amy Walter of The Cook
Political
Report, and Washington Post
columnist Michael

26:11.170 --> 26:12.838 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Gerson.

26:12.871 --> 26:14.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hey, Amy, did you notice
something I just
noticed with Donna Brazile,
which is, when

26:14.773 --> 26:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was asked about something
that Bill Clinton
said, which is widely
interpreted to be a

26:18.811 --> 26:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gaffe, she responded by saying
Tim Kaine will
respond that tonight?

26:21.113 --> 26:22.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Tim
Kaine can help clean that up.

26:22.648 --> 26:23.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:23.649 --> 26:24.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Cleanup in aisle
six.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Bring Tim Kaine over
there.

26:27.453 --> 26:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, both of these candidates
were brought
on, Tim Kaine and Mike Pence,
were brought

26:29.254 --> 26:34.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on to be stabilizers for Hillary
Clinton and
Donald for Trump, for different
reasons, for

26:34.359 --> 26:38.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, literally a
stabilizer, in that
both his personality and his
ability to talk

26:39.031 --> 26:44.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to that core conservative base
that Matt Schlapp
was talking about, so to make
them feel better.

26:44.970 --> 26:52.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Tim Kaine was there to sort
of stabilize
the Hillary Clinton -- not
expand her base,

26:52.611 --> 26:58.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but hold on to a lot of her
base, and also
to prove to be a very different
kind of candidate

26:58.851 --> 27:01.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
without the baggage that Hillary
Clinton comes
with.

27:01.954 --> 27:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, how
do you see
the mission of these two men at
-- the second

27:07.726 --> 27:10.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
man on the ticket in both cases
tonight?

27:10.095 --> 27:15.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Obviously, as said
earlier,
not to make any mistakes, but
most of all,

27:15.667 --> 27:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mike Pence has a tougher task.

27:17.503 --> 27:21.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He does -- stop the bleeding or
however you
want to put it.

27:21.173 --> 27:25.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been a terrible week for
the Trump campaign
ever since the first debate.

27:25.978 --> 27:29.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's been assigned the task of
being the explainer-in-chief.

27:29.381 --> 27:32.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's had to clean up in the past
after Mr.
and Mrs. Khan.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, we honor Gold Star
parents.

27:35.020 --> 27:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, he said that to a
partisan crowd.

27:38.323 --> 27:42.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's time and again had to sort
of right the
wrongs.

27:42.661 --> 27:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that is his -- to
try the change
the narrative as much as he can.

27:46.231 --> 27:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tim Kaine, it's interesting.

27:48.066 --> 27:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The happiest I have ever seen
Hillary Clinton
in any public setting was the
day that she

27:53.505 --> 27:55.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
chose Tim Kaine.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was beyond giddy.

27:56.775 --> 27:59.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was just happy.

27:59.745 --> 28:05.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she had somebody she could
totally depend
upon as a partner.

28:05.217 --> 28:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it was the best
decision of her
campaign, in the sense of, you
couldn't get

28:09.054 --> 28:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a Republican to say anything bad
about him.

28:12.190 --> 28:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington and the toxicity,
to have somebody
like Tim Kaine -- and so I think
his job,

28:19.264 --> 28:25.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, is going to be the
explainer, or defender,
or whatever, but to -- I would
just remind

28:25.537 --> 28:29.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, Tim Kaine in 2007 at
Virginia Tech.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have never seen anybody
handle a public
situation...

28:31.743 --> 28:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: After the shooting.

28:33.512 --> 28:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Just after the
tragedy of 32
people being murdered by a
deranged person

28:37.616 --> 28:38.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with a gun.

28:38.784 --> 28:41.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have just never seen
anybody handle
it better.

28:41.353 --> 28:43.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

28:43.155 --> 28:46.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Michael Gerson, so, vice
presidential debate,
do they ever help, or are they
more likely

28:46.625 --> 28:47.926 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to hurt?

28:47.960 --> 28:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON, The Washington
Post: Well,
it's interesting.

28:48.627 --> 28:49.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're often memorable.

28:50.028 --> 28:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're seldom consequential,
don't really
determine the outcome.

28:53.298 --> 28:54.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:54.766 --> 28:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: And this is a
strange one,
though, in a certain way.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are not strange men.

28:58.136 --> 29:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a strange circumstance,
where the republic
might be better served, and a
lot of people

29:02.241 --> 29:08.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might agree that both tickets
could be flipped
and actually have more appealing
candidates.

29:08.780 --> 29:10.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: They say that about
the Libertarian
ticket, too.

29:11.016 --> 29:11.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Right.

29:12.017 --> 29:13.885 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that could be -- that's
interesting, because
it's an indictment of sorts of
the system,

29:16.221 --> 29:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that our primary system has
chosen two of
the least popular politicians in
America.

29:21.460 --> 29:25.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the selection, the people
they selected
as vice president are actually
very respected

29:26.031 --> 29:30.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in their party, knowledgeable
people, so,
you know, the selected
candidates better than

29:30.769 --> 29:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the elected candidates, maybe.

29:32.871 --> 29:38.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, when all
is said and
done tonight, we don't know
what's going to

29:38.143 --> 29:41.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen, does the election, does
the direction
of this election change after
tonight?

29:41.980 --> 29:47.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, remember, in
2012, after
Barack Obama's first -- after
the first presidential

29:47.753 --> 29:52.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate, he was widely panned for
having an
off night.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you saw Democrats panic.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the polls started to dip.

29:56.328 --> 30:03.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was Joe Biden's job to go
in and basically
reassure Republicans -- I mean
Democrats -- reenergize

30:03.435 --> 30:05.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats, keep them -- keep
their chin up.

30:05.871 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what Mike Pence will have
to do tonight
as well, is to reassure a lot of
those Republicans

30:10.709 --> 30:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are worried, as well as go
on the offense,
something that Donald Trump
didn't do well

30:15.580 --> 30:17.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the first debate.

30:17.382 --> 30:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually think this -- while
it might not
be consequential, I think we
might see a much

30:21.119 --> 30:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more aggressive debate than
we're expecting,
because Mike Pence really does
have to put

30:26.458 --> 30:30.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kaine and the Hillary Clinton
campaign back
on its heels.

30:30.395 --> 30:36.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this may not be the nice,
genteel,
lovely sort of experience that
people are

30:36.735 --> 30:38.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
expecting.

30:38.704 --> 30:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Briefly, which one
is better equipped
to do that job, that Swiffer
job, that cleanup

30:41.873 --> 30:43.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
job tonight?

30:43.575 --> 30:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, Pence has
the tougher
task, whether, in fact, he can
do it.

30:49.081 --> 30:52.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's more immediate and urgent
that he do
it than Kaine do it.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

30:53.251 --> 30:54.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, I agree with that.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talked to some of the people
that prepared
Pence today.

30:56.354 --> 31:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they need to explain,
because they have
to respond to charges, but then
not give get

31:02.194 --> 31:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the quicksand of just
explaining, because
that would be a loss.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are going to
be all watching

teachers tired
of the status quo step into
politics and onto

31:55.046 --> 32:00.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

32:00.552 --> 32:04.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Supreme Court's refusal
this week
to rehear a key immigration case
dealt a setback

32:05.023 --> 32:10.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to millions of undocumented
immigrants hoping
to stay in the U.S. legally.

32:10.162 --> 32:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also reflects the continuing
difficulty
of deadlock, in this case, the
limitations

32:14.900 --> 32:16.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of an eight-person bench.

32:16.768 --> 32:21.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The issue of the immigration
program's legality
could yet return to the high
court, but one

32:21.373 --> 32:26.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whose makeup is likely to be
decided by the
next president.

32:26.244 --> 32:32.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Twelve-year-old Victoria
Bonilla, like many
seventh graders, spends
weeknights hammering

32:32.517 --> 32:34.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
away at her homework.

32:34.452 --> 32:39.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unlike her classmates, she
worries her mom
won't always be there to help.

32:39.090 --> 32:42.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VICTORIA BONILLA, Student: I'm
worried that
they might take my mom away from
me, which

32:42.661 --> 32:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really hard for a kid,
because, like, you
know you can't live without your
mom.

32:47.866 --> 32:51.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Victoria is an only
child and
a U.S. citizen.

32:51.703 --> 32:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she was born to a mother who
came to the
country illegally, from Eli
Salvador in 2004.

32:58.543 --> 33:03.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Bonillas live in
Gaithersburg, Maryland,
a Washington suburb, where
Hilaria works as

33:03.582 --> 33:05.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a restaurant manager.

33:05.517 --> 33:11.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says she moved to the U.S.
to escape domestic
abuse, one of an estimated four
million parents

33:11.423 --> 33:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who would have qualified for
legal status
under a 2014 executive action
issued by President

33:18.263 --> 33:19.898 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Obama.

33:19.931 --> 33:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's plan was blocked
by a Texas
federal judge last year, leaving
families

33:24.202 --> 33:28.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like the Bonillas in limbo.

33:28.673 --> 33:33.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court deadlocked 4-4 when it
heard the
case earlier this year, leaving
the lower

33:33.845 --> 33:35.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
court's hold in place.

33:35.680 --> 33:40.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with the ninth seat vacant
since Justice
Antonin Scalia's death nearly
eight months

33:40.785 --> 33:43.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ago, there is no resolution in

MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law

This is such an important issue,
it may be

33:50.896 --> 33:56.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well that the court is willing
to take another
shot at it if it does have a
ninth justice

33:56.868 --> 33:58.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eventually.

BARACK OBAMA, President of the

Merrick Garland.

Garland, chief judge of the D.C.

34:05.343 --> 34:11.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court of Appeals, has languished
without a
confirmation hearing since
March, after the

34:11.116 --> 34:15.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Senate majority
declared it was
too late in the president's term
to allow

MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority

American people may well elect a
president

34:19.958 --> 34:25.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who decides to nominate Judge
Garland for
Senate consideration.

34:25.196 --> 34:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The next president may also
nominate somebody
very different.

34:28.833 --> 34:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Either way, our view is this:
Give the people
a voice in filling this vacancy.

CARRIE SEVERINO, Judicial Crisis

The Constitution gives the
authority to choose

34:48.787 --> 34:53.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Supreme Court justices to
the president,
as the nominator, and then to
the Senate,

34:53.491 --> 34:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which gives its advice and
consent.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's a lot of ways it can
do that.

34:56.561 --> 35:00.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't have to have hearings
or votes
on a specific schedule.

35:00.532 --> 35:05.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, historically, two-thirds of
the justices
who have not been confirmed,
who've been rejected

35:05.203 --> 35:06.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the Senate, it's been because
they didn't
get a vote.

asking is for the Republicans to
do their

35:09.808 --> 35:11.409 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

35:11.443 --> 35:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Mitch McConnell set out and
he did it
publicly.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His number one goal was to make
sure Obama
wasn't reelected.

35:18.750 --> 35:22.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He failed at that miserably,
just like he
is going to fail miserably here.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to have a Supreme
Court justice.

35:24.255 --> 35:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the right thing to do.

constitutional

35:39.971 --> 35:44.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

35:44.676 --> 35:47.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

ages of the
justices who are currently on
the Supreme

35:59.858 --> 36:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

fill not only

36:05.864 --> 36:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one seat, but possibly as many

One of the reasons this election

MARCIA COYLE: The political
polarization that
we have been experiencing in the
last eight

37:47.866 --> 37:55.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
years has driven more
organizations and people
to turn to the courts for
answers to some

37:55.440 --> 38:00.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the questions and issues that
Congress
has not been able to address.

38:00.678 --> 38:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that has raised the profile
of the U.S.
Supreme Court.

38:04.616 --> 38:10.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it also has made the Supreme
Court loom
much larger in every American's
life than

38:10.054 --> 38:13.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it has been perhaps in recent
decades.

38:13.525 --> 38:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And for Hilaria
Bonilla and her
daughter, this election's
outcome will hit

38:18.429 --> 38:19.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
close to home.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Will they stay or will they go?

38:22.634 --> 38:24.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILARIA BONILLA, Immigrant: We
never know.

38:24.702 --> 38:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we are going to work and we
never know
if we can come back or not.

38:28.506 --> 38:33.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it's difficult.

38:33.711 --> 38:46.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In some parts of
the country,
it's not just the presidential
race on voters'

38:46.558 --> 38:48.326 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
minds.

38:48.359 --> 38:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State elections are taking
center stage in
some places, too, like Oklahoma,
where education

38:52.764 --> 38:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is at the forefront of the
ballot.

38:55.099 --> 39:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teachers are upset over spending
cuts and
what they see as a political
assault on public

39:00.838 --> 39:02.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have decided it's time to
take matters
into their own hands.

39:04.442 --> 39:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A record number of teachers are
running for
seats in the state legislature.

39:08.980 --> 39:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of this comes as Oklahoma
faces tough
budget decisions.

Special correspondent Lisa Stark
of our partner
Education Week reports from
Oklahoma as part

39:18.623 --> 39:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of our weekly segment Making the

39:22.293 --> 39:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Football is king in
Oklahoma,
so it's no surprise the Norman
High School

39:28.800 --> 39:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
homecoming parade shuts down the
town's main
street.

39:33.004 --> 39:39.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's candy for the kids,
cheerleaders,
and athletes, of course, and
enjoying the

39:40.011 --> 39:45.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ride, Oklahoma's teacher of the
year, whose
day job is deciphering algebra
for ninth graders

39:45.817 --> 39:49.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at Norman High.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is Shawn Sheehan's sixth
year teaching.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, you love being a teacher?

39:54.259 --> 39:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAWN SHEEHAN, Oklahoma State
Senatorial Candidate:
I do.

39:55.693 --> 39:56.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love it.

39:56.694 --> 39:57.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I love working with kids.

39:57.695 --> 39:58.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really do.

39:58.696 --> 39:59.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I love math.

39:59.697 --> 40:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That sounds super nerdy, but I
do love math.

40:01.499 --> 40:06.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: So, it may seem odd
that Sheehan,
Oklahoma's top teacher, is ready
to hang up

40:06.304 --> 40:07.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the white board.

40:07.605 --> 40:10.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAWN SHEEHAN: I made the
decision to run
for state Senate.

40:10.074 --> 40:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what it is, is, we have
is a lack
of representation at the state
capitol.

40:14.712 --> 40:19.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have folks up there who don't
really understand
what's going on in education and
what's going

40:19.117 --> 40:20.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on in our communities.

40:20.351 --> 40:24.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: He's not the only
one who feels
that way.

40:24.155 --> 40:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sheehan has joined more than 40
educators
who have filed to run for the
Oklahoma legislature.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Why do you think so many
educators are running
this year?

40:31.629 --> 40:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAWN SHEEHAN: I think, in this
state, educators
are finally fed up.

40:35.500 --> 40:39.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's almost like a sense of,
we don't
have anything to lose at this
point.

40:39.904 --> 40:44.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Oklahoma schools
have already
lost a lot.

40:44.676 --> 40:49.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state ranks 47 out of 50 in
per-pupil
spending.

40:49.113 --> 40:55.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since 2008, the legislature
has cut spending
per student by 24 percent, the
largest drop

40:55.520 --> 40:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the nation, leading to
teacher layoffs,
overcrowded classrooms.

41:00.024 --> 41:04.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 100 districts have
approved four-day
school weeks.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Teachers and parents are riled
up.

41:05.930 --> 41:07.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BOREN, President,
University of Oklahoma:
They are really concerned about
the education

41:07.632 --> 41:09.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of their children.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: David Boren is
president of the
University of Oklahoma, and a
former U.S.

41:12.904 --> 41:14.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
senator and governor.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BOREN: We're headed for
dead last in
what we spend in the nation
among all the

41:17.975 --> 41:23.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states on the education of our
students, and
we're losing our best and
brightest teachers

41:23.147 --> 41:27.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to all the states that surround
us, because
they pay so much more in their
salaries, every

41:27.352 --> 41:28.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
single one of them.

41:28.353 --> 41:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we're at a crossroads.

41:29.954 --> 41:34.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Salaries average
about $45,000
a year, including benefits.

41:34.859 --> 41:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's so hard to attract teachers
that the
state this school year has
already approved

41:39.897 --> 41:43.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more than 900 emergency
certifications.

41:43.101 --> 41:48.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Currently, an estimated 50,000
students are
relying on these teachers, who
may not be

41:48.673 --> 41:50.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fully qualified to take over a
classroom.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GENE PERRY, Oklahoma Policy
Institute: And
that's troubling.

41:52.577 --> 41:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Gene Perry is the
policy director
at a progressive Oklahoma think
tank.

41:56.280 --> 42:02.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENE PERRY: What I think it's
shown is that
experience and that training is
the most important

42:02.954 --> 42:06.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing to have to be an effective
teacher,
and we're putting untrained
people in the

42:06.858 --> 42:08.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
classroom.

42:08.626 --> 42:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Educators say they
have tried
to change things from outside
the capitol,

42:14.165 --> 42:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rallying for more money for
education.

42:16.501 --> 42:21.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, lawmakers cut taxes,
even when the
state's oil industry was
booming.

42:21.939 --> 42:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now the industry's in a slump,
and there's
no money to spare.

42:25.309 --> 42:28.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY MULLEN HOPPER, Oklahoma
State Senatorial
Candidate: Hello, sir.

42:28.613 --> 42:30.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Mullen Hopper.

42:30.047 --> 42:33.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: So, educators are
now trying to
get inside the capitol.

42:33.651 --> 42:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy Mullen Hopper is vying for
the state
Senate.

42:36.487 --> 42:41.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She retired after 35 years as a
special-ed
teacher, unhappy over the
emphasis on testing.

42:42.026 --> 42:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY MULLEN HOPPER: But our
biggest concern
right now is education, and
being able to

42:46.531 --> 42:53.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finance it correctly, being able
to allow
teachers to teach the way they
used to teach,

42:53.371 --> 42:55.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know?

42:55.206 --> 42:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICKEY DOLLENS, Oklahoma State
House Candidate:
I just wanted to come back by
and ask for

42:56.407 --> 42:58.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your vote on November 8.

42:58.209 --> 43:02.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Mickey Dollens is
campaigning
for the state House, one of
1,500 Oklahoma

43:02.847 --> 43:05.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teachers let go last spring
because of budget
cuts.

43:05.616 --> 43:10.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICKEY DOLLENS: I am sticking up
for education,
mental health, senior citizens,
and public

43:10.288 --> 43:11.389 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
safety.

43:11.422 --> 43:13.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's where all my time and
attention will
go into.

43:13.157 --> 43:14.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Check out my campaign
headquarters.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: His headquarters?

43:16.694 --> 43:18.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Right behind his front door.

43:18.496 --> 43:21.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICKEY DOLLENS: These are
probably the most
important parts right here, the
follow-up

43:21.199 --> 43:22.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank-you letters.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I try to hit a 100 doors a day.

43:23.968 --> 43:28.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Dollens was a
college football
player, a Team USA bobsledder,
even drilled

43:28.773 --> 43:32.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for oil, before he became a high
school English
teacher.

43:32.410 --> 43:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's reinventing himself again.

43:34.345 --> 43:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How to win a local election?

43:36.514 --> 43:37.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICKEY DOLLENS: Mm-hmm.

43:37.515 --> 43:39.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: A complete
step-by-step guide.

43:39.350 --> 43:41.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICKEY DOLLENS: Yes, I read them
all.

43:41.219 --> 43:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Dollens and the
other educators
running for office have been
dubbed the teacher

43:44.822 --> 43:45.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
caucus.

43:45.923 --> 43:46.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We're definitely going to
go vote for
you.

43:46.791 --> 43:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICKEY DOLLENS: Well, thank you
so much.

43:47.825 --> 43:49.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We really support you.

43:49.327 --> 43:52.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICKEY DOLLENS: Mostly Democrats
running in
this very conservative state.

43:52.230 --> 43:53.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA CLARK LITTLE, Oklahomans
for Public
Education: This is our list of
candidates

43:53.798 --> 43:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our group supports.

43:55.600 --> 44:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Angela Little can
take some credit
for this swell of education
candidates.

44:00.271 --> 44:06.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A suburban single mom with twin
fifth graders,
upset over increased school
testing, she started

44:06.811 --> 44:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Facebook group two years ago
for parents
and teachers to share ideas.

44:11.749 --> 44:16.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year, she put out a call
for candidates
to challenge -- quote --
"anti-public education

44:16.654 --> 44:17.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
legislators."

44:17.655 --> 44:19.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The idea took off.

44:19.257 --> 44:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So did the Facebook group.

44:20.424 --> 44:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It now has 25,000 members.

44:22.226 --> 44:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA CLARK LITTLE: A lot of
legislators
feel like because they went to
school, they

44:26.130 --> 44:27.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are education experts.

44:27.532 --> 44:30.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I have been to a Thunder
game, and I
can't play basketball.

44:30.268 --> 44:31.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's a difference.

44:31.569 --> 44:33.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to bring the subject
matter experts
to the table.

44:33.304 --> 44:35.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLARK JOLLEY (R), Oklahoma State
Senator:
These people who are running to
put more money

44:35.740 --> 44:39.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in education, to do more for
education, I
think they are going to quickly
find out,

44:39.510 --> 44:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whoa, we have got other things
we have to
fund too.

LISA STARK: State Senator Clark
Jolley has
chaired the Senate
Appropriations Committee

44:45.483 --> 44:51.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for five years, and has seen
Oklahoma's economy
nosedive, as gas prices
plummeted.

44:51.689 --> 44:57.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mid-last year, lawmakers
suddenly faced a
$1.3 billion deficit.

44:57.128 --> 45:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even so, Jolley says education
got more than
it's fair share.

45:00.598 --> 45:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLARK JOLLEY: We actually are
giving more
money to education at the end of
my tenure

45:05.803 --> 45:07.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than we were at the beginning.

45:07.672 --> 45:08.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The problem is that we have
got...

45:08.673 --> 45:10.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: But not more money
per student.

45:10.241 --> 45:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLARK JOLLEY: We have got more
students coming
in than we have money coming in.

45:13.210 --> 45:17.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, because of that, we're
seeing a decrease
in the per-pupil expenditure,
even though

45:17.648 --> 45:21.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're putting tens of millions
of more dollars
in education every year.

45:21.752 --> 45:26.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: But what legislators
didn't do,
voters are being asked to, on
the ballot,

45:26.190 --> 45:31.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a measure to raise the sales tax
by 1 percent
for education, including money
to boost teacher

45:31.796 --> 45:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
salaries by $5,000 a year.

45:35.099 --> 45:37.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University President Boren is
its chief backer.

45:37.602 --> 45:41.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BOREN: It's not a perfect
solution,
but we can't sit here and wait.

45:41.272 --> 45:45.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we going to wait until we
have 100,000
students in classroom with no
teachers, qualified

45:45.843 --> 45:46.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
teachers?

45:46.844 --> 45:48.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are we going to go to three-day
school weeks?

45:48.646 --> 45:52.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How long are we going to wait
before we go
over Niagara Falls, so to speak,
in a barrel?

45:52.717 --> 45:55.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: It's clear some
voters aren't
convinced.

45:55.519 --> 46:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They see waste in the system,
too many school
districts, too many
administrators.

46:00.124 --> 46:03.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: And our teachers are
complaining about
not being paid enough?

46:03.728 --> 46:06.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, where is all this money
going to?

46:06.764 --> 46:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every year, we ask for more and
more money
for education.

46:09.400 --> 46:13.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Regardless of what
happens at
the polls, educators feel that,
by running

46:13.604 --> 46:19.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in such large numbers, they have
made a difference,
that they have changed the
conversation around

46:20.011 --> 46:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
education here in Oklahoma.

46:22.146 --> 46:23.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY MULLEN HOPPER: Come help
me.

46:23.681 --> 46:24.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just push it down.

46:24.682 --> 46:25.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you do it with me?

46:25.816 --> 46:27.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Put your hand right here.

46:27.585 --> 46:30.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: It's a conversation
these novice
candidates hope will sink in
with voters.

46:30.855 --> 46:34.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY MULLEN HOPPER: OK, here we
go.

46:34.225 --> 46:36.060 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

46:36.093 --> 46:40.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Reporting from
Oklahoma, I'm Lisa
Stark of Education Week, for the
"PBS NewsHour."

46:40.631 --> 46:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY MULLEN HOPPER: And can you
vote for me?

46:46.904 --> 46:52.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you vote for me?

46:52.309 --> 46:58.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And finally tonight:
As the baseball
playoffs get under way, one of
the game's

46:58.115 --> 47:04.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legendary figures, Vin Scully,
is signing
off; 88-year-old Scully called
his last Los

47:04.321 --> 47:07.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Angeles Dodgers game on Sunday.

47:07.625 --> 47:13.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That closed an incredible
67-year career that
started back when the Dodgers
called Brooklyn

47:13.698 --> 47:14.932 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

47:14.965 --> 47:17.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown spent a day at the
ballpark
with Scully in 2009.

47:17.601 --> 47:19.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here's an excerpt of that
profile.

47:19.303 --> 47:23.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIN SCULLY, Los Angeles Dodgers
Broadcaster:
It's time for Dodger baseball.

47:23.908 --> 47:25.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

47:25.776 --> 47:31.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a voice that
generations
of Dodger fans have grown up
with, savored,

47:31.382 --> 47:32.583 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
loved.

47:32.616 --> 47:35.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIN SCULLY: Ground ball to
third, backhanded
by Blake.

47:35.119 --> 47:37.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He straightens up to throw him
out.

47:37.388 --> 47:39.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Easy inning for Randy Wolf.

47:39.323 --> 47:44.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In Los Angeles,
but also, incredibly,
going all the way back to
Brooklyn in the

47:44.395 --> 47:45.629 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1950s.

47:45.663 --> 47:48.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIN SCULLY: The pitch at the
right ankle of
Andres Torres.

47:48.632 --> 47:50.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ball one.

47:50.401 --> 47:55.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, admittedly, there are days
where you
think, you know, I'd rather sit
under a tree

47:55.706 --> 47:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and read a book than go to the
ballpark.

47:57.141 --> 47:58.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:58.142 --> 47:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everybody has those days, right?

47:59.810 --> 48:03.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIN SCULLY: But what's great is,
you come
to the park, you do the routine
stuff, and

48:03.180 --> 48:08.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then the crowd comes in, and the
team takes
the field, and the crowd roars.

48:08.753 --> 48:13.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, all of a sudden, you're
delighted as
a kid in a candy store.

48:13.157 --> 48:14.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's exactly
where you want
to be.

48:14.892 --> 48:16.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
VIN SCULLY: Exactly.

48:16.961 --> 48:20.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In an age when
the sports broadcast
booth is crammed with two or
even three announcers,

48:20.197 --> 48:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scully still prefers to work
alone.

48:22.266 --> 48:25.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIN SCULLY: Sanchez a strike,
and the count
0-1.

48:25.236 --> 48:30.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: His style,
mastery of language,
and, yes, longevity have made
him a legend

48:30.674 --> 48:32.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in sports circles.

48:32.676 --> 48:38.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It all began, he says, with
lessons in attitude
from his mentor, Red Barber,
another broadcasting

48:38.682 --> 48:43.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
great, who gave Scully his first
big break
and brought him into the booth
in Brooklyn

48:43.154 --> 48:44.855 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1950.

48:44.889 --> 48:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIN SCULLY: One of my many jobs
as the junior
partner of the broadcasting firm
would be

48:49.660 --> 48:52.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get the lineups every day.

48:52.096 --> 48:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's say that, one day, I
brought up
a lineup where Smith was hitting
in front

48:56.267 --> 48:57.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Brown.

48:57.802 --> 49:02.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The next day, I brought a lineup
up and Brown
was hitting in front of Smith.

49:02.039 --> 49:03.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Red would ask me, why?

49:03.207 --> 49:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the first time he asked me
why, I didn't
know.

49:07.845 --> 49:10.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
However, after that, I knew.

49:10.047 --> 49:16.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was part of Red: Be
there early,
be very well-prepared, and then
you're ready

49:16.520 --> 49:17.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to go on the air.

49:17.888 --> 49:19.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Who are you
talking to when
you're doing the game?

49:19.990 --> 49:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you're one of the few
who still does
it alone for the most part.

49:23.327 --> 49:25.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So who are you talking to?

49:25.763 --> 49:30.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIN SCULLY: Well, first of all,
I have to
make people understand, it's not
an ego thing.

49:30.801 --> 49:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not that I just want to be
on all by
myself.

49:33.971 --> 49:41.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This goes back to Brooklyn,
where Red's philosophy
was simply this: If I want to
sell you a car,

49:41.345 --> 49:46.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is it better for me to talk to
you about the
merits of the car or talk to
so-and-so and

49:46.283 --> 49:50.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have you listen to our
discussion about the
merits of the car?

49:50.087 --> 49:53.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Red always felt that it was
better to talk
one-on-one.

49:53.357 --> 49:56.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So what I'm doing, I'm talking
to the listener.

49:56.327 --> 49:57.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I will talk.

49:57.561 --> 49:59.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say, oh, by the way, I
forgot to tell
you, or...

49:59.363 --> 50:01.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I forgot to tell
you.

50:01.131 --> 50:04.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIN SCULLY: Exactly, talking --
because I
don't want the microphone to be
in the way.

50:04.468 --> 50:07.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want them to know I'm sitting
next to them
in the ballpark talking.

50:07.771 --> 50:11.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yankee Stadium shivering in its
concrete foundation
right now.

50:11.442 --> 50:16.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He called the
only perfect
game pitched in a World Series,
Don Larsen's

50:16.680 --> 50:19.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gem for the Yankees against the
Brooklyn Dodgers
in 1956.

50:19.884 --> 50:21.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
VIN SCULLY: Got him!

50:21.285 --> 50:27.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The greatest game ever pitched
in baseball
history by Don Larsen!

50:27.758 --> 50:33.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nine years later,
Scully was
there for Sandy Koufax's perfect
game.

50:33.330 --> 50:36.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VIN SCULLY: Sandy into his
windup.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the pitch.

50:39.570 --> 50:41.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Swung on and missed! ha perfect
game!

50:41.438 --> 50:42.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
High fly ball into right field,
she is gone!

50:42.806 --> 50:50.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a year that has been so
improbable, the
impossible has happened.

50:50.881 --> 51:00.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then there
was the famous
1988 World Series walk-off home
run by a hobbled

51:00.991 --> 51:05.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Kirk Gibson.

51:05.095 --> 51:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That crowd noise and the silence
from the
broadcast booth is another
Scully trademark.

51:13.337 --> 51:19.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIN SCULLY: When I was very
small, maybe 8
years old, we had a big radio
that stood on

51:19.944 --> 51:23.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
four legs, and it had a
crosspiece underneath
it.

51:23.180 --> 51:26.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I used to take a pillow and
crawl under
the radio.

51:26.550 --> 51:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would listen to a game
that meant nothing
to a kid growing up in New York.

51:29.753 --> 51:32.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, it might be
Tennessee-Alabama.

51:32.456 --> 51:38.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when someone scored a
touchdown and the
crowd roared, that crowd noise
would come

51:38.629 --> 51:44.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the speaker like water
out of a showerhead,
and it would just cover me with
goose bumps.

51:44.335 --> 51:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I used to think, oh, I would
like to be
there to feel that roar of the
crowd.

51:48.472 --> 51:54.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's never left me to this
day, so that,
when something happens, I love
it to shut

51:54.244 --> 51:55.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up and hear the crowd.

51:55.813 --> 51:57.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you're still
enjoying what
you're doing?

51:57.314 --> 51:58.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
VIN SCULLY: I love it.

51:58.549 --> 52:00.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you know how I know I love
it?

52:00.351 --> 52:05.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, when there's a great
play on the
field and the crowd roars, I
still get goose

bumps.

52:06.924 --> 52:09.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm just like that little kid
under the radio.

52:09.193 --> 52:13.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bases loaded, sixth inning, one
out.

52:13.163 --> 52:19.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a drive to left field down
the line.

52:19.069 --> 52:24.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Scully, who was a childhood fan
of the San
Francisco Giants, said the
greatest ballplayer

52:32.383 --> 52:34.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of his lifetime was Willie Mays.

52:34.752 --> 52:39.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, on Sunday, Mays joined him
in the booth
for his final game between the
Dodgers and

52:39.523 --> 52:41.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their rivals, the Giants.

52:41.592 --> 52:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

to his fans.

VIN SCULLY: You and I have been
friends for
a long time, but I know in my
heart that I

52:46.130 --> 52:47.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have always needed you more than
you have
ever needed me.

52:47.464 --> 52:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I will miss our time
together more than
I can say.

52:48.899 --> 52:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you know what?

52:50.034 --> 52:51.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There will be a new day and
eventually a new
year.

52:51.835 --> 52:52.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when the upcoming winter
gives way to
spring, oh, rest assured, once
again, it will

52:52.636 --> 52:54.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be time for Dodger baseball.

52:54.304 --> 52:55.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is Vin Scully, wishing
you a very
pleasant good afternoon,
wherever you may

52:55.039 --> 52:56.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.
