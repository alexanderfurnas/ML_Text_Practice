>> Announcer: ON THIS EDITION
FOR SATURDAY, JULY 5:

00:13.213 --> 00:15.015
THE CLASHES IN ISRAEL SPREAD--

00:15.082 --> 00:17.117
WE'LL HAVE THE LATEST FROM
JERUSALEM;

00:17.184 --> 00:19.786
FROM COLORADO,
HARI SREENIVASAN REPORTS

00:19.853 --> 00:22.222
FROM THE ASPEN IDEAS FESTIVAL;

00:22.289 --> 00:24.825
AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO
CAPTURED THE START

00:24.892 --> 00:26.627
OF THE GAY RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.796
NEXT, ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:29.863 --> 00:33.433
>> FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS
AT LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:33.500 --> 00:36.236
THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.371
>> Larson: GOOD EVENING.

00:37.437 --> 00:38.405
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.307
HARI SREENIVASAN IS ON
A REPORTING TRIP

00:40.374 --> 00:42.476
AND WILL APPEAR LATER
IN THE BROADCAST.

00:42.542 --> 00:46.113
WE BEGIN IN UKRAINE, WHERE
THE GOVERNMENT SAYS ITS FORCES

00:46.179 --> 00:49.616
HAVE SCORED A MAJOR VICTORY,
ROUTING PRO-RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS

00:49.683 --> 00:52.753
WHO LATER FLED THE CITY
OF SLOVYANSK.

00:52.819 --> 00:55.155
THE REBELS HAD SEIZED
ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDINGS

00:55.222 --> 00:57.925
AND POLICE STATIONS THERE
THREE MONTHS AGO.

00:57.991 --> 01:01.828
EARLIER THIS WEEK, UKRAINE'S NEW
PRESIDENT, PETRO POROSHENKO,

01:01.895 --> 01:04.531
RENOUNCED A CEASEFIRE
WITH THE REBELS.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.767
LATER, HARI SREENIVASAN'S
INTERVIEW

01:06.833 --> 01:09.202
WITH THE FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR
TO RUSSIA

01:09.269 --> 01:12.139
ABOUT THE CRISIS IN UKRAINE.

01:12.205 --> 01:15.509
FROM ISRAEL TONIGHT, PALESTINIAN
MILITANTS IN GAZA FIRED

01:15.575 --> 01:18.145
MORE ROCKETS TODAY INTO ISRAEL,

01:18.211 --> 01:22.182
AND ISRAELI WARPLANES RESPONDED
BY HITTING TARGETS IN GAZA.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.552
THIS AS THE FINDINGS OF A
PRELIMINARY AUTOPSY

01:25.619 --> 01:29.389
OF A PALESTINIAN TEENAGER KILLED
THIS WEEK CAME TO LIGHT.

01:29.456 --> 01:32.426
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED NOW FROM
JERUSALEM VIA SKYPE

01:32.492 --> 01:34.861
BY JOSEF FEDERMAN OF THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.930
JOE, THANKS FOR JOINING US.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.598
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING TO THE
FIRST NEWS

01:38.665 --> 01:40.600
OF THIS AUTOPSY THAT CAME OUT

01:40.667 --> 01:43.036
INVOLVING THE PALESTINIAN YOUTH
KILLED THERE THIS WEEK.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.238
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THAT?

01:45.305 --> 01:48.241
>> YEAH, WE RECEIVED THE INITIAL
RESULTS OF THE AUTOPSY,

01:48.308 --> 01:51.178
AND THEY'RE PRETTY DISTURBING.

01:51.244 --> 01:54.314
THE SIGNS ARE THAT THIS BOY
WAS BURNED ALIVE.

01:54.381 --> 01:58.585
THEY FOUND SIGNS HE ACTUALLY
INHALED SMOKE BEFORE HE DIED.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.020
>> Larson: AND WHERE IS THE
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

02:00.087 --> 02:01.355
INTO HIS DEATH?

02:01.421 --> 02:02.856
DO WE KNOW WHO DID THIS YET?

02:02.923 --> 02:07.527
>> WE DON'T. THE ASSUMPTION, AT
LEAST ON THE PALESTINIAN SIDE,

02:07.594 --> 02:10.897
IS THAT ISRAELI EXTREMISTS DID
THIS IN A REVENGE ATTACK

02:10.964 --> 02:13.900
FOLLOWING THE DEATHS OF THREE
ISRAELI TEENAGERS

02:13.967 --> 02:16.636
FOUND EARLIER THIS WEEK.

02:16.703 --> 02:20.474
ISRAEL HAS PUT, YOU KNOW,
MAXIMUM EFFORT INTO THE SEARCH

02:20.540 --> 02:23.377
FOR THE KILLERS, BUT THEY STILL
DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE

02:23.443 --> 02:25.846
AND THEY STILL DON'T HAVE
A FIRM MOTIVE.

02:25.912 --> 02:27.814
THEY SAY THEY ARE EXPLORING
ALL POSSIBILITIES,

02:27.881 --> 02:30.517
INCLUDING NATIONALISTIC MOTIVES,

02:30.584 --> 02:32.753
BUT ALSO THE POSSIBILITY
OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY

02:32.819 --> 02:34.254
OR SOME SORT OF FAMILY FEUD.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.223
IT'S REALLY TOO SOON TO SAY.

02:36.289 --> 02:38.658
>> Larson: JOE, I KNOW
PERSONALLY YOU'VE BEEN REPORTING

02:38.725 --> 02:41.061
OUT OF THE REGION FOR MORE
THAN A DECADE NOW.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.963
WHAT DO THE EVENTS OF THE LAST
COUPLE OF WEEKS

02:43.030 --> 02:45.966
SEEM TO YOU LIKE?

02:46.033 --> 02:47.567
>> YES, I FEEL LIKE WE'VE
ENTERED

02:47.634 --> 02:48.869
SOME UNCHARTERED WATERS HERE.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.071
I'VE SEEN THINGS THAT I'VE NEVER
SEEN BEFORE IN A DECADE

02:51.138 --> 02:52.806
OF COVERING THIS STORY.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.475
IT BEGAN WITH THE KIDNAPPINGS
OF THREE ISRAELI TEENAGERS

02:55.542 --> 02:56.877
THREE WEEKS AGO.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.812
THAT'S WHAT SET OFF THIS CURRENT
ROUND OF TENSIONS

02:58.879 --> 03:00.847
WHERE YOU HAVE THREE CIVILIANS,

03:00.914 --> 03:05.252
UNDERAGE TEENAGERS BEING
TARGETED, ABDUCTED AND KILLED.

03:05.318 --> 03:08.055
THAT WAS SORT OF THE LEVEL
OF CRUELTY,

03:08.121 --> 03:10.557
THE TYPE OF ATTACK,
THAT HASN’T BEEN SEEN BEFORE.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.260
THE REACTION IN ISRAEL ALSO WAS
SOMETHING I HAVEN'T SEEN

03:13.326 --> 03:16.930
WHERE YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OUTSIDE
OF MY OFFICE THE FOLLOWING DAY,

03:16.997 --> 03:19.066
WHEN THE BOYS WERE BEING BURIED,

03:19.132 --> 03:21.234
HUNDREDS OF RIGHT-WING YOUNG
ISRAELIS MARCH

03:21.301 --> 03:24.304
THROUGH DOWNTOWN JERUSALEM,
CALLING FOR REVENGE,

03:24.371 --> 03:27.274
SCREAMING "DEATH TO ARABS"
AND SO FORTH.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.209
IT WAS A CHILLING SIGHT TO SEE.

03:29.276 --> 03:30.877
AND THEN, A FEW HOURS LATER,

03:30.944 --> 03:33.080
THIS BOY IS ABDUCTED
IN EAST JERUSALEM.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.949
A PALESTINIAN BOY IS ABDUCTED,
AND HIS CHARRED BODY IS FOUND

03:36.016 --> 03:38.185
IN THE FOREST JUST
A FEW HOURS LATER.

03:38.251 --> 03:41.388
NOW, WE'RE NOT SURE WHO DID IT,
BUT THE TIMING, THE MOTIVE,

03:41.455 --> 03:44.691
THE ATMOSPHERE AT LEAST POINTS
IN THAT DIRECTION

03:44.758 --> 03:46.426
AS A STRONG POSSIBILITY.

03:46.493 --> 03:47.794
>> Larson: YOU ALSO HAVE TOLD ME
EARLIER

03:47.861 --> 03:50.130
IN A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION
THAT YOU SAW THE MOTHER

03:50.197 --> 03:54.334
OF ONE OF THE ISRAELIS KILLED
SPEAK OUT.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.003
>> YES, SHE ISSUED A STATEMENT.
THE FAMILY ISSUED A STATEMENT--

03:57.070 --> 03:59.172
AND THIS IS SORT OF A GLIMMER
OF HOPE, I GUESS--

03:59.239 --> 04:02.275
SAYING AFTER THE PALESTINIAN BOY
WAS FOUND BURNED TO DEATH,

04:02.342 --> 04:04.778
SHE PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING,
"MURDER IS WRONG.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.279
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU ARE
JEWISH,

04:06.346 --> 04:09.082
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU ARE
ARAB, MURDER IS MURDER."

04:09.149 --> 04:13.253
AND HOPEFULLY A VOICE LIKE THAT
CAN SORT OF CALM TENSIONS DOWN

04:13.320 --> 04:14.588
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.289
>> Larson: JOSEF FEDERMAN FROM
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,

04:16.356 --> 04:17.591
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

04:17.657 --> 04:20.260
>> THANK YOU.

04:20.327 --> 04:23.597
>> Larson: IN AFGHANISTAN,
200 TANKER TRUCKS CARRYING FUEL

04:23.663 --> 04:26.867
FOR NATO FORCES WERE SET ON FIRE
IN AN ATTACK

04:26.933 --> 04:29.169
NEAR THE CAPITAL CITY OF KABUL.

04:29.236 --> 04:32.005
TALIBAN MILITANTS CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY.

04:32.072 --> 04:35.108
FROM IRAQ TONIGHT, WORD OF THE
FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE

04:35.175 --> 04:39.312
BY THE MAN BEHIND THE RECENT
OFFENSIVE BY ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS

04:39.379 --> 04:42.916
WHO HAVE CAPTURED TOWNS IN
NORTHERN IRAQ AND WESTERN IRAQ,

04:42.983 --> 04:45.785
AND DECLARED A CALIPHATE,
OR ISLAMIC STATE.

04:45.852 --> 04:48.021
FOR MORE ABOUT THAT
AND THE COUNTEROFFENSIVE

04:48.088 --> 04:49.656
BY IRAQI GOVERNMENT FORCES,

04:49.723 --> 04:53.226
WE ARE JOINED NOW VIA SKYPE FROM
BAGHDAD BY MATTHEW BRADLEY

04:53.293 --> 04:54.928
OF THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL."

04:54.995 --> 04:56.263
MATT, THANKS FOR JOINING US.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.298
WHAT'S THE LATEST AT THIS HOUR?

04:58.365 --> 05:00.133
>> THE LATEST NEWS THAT'S COME
OUT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS

05:00.200 --> 05:04.404
IS THE APPEARANCE OF
THE ISLAMIC STATE LEADER,

05:04.471 --> 05:08.241
ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI, WHO MADE
HIS FIRST VIDEO APPEARANCE

05:08.308 --> 05:11.778
JUST TODAY, AND JUST IN THE LAST
COUPLE OF HOURS.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.147
AND THIS WAS A VIDEO THAT WAS
CIRCULATED ON SOCIAL MEDIA

05:14.214 --> 05:18.018
AND SUPPOSEDLY SHOWS ABU BAKR
AL-BAGHDADI GIVING

05:18.084 --> 05:21.454
WHAT IS CALLED A UKBA--
OR SORT OF LIKE A SERMON--

05:21.521 --> 05:28.528
TO A PRAYER GROUP, A MEETING OF
MUSLIMS IN A MOSQUE IN MOSUL,

05:28.595 --> 05:31.398
A NORTHERN CITY IN IRAQ
YESTERDAY.

05:31.464 --> 05:34.201
SO, THIS IS A VERY BIG DEAL
BECAUSE ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI,

05:34.267 --> 05:37.337
THERE'S ONLY TWO KNOWN PHOTOS
OF HIM AVAILABLE.

05:37.404 --> 05:40.941
HE'S A VERY NOTORIOUSLY ELUSIVE
CHARACTER.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.344
AND NOW WE'RE SEEING A LENGTHY
VIDEO SEQUENCE OF HIM

05:44.411 --> 05:46.112
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

05:46.179 --> 05:47.614
AND IT'S A VERY, VERY
INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.218
WE'RE NOW ACTUALLY ABLE TO PUT
A FACE TO A NAME

05:51.284 --> 05:57.257
OF A JIHADI LEADER WHO HAS
REALLY ECLIPSED AL QAEDA

05:57.324 --> 06:01.561
AND THE LEADER OF AL QAEDA IN
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS

06:01.628 --> 06:03.964
IN TERMS OF POWER AND IN TERMS
OF POPULARITY.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.632
>> Larson: YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE IN BAGHDAD.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.001
WHAT’S THE MOOD ON THE STREETS
RIGHT NOW IN BAGHDAD?

06:08.068 --> 06:11.972
HOW CLOSE ARE SORT OF THESE
FORCES TO BAGHDAD NOW?

06:12.038 --> 06:17.844
>> THESE FORCES ARE FORMING
SOMETHING OF A U-SHAPE,

06:17.911 --> 06:20.580
SORT OF A HORSESHOE SHAPE
AROUND BAGHDAD.

06:20.647 --> 06:24.251
THEY'RE QUITE CLOSE, ABOUT 100
MILES TO THE NORTH IN THE CITY

06:24.317 --> 06:25.652
OF TIKRIT.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.089
THEY'RE IN THE WEST,
THE CLOSEST CITY BEING FALLUJAH,

06:29.155 --> 06:30.724
WHICH THEY'VE HELD SINCE
JANUARY.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.760
AND THEY'RE QUITE CLOSE
TO BAGHDAD IN THE SOUTH,

06:33.827 --> 06:37.097
AND THERE HAVE BEEN CLASHES
THERE IN THE TOWN OF ABU GHRAIB.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.865
IF YOU REMEMBER,
ABU GHRAIB IS THE SITE

06:38.932 --> 06:42.469
OF THAT HUGE PENITENTIARY
WHERE THE U.S. FORCES

06:42.535 --> 06:46.239
WERE SEEN TORTURING PRISONERS
AND HARASSING PRISONERS.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.875
THAT PRISON HAS BEEN EVACUATED
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO

06:48.942 --> 06:51.911
JUST BECAUSE OF HOW CLOSE
THE MILITANTS WERE COMING.

06:51.978 --> 06:55.982
SO, THEY ARE REALLY PRETTY CLOSE
TO THE CITY.

06:56.049 --> 06:59.219
THE THING IS THAT BAGHDAD IS NOT
LIKE THE OTHER AREAS OF IRAQ

06:59.286 --> 07:02.622
THAT THE ISLAMIC STATE-- WHICH
WAS FORMERLY KNOWN AT ISIS--

07:02.689 --> 07:06.126
WAS ABLE TO TAKE BECAUSE BAGHDAD
IS QUITE

07:06.192 --> 07:09.195
A LARGE SHIITE POPULATION.

07:09.262 --> 07:13.466
AND IT'S NOT REALLY POSSIBLE
FOR THIS MILITIA

07:13.533 --> 07:16.369
TO MOVE IN QUITE AS EASILY INTO
BAGHDAD AS THEY DID IN MOSUL

07:16.436 --> 07:18.505
AND SOME OF THE CITIES
TO THE NORTH.

07:18.571 --> 07:21.174
>> Larson: MATT, WE UNDERSTAND
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME...

07:21.241 --> 07:23.710
SOME SUCCESSES BY GOVERNMENT
FORCES.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.879
WHAT'S THE REALITY,
AT LEAST THE WAY IT FEELS

07:25.945 --> 07:27.047
THERE IN THE STREETS?

07:27.113 --> 07:29.249
YOU KNOW, WILL GOVERNMENT FORCES
BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO

07:29.316 --> 07:32.786
ANY OF THESE MAJOR METROPOLITAN
AREAS THEY HAVE LOST?

07:32.852 --> 07:35.789
>> WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

07:35.855 --> 07:38.224
THE MILITARY HAS BEEN TRYING
TO TAKE TIKRIT,

07:38.291 --> 07:43.763
WHICH IS THE CITY THAT'S NEAR
THE BIRTHTOWN OF SADDAM HUSSEIN.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.699
AND THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT
FOR ABOUT A WEEK.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.601
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO PUSH
INTO THIS CITY.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.704
THERE HAVE BEEN LANDMINES THAT
HAVE BEEN REALLY FRUSTRATING

07:50.770 --> 07:52.439
THEIR APPROACH.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.474
SO, IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD
FOR THE IRAQI MILITARY.

07:54.541 --> 07:57.043
THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE ABLE
TO TAKE THE UPPER HAND

07:57.110 --> 08:01.915
AGAINST A MILITANT GROUP THAT
SHOULD BE MUCH LESS PREPARED,

08:01.981 --> 08:04.951
MUCH WORSE TRAINED
AND MUCH WORSE ARMED

08:05.018 --> 08:08.988
THAN THIS U.S.-TRAINED AND
U.S.-ARMED MILITARY.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.590
>> Larson: MATT BRADLEY
OF THE "WALL STREET JOURNAL,"

08:10.657 --> 08:13.159
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.794
>> THANK YOU.

08:14.861 --> 08:17.364
>> Larson: LATE TODAY, REUTERS
QUOTED THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT

08:17.430 --> 08:20.266
AS CALLING THE VIDEO
"A FABRICATION."

08:20.333 --> 08:22.502
THE GOVERNMENT CLAIMED ITS
TROOPS WOUNDED

08:22.569 --> 08:24.871
THE ISLAMIC LEADER
IN A BOMBING ATTACK

08:24.938 --> 08:27.607
AND THAT HE'S BEING TREATED
IN SYRIA.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.476
HURRICANE ARTHUR
HAS COME AND GONE,

08:29.542 --> 08:33.380
BUT NOT BEFORE FLOODING SOME
COASTAL AREAS IN MASSACHUSETTS.

08:33.446 --> 08:36.182
NEW BEDFORD, ABOUT 60 MILES
SOUTH OF BOSTON,

08:36.249 --> 08:39.586
RECEIVED AS MUCH
AS EIGHT INCHES OF RAIN.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.355
PORTIONS OF CAPE COD
WERE ALSO FLOODED.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.557
FROM HOUSTON,
REPORTS OF A NEAR COLLISION

08:44.624 --> 08:47.227
BETWEEN TWO PASSENGER PLANES
ON THURSDAY.

08:47.293 --> 08:52.232
THE F.A.A. SAYS A SINGAPORE
AIRLINE 777 JUMBO JET TAKING OFF

08:52.298 --> 08:56.269
FLEW DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO A
DELTA AIRLINES JET LANDING

08:56.336 --> 08:59.272
AT GEORGE BUSH INTERCONTINENTAL
AIRPORT.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.683
>> Larson:
THE F.A.A. SAYS THE PILOT

09:10.750 --> 09:13.653
OF THE SINGAPORE AIRLINES PLANE,
AFTER HIS INITIAL CLIMB,

09:13.720 --> 09:16.322
DID NOT LEVEL OFF AS REQUIRED.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.691
THE F.A.A. SAYS IT'S TAKING
ADDITIONAL STEPS

09:18.758 --> 09:22.429
TO ENSURE THAT ALL PILOTS
ARE AWARE OF THE RULES.

09:22.495 --> 09:25.565
CALIFORNIA'S LEADING CHICKEN
PRODUCER, FOSTER FARMS,

09:25.632 --> 09:29.736
IS RECALLING 170 DIFFERENT
CHICKEN PRODUCTS.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.905
THIS AFTER THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT LINKED CHICKEN

09:31.971 --> 09:34.808
PRODUCED BY THAT COMPANY
TO A SALMONELLA OUTBREAK

09:34.874 --> 09:38.378
THAT HAS SICKENED SOME
600 PEOPLE IN 27 STATES

09:38.445 --> 09:40.113
AND PUERTO RICO.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.683
THE COMPANY DISPUTES THAT ITS
CHICKEN LED TO THE ILLNESSES.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.819
IT SAYS IT HAS ISSUED THE RECALL

09:45.885 --> 09:49.222
IN "THE FULLEST INTEREST
OF FOOD SAFETY."

09:49.289 --> 09:53.026
ALSO IN CALIFORNIA, THE HIGHWAY
PATROL SAYS IT IS INVESTIGATING

09:53.092 --> 09:56.262
A GRAPHIC VIDEO THAT SHOWS
AN OFFICER STRADDLING

09:56.329 --> 10:00.366
AND REPEATEDLY PUNCHING A WOMAN
ON THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.736
THE VIDEO WAS CAPTURED BY A
PASSING MOTORIST ON TUESDAY.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.172
HE LATER DISTRIBUTED IT
TO THE MEDIA.

10:06.239 --> 10:09.175
A HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICIAL SAID
YESTERDAY THAT THE OFFICER

10:09.242 --> 10:11.978
INVOLVED HAS BEEN PLACED ON
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.781
HE SAID THE OFFICER WAS TRYING
TO RESTRAIN THE WOMAN

10:14.848 --> 10:17.817
WHO HAD BEEN WALKING
ON THE FREEWAY.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.195
AS WE SAID,
HARI SREENIVASAN HAS BEEN

10:29.262 --> 10:31.397
AT THE ASPEN IDEAS FESTIVAL.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.200
HE INTERVIEWED THE FORMER
AMERICAN AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA,

10:34.267 --> 10:35.702
MICHAEL McFAUL.

10:35.768 --> 10:38.471
THEIR CONVERSATION FOCUSED ON
THE CRISIS IN UKRAINE

10:38.538 --> 10:43.209
AND ITS IMPACT ON U.S./RUSSIAN
RELATIONS.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.744
>> Sreenivasan: FOR SOMEONE
WATCHING RIGHT NOW,

10:44.811 --> 10:47.213
WHAT’S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND
THERE?

10:47.280 --> 10:52.318
WE ARE SEEING THESE PUSHES FROM
THE UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT

10:52.385 --> 10:54.420
TO TRY TO QUELL THE UNREST.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.389
WE SAW A CEASEFIRE,
AND NOW WE ARE SEEING

10:56.456 --> 10:57.924
THE END OF THAT CEASEFIRE.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.360
WHAT IS PRESIDENT POROSHENKO
TRYING TO DO?

11:00.426 --> 11:04.764
>> WELL, THE FIRST THING THAT'S
HAPPENING THERE IS A GIANT

11:04.831 --> 11:06.599
AND NEEDLESS TRAGEDY.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.901
AND I WANT TO START WITH THAT

11:07.967 --> 11:12.639
BECAUSE WE SOMETIMES QUICKLY GET
IN, WE TALK ABOUT THE CONFLICT

11:12.705 --> 11:14.707
AND KIND OF RATING THE CONFLICT.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.310
THIS IS ONE WITH THAT DIDN'T
NEED TO HAPPEN.

11:17.377 --> 11:21.314
ETHNIC UKRAINIANS AND ETHNIC
RUSSIANS HAVE LIVED SIDE BY SIDE

11:21.381 --> 11:22.815
FOR A LONG TIME.

11:22.882 --> 11:26.619
THIS WAS ALL FABRICATED BY BAD
LEADERSHIP AND BAD DECISIONS.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.955
AND NOW YOU HAVE HUNDREDS
OF PEOPLE DYING IN A PLACE

11:29.022 --> 11:31.758
THAT HAD BEEN PEACEFUL
FOR A LONG TIME.

11:31.824 --> 11:35.094
AND THAT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME
AS SOMEBODY WHO WORKED ON

11:35.161 --> 11:37.196
THE EFFORT TO TRY TO MAKE
RELATIONS WITH UKRAINE

11:37.263 --> 11:39.332
AND RUSSIA BETTER
WITH THE UNITED STATES.

11:39.399 --> 11:42.635
BUT WHERE WE'RE AT NOW,
POROSHENKO ALSO IS FRUSTRATED.

11:42.702 --> 11:47.206
HE HAD AN OVERTURE,
A CEASEFIRE PLAN.

11:47.273 --> 11:50.543
HE THEN CALLED FOR A CEASEFIRE,
AND HE DIDN'T GET THE RESPONSE

11:50.610 --> 11:52.979
HE WANTED.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.015
MAYBE EXTERNALLY THE RESPONSE
WAS BETTER THAN THE ONE

11:56.082 --> 11:59.852
FROM THE REBELS OR TERRORISTS
INSIDE UKRAINE,

11:59.919 --> 12:02.155
AND SO NOW HE'S DECIDED TO GO
AFTER THEM

12:02.221 --> 12:03.556
AND WE'LL SEE WHERE IT ENDS.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.224
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT
RUSSIA'S SUPPORT

12:05.291 --> 12:06.893
FOR THESE REBELS OR TERRORISTS?

12:06.960 --> 12:10.897
THE STEADY STREAM OF PEOPLE THAT
ARE COMING FROM RUSSIA

12:10.964 --> 12:14.400
INTO THESE PARTS OF THE UKRAINE
AND OBVIOUSLY MILITARY SUPPORT

12:14.467 --> 12:17.070
IN THE WAY OF AMMUNITION
OR SOME OF THE WEAPONS

12:17.136 --> 12:18.338
THAT ARE COMING IN?

12:18.404 --> 12:19.973
>> YOU DON'T HAVE THIS
INSURGENCY

12:20.039 --> 12:21.541
WITHOUT RUSSIAN SUPPORT.

12:21.608 --> 12:22.842
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THEY CONTROL THEM,

12:22.909 --> 12:24.177
DOESN'T MEAN PUTIN IS
ON THE PHONE EVERY DAY

12:24.243 --> 12:25.878
TALKING TO THE COMMANDERS.

12:25.945 --> 12:27.981
IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF CONTROL.

12:28.047 --> 12:33.987
BUT PARTICULARLY THE OPEN BORDER
AND THE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THEM,

12:34.053 --> 12:35.622
AS WELL AS THE MILITARY
ASSISTANCE,

12:35.688 --> 12:39.859
THE HARDWARE, THOSE THREE
COMPONENTS ARE THERE.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.728
AND IF PUTIN WANTED TO SHUT IT
DOWN,

12:41.794 --> 12:44.731
HE COULD BY DISRUPTING THOSE
THREE COMPONENTS.

12:44.797 --> 12:46.132
>> Sreenivasan:
ARE WE MISUNDERSTANDING

12:46.199 --> 12:48.768
PRESIDENT PUTIN’S MOTIVATIONS?

12:48.835 --> 12:51.671
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE'S THIS
IDEA THAT CRIMEA

12:51.738 --> 12:54.874
WAS THE FIRST AND THEN THERE ARE
GOING TO BE PARTS OF UKRAINE

12:54.941 --> 12:57.343
AND HE WANTS TO KIND OF
RECAPTURE THE GLORY DAYS

12:57.410 --> 12:58.845
OF THE RUSSIAN EMPIRE.

12:58.911 --> 13:00.680
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

13:00.747 --> 13:03.983
I DO NOT THINK THAT THIS IS
THE SECOND PHASE

13:04.050 --> 13:05.652
OF A GRAND STRATEGY.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.987
I DO BELIEVE HE WENT INTO CRIMEA

13:08.054 --> 13:10.790
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT FELL
IN KIEV.

13:10.857 --> 13:12.291
HE WAS PISSED OFF.

13:12.358 --> 13:14.027
IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL,
TACTICAL MOVE,

13:14.093 --> 13:18.431
AND HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF A
WEAKNESS IN KIEV TO DO THAT.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.134
AND THEN HE EXPERIMENTED IN
EASTERN UKRAINE, RIGHT?

13:21.200 --> 13:22.635
SO HE DIDN'T TRY TO STOP IT.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.103
HE WANTED TO SEE WHERE IT WENT.

13:24.170 --> 13:28.174
HE GAVE THEM SOME PUBLIC SUPPORT
FOR A TIME.

13:28.241 --> 13:31.544
BUT NOW I SEE HIM AS DECIDING
THIS IS NOT GOING TO LEAD

13:31.611 --> 13:36.015
TO POPULAR UPRISING IN EASTERN
UKRAINE TO JOIN RUSSIA,

13:36.082 --> 13:41.120
AND SO HE'S LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM THOSE

13:41.187 --> 13:42.555
THAT ARE FIGHTING ON THE GROUND.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.358
AND, BY THE WAY, YOU SEE IT
WITH THEIR OWN STATEMENTS

13:45.425 --> 13:47.093
FROM TIME TO TIME OF FRUSTRATION

13:47.160 --> 13:49.128
THAT PUTIN IS NOT DOING
MORE FOR THEM.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.197
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT ARE THE
OPTIONS FOR THE UNITED STATES

13:51.264 --> 13:55.535
WHEN IT COMES TO THE UKRAINE
AND WHEN IT COMES TO RUSSIA?

13:55.601 --> 13:59.839
>> THE BIGGEST, OBVIOUS POINT,
YOU KNOW, THE FORK IN THE ROAD

13:59.906 --> 14:03.042
FOR UKRAINE IS TO END
THE VIOLENCE.

14:03.109 --> 14:07.080
IF POROSHENKO OR SOME
CONFIGURATION

14:07.146 --> 14:09.649
OF INTERNATIONAL LEADERS HELPED
END THE VIOLENCE,

14:09.716 --> 14:12.385
THEN UKRAINE HAS A CHANCE
AS A STATE, AS AN ECONOMY,

14:12.452 --> 14:14.320
AS A DEMOCRACY.

14:14.387 --> 14:18.524
AND THAT SHOULD THE FIRST
AND FOREMOST OBJECTIVE

14:18.591 --> 14:20.727
IS TO HELP STABILIZE THE ECONOMY

14:20.793 --> 14:23.830
AND TO MAKE THAT DEMOCRACY
FUNCTION.

14:23.896 --> 14:27.800
THAT'S THE WAY YOU DETER FURTHER
AGGRESSION AND FURTHER PROBLEMS

14:27.867 --> 14:29.936
IN UKRAINE LOOKING FORWARD.

14:30.002 --> 14:33.372
BUT A PRECONDITION TO MAKE THAT
HAPPEN IS TO END THE VIOLENCE

14:33.439 --> 14:34.774
IN EASTERN UKRAINE.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.310
>> Sreenivasan: DOES THE STANCE
THE AMERICA TAKES ON UKRAINE

14:37.376 --> 14:40.646
HAVE RIPPLE EFFECTS IN OTHER
PARTS OF FOREIGN POLICY

14:40.713 --> 14:42.882
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES
AND RUSSIA?

14:42.949 --> 14:48.621
>> YES, I THINK IT DOES,
PARTICULARLY IN THE WAY

14:48.688 --> 14:55.061
THAT PUTIN NOW VIEWS US AS THIS
SINISTER AGENT TRYING TO DETER

14:55.128 --> 14:57.964
AND CONTAIN AND CONFRONT RUSSIA.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.432
THAT'S THE WAY
HE THINKS ABOUT IT.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.101
HE SAYS THIS PUBLICLY,
VERY VOCALLY.

15:02.168 --> 15:06.506
AND THEREFORE IF YOU NEED TRUST
FOR COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA,

15:06.572 --> 15:08.841
THEN YOU ARE NOT GOING
TO HAVE IT.

15:08.908 --> 15:12.278
I THINK PERSONALLY TRUST IS
OVERRATED IN DIPLOMACY,

15:12.345 --> 15:13.379
IN GENERAL.

15:13.446 --> 15:14.847
I THINK PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT
A LOT

15:14.914 --> 15:16.015
AND IN FACT I DIDN'T SEE
A LOT OF IT

15:16.082 --> 15:17.517
WHEN I WAS IN THE GOVERNMENT.

15:17.583 --> 15:21.220
BUT MOST CERTAINLY IF THAT IS
A REQUIREMENT FOR COOPERATION

15:21.287 --> 15:23.890
ON ISSUE X, Y OR Z,
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THAT

15:23.956 --> 15:26.025
AS PART OF THE EQUATION.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.760
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
WE CAN DO

15:27.827 --> 15:29.395
THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE TRUST,

15:29.462 --> 15:32.832
THAT JUST REQUIRES OUR INTERESTS
TO BE IN ALIGNMENT.

15:32.899 --> 15:37.603
>> Sreenivasan: AND SO HOW DOES
THE UNITED STATES MAKE THE CASE

15:37.670 --> 15:42.608
FOR ALIGNING OUR INTERESTS WHEN
IT COMES TO UKRAINE?

15:42.675 --> 15:45.945
>> WELL, I WOULD JUST GO BACK
TO THE ARGUMENT WE MADE

15:46.012 --> 15:49.148
WHEN I WAS STILL IN GOVERNMENT,
WHICH WAS BEFORE THE VIOLENCE,

15:49.215 --> 15:51.918
WHERE WE SAID TO PUTIN AND TO
THE REST OF HIS GOVERNMENT,

15:51.984 --> 15:55.421
LOOK, WE DO NOT SEE THIS IN
ZERO-SUM SOME TERMS, RIGHT?

15:55.488 --> 15:58.291
THIS IS NOT A GAME OF, IS
UKRAINE GOING TO BE IN THE WEST

15:58.357 --> 15:59.659
OR THE EAST?

15:59.725 --> 16:04.330
WE THINK THAT A PROSPEROUS
UKRAINE IS GOOD FOR RUSSIA

16:04.397 --> 16:07.333
AND GOOD FOR EUROPE AND GOOD FOR
THE UNITED STATES, BY THE WAY.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.703
AND I, IN MY NEGOTIATIONS WHEN
WE WOULD TALK ABOUT THIS

16:10.770 --> 16:12.138
WHEN I WAS STILL AN AMBASSADOR,

16:12.205 --> 16:15.208
I WOULD SAY WE HAVE TRADED
ARRANGEMENTS

16:15.274 --> 16:18.945
WITH ALL KINDS OF COUNTRIES, AND
AS LONG AS THEY ARE CONSISTENT

16:19.011 --> 16:23.716
WITH EACH OTHER, THEY CAN BE
MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.152
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S NOT
THE WAY PUTIN SAW

16:26.219 --> 16:28.354
THAT PARTICULAR SET OF EVENTS.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.223
>> Sreenivasan: MICHAEL McFAUL,
THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

16:30.289 --> 16:32.491
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.101
>> Larson:
FROM SAN FRANCISCO TONIGHT,

16:42.168 --> 16:44.737
A REPORT ABOUT PHOTOGRAPHER
ANTHONY FRIEDKIN

16:44.804 --> 16:47.907
AND A NEW EXHIBIT OF HIS WORK
THAT WAS MORE THAN 40 YEARS

16:47.974 --> 16:49.275
IN THE MAKING.

16:49.342 --> 16:53.246
IN IT, HE CAPTURES LIFE AMONG
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE LATE 1960s

16:53.312 --> 16:56.082
AND EARLY 1970s,
AND HE DOCUMENTS THE BIRTH

16:56.148 --> 16:57.817
OF THE GAY RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

16:57.884 --> 17:02.889
SCOTT SCHAEFER OF KQED NEWSROOM
REPORTS.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.157
>> DON!
(LAUGHTER)

17:05.224 --> 17:07.159
>> WHAT A DELIGHT!

17:07.226 --> 17:09.228
>> Reporter: IN WEST HOLLYWOOD,
TWO OLD FRIENDS,

17:09.295 --> 17:12.932
DON KILHEFNER AND ANTHONY
FRIEDKIN, REUNITE.

17:12.999 --> 17:17.069
>> I EVEN HAVE THE CAMERA
THAT I SHOT ALL THE PHOTOS WITH.

17:17.136 --> 17:20.840
THIS WAS THE CAMERA, THIS BABY
WAS THE ONE THAT DID IT ALL.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.742
>> Reporter: THE CAMERA THAT SET
THEM ON A JOURNEY TOGETHER

17:22.808 --> 17:26.545
DECADES AGO, ALL GATHERED THIS
NIGHT IN HONOR OF KILHEFNER

17:26.612 --> 17:29.148
AND OTHER PIONEERING GAY RIGHTS
ACTIVISTS.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.983
(APPLAUSE)

17:31.050 --> 17:33.452
PLACED AT THE CENTER OF THE
MURAL ARE DON KILHEFNER

17:33.519 --> 17:36.088
WITH MORRIS KIGHT, FOUNDERS OF
THE GAY LIBERATIONS FRONT

17:36.155 --> 17:37.590
IN LOS ANGELES,

17:37.657 --> 17:39.859
A PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN BY FRIEDKIN
AT THE DAWN

17:39.926 --> 17:42.295
OF THE GAY LIBERATION MOVEMENT.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.496
IT WAS 1969.

17:43.562 --> 17:46.465
A SOCIETAL SHIFT
WAS TAKING PLACE.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.467
>> IT WAS REALLY
ABOUT SAYING NO,

17:48.534 --> 17:50.536
WE WON'T ACCEPT THIS ANYMORE.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.971
>> Reporter:
IN CITIES ACROSS AMERICA

17:52.038 --> 17:53.739
GAY PEOPLE WERE FIGHTING BACK,

17:53.806 --> 17:57.443
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T LOST ON
19-YEAR-OLD ANTHONY FRIEDKIN.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.645
>> THERE'S SOMETHING THAT IS
REFERRED TO

17:59.712 --> 18:01.681
AS THE CONCERNED PHOTOGRAPHER.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.250
AND THE IDEA IS THAT YOU
CELEBRATE HUMANITY

18:04.317 --> 18:08.154
FOR ITS GOOD THINGS, BUT YOU
ALSO IDENTIFY THE THINGS

18:08.220 --> 18:11.157
THAT NEED TO BE REEVALUATED
AND CHANGED.

18:11.223 --> 18:13.859
>> Reporter: WHAT FRIEDKIN SAW
NEEDING CHANGE WAS ATTITUDES

18:13.926 --> 18:15.761
TOWARD HOMOSEXUALITY.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.130
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS HORRIBLE THE
WAY GAY PEOPLE WERE TREATED

18:18.197 --> 18:19.665
BY OUR SOCIETY.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.400
IT MADE ME ANGRY.

18:21.467 --> 18:23.269
>> Reporter: FRIEDKIN GREW UP
IN LOS ANGELES.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.004
>> HIS FATHER WAS A SCREEN
WRITER,

18:25.071 --> 18:27.273
HIS MOTHER WAS A DANCER-
CHOREOGRAPHER.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.542
THEY HAD TONS OF FRIENDS
WHO WERE GAY.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.078
HE HAD BEEN AROUND GAY PEOPLE
ALL OF HIS LIFE,

18:32.144 --> 18:33.946
SO IT DIDN'T SEEM STRANGE
TO HIM.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.616
>> THEY EXPRESSED THEMSELVES
IN A FREE WAY WITH LOVE

18:36.682 --> 18:39.618
AND AFFECTION AND HUMOR, SO, YOU
KNOW,

18:39.685 --> 18:41.721
I WANTED TO TRY TO RECORD THAT,

18:41.787 --> 18:44.190
YOU KNOW, JUST OUT OF THE
DIGNITY THAT I THOUGHT

18:44.256 --> 18:46.459
THEY DESERVED THAT MANY PEOPLE
WOULDN'T GIVE THEM.

18:46.525 --> 18:48.561
>> Reporter: SO FRIEDKIN SOUGHT
OUT KIGHT AND KILHEFNER,

18:48.627 --> 18:51.263
WHO HAD JUST FOUNDED THE GAY
COMMUNITY SERVICES CENTER

18:51.330 --> 18:52.665
IN LOS ANGELES.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.166
THEY GAVE HIM ACCESS TO A WORLD

18:54.233 --> 18:56.736
THAT WAS JUST EMERGING
FROM THE SHADOWS.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.237
>> HE COMES ACROSS AS REAL.

18:58.304 --> 19:02.274
AND AT THAT TIME AS A YOUNG MAN,
HE WAS ON FIRE.

19:02.341 --> 19:04.744
HE WAS ON FIRE WITH CREATIVITY.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.946
HE SAW THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE
DIDN'T SEE.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.748
>> Reporter: FRIEDKIN DEDICATED
TWO YEARS,

19:08.814 --> 19:12.151
CAPTURING AND PRINTING THE MOST
POWERFUL IMAGES POSSIBLE.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.820
>> IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL
AT THAT TIME FOR CARS

19:14.887 --> 19:18.891
WITH FOUR OR FIVE YOUNG PEOPLE
IN IT WITH BASEBALL BATS

19:18.958 --> 19:22.828
TO STOP A GAY PERSON ON THE
STREET AND BEAT THEM SENSELESS.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.765
SO, IT WAS DANGEROUS EVEN
ASSOCIATING WITH GAY PEOPLE

19:25.831 --> 19:27.199
AT THAT TIME.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.136
WHAT TONY DID WAS, HE VENTURED
INTO THIS DANGEROUS SPACE

19:30.202 --> 19:32.004
AND HE TOOK HIS PHOTOGRAPHS.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.839
>> Reporter: BUT THE PHOTOGRAPHS
WERE AHEAD OF THEIR TIME,

19:33.906 --> 19:38.144
AND MOST GALLERIES WOULDN'T SHOW
THEM UNTIL NOW.

19:38.210 --> 19:41.647
THE CULMINATION OF FRIEDKIN'S
VISION TOOK 45 YEARS,

19:41.714 --> 19:43.749
BUT IT'S NOW BEING REALIZED AT
THE DE YOUNG MUSEUM

19:43.816 --> 19:45.651
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.787
THE EXHIBIT TITLED
"THE GAY ESSAY"

19:47.853 --> 19:51.290
IS UNDER THE DIRECTION OF CHIEF
PHOTOGRAPHY CURATOR JULIAN COX.

19:51.357 --> 19:52.792
>> JULIAN, THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC.

19:52.858 --> 19:56.796
OH, MY GOD! OH, WOW!

19:56.862 --> 19:58.864
THIS GUY CAN PLAY,
LIKE, A HALFBACK.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.767
THERE'S SO MUCH OF
"THE GAY ESSAY" IN HIS SPIRIT.

20:01.834 --> 20:05.171
>> ANTHONY'S WHOLE APPROACH TO
WHAT HE DOES IS VERY IMMERSIVE.

20:05.237 --> 20:07.573
HE REALLY BELIEVED
THAT TO MAKE GOOD WORK,

20:07.640 --> 20:11.510
YOU HAD TO BE DEEPLY CONNECTED
TO YOUR SUBJECT.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.747
>> I REALLY BELIEVED
THAT THE PRINT

20:14.814 --> 20:18.317
IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART
THE ART FORM OF PHOTOGRAPHY.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.820
JIM WAS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY
YOUNG MAN, YOU KNOW.

20:20.886 --> 20:25.057
HE WAS CHICANO, AND HE LIVED IN
A HARDCORE, GANG-INFESTED AREA.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.960
AND TO BE GAY IN THAT KIND OF A
COMMUNITY AND TO COME OUT OPENLY

20:28.027 --> 20:29.995
THAT WAY AND WALK AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD...

20:30.062 --> 20:32.465
>> Reporter: WHAT DO YOU SEE IN
THOSE EYES?

20:32.531 --> 20:37.236
>> THERE'S A CURIOSITY IN HIS
EYES ABOUT WHAT HIS FUTURE

20:37.303 --> 20:41.073
MIGHT BE LIKE, WHAT THE PATH
THAT HE HAS CHOSEN TO GO DOWN.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.541
>> Reporter: AND THIS IS TROY
PERRY HERE, RIGHT?

20:42.608 --> 20:43.776
>> YES.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.144
>> Reporter: HE FOUNDED THE
METROPOLITAN COMMUNITY CHURCH,

20:45.211 --> 20:46.512
RIGHT?

20:46.579 --> 20:47.780
>> CORRECT.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.014
THIS WAS A VERY DARK,
TRAGIC DAY.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.716
THIS CHURCH WAS BURNT DOWN.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.885
LOOK IN HIS EYES, HE'S DEFIANT.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.887
HE'S SAYING, YOU KNOW,
"I'M HERE TO TAKE YOU ON."

20:58.124 --> 21:00.092
>> IT WAS THAT NEW GAY
LIBERATION SPIRIT.

21:00.159 --> 21:02.061
WE WERE DEMANDING IT.

21:02.128 --> 21:05.898
YOU TAKE YOUR FREEDOM, AND IT
WAS THAT AUDACIOUS ATTITUDE

21:05.965 --> 21:10.903
THAT WAS THE CLIMATE OF THE
TIMES, AND TONY CAUGHT THAT.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.806
>> Reporter: IMAGES ALSO NOW
CAPTURED FOR ALL-TIME IN A BOOK

21:13.873 --> 21:17.009
JUST PUBLISHED BY YALE
UNIVERSITY PRESS.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.477
>> OH, THAT IS GREAT.

21:18.544 --> 21:20.846
OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THOSE
TWO CHARACTERS.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.681
HE HUMANIZES.

21:22.748 --> 21:25.484
WHEN I WAS LOOKING AGAIN AT THE
PHOTOGRAPH OF MORRIS KIGHT

21:25.551 --> 21:28.387
AND MYSELF,
A TEAR CAME TO MY EYE.

21:28.454 --> 21:32.358
THOSE WERE VERY DIFFICULT DAYS
FOR GAY PEOPLE.

21:32.424 --> 21:39.431
THE AMOUNT OF OPPRESSION THAT WE
FACED EVERYWHERE WAS TREMENDOUS.

21:39.498 --> 21:43.369
>> THIS CAMERA HAS SO MANY OF
THOSE PRIVATE, SPECIAL MOMENTS

21:43.435 --> 21:45.371
THAT IT WAS A WITNESS TO.

21:45.437 --> 21:46.872
IF ANYTHING HAPPENED
TO THIS CAMERA, GOD,

21:46.939 --> 21:48.140
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.642
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.644
>> Reporter: STILL A PURIST
SHOOTING BLACK AND WHITE FILM

21:51.710 --> 21:54.046
WITH HIS LEICA, STILL COMMITTED
TO CAPTURING

21:54.113 --> 21:57.750
THAT DECISIVE MOMENT,
AND STILL PUSHING THE LIMITS.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.553
>> I THINK THE RISK THAT WE TAKE
AS ARTISTS IS CRITICAL

22:00.619 --> 22:03.923
TO OUR ABILITY TO DO INTERESTING
WORK,

22:03.989 --> 22:07.159
AND HOW MUCH RISK
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE.

22:10.596 --> 22:15.234
>> Announcer: THIS IS PBS
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND, SATURDAY.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.306
>> Larson: NOW, A VISIT TO ONE
OF THE WORLD'S ONLY

22:20.372 --> 22:23.976
UNDERWATER LABS, WHERE SIX
SCIENTISTS RECENTLY SPENT

22:24.043 --> 22:27.146
A MONTH OFF KEY LARGO IN FLORIDA
STUDYING THE EFFECTS

22:27.213 --> 22:29.815
OF CLIMATE CHANGE
ON CORRAL REEFS.

22:29.882 --> 22:33.419
HARI SREENIVASAN SPOKE TO THE
MISSION LEADER, FABIEN COUSTEAU,

22:33.485 --> 22:37.356
GRANDSON OF JACQUES COUSTEAU.

22:37.423 --> 22:40.526
>> WELCOME TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE SEA.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.562
WE’RE AT 63 FEET IN DEPTH.

22:43.629 --> 22:44.897
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

22:44.964 --> 22:50.002
VERY SIMPLY BECAUSE IT GIVES US
THE LUXURY OF TIME.

22:50.069 --> 22:52.705
WE'RE ABLE TO GO OUT INTO THIS
FINAL FRONTIER

22:52.771 --> 22:59.345
ON OUR LIVING PLANET TO EXPLORE
UNADULTERATED AND UNLIMITED

22:59.411 --> 23:03.916
BY TIME, WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING
ONE CAN SAY WHEN DIVING DOWN

23:03.983 --> 23:05.251
FROM A BOAT.

23:05.317 --> 23:06.752
>> Sreenivasan: TELL US A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT WHAT IT IS

23:06.819 --> 23:08.153
THAT YOU'RE DOING WHEN YOU'RE
OUT THERE

23:08.220 --> 23:10.022
SIX TO EIGHT HOURS A DAY.

23:10.089 --> 23:12.891
>> WELL, WE HAVE A WET LAB,
WHICH YOU HAVE IN THAT PHOTO

23:12.958 --> 23:16.328
RIGHT THERE, AND AS WELL AS A
DRY LAB INSIDE THE HABITAT.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.565
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ARE ISSUES
WITH CLIMATE CHANGE,

23:19.632 --> 23:22.268
OR MORE SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO
CLIMATE CHANGE

23:22.334 --> 23:26.672
AND ACIDIFICATION LEVELS AS WELL
AS POLLUTION.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.407
SO, WE'RE LOOKING
AT THE BASELINE

23:28.474 --> 23:33.112
OF THESE UNDERWATER CITIES THAT
BASICALLY DICTATES EVERYTHING

23:33.178 --> 23:36.782
THAT LIVES IN AND AROUND THESE
CORAL CITIES.

23:36.849 --> 23:37.950
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE
ANYTHING COOL THAT YOU'VE SEEN

23:38.017 --> 23:39.251
SINCE WHILE YOU'RE DOWN THERE?

23:39.318 --> 23:40.886
>> IT'S JUST AMAZING.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.489
I'VE SEEN SO MUCH NEW BEHAVIOR
THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE:

23:43.555 --> 23:46.025
FISH SLEEPING IN SPONGES;

23:46.091 --> 23:49.862
A GOLIATH GROUPER ATTACKING
A BARRACUDA--

23:49.928 --> 23:51.997
NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.166
I DON'T THINK ANYONE HAS EVER
CAUGHT IT ON FILM BEFORE.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.835
I MEAN, IT’S JUST...
IT'S SCIENCE FICTION.

23:56.902 --> 23:59.071
IT'S JUST REALLY AMAZING
DOWN HERE,

23:59.138 --> 24:01.974
AND THAT'S THE POINT OF BEING
DOWN HERE.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.475
MY GRANDFATHER USED TO SAY,

24:03.542 --> 24:06.145
"IN ORDER TO FILM A FISH,
YOU MUST BECOME A FISH."

24:06.211 --> 24:10.182
SO, HERE WE ARE AS CLOSE AS WE
CAN GET TO BECOMING FISH.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.825
>> Larson: SOME LATE NEWS BEFORE
WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.628
THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS
IT IS PROFOUNDLY TROUBLED

24:22.695 --> 24:25.297
BY REPORTS THAT ISRAELI
POLICE BEAT

24:25.364 --> 24:27.333
AN AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.

24:27.399 --> 24:30.169
THE 15-YEAR-OLD IS FROM FLORIDA
AND IS THE COUSIN

24:30.235 --> 24:33.472
OF THE PALESTINIAN TEEN WHO WAS
APPARENTLY BURNED ALIVE

24:33.539 --> 24:36.508
IN WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN A REVENGE
ATTACK FOR THE MURDER

24:36.575 --> 24:39.078
OF THREE ISRAELI TEENAGERS.

24:39.144 --> 24:42.915
AND THE JULY 4 HOLIDAY WEEKEND
HAS BROUGHT A WAVE OF VIOLENCE

24:42.981 --> 24:44.316
TO CHICAGO.

24:44.383 --> 24:48.120
POLICE THERE SAY AT LEAST 36
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT.

24:48.187 --> 24:50.089
ONE OF THE SHOOTINGS WAS FATAL.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.558
JOIN US TOMORROW ON AIR
AND ONLINE.

24:52.624 --> 24:55.294
I'M JOHN LARSON,
THANKS FOR JOINING US.
