Iraq's prime minister
visits war-torn Ramadi after
government forces

00:13.180 --> 00:16.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take the city back from ISIS.

00:16.083 --> 00:22.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Tuesday: The
World Health
Organization announces Guinea is
now Ebola-free,

00:22.289 --> 00:26.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after being the first country
hit with the
deadly outbreak nearly two years
ago.

00:26.927 --> 00:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how Puerto Ricans are
dealing with water
rationing during an extreme
drought.

00:32.699 --> 00:38.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUIS TORRES, Puerto Rico: We
can't run if
we don't have water. If we want
to open the

00:38.906 --> 00:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doors, we have to have water.

00:40.641 --> 00:47.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

GWEN IFILL: A white Chicago
policeman pleaded
not guilty today in the killing
of black teenager

01:01.261 --> 01:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Laquan McDonald. That case
sparked local protests
and gained national attention.

01:07.134 --> 01:12.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jason Van Dyke was arraigned on
charges of
first-degree murder and official
misconduct.

01:12.706 --> 01:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police video released last month
showed him
shooting McDonald 16 times.

01:17.678 --> 01:23.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, in Cleveland,
protesters gathered
a day after a grand jury refused
to indict

01:23.317 --> 01:28.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two police officers for killing
Tamir Rice.
The 12-year-old was shot dead in
November

01:28.755 --> 01:30.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of last year.

01:30.524 --> 01:35.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, Mayor Frank
Jackson said the
city wants to address public
anger, in part

01:35.195 --> 01:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with a special committee to
examine the case.

01:37.898 --> 01:42.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANK JACKSON, Mayor of
Cleveland: The grand
jury has said that there's been
nothing done

01:42.502 --> 01:48.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
wrong criminally. We are
reviewing , based
on what we have seen, whether or
not something

01:48.909 --> 01:57.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been done administratively.
A 12-year-old
lost his life. Something
happened.

01:57.117 --> 02:02.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Attorneys for the
accused officers
reiterated today that their
clients didn't

02:02.856 --> 02:07.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know Rice was only 12 or that he
had a toy
gun, not a real one.

02:07.961 --> 02:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Pakistan today, a suicide
bomber blew himself
up outside a government office,
killing at

02:13.300 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
least 26 people and wounding
scores more.
It happened in the northwestern
city of Mardan,

02:19.473 --> 02:25.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
near Peshawar, in a province
bordering Afghanistan.
The bomber opened fire, then
detonated his

02:25.712 --> 02:30.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suicide jacket at a national
registration
office. Many of the victims were
there to

02:30.217 --> 02:33.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
receive identification cards.

02:33.286 --> 02:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I was
praying in
my house when the blast
occurred. It was a

02:38.225 --> 02:42.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
huge blast. When I came running
here, there
were dead bodies lying all
around. It was

02:42.963 --> 02:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like doomsday. Body parts were
scattered on
the ground. Rescue workers were
picking up

02:47.334 --> 02:49.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dead bodies and putting them
into vehicles.

02:49.269 --> 02:55.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: An offshoot of the
Pakistani Taliban
claimed responsibility for the
attack.

02:56.009 --> 03:00.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police in Belgium have arrested
two people
in a possible plot to stage
attacks around

03:00.647 --> 03:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Year's. Brussels' main
square is popular
with tourists this time of year
and was allegedly

03:06.253 --> 03:12.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the targets. Authorities
say the plotters
had military-type uniforms and
Islamic State

03:12.192 --> 03:14.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
propaganda.

03:14.127 --> 03:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, days of
heavy rain triggered
flooding along the Mississippi
River today,

03:19.199 --> 03:24.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inundating small towns in
Missouri and Illinois.
The rising tide also shut down
parts of two

03:24.805 --> 03:31.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interstate highways and forced
residents of
West Alton, Missouri, to
evacuate their homes.

03:31.445 --> 03:34.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Jay Nixon warned the
worst is yet
to come.

03:34.181 --> 03:38.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. JAY NIXON (D), Missouri: We
have got
a lot more water coming. We try
to stay in

03:38.151 --> 03:41.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
front of it as best we can.
Today is Tuesday.
And, as I said before, we're
looking at Thursday

03:41.688 --> 03:47.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night or Friday morning for that
-- that crest,
so we have 36, 48 hours to get
ready for the

03:47.661 --> 03:48.962 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
top.

03:48.995 --> 03:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Later, the governor
activated
the National Guard.

03:52.799 --> 03:58.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elsewhere, heavy rain continues
in Georgia
and Alabama, and New England is
finally getting

03:58.105 --> 04:02.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
snow, after one of the warmest
Decembers on
record.

04:02.275 --> 04:07.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan's governor apologized
today for lead
contamination in the city of
Flint's drinking

04:07.647 --> 04:12.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water. And his environmental
chief resigned.
The city started drawing water
from the Flint

04:12.352 --> 04:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
River last year to save money.
State officials
insisted it was safe, but the
water corroded

04:18.125 --> 04:23.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aging pipes and released lead.
Residents have
now been warned against drinking
unfiltered

04:23.663 --> 04:25.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tap water.

04:25.532 --> 04:30.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street rallied on
higher oil prices,
plus upbeat economic reports.
The Dow Jones

04:30.904 --> 04:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industrial average gained 192
points to close
at 17720. The Nasdaq rose 67
points, and the

04:39.312 --> 04:42.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
S&amp;P 500 added nearly 22.

04:42.816 --> 04:47.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Still to come on the
"Â®MDNM/NewsHour": a
victory in the Iraqi city of
Ramadi; Guinea,

04:47.988 --> 04:54.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground zero for the Ebola
outbreak, declared
free of the virus; a law to
prevent data breaches;

04:54.995 --> 05:09.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a drought in the heart of the
Caribbean; and
much more.

05:09.276 --> 05:13.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now to the fight against ISIS
and the fate
of a key city, Ramadi.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner begins with this report.

05:17.717 --> 05:23.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It was a
triumphant tour
for the Iraqi prime minister.
Today, Haider

05:23.423 --> 05:29.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
al-Abadi planted his country's
flag in the
city after government troops
retook its center.

05:29.229 --> 05:32.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAIDER AL-ABADI, Iraqi Prime
Minister (voice-over):
ISIS said they would fight in
Ramadi, but

05:32.465 --> 05:36.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they felt afraid. They didn't
fight. They
fled, and many of them were
killed.

05:36.436 --> 05:41.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It was a
seven-month slog
to this day. Islamic State
militants had captured

05:41.841 --> 05:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ramadi, capital of the majority
Sunni Anbar
province, in May.

05:47.881 --> 05:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After encircling Ramadi for
weeks, last week,
Iraqi forces, backed by U.S.-led
coalition

05:53.787 --> 05:59.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airstrikes, finally launched an
assault into
the city. And over the weekend,
they made

05:59.125 --> 06:03.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a final push to seize its
central administration
complex.

06:03.830 --> 06:09.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, troops celebrated as
they raised
the Iraqi flag above the key
government building.

06:09.769 --> 06:15.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, speaking from Baghdad,
U.S. Army Colonel
Steve Warren underscored the
role of U.S.-led

06:15.742 --> 06:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
airpower in retaking the city.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
COL. STEVE WARREN, U.S.
Spokesman for Operation
Against ISIS: I would agree that
probably

06:19.946 --> 06:25.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
80 percent of the effort in
Ramadi was due
to coalition airstrikes. This is
significant.

06:25.118 --> 06:32.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this is what really
facilitated or enabled
the Iraqi forces to move in.
It's using that

06:32.259 --> 06:35.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
airpower as the force multiplier
that it really
can be.

06:35.528 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Warren also
told reporters
that airstrikes over the past
month have killed

06:40.066 --> 06:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10 Islamic State leaders.
Several of them
were linked to the deadly
attacks in Paris,

06:46.339 --> 06:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and one had direct ties to the
ringleader
of the November 13 rampage.

06:51.811 --> 06:56.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in Ramadi, there is much
work left to
do. Iraqi forces have cleared
the areas shown

06:56.983 --> 07:03.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in green, but militants
remain in other
parts of the city. Indeed, Abadi
and his convoy

07:03.323 --> 07:09.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were forced to leave one section
of Ramadi
after mortar rounds landed
nearby. Explosives

07:09.996 --> 07:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also must be removed from
streets and buildings.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Warren declined to predict how
long that would
take.

07:16.236 --> 07:21.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now we get the view
from Iraq
with Wall Street Journal
reporter Matt Bradley

07:21.074 --> 07:24.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Baghdad. I spoke with him
earlier today.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matt Bradley, thank you for
joining us.

07:26.746 --> 07:31.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this victory which people
have been talking
about as being imminent for
several days,

07:31.184 --> 07:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how significant is that it was
accomplished
without the help of Kurdish or
Shiite militia?

07:36.256 --> 07:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT BRADLEY, The Wall Street
Journal: Well,
this was a -- this moment, this
victory, as

07:38.992 --> 07:42.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you described it, is really
vindicating for
the Iraqi military, and not just
for the Iraqi

07:42.896 --> 07:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military, but also for Prime
Minister Haider
Abadi and his partners in the
United States.

07:47.701 --> 07:52.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is really -- as Haider
al-Abadi said,
this is really sort of paving
the way toward

07:52.872 --> 07:55.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mosul, which will be a much,
much more difficult
fight.

07:55.842 --> 08:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You mentioned Haider
al-Abadi,
the prime minister. He made kind
of a victory

08:00.447 --> 08:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lap through Ramadi today. How
unusual was
that and how well was it
received?

08:04.818 --> 08:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT BRADLEY: Well, he's been
trying to do
that.

08:06.653 --> 08:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Haider al-Abadi, of course, like
any politician,
likes to get his picture in the
right place

08:10.790 --> 08:14.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the right time. So this was
not unusual
for him. However, there were
some rumors that

08:14.627 --> 08:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were circulating this afternoon
that his convoy
had actually come under fire
from some missiles

08:19.399 --> 08:20.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the enemy.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, that was really denied.
That wasn't
the case at all.

08:23.103 --> 08:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it just goes to show just
how dangerous
this situation is and the kind
of target that

08:27.307 --> 08:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he makes. He really is caught
between the
Islamic State on one side and
the Shiite militia

08:32.379 --> 08:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups, who were very resentful
that they
weren't included in the fight
for Ramadi.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, in this victory
we have, have
Iraqi troops improved on their
performance

08:38.985 --> 08:40.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and, if so, how?

08:40.754 --> 08:44.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT BRADLEY: Yes, one of the
things that
the Iraqi troops were able to do
in Ramadi

08:44.624 --> 08:48.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they were not able to do in
previous
battles was the combined use of
different

08:48.728 --> 08:50.463 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tactics.

08:50.497 --> 08:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were able to call in
airstrikes from
the coalition and from Iraq's
military at

08:53.533 --> 08:58.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the right time for the right
targets. They
were able to combine the use of
sort of amphibious

08:58.438 --> 09:03.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assaults when they erected this
bridge downriver
from Ramadi in order to surprise
the enemy

09:04.010 --> 09:05.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the south.

09:05.779 --> 09:09.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they have been able to create
a combined
assault, which is sort of a
lofty military

09:09.916 --> 09:15.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
theory that a lot of these Iraqi
soldiers
hadn't been exposed to until
U.S. training

09:15.822 --> 09:17.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just this past summer.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What effect does it
have on morale,
not only for Iraqi citizens, but
also for

09:21.628 --> 09:23.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Iraqi military?

09:23.530 --> 09:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT BRADLEY: Well, every
victory that happens
in this battle is a strategic
victory, because

09:28.001 --> 09:34.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we're talking about, what
the Iraqi troops
really lack is morale, is this
esprit de corps,

09:34.207 --> 09:38.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is this feeling that they're
defending a nation,
that their nation is grateful,
that it's worth

09:38.244 --> 09:42.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saving and that their victories
are not going
to be usurped or eclipsed by
those of the

09:42.449 --> 09:44.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Shiite militias or the
Peshmerga.

09:44.250 --> 09:49.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, really, this is a huge
moment, because
this is the first time that the
Iraqi military

09:49.322 --> 09:52.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has really achieved a victory
against the
Islamic State. Up until now,
it's only been

09:52.792 --> 09:54.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
embarrassing defeats for the
Iraqi military.

09:54.627 --> 09:59.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, Matt, there has
been some
talk that the next goal is
Mosul, which seems

09:59.532 --> 10:02.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a far more difficult target. Is
that realistic?

10:02.068 --> 10:06.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT BRADLEY: Well, it's not
really realistic
at this present moment.

10:06.339 --> 10:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mosul is several times the size
of Ramadi.
It's the second largest city in
Iraq. It's

10:12.479 --> 10:17.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islamic State's de facto capital
in this country.
There is a huge number of
civilians still

10:17.717 --> 10:23.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the city and there's a lot of
civilians
who have some amount of
affection or support

10:23.389 --> 10:25.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Islamic State.

10:25.191 --> 10:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Mosul fight will not be
nearly as
easy as the Ramadi fight, and
the Ramadi fight

10:29.629 --> 10:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't easy at all, so, really,
it's just
going to get only more
difficult.

10:33.299 --> 10:38.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Matt Bradley
reporting for us
tonight from Baghdad for The
Wall Street Journal,

10:38.271 --> 10:40.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you so much.

10:40.540 --> 10:46.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT BRADLEY: Thanks.

10:46.112 --> 10:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For the first time
in two years,
the country where the Ebola
outbreak began

10:54.354 --> 10:59.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can say it's free of the virus.
That's also
true for the region of West
Africa, where

10:59.325 --> 11:02.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 11,000 people have
died in the epidemic.

11:02.829 --> 11:09.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ebola sickened more than 28,000
people across
10 countries, mostly in Africa.
But a long

11:09.335 --> 11:12.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
international effort eventually
paid off.

11:12.505 --> 11:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham begins our look
at the lessons
learned and the challenges that
remain.

11:17.176 --> 11:21.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The outbreak
first began
in Eastern Guinea back in
December of 2013

11:21.881 --> 11:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then spread to neighboring
Liberia and
Sierra Leone. More than 2,500
people died

11:26.786 --> 11:31.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Guinea before it was fully
contained. And,
today, an estimated 6,000
children there are

11:31.991 --> 11:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
orphans because of the epidemic.

11:34.260 --> 11:38.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's now been six weeks
since the last
known Ebola patient repeatedly
tested negative

11:38.197 --> 11:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the virus. Reports from
Guinea today suggest
a mix of both celebration and
wariness.

11:43.903 --> 11:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sheri Fink has chronicled the
impact of the
epidemic for The New York Times,
and was part

11:47.774 --> 11:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the team who won the Pulitzer
Prize for
its coverage.

11:50.743 --> 11:56.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Sheri Fink, Guinea says no
more Ebola.
Tell us, how big a deal is this?

11:56.916 --> 12:00.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERI FINK, The New York Times:
It's a big
deal.

12:00.286 --> 12:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you have said, it's been two
years since
experts believe that that first
case in a

12:05.291 --> 12:11.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little village in Guinea started
this epidemic.
That's a very long time. And
today marks the

12:11.864 --> 12:16.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
date that all three of those
most affected
countries have broken that
original chain

12:17.003 --> 12:21.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of transmission, that
human-to-human transmission
that has led us to this day,
with thousands

12:22.008 --> 12:26.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of deaths and many, many
thousands of people
getting sick with Ebola.

12:26.245 --> 12:31.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is the
scientific community
pretty confident that we are in
fact at zero?

12:31.684 --> 12:37.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Liberia at one point was
declared Ebola-free,
and then some new cases erupted.
So how confident

12:37.223 --> 12:39.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can we be that this really is
it?

12:39.759 --> 12:44.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERI FINK: So, this has been
something that
we have learned this year.

12:44.063 --> 12:49.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, people might even be
surprised Ebola
has slipped from the headlines,
that the transmissions

12:49.769 --> 12:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continued to go up until this
date. And that
is because there have been sort
of these cases

12:55.475 --> 13:01.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that nobody knew about of
potential Ebola
kind of hanging out in certain
parts of the

13:01.848 --> 13:08.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
body that are immunologically
protected and
reemerging in some survivors,
causing these

13:08.554 --> 13:10.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
little mini-outbreaks.

13:10.456 --> 13:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, indeed, Liberia reached this
milestone
a few months ago and twice has
had small flare-ups

13:16.429 --> 13:21.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are thought to be linked to
transmission
from survivors in very rare
cases thought

13:21.868 --> 13:24.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be sexually transmitted, for
one thing.

13:24.637 --> 13:30.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So now the World Health
Organization is saying,
OK, human-to-human transmission
has stopped,

13:30.209 --> 13:35.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but Guinea will enter a 90-day
period of what
they're calling enhanced
surveillance to be

13:35.648 --> 13:41.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really on the lookout for
occasional sporadic
cases that could pop up and lead
to more cases.

13:41.854 --> 13:46.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Your reporting
over the
last months and year have
revealed that there

13:46.592 --> 13:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are some real problems with the
way the World
Health Organization responded to
this epidemic.

13:50.763 --> 13:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you tell us about some of
those -- some
of the problems that they had,
and how have

13:54.500 --> 13:56.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they been addressed?

13:56.502 --> 14:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERI FINK: Well, the World
Health Organization
has really been a punching bag
for this outbreak.

14:02.442 --> 14:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it should be said that
nobody responded
very well at the beginning.

14:05.978 --> 14:11.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, certainly, the World Health
Organization,
as that U.N. body that's in
charge of the

14:11.117 --> 14:16.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world's health, came in for a
lot of criticism,
and they said it was justified.
And numerous

14:16.522 --> 14:21.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups have come out, experts,
trying to say,
what can we learn from this?

14:21.260 --> 14:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The essential fact was, early in
the outbreak,
the WHO failed to sort of
understand its gravity.

14:27.767 --> 14:32.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, these cases popped up in
a part of
the world that hadn't been known
really to

14:32.605 --> 14:37.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have Ebola outbreaks in the
past, right at
the border of three countries,
and very quickly

14:37.944 --> 14:41.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had hit capital cities.

14:41.180 --> 14:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there wasn't just enough of a
sense of
urgency in that very early
response, a sense

14:47.420 --> 14:52.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this was different from the
WHO. Plus,
they had cut down their outbreak
response

14:52.525 --> 14:58.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
units just before the outbreak
happened. This
was because, you know, they
hadn't had as

14:58.164 --> 15:04.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much money to work with, with
the global financial
crisis, and so they chose to cut
certain aspects

15:04.237 --> 15:06.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of their global health
portfolio.

15:06.305 --> 15:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, one of them was
outbreak response.
So now the focus is how to
strengthen that

15:11.477 --> 15:13.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the future.

15:13.279 --> 15:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You reported
also that,
sometimes, political concerns
got in the way

15:16.849 --> 15:20.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of public health concerns.
Explain how that
happens.

15:20.553 --> 15:25.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERI FINK: So, the WHO is made
up of its
member countries.

15:25.892 --> 15:30.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the past, even with this
outbreak,
we saw that there is sort of a
punitive response

15:30.530 --> 15:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when a country has a dangerous
disease like
Ebola within its borders.
Airlines shut down

15:37.003 --> 15:42.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flights, countries pull out, and
the thought
is also that these countries put
pressure

15:42.975 --> 15:46.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the local -- the regional WHO
offices.

15:46.345 --> 15:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't want a big deal to be
made of this
outbreak. So, looking forward, a
lot of these

15:51.350 --> 15:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups are saying the WHO needs
to be protected
from that political pressure, so
that they

15:56.823 --> 16:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can address an outbreak, not
minimize it,
in the beginning, as well as the
other countries

16:02.762 --> 16:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the world need to reward
countries that
are willing to come forward and
say, we have

16:07.767 --> 16:09.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
got an outbreak.

16:09.702 --> 16:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that reward is, you know,
immediate assistance
to fight the outbreak. More
broadly, health

16:15.942 --> 16:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
systems really need to be
strengthened in
all these countries. These are
countries with

16:19.946 --> 16:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poor health systems to begin
with, and all
the countries of the world have
realized that

16:24.684 --> 16:27.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
there is an interest in
strengthening those
health systems.

16:27.720 --> 16:34.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, that's partly to help
people, humanitarian,
but partly so that future
outbreaks of even

16:34.660 --> 16:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more dangerous, you know,
epidemics would
be stopped at their source.

16:39.198 --> 16:42.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Sheri Fink of
The New York Times, thank you so
much.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHERI FINK: Thanks.

16:44.237 --> 16:48.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Clearly, the best
way to stop
Ebola altogether would be
developing a vaccine.

16:48.875 --> 16:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, more than a dozen
trials and
experiments are under way.

16:53.246 --> 16:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this year, our science
correspondent,
Miles O'Brien, reported on some
of those efforts

16:57.216 --> 17:01.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in West Africa and why the
search for a cure
has been so difficult.

17:01.854 --> 17:06.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is an encore look from his
series Cracking
Ebola's Code.

17:06.459 --> 17:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's dark and
early in Freetown,
Sierra Leone. A team of
pharmacists is in

17:13.399 --> 17:18.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a nondescript government
building preparing
the day's supply of an
experimental vaccine

17:19.005 --> 17:22.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against Ebola.

17:22.308 --> 17:34.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The clock starts running when
they take the
vaccine out of a very deep
freeze. This is

17:34.720 --> 17:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likely the coldest spot in the
whole country.
The vaccine can only be thawed
out right before

17:40.226 --> 17:46.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is injected, or it will lose
its potency,
and all of this will be a waste
of time, money

17:46.499 --> 17:48.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and hope.

17:48.167 --> 17:54.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, right now, timing and
temperature are
absolutely critical. And then it
happens.

17:54.707 --> 17:59.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: The power went out.

17:59.512 --> 18:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Another reminder
of how hard
it is to conduct a high-tech
vaccine trial

18:05.985 --> 18:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in one of the poorest countries
on the planet.
But they are ready. They have
got two backup

18:14.327 --> 18:19.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generators for the building,
solar-charged
batteries, and, if all else
fails, a special

18:19.932 --> 18:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
container that maintains about
100 degrees
below zero Fahrenheit for five
days without

18:25.638 --> 18:29.275 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
power.

18:29.308 --> 18:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pharmacist Morrison Jusu is
delivering the
vaccine three-and-a-half miles
across Freetown.

18:35.414 --> 18:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a seemingly endless
national nightmare,
he carries a cooler full of
expectations.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He knows much is riding with
him.

18:43.556 --> 18:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORRISON JUSU, Pharmacist: Some
people lost
family members. And some
families were essentially

18:49.095 --> 18:58.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wiped out as a result of this
thing. And if
this vaccine proves out to be
something that

18:58.137 --> 19:06.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prevents such in the future,
then it's -- it's
-- words cannot describe how
much relief that

19:06.479 --> 19:08.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would be to this community.

19:08.614 --> 19:15.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: While Jusu and
the vaccine
are wending their way, a line is
growing outside

19:15.054 --> 19:18.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their destination, Freetown's
Connaught Hospital.

19:18.758 --> 19:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The volunteers start showing up
before dawn.
They are health care workers.
This trial is

19:23.896 --> 19:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
limited to them because they
are, by far,
the most at risk of contracting
Ebola virus

19:29.702 --> 19:34.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disease. Even though there is no
evidence
the vaccine poses any real
danger, they must

19:34.807 --> 19:36.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weigh the rumors and the
uncertainties.

19:36.876 --> 19:41.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMED SAMBOLA, Vaccine Trial
Volunteer (through
translator): Life is all about
risks. But

19:41.247 --> 19:43.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe it will be of help in
the job that
I do.

19:43.482 --> 19:46.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUGIATU CONTEH, Vaccine Trial
Volunteer (through
translator): It is a high risk
for me. I believe

19:47.019 --> 19:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this can protect me from Ebola,
and that's
why I came here for this
vaccine.

19:50.456 --> 19:55.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It wasn't always
this way.
The trial got off to a slow
start when it

19:55.628 --> 19:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
began in April. People were too
afraid.

19:58.464 --> 20:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Mohamed Samai is one of the
principal
investigators.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MOHAMED SAMAI, Provost,
College of Medicine
and Allied Health Sciences:
People said the

20:03.536 --> 20:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vaccine was the Ebola virus, so,
once you
get it, you become infected. So,
a lot of

20:10.443 --> 20:16.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people were not willing to come
forward there
in the first week to take the
vaccine, because

20:16.382 --> 20:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they thought they should wait
and see what
happens.

20:19.118 --> 20:24.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The vaccine does
contain a
piece of the Ebola virus, a
protein. It's

20:24.457 --> 20:29.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough to trick the body into
triggering its
natural defenses, but won't give
the recipient

20:29.628 --> 20:32.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ebola virus disease.

20:32.064 --> 20:36.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the wall in the lobby of the
hospital,
a spontaneous memorial to some
of the doctors

20:36.769 --> 20:43.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and nurses who died here during
the epidemic,
a grim reminder of what
motivates volunteers

20:43.142 --> 20:44.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like Richard Kanu.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD KANU, Vaccine Trial
Volunteer (through
translator): I became aware of
it through

20:47.379 --> 20:51.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my friends who got the shot
three days ago.
Since they're not having any
side effects,

20:51.183 --> 20:55.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I decided to come and have a go
at it myself,
because I feel it will protect
me.

20:55.187 --> 21:01.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kanu works on a
team that buries
the highly contagious dead. He
has been shunned

21:01.060 --> 21:04.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by friends, even forced out of
his own home.

21:04.697 --> 21:08.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD KANU (through
translator): I will
go back and tell them that I
have had the

21:08.300 --> 21:11.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vaccine and they should rest
assured that
I won't have the virus. I will
probably encourage

21:11.937 --> 21:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them to step forward as well.

21:13.772 --> 21:20.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Bad traffic
delays Jusu's ride
to the hospital, but, when he
arrives, the

21:20.946 --> 21:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vaccine isn't spoiled, and the
volunteers
are ready. The nursing team
doesn't waste

21:27.319 --> 21:31.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any time prepping for the jabs.

21:31.423 --> 21:37.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aruna Thorlie is a chlorine
sprayer who disinfects
Ebola treatment units.

21:37.863 --> 21:40.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Have you felt anything
different? Did it hurt,
anything?

21:40.166 --> 21:43.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARUNA THORLIE, Vaccine Trial
Volunteer (through
translator): I feel the same as
I did before.

21:43.335 --> 21:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I hope and pray that it works.

21:45.337 --> 21:50.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The vaccine is
made by Merck.
The trial is a partnership
between the Sierra

21:50.075 --> 21:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leone Ministry of Health, the
U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and
Prevention and the

21:55.047 --> 21:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
medical college in Freetown.

21:56.882 --> 22:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MOHAMED SAMAI: Once we can
document the
effectiveness of the vaccine,
and we are now

22:02.454 --> 22:07.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that it can really protect
them, we can
move to another stage, where we
will look

22:07.593 --> 22:10.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the community and the
population at large.

22:10.596 --> 22:16.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Across the border
in Liberia,
a separate trial is testing the
same vaccine,

22:16.902 --> 22:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
along with another one made by
GlaxoSmithKline.
It is open to all and based at
this hospital

22:22.875 --> 22:24.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Monrovia.

22:24.643 --> 22:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the darkest days of the
crisis here in
Liberia, a senior doctor and
nurse here at

22:29.315 --> 22:34.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Redemption Hospital contracted
Ebola virus
disease, and they subsequently
died. Many

22:35.020 --> 22:39.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the health care workers here
became afraid
to come to work and the hospital
had to close

22:39.892 --> 22:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a time. In all, 13 members
of the hospital
staff died here.

22:44.563 --> 22:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. MARK KIEH, Redemption
Hospital: It was
scary. It was confusing

22:47.299 --> 22:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: DR. Mark Kieh is
the site physician
for the trial.

22:51.537 --> 22:57.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So far, there are 1, 500
volunteers. He is
carefully watching them for side
effects.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So far, so good.

22:59.445 --> 23:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARK KIEH: Those we have
seen are expected
side effects of fever, muscle
pain, pain at

23:06.285 --> 23:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the injection sites, some joint
pain, some
-- few people with rashes that
resolve over

23:13.259 --> 23:15.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

23:15.160 --> 23:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The trial is run
by Liberia's
Ministry of Health and the U.S.
National Institute

23:19.598 --> 23:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Allergy and Infectious
Disease.

23:21.834 --> 23:28.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its director, Dr. Anthony Fauci,
has intense,
intimate understanding of the
ravages of Ebola.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, Director,
National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases: At least

23:29.875 --> 23:35.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the most recent patient that
we took care
of, that that's about as sick as
you can get

23:35.381 --> 23:37.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
without dying.

23:37.149 --> 23:41.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: On March 14,
2015, he suited
up to treat a U.S. health care
worker who

23:41.820 --> 23:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
became infected in Sierra Leone,
and was airlifted
to the NIH hospital outside
Washington, where

23:47.960 --> 23:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he received the highest level of
intensive
care possible. It kept him alive
while his

23:53.299 --> 23:56.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
body mounted its own defense.

23:56.168 --> 23:58.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was touch and go for a week,
but he survived.

23:58.737 --> 24:04.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: All of the
people who have
recovered from Ebola, even those
who have

24:04.143 --> 24:10.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been very ill, it was their
immune system
that ultimately suppressed and
eliminated

24:10.516 --> 24:12.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the virus.

24:12.184 --> 24:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This is why Fauci
and others
are optimistic they have a found
a way to

24:15.254 --> 24:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stop Ebola its tracks. The human
body can
create the antibodies to fight
off Ebola,

24:21.960 --> 24:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but usually not fast enough.

24:24.363 --> 24:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An effective vaccine creates an
army of Ebola
antibodies that can stop the
virus before

24:29.835 --> 24:33.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it stampedes through the body.
But here is
the ironic rub.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN, Director,
Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention:
If we are

24:35.708 --> 24:40.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successful in controlling Ebola,
we won't
be successful in determining
whether the vaccines

24:40.646 --> 24:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are effective at preventing
Ebola.

24:42.748 --> 24:50.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Tom Frieden
is director
of the CDC. Ebola cases in
Liberia are now

24:50.756 --> 24:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at zero, and Sierra Leone is
close behind.

24:54.360 --> 24:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If no one is getting Ebola, you
can't tell
for sure if the vaccine is
protective, so

24:59.998 --> 25:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have to rely on other
evidence.

25:01.934 --> 25:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: So, the
trials under way
now will at least tell us
whether they're

25:05.671 --> 25:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safe, and they will tell us
whether they lead
to an immune reaction.

25:09.742 --> 25:14.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We wish we were further along
with the vaccine,
but it's very difficult to do
research in

25:14.980 --> 25:18.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the middle of an epidemic.

25:18.350 --> 25:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In Freetown,
pharmacist Morrison
Jusu is among those who
scrambled to get this

25:24.723 --> 25:29.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trial under way at all. He is
anxious to know
if the hard work will pay off.

25:29.895 --> 25:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORRISON JUSU: We are really
looking forward
to it being successful, so that
someday in

25:35.300 --> 25:40.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the future, we will be able to
say, yes, I
was a part of that team and I
contributed.

25:40.139 --> 25:43.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it will be a great feeling
then.

25:43.776 --> 25:51.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The answer will
have to wait,
but no one doubts the vaccine
will meet its

25:51.950 --> 25:55.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
viral foe someday.

25:55.654 --> 26:05.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Freetown,
Sierra Leone.

26:05.631 --> 26:15.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Before the president
and Congress
left town for the holidays, they
managed to

26:15.674 --> 26:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Before the president
and Congress
left town for the holidays, they
managed to

26:23.315 --> 26:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enact a massive 2,000-page
package of spending
and tax cuts. Typically, these
laws draw attention

26:30.255 --> 26:33.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only for the chaos they create,
like shutting
down the government.

26:33.692 --> 26:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a lot more deep
inside, in this
case, a significant and
controversial new

26:38.397 --> 26:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law governing cyber-security and
Internet
data. The new law encourages
private companies

26:44.770 --> 26:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to share data about cyber-hacks
with the government.
It protects companies from
liability, and

26:50.609 --> 26:56.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it also allows data to shared
with other companies
and with the Department of
Homeland Security.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lawmakers from both parties said
it was a
good deal.

26:59.485 --> 27:04.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: If
someone sees a particular virus
or harmful

27:04.490 --> 27:10.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cyber-signature, they should
tell others,
so they can protect themselves.
That's what

27:10.095 --> 27:11.930 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this bill does.

27:11.964 --> 27:15.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. DEVIN NUNES (R),
California: We believe
that sharing is an area where
you really can't

27:15.267 --> 27:19.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do any harm. It doesn't hurt
anybody to have
a way to talk. But, right now,
they can't

27:19.037 --> 27:20.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even talk.

27:20.806 --> 27:27.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine:
Does it make
sense that we require one case
of measles

27:27.212 --> 27:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be reported to a federal
government agency,
but not a cyber-attack?

27:34.019 --> 27:39.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But there are some
security advocates
and privacy groups who say the
law manages

27:39.892 --> 27:43.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to go too far and not quite far
enough.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has that debate.

27:45.230 --> 27:49.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To understand
more, we're joined
by James Lewis, senior fellow
for the Center

27:49.234 --> 27:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Strategic and International

27:55.007 --> 27:58.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
start-up designed to provide
private communications
to customers.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
James Lewis, let me start with
you.

28:02.180 --> 28:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The proponents of this in
Congress say that
this will allow the government
to coordinate

28:07.853 --> 28:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information, and they think this
is the best
way to do it, and then push back
to other

28:11.957 --> 28:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
companies, push out information
about how
to prevent it in the future.

28:15.193 --> 28:17.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LEWIS, Center for
Strategic and International
Studies: You know, it's a really
good first

28:17.529 --> 28:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
step, and it's great that
Congress managed
to pass a law, almost amazing.

28:23.635 --> 28:31.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have a lot of work to do.
And in cyber-security
in general, this is a little
step. In information-sharing,

28:31.076 --> 28:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of things have to come
together for
it to work. We have tried this
for a long

28:35.681 --> 28:41.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
time. It's hard to share
information, classified
information, private
information. We will

28:41.920 --> 28:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see where we are a year from
now, but a good
first step, a long way to go.

28:45.891 --> 28:50.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From a security
perspective,
what's the goal here, and how
would the new

28:50.062 --> 28:51.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
law try to achieve it?

28:51.830 --> 28:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LEWIS: This is something
the U.S. has
been trying to do for almost 18
years now,

28:56.168 --> 28:57.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and it's never worked.

28:57.936 --> 29:02.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The theory is that, if you
remove some of
the obstacles to sharing
information, people

29:02.908 --> 29:07.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will do more, will know what the
threats are,
and maybe they will take action.
But that's

29:07.846 --> 29:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where the bill falls apart.

29:09.014 --> 29:10.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's where you
see a problem
on it?

29:10.449 --> 29:12.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LEWIS: Yes.

29:12.351 --> 29:16.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no incentive for people
to use information.
This doesn't change -- it's like
me telling

29:16.421 --> 29:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you, hey, the Chinese are trying
to hack into
your computer, be ready. It
doesn't really

29:21.026 --> 29:26.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affect what people are going to
do to defend
themselves. And it keeps us in a
reactive

29:26.598 --> 29:28.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
posture.

29:28.266 --> 29:32.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Elissa Shevinsky,
a lot of
people have raised privacy
concerns in all

29:32.170 --> 29:35.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this. You come at it from that
angle. Explain
the problems you see.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELISSA SHEVINSKY, Founder,
JeKuDo Privacy
Company: There are numerous
problems with

29:37.275 --> 29:39.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this bill.

29:39.177 --> 29:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't actually help us with
security.
Rather, it's more information
gathering for

29:44.983 --> 29:51.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government. And it makes it
difficult
for executives like myself to
actually safeguard

29:51.690 --> 29:53.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the privacy of our customers.

29:53.825 --> 29:58.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past, we have been able
to rely on
our privacy policies to create
trust with

29:58.630 --> 30:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our customers. We can say the
privacy policy
says that we can't share your
data with third

30:05.337 --> 30:11.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parties. With the CISA bill,
that will no
longer apply. Now companies will
be coerced

30:11.510 --> 30:13.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into sharing their customer data
with the
government.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you say
coerced. Isn't
this voluntary?

30:16.181 --> 30:20.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: They say that
it's voluntary,
but if the government comes to
you and says

30:20.419 --> 30:24.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they want information, it's
tricky to
stand up and say no.

30:24.222 --> 30:26.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Jim Lewis,
what do you
see about that?

30:26.591 --> 30:31.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LEWIS: This is DHS we're
talking about.
And it's very hard for them to
coerce anyone.

30:31.596 --> 30:33.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it's voluntary.

30:33.699 --> 30:38.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's actually my concern, is,
since it's
voluntary, people are unlikely
to do anything.

30:38.970 --> 30:43.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This doesn't expand the
information that companies
are gathering. It's their
decision whether

30:43.709 --> 30:48.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or not they share it, and
there's no authority
in the bill for the government
to coerce anyone.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I hadn't even thought about
coercion as
a problem.

30:51.216 --> 30:52.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What would you
like to see
happen?

30:52.751 --> 30:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES LEWIS: We're going to have
to tackle
some hard issues.

30:54.820 --> 30:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to have to tackle
what is the
role of the military, where do
we need to

30:58.990 --> 31:05.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulate, and how do we work
with other countries
to come to some understanding on
what we should

31:05.831 --> 31:07.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or shouldn't do in cyberspace.

31:07.332 --> 31:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you see
the government
saying to companies here?

31:10.135 --> 31:15.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LEWIS: What they're saying
is, you either
know than we do, which could be
true. You

31:15.474 --> 31:20.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly know different things
than we do.
And so if you can give us that
threat information,

31:20.479 --> 31:23.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we can share back with you,
it will help
everyone.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It could work. I mean, it hasn't
worked so
far, but that's the theory.

31:26.885 --> 31:31.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Elissa
Shevinsky, where
do you see this line, from where
you sit,

31:31.223 --> 31:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this line of security and
privacy?

31:33.158 --> 31:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: We need to
actually build
and enforce real security. That
requires encrypting

31:39.097 --> 31:40.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our data.

31:40.999 --> 31:46.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It requires taking new measures
in the government.
So many government offices were
hacked this

31:46.938 --> 31:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last year. We need to review
their security
practices if they are going to
be holding

31:51.510 --> 31:53.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more citizen data.

31:53.345 --> 31:57.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, that could
be right.
This is a very evolving threat,
right, both

31:57.616 --> 31:59.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the private sector and
government.

31:59.551 --> 32:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: That's right.
And this bill
doesn't address that.

32:03.054 --> 32:08.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This bill is information
gathering for DHS.
And it doesn't actually support
what we need

32:08.994 --> 32:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to improve the security of our
companies and
to improve the security of our
government

32:13.131 --> 32:14.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agencies.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What would you
like to see?
What kind of system would you
like to see

32:17.002 --> 32:18.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in place?

32:18.870 --> 32:22.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELISSA SHEVINSKY: We need to
actually improve
the security of how we're
storing and managing

32:22.841 --> 32:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
data, who has access to that
data. More threat
intelligence won't help us,
because we already

32:28.780 --> 32:30.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
know what the threats look like.

32:30.549 --> 32:33.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jim Lewis, is it
correct that
there is still a lot to work
out? There's

32:33.685 --> 32:35.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still a lot we don't know about
how this is
going to be implemented.

32:35.720 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LEWIS: Yes. The bill has a
lot of reporting
dates and actions for
implementation.

32:41.193 --> 32:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, you know, the
debate over the
-- between the privacy community
and the agencies

32:48.800 --> 32:54.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was, where does the information
go? They settled
on DHS. And now DHS has to
prepare itself.

32:54.573 --> 32:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is a lot of action
here. Right now,
this doesn't change anything.
Maybe three

32:59.244 --> 33:02.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
months from now, we will see
some improvement.

33:02.214 --> 33:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How would you
judge success
in something like this? How do
we know?

33:07.118 --> 33:12.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES LEWIS: Unfortunately, the
metrics are
really simple, how many people
are getting

33:12.257 --> 33:18.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, how much data is flowing
out. And if the
numbers aren't going down, it's
not working.

33:18.196 --> 33:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, James
Lewis, Elissa
Shevinsky, thank you both very
much.

33:28.940 --> 33:34.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES LEWIS: Thank you.

33:34.646 --> 33:38.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

33:38.516 --> 33:43.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
winner of
this year's National Book Award
for Poetry;

33:43.755 --> 33:47.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and why there are still so few
women in science.

33:47.993 --> 33:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the entire summer of 2015,
the residents
of Puerto Rico lived under
drought conditions.

33:55.033 --> 33:59.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Water was rationed, and, in some
towns, it
was only available in public
places.

33:59.871 --> 34:04.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As special correspondent Chris
Bury reports,
the rains have returned, but the
island's

34:04.876 --> 34:09.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recession and debt crisis remain
a burden
on the water infrastructure.

34:09.247 --> 34:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: The remnants of
Hurricane Danny
and Tropical Storm Erika that
drenched Puerto

34:14.853 --> 34:21.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rico in late summer were, in
fact, a great
relief for this tropical island
3,500 square

34:21.359 --> 34:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
miles surrounded by the blue
Caribbean.

34:24.496 --> 34:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a new era of greatly reduced
rainfall and
extended dry spells, the most
precious commodity

34:30.936 --> 34:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these days is water, clean,
fresh water. But
for nearly five months in the
summer and early

34:40.412 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fall, the most populous parts of
the country
depended on 1,600 gallon tanks
of water like

34:46.318 --> 34:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this. At one point, more than
100 of these
tanks helped Puerto Ricans cope
with the worst

34:52.257 --> 34:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
drought in more than 20 years.

34:54.292 --> 35:00.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Near San Juan, Juliana Chiclana
was filling
up water jugs for a household
that includes

35:00.131 --> 35:02.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
eight grandchildren.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIANA CHICLANA, Puerto Rico
(through translator):
One is emotionally affected by
the drought

35:05.503 --> 35:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself, which, at least for me,
I have never
experienced a drought this big.

35:08.907 --> 35:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: In this town, the
tap water was
on for 24 hours, then off for 72
hours. And

35:15.513 --> 35:19.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so families had to load up with
enough to
get through three days without
tap water at

35:19.951 --> 35:21.720 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIANA CHICLANA (through
translator): In
a way, I'm grateful that it's
three, because

35:23.788 --> 35:25.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they had announced that it was
going to be
five days.

35:25.857 --> 35:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: The rationing, in
force from mid-May
until September, was the most
stringent ever

35:31.663 --> 35:38.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imposed. Just outside San Juan,
the Torres
family lived for months with
those restrictions.

35:38.103 --> 35:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we have the kitchen without
water?

35:40.972 --> 35:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEHUEL TORRES, Puerto Rico:
That's it.

35:42.874 --> 35:47.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: On the day we
visited, water rationing
was in effect for the entire
neighborhood.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, they could turn on the
taps every other
day.

35:50.181 --> 35:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What happens if you try and turn
on the water?

35:52.350 --> 35:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEHUEL TORRES: Well, if you turn
on the water,
we have no water at this point.
We are in

35:57.622 --> 36:04.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a drought, right now rationing.
We have 24
hours previous -- we got one day
with water,

36:04.162 --> 36:05.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
another day with no water.

36:05.263 --> 36:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: Twenty-four hours
on, 24 hours
off?

36:07.432 --> 36:10.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEHUEL TORRES: Twenty-four hours
on, 24 hours
off.

36:10.235 --> 36:14.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: So, like thousands
of others here,
Dehuel and his wife, Jessica,
had to cope

36:14.906 --> 36:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creatively. In the bathrooms, he
installed
22-gallon tanks for cleaning and
hygiene.

36:20.178 --> 36:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEHUEL TORRES: Just to use our
toilet in a
regular basis.

36:24.049 --> 36:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: And to bathe, they
relied on this
small camp shower. Dehuel filled
it from a

36:29.687 --> 36:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big barrel that sits outside in
the sun to
keep the water warm, then hung
it up in the

36:35.427 --> 36:37.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bathroom, where the showers, by
necessity,
were brief.

36:37.495 --> 36:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEHUEL TORRES: There you go. We
got our shower.

36:39.664 --> 36:45.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: And in the kitchen,
some more
improvisation. Dehuel attached a
faucet to

36:46.004 --> 36:50.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this big bucket. That's how they
saved enough
water to do the dishes on those
days when

36:51.009 --> 36:52.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the tap ran dry.

36:52.811 --> 36:57.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA TORRES, Puerto Rico: We
have to turn
it off. Then clean each cup or
dish one by

36:57.949 --> 37:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one to save water, then turn it
up to rinse
it.

37:02.420 --> 37:06.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: For the Torres
family, the drought
not only meant a dramatic change
in their

37:06.791 --> 37:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
daily lives. It's cost them more
money, too.

37:09.327 --> 37:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA TORRES, It's more
expensive. We may
have to buy another container to
supply our

37:13.798 --> 37:16.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needs, so that's another expense
that we have
to look into it.

37:16.401 --> 37:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: In much of Puerto
Rico, the drought
created a cottage industry of
coping. Hardware

37:21.773 --> 37:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stores hawked buckets with
faucets already
bolted on. This sign said,
"Don't stay soapy."

37:28.079 --> 37:37.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Along highways, vendors sold the
bucket contraptions,
too, $15 apiece. And on rooftops
everywhere,

37:37.655 --> 37:42.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plastic cisterns stored extra
water to ride
out the rationing.

37:42.794 --> 37:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For many businesses, such as
this seafood
restaurant and bar, the drought
made life

37:47.298 --> 37:53.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more difficult and more
expensive. Employees
washed dishes the old-fashioned
way. Plastic

37:53.171 --> 37:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cups replaced glass ones and the
restaurant
relied on delivered ice.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUIS TORRES, Puerto Rico: Like
you see, it's
brand-new.

38:00.612 --> 38:05.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: Outside, manager
Luis Torres showed
us two new 600-gallon cisterns
that stored

38:06.017 --> 38:08.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
water for the days when it
wasn't available.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How important is water to your
business?

38:10.822 --> 38:17.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUIS TORRES: We can't run if we
don't have
water. If we want to open the
doors, we have

38:17.862 --> 38:19.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to have water.

38:19.697 --> 38:24.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: Many of the island's
tourist resorts
were relatively unaffected,
because their

38:24.102 --> 38:28.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
water flows from a remote
aqueduct, not local
reservoirs.

38:28.573 --> 38:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the lack of water took its
toll on agriculture.
The drought dried up the
pastures where cattle

38:33.745 --> 38:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
typically graze. In much of the
country, milk
production fell. This farm grows
plantains,

38:39.951 --> 38:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mangoes, avocados and other
fruit.

38:43.188 --> 38:47.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But farmer Daniel Cadenas says
the dry weather
stunted their growth.

38:47.058 --> 38:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL CADENAS, Farmer: There
might be as
many fruit maybe, but they tend
to be smaller.

38:52.897 --> 38:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then a lot of things can
die. Let's say,
the platanos, usually, they
definitely need

38:57.802 --> 38:59.537 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
water.

38:59.571 --> 39:00.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSE MOLINELLI-FREYTES,
University of Puerto
Rico: These two sections are the
ones that

39:00.905 --> 39:02.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are very dry.

39:02.707 --> 39:06.144 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
CHRIS BURY: Jose
Molinelli-Freytes, a professor
of environmental science at the
University

39:06.177 --> 39:13.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Puerto Rico, blamed a
confluence of factors,
including El Nino, the unusually
warm currents

39:13.484 --> 39:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Pacific that affect
weather globally
and reduce precipitation in the
Caribbean.

39:18.656 --> 39:24.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another factor, hot dust from
the Sahara Desert
that dissipates storm clouds
before they reach

39:24.195 --> 39:26.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Puerto Rico, all part of a
changing climate.

39:26.664 --> 39:31.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE MOLINELLI-FREYTES: The
models predict,
for example, that, for the
Caribbean, we're

39:31.469 --> 39:37.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to have 20 percent
reduction in rainfall
by the middle of the century.
And it will

39:37.575 --> 39:39.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be intensifying.

39:39.344 --> 39:43.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: And that, he says,
doesn't bode
well for Puerto Rico's aging and
crumbling

39:43.348 --> 39:49.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water system, that the dams need
maintenance,
that the reservoirs have too
much silt and

39:49.320 --> 39:54.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sediment, reducing their
capacity, and that
old water pipes routinely
springs leaks, such

39:54.492 --> 39:57.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as this one bubbling up on a
city street.

39:57.128 --> 40:00.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE MOLINELLI-FREYTES: When it
is pumped
through the distribution system,
more than

40:00.598 --> 40:05.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
half of the water is lost due to
aging infrastructure
and leaking.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: More than half?

40:06.337 --> 40:08.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSE MOLINELLI-FREYTES: More
than half.

40:08.139 --> 40:11.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: But Puerto Rico,
suffering from
a recession and deep in debt, is
too starved

40:11.576 --> 40:16.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for cash to even partially plug
the leaks.
And the rationing drained
revenue from the

40:16.514 --> 40:19.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
island's water utility, which is
headed by
Alberto Lazaro.

40:19.884 --> 40:22.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALBERTO LAZARO, Puerto Rico
Aqueduct and Sewer
Authority: It's costing us quite
a bit. It's

40:22.787 --> 40:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
costing us about $12 million per
month. That
cost is mostly income or
revenues that are

40:30.828 --> 40:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not being received, because, if
we are shutting
off services for two days at a
time, then

40:36.034 --> 40:37.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people are going to use less
water.

40:37.869 --> 40:42.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: Dehuel and Jessica
Torres told
us the drought was another
burden to shoulder

40:42.140 --> 40:46.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a difficult economy, one more
reason they
have thought about leaving for
the mainland

40:46.744 --> 40:48.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

40:48.746 --> 40:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA TORRES: With this
situation of uncertainty
that we're experiencing right
now, the drought,

40:53.217 --> 40:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government not actually
helping us, it
creates a lot of uncertainty in
the people.

40:58.690 --> 41:02.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people might say they have
the option.
We're not in another country. We
have the

41:02.760 --> 41:04.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
option. We're American citizens.

41:04.529 --> 41:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: Even the scientist
who studies
the climate here was counting on
nature to

41:08.700 --> 41:09.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intervene.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is Puerto Rico praying for a
good hurricane?

41:11.703 --> 41:15.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE MOLINELLI-FREYTES: I will
say that a
good hurricane that pass by and
brings a lot

41:16.007 --> 41:19.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of rain, that will be a
blessing, if that
occurs.

41:19.711 --> 41:25.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS BURY: The late summer
storms did dump
enough rain on Puerto Rico so
that the water

41:25.049 --> 41:31.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authority eventually ended the
rationing.
But now the dry season has
begun, and Puerto

41:31.055 --> 41:35.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rico will need more rain next
year to prevent
another drought that will send
the residents

41:35.727 --> 41:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of this tropical island
scrambling for that
most precious commodity: clean,
fresh water.

41:42.166 --> 41:52.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm Chris Bury for "PBS
NewsHour" in Carolina,
Puerto Rico.

41:52.210 --> 41:58.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm Chris Bury for "PBS
NewsHour" in Carolina,
Puerto Rico.

41:58.383 --> 42:03.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When the 2015
National Book Awards
were announced last month, Robin
Coste Lewis,

42:03.588 --> 42:08.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fellow at the University of
Southern California,
was awarded the poetry prize for
her first

42:08.993 --> 42:12.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
collection of poems, "Voyage of
the Sable
Venus."

42:12.563 --> 42:16.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeff is back with their
conversation, conducted
at the Miami Book Festival.

42:16.300 --> 42:20.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There are many
personal poems
in this.

42:20.505 --> 42:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS, National Book
Award for
Poetry Winner: Yes.

42:22.407 --> 42:25.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But the long poem
that anchors
the collection, the "Voyage of
the Sable Venus,"

42:25.610 --> 42:26.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has a very particular focus,
right?

42:26.711 --> 42:28.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Yes.

42:28.246 --> 42:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The history of
African-American
women, their bodies in art.

42:31.449 --> 42:33.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Yes.

42:33.217 --> 42:37.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's actually the history of
black female
bodies in art. So, that's part
of why I did

42:37.588 --> 42:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the project. It exceeds the
national boundaries
and even the history of America
by several

42:42.326 --> 42:47.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millennia. It goes back even to
38,000 years,
into prehistoric images of black
female figures.

42:47.265 --> 42:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And why? Why did
you want to
explore that?

42:49.333 --> 42:52.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Well, I
didn't want it
to go back that far. I didn't
know that would

42:52.870 --> 42:53.371 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happen.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

42:55.139 --> 42:58.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: And then once
I started
doing research -- and I have a
background

42:58.643 --> 43:01.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in ancient languages, and so, of
course, I
went into the ancient world as
well to see

43:01.813 --> 43:03.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what was going on there.

43:03.614 --> 43:11.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, I found images
of black women
in subservient positions, or as
the tripod

43:11.055 --> 43:15.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a lamp, or the handle of a
razor blade
or handle of a knife. And I
thought, well,

43:15.293 --> 43:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how far back does it go? How
long have we
been doing this to each other?
That was my

43:19.063 --> 43:21.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
primary question.

43:21.432 --> 43:26.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And everywhere I looked,
regardless of the
time period or the continent, it
was happening.

43:26.237 --> 43:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so then I couldn't look
away. I had to
keep going.

43:28.172 --> 43:33.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But why is that
poetry? Why
through poetry? Because that's a
huge subject.

43:33.044 --> 43:33.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a fascinating, important
subject.

43:34.011 --> 43:35.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Right. Right.

43:35.480 --> 43:36.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:36.347 --> 43:38.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But why through
poetry?

43:38.082 --> 43:41.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Because
poetry is song.
Poetry, first and foremost, is
the lyric.

43:41.919 --> 43:43.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's the music.

43:43.788 --> 43:48.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And epic is one of the oldest
forms we have
as human beings. And I thought
that it would

43:48.759 --> 43:59.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be really helpful and also
mirror the history
itself if I showed -- if I tried
to capture

43:59.203 --> 44:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this history of how we have
looked at black
women visually in epic form.

44:05.576 --> 44:10.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It made sense to me, as opposed
to writing,
say, an essay. I mean, essays
are fine. I

44:10.515 --> 44:17.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
love them. And I write them as
well. But to
do it with poem, it's like
poetry is almost

44:17.221 --> 44:21.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
primordial for us, like
breathing. Everybody
-- lullabies. You know, we all
know what it

44:21.659 --> 44:23.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
means to be sung to.

44:23.494 --> 44:27.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And poetry is very close to
that. So, I wanted
do it that way, so I could keep
my reader

44:27.098 --> 44:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close. I didn't want to put
distance between
me and my reader.

44:29.901 --> 44:32.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Voyage of the
Sable Venus is
an actual -- is a painting,
right?

44:32.403 --> 44:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: It's an
etching, yes, from
the 18th century, 1787, I think.

44:35.039 --> 44:36.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: An etching, yes.

44:36.874 --> 44:42.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A kind of allegory of a black
woman on the
passage, right, from Africa to
the Caribbean?

44:42.513 --> 44:44.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Right. Right.

44:44.181 --> 44:48.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a redux of Botticelli's
Venus on
the Half Shell, but, in this
case, it's a

44:48.719 --> 44:54.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black woman on the clam shell.
And she's being
drawn to the water by Cupid and
Triton or

44:54.125 --> 45:00.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neptune. I'm not sure. But
instead of Neptune
having a trident, right, he has
a slab of

45:00.097 --> 45:03.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the (INAUDIBLE) so it turns out
to be a pro-slavery
image.

45:03.868 --> 45:08.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is based on a poem, also
"Voyage of
the Sable Venus," titled "Voyage
of the Sable

45:08.072 --> 45:13.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Venus," that speaks about how --
it's a pro-rape
poem. It's disgusting, how to
rape a white

45:13.744 --> 45:19.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman or a black woman slave at
night is the
same, because you can't see
their bodies,

45:19.317 --> 45:21.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1782.

45:21.085 --> 45:25.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I heard the title,
"Voyage of the
Sable Venus," this is the whole
experience

45:25.222 --> 45:28.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of looking at that experience,
where you're
both completely compelled --
it's a gorgeous

45:28.893 --> 45:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
image -- until you realize that
it's pro-slavery.

45:33.464 --> 45:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the title itself was so
gorgeous
to me, "Voyage of the Sable
Venus." Right?

45:38.502 --> 45:45.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the complete contradiction
of what the
image performed and what the
title said seemed

45:45.476 --> 45:50.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me to be a cue to look
further. And so
the more I looked and the more
titles I found,

45:50.581 --> 45:52.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the weirder it got and the more
interesting
it got.

45:52.883 --> 45:58.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you -- is it
important for
you, at least for you work, that
poetry connect

45:58.189 --> 46:01.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with things, with history,
with...

46:01.092 --> 46:02.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Yes, it is.

46:03.027 --> 46:04.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes?

46:04.362 --> 46:06.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Yes, because,
I mean, this
is just me, right?

46:06.931 --> 46:10.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not saying that all poets
should do this,
but I feel like I'm here in the
body at a

46:10.501 --> 46:11.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particular time, right?

46:11.902 --> 46:13.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

46:13.771 --> 46:20.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: And that time
is completely
impacted by very large and very
small movements

46:20.711 --> 46:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by human beings, whether it's on
grand historical
scale like wars, or small
historical scales

46:26.517 --> 46:28.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like, I had a baby.

46:28.653 --> 46:35.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All those things are about our
time. They're
all impacted by how we treat
each other, how

46:35.459 --> 46:39.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we live in the world. So it's
important to
me that that be reflected in my
work, for

46:39.263 --> 46:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure. Otherwise, I feel like I'm
wasting the
reader's time. I don't want to
waste my readers'

46:43.100 --> 46:46.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time ever. My readers are very
important to
me.

46:46.337 --> 46:52.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if I'm going to -- I don't
want to pretend
that they're not there. I don't
want my work

46:52.643 --> 46:55.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pretend that they're not
there. I want
them to know at, every moment,
I'm thinking

46:55.880 --> 47:01.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them. I don't necessarily
need to please
them. I don't necessarily need
to entertain

47:01.052 --> 47:03.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them, but I take very seriously,
with great
respect.

47:03.587 --> 47:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Engage them.

47:04.455 --> 47:06.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: With great
respect.

47:06.290 --> 47:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also assume that my
readers have great
intelligence, so I also don't
want to talk

47:09.326 --> 47:13.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down to them. And so all those
things go into
how I present the work on the
page.

47:13.564 --> 47:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And who do you
look to for
influences?

47:15.866 --> 47:17.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Oh, that's
such a hard
question.

47:17.868 --> 47:18.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes?

47:18.836 --> 47:20.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Yes.

47:20.638 --> 47:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, who don't I look to for
influences.
On the one hand I look to, you
know, visual

47:26.944 --> 47:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
artists. And there is a long
list of those
people. And then there's
musicians, with whom

47:31.482 --> 47:37.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't live out, Shirley Holme
(ph), Charlie
Parker. I don't know. You name
it. Astor Piazzolla,

47:37.221 --> 47:38.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
someone was talking about his
work today.

47:38.723 --> 47:40.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:40.524 --> 47:47.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: And I look to
poets, sure,
but it's just a large, lush,
saturated field

47:47.631 --> 47:49.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that I go to.

47:49.333 --> 47:53.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Toni Morrison was a big
influence on my work
since I was a teenager, what she
did with

47:53.604 --> 47:59.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
English. I joke that I think she
speaks 20
Englishes simultaneously, that
she knows how

47:59.543 --> 48:03.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do that. It's just huge. It's
a long list,
yes.

48:03.280 --> 48:07.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Robin
Coste Lewis,
her book, the "Voyage of the
Sable Venus,"

48:07.251 --> 48:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
winner of the National Book
Award for Poetry.

48:09.820 --> 48:13.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Thank you.

48:13.657 --> 48:15.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Congratulations.

48:15.960 --> 48:21.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBIN COSTE LEWIS: Thank you so
much.

48:21.332 --> 48:25.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Thanks a lot.

48:25.169 --> 48:29.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now we turn to
one of our
"NewsHour" Essays.

48:29.707 --> 48:35.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women in this country earn just
over 57 percent
of bachelor's degrees in all
fields, yet they

48:35.446 --> 48:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
receive less than 20 percent of
degrees conferred
in computer science, engineering
and physics.

48:39.817 --> 48:47.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A recent study by the American
Association
of University Women also found
that, in 2013,

48:47.057 --> 48:53.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
26 percent of all computing jobs
were held
by women, a drop from 35 percent
in 1990.

48:53.898 --> 48:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We asked Eileen Pollack, one of
the first
two women to receive a
bachelor's of science

48:58.135 --> 49:03.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
degree in physics at Yale, and
who now teaches
creative writing at the
University of Michigan,

49:03.474 --> 49:09.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to share an idea from her latest
book, "The
Only Woman in the Room: Why
Science Is Still

49:09.280 --> 49:10.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a Boys' Club."

49:10.581 --> 49:12.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's an encore look.

49:12.383 --> 49:13.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EILEEN POLLACK, Author, "The
Only Woman in
the Room: Why Science Is Still a
Boys' Club":

49:13.717 --> 49:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was growing up, I wanted
passionately
to be a physicist.

49:17.888 --> 49:22.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in seventh grade, the
principal wouldn't
let me enter the accelerated
track in science

49:22.326 --> 49:27.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and math. "Girls never go on to
careers in
those subjects," he told my
mother. "Besides,"

49:27.932 --> 49:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he said, "getting skipped ahead
in science
and math would ruin my social
life."

49:32.970 --> 49:40.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, I arrived at Yale
in 1974 far
behind my male classmates. I
failed my first

49:40.244 --> 49:45.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
physics midterm, and my parents
urged me to
switch majors. But I worked
incredibly hard

49:46.016 --> 49:52.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and didn't give up. Four years
later, I graduated
with a nearly perfect GPA, an A
in a graduate

49:52.523 --> 49:57.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
course in gravitational theory,
and two original
research papers.

49:57.761 --> 50:04.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even so, I didn't go on. As
ridiculous as
it seems now, I assumed that if
I were talented

50:04.401 --> 50:09.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough to apply to graduate
school, one of
my professors would have let me
know.

50:09.340 --> 50:15.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, I have done a lot of
research
on gender bias in the sciences,
and I'm sorry

50:15.546 --> 50:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to report not much has changed.
When parents
ask why there are still so few
girls in advanced

50:22.019 --> 50:27.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
science and math classes in high
school, I
tell them, because girls still
need way more

50:27.324 --> 50:30.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
encouragement than boys to take
those courses.

50:30.861 --> 50:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We still raise girls to look to
other people
for assurance they are
attractive and smart,

50:36.033 --> 50:41.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
while boys are raised to
determine their own
value. Many girls are still made
to feel it's

50:41.338 --> 50:43.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not feminine to be good at
science or math.

50:43.741 --> 50:49.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if a girl complains about
how hard her
AP calculus course is, her
parents are more

50:49.747 --> 50:56.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likely to let her drop it than
if her brother
voices the same complaint. As a
result, by

50:56.053 --> 51:01.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time they get to college,
most girls won't,
or can't, sign up for rigorous
courses in

51:01.725 --> 51:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
science or math. Those who do
often find themselves
unprepared or lacking in
confidence.

51:09.867 --> 51:15.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What delivers the one-two punch
that knocks
so many women and minorities out
of STEM fields

51:15.139 --> 51:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that scientists have this
strange belief
that, if you need to be
encouraged, you aren't

51:20.377 --> 51:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talented or dedicated enough to
be one of
them. If you flunk your first
physics or calculus

51:26.016 --> 51:29.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
midterm, you deserve to be
weeded out.

51:29.119 --> 51:34.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they don't realize is that
young women
and students of color grow up in
a society

51:34.892 --> 51:40.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that fails to encourage and
often actively
discourages them from thinking
of themselves

51:40.197 --> 51:45.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as scientists. Ask most people
to picture
a physicist, and they will
imagine Albert

51:45.703 --> 51:50.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Einstein or Sheldon from "The
Big Bang Theory."

51:50.140 --> 51:56.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My parents didn't know how to
provide me with
the encouragement I needed to
achieve my dreams.

51:56.080 --> 52:01.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the solution isn't rocket
science. If
your daughter finds herself in a
course designed

52:01.218 --> 52:07.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to weed her out, cheer her on,
urge her to
seek extra help, and give her a
giant pat

52:07.257 --> 52:17.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the back for having made it
so far, despite
all the discouragement she
already has overcome.

52:18.002 --> 52:26.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And a news update
before we leave
you.

52:26.210 --> 52:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former New York Governor George
Pataki is
dropping his 2016 presidential
bid. Pataki

52:33.417 --> 52:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reportedly told supporters today
he is suspending
his campaign. And he will air a
special message

52:38.422 --> 52:43.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New Hampshire, Iowa and South
Carolina
later tonight. He is the fifth
Republican

52:43.193 --> 52:46.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to drop out, leaving 12 in the
race.

52:46.930 --> 52:52.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online, 38
million people
are expected to fly U.S.
airlines this holiday

52:52.302 --> 52:57.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
season. That demand increases
the likelihood
you might get bumped, even when
you have a

52:57.775 --> 53:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confirmed reservation. But there
is one carrier
that lets you decide how much
your seat and

53:03.447 --> 53:09.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your time is worth. See how
Delta lets its
