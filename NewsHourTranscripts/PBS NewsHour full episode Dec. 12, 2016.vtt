JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.572 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.474 --> 00:11.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: As
the CIA concludes
Russia acted to sway the U.S.
election in

00:11.945 --> 00:16.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's favor, we talk
with one of
the bipartisan group of senators
calling for

00:16.817 --> 00:18.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an investigation.

00:18.685 --> 00:23.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: the future of Obamacare --
Health and
Human Services Secretary
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /Sylvia

00:23.557 --> 00:27.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Burwell on the fate of the
president's signature
law under a Trump
administration.

00:27.928 --> 00:31.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL, U.S.
Health and Human
Services Secretary: It's like a
game of Jenga,

00:31.398 --> 00:35.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where you have the puzzle
pieces, and if you
pull one out, the thing will
topple.

00:35.736 --> 00:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the Music
City feels the
pressure -- how Nashville's
booming housing

00:44.378 --> 00:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
market is threatening its
historic culture.

00:46.980 --> 00:49.616 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
AUBREY PRESTON,
Developer/Philanthropist:
I believe in Music City.

00:49.650 --> 00:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be the equivalent of,
in Egypt, them
allowing one of their three
pyramids or something

00:55.355 --> 00:56.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be torn down.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just an impossibility that
this building
would be torn down.

00:59.059 --> 01:06.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:06.900 --> 01:09.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.736 --> 01:19.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's a split
tonight between
Donald Trump and his own
Republican Party,

01:19.713 --> 01:25.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at issue, serious allegations
that the Russians
were playing spy games during
the presidential

01:25.319 --> 01:26.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:28.255 --> 01:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Top congressional
Republicans put
themselves at odds with
president-elect Trump

01:33.060 --> 01:38.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
today, calling for
investigations into possible
Russian attempts to influence
the election.

01:38.198 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: Obviously,
any foreign breach of
cyber-security measures

01:41.969 --> 01:46.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are disturbing, and I strongly
condemn any
such efforts.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, let me just speak for
myself.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Russians are not our
friends.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I think
it's just another excuse.

01:53.814 --> 01:58.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On Sunday, Mr. Trump
dismissed
the CIA's conclusion that the
Russians were

01:58.151 --> 02:01.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to help him win as
ridiculous.

02:01.221 --> 02:04.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He pointed to apparent
disagreements between
the spy agency and the FBI.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I have great
respect for them.

02:07.060 --> 02:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you read the stories, the
various stories,
they're disputing.

02:12.766 --> 02:16.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And certain groups don't
necessarily agree.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Personally, it could be Russia.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It -- I don't really think it
is.

02:20.841 --> 02:21.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But who knows?

02:21.842 --> 02:22.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't know either.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't know and I don't
know.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning, he
tweeted that:
"If the election results were
the opposite

02:27.881 --> 02:34.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and we tried to play the
Russia/CIA card,
it would be called conspiracy
theory."

02:34.621 --> 02:39.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia is also an issue with a
potential secretary
of state in the Trump
administration, ExxonMobil

02:39.893 --> 02:41.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CEO Rex Tillerson.

02:42.029 --> 02:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's done a lot of business
there and has
close ties to President Vladimir
Putin.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a reason for concern, say
some Senate
Republicans, including John
McCain.

02:50.637 --> 02:52.339 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:52.372 --> 02:54.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: Maybe
those ties
are strictly commercial and got
to do with

02:54.875 --> 02:57.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his business in the oil
business.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Fine.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we will give him a fair
hearing.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But is it a matter of concern?

03:02.883 --> 03:04.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Certainly, it should be a matter
of concern.

03:04.785 --> 03:09.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, the
president-elect's
challenge to the longstanding
U.S. one-China

03:09.689 --> 03:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy brought a stern warning
from the Chinese
Foreign Ministry.

03:13.727 --> 03:17.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENG SHUANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesperson
(through translator): I want to
stress that

03:17.464 --> 03:21.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Taiwan issue involves
China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity.

03:21.101 --> 03:26.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If such a foundation is
disrupted and undermined,
the sound and steady growth of
our relations

03:26.173 --> 03:28.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would be impossible.

03:28.041 --> 03:32.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Mr. Trump
officially named
his choice for secretary of
homeland security,

03:32.512 --> 03:38.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retired Marine Four-Star General
John Kelly,
a veteran of four decades in the
Corps.

03:38.251 --> 03:43.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kelly most recently headed U.S.
Southern Command,
overseeing military operations
in Central

03:43.857 --> 03:45.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and South America.

03:45.692 --> 03:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In that role, he also worked
with Homeland
Security to stop the smuggling
of immigrants.

03:50.564 --> 03:56.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the third general Mr. Trump
has picked
for a major post, but he is also
a Gold Star

03:56.169 --> 03:57.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
parent.

03:57.604 --> 04:01.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His son, a Marine 1st
lieutenant, was killed
in Afghanistan in 2010.

04:01.808 --> 04:06.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect also named
Goldman Sachs
president Gary Cohn to head the
White House

04:06.746 --> 04:09.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
National Economic Council.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:11.451 --> 04:15.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And two
developments in election
recounts today.

04:15.122 --> 04:22.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge refused to order
one in Pennsylvania,
as Green Party candidate Jill
Stein wanted.

04:22.195 --> 04:25.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And a new tally ended in
Wisconsin, with little
change.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump won both states.

04:28.335 --> 04:33.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among those voicing concern
about Russia's
attempts to influence the
presidential election,

04:33.206 --> 04:38.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bipartisan group of senators
who called
for an investigation into the
cyber-attacks

04:38.778 --> 04:42.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they say should alarm every
American.

04:42.516 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jack Reed, the ranking member of
the Senate
Armed Services Committee is one
of those senators,

04:47.354 --> 04:50.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he says he has no reason to
doubt the
CIA's conclusions.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK REED (D), Rhode Island:
They definitely
intervened in the election.

04:54.227 --> 05:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They collected information
against both Democrats
and Republicans, and they seemed
to only have

05:00.534 --> 05:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
released information with
respect to the Democratic
candidate.

05:05.539 --> 05:09.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The motivation, that is
something that we're
going to continue to probe.

05:09.643 --> 05:16.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it seems -- it seems that
they were interested
in disrupting the Democratic
campaign as much

05:16.783 --> 05:18.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as they could.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You don't have
any question
about that conclusion?

05:20.220 --> 05:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because the FBI, as you know,
it's reported
that they are holding back on
ascribing a

05:24.624 --> 05:25.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
motive here.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.460 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:27.494 --> 05:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK REED: Well, there is a
difference between
a motive and what happened on
the ground,

05:31.498 --> 05:33.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if you will.

05:33.300 --> 05:38.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What seems to be clear is that
they had been
able to enter into the computer
systems of

05:38.371 --> 05:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both the Republicans and the
Democrats, and
that they through proxies
disseminated information

05:44.411 --> 05:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the Democratic candidate,
didn't in
any significant way do so with
the Republicans.

05:49.115 --> 05:54.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Could you question motivations,
but it seems
clear that they had a goal and
objective to

05:54.287 --> 05:58.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
provide information that would
be detrimental
to the Democratic candidate.

05:58.692 --> 06:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what other
explanation
could there be other than
wanting to help

06:02.195 --> 06:03.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump?

06:03.396 --> 06:05.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:05.165 --> 06:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK REED: It -- the only other
plausible
explanation would be just so to
sow general

06:09.603 --> 06:11.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
confusion.

06:11.438 --> 06:16.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at some point, they clearly
seem to suggest
a preference in terms of who
they were going

06:16.710 --> 06:20.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to attack or provide detrimental
information
about.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was the Democratic
candidate.

06:22.616 --> 06:26.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What does this
represent to
you, Senator Reed, as somebody
who has looked

06:26.586 --> 06:28.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at intelligence for as long as
you have?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:30.790 --> 06:35.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK REED: Well, it demonstrates
the practice
that the Russians have of
surreptitiously

06:35.895 --> 06:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using cyber and other techniques
to involve
themselves in elections, to
distort elections.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It happened overseas.

06:44.671 --> 06:48.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now, unfortunately, it has
happened dramatically
in the United States.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we have to be aware of
this.

06:50.110 --> 06:55.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is why Senator McCain and I
are working
to set up a subcommittee to look
at this issue,

06:55.649 --> 07:02.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but longer term to look at the
cyber-capabilities
of Russia in many different
dimensions.

07:02.956 --> 07:08.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the first issue is trying to
get all the
facts that we can out about
their participation

07:08.862 --> 07:14.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this election cycle, because
we have to
be able to show the American
public that in

07:14.167 --> 07:20.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two years or at any time in the
future, our
elections are not determined by
surreptitious

07:20.340 --> 07:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activity of foreign intelligence
services;
they're determined by the
voters.

07:23.943 --> 07:28.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I'm sure,
as you know,
the president-elect, Donald
Trump, is saying

07:28.281 --> 07:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he doesn't believe that the
Russians did this.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says he's not at all sure
they did the
hacking.

07:33.520 --> 07:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says it could have been a man
sitting on
a bed somewhere.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you -- what do you say to
his reaction
to all this?

07:42.696 --> 07:44.197 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:44.230 --> 07:48.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK REED: Well, it seems quite
obvious that
this was done by the Russians.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our intelligence services have
indicated it.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have done so very
carefully.

07:53.473 --> 07:57.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To disregard the obvious is not
a good trait
in a leader in any situation.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To disregard the
obvious?

08:00.447 --> 08:01.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:01.514 --> 08:02.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JACK REED: Yes.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, do you want
to elaborate
on that?

08:05.385 --> 08:07.187 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK REED: Well, it seems that
the facts are
overwhelming that there is the
involvement

08:10.490 --> 08:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Russians in the election,
the involvement
not only in terms of penetrating
Democratic

08:18.164 --> 08:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operatives and organizations,
but also, as
the intelligence community
concluded also,

08:22.001 --> 08:23.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Republican National
Committee.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, they were involved.

08:24.604 --> 08:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that seems to be not an
issue of contention.

08:28.541 --> 08:34.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to simply deny that is to
deny what to
me appears increasingly to be
obvious, a fact.

08:34.881 --> 08:40.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, what
would be different
between the investigation that
you and some

08:40.320 --> 08:45.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican senators are calling
for and the
investigation that President
Obama has called

08:45.425 --> 08:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for inside the administration to
be done by
the inauguration?

08:48.027 --> 08:49.863 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:49.896 --> 08:55.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK REED: Well, the president
is able to
use the intelligence agencies
and other agencies

08:55.602 --> 09:02.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vet the information, to
protect sources
and methods, to come up with all
that could

09:02.208 --> 09:03.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
released to the public.

09:03.743 --> 09:06.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our investigation, I hope, will
build off
of that.

09:06.546 --> 09:12.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I hope the document the
president us is available,
so we have a common base of
facts and knowledge.

09:12.685 --> 09:19.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from there, we can ask other
questions
that I think are relevant going
forward: What

09:19.959 --> 09:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can we do to prevent this in the
future?

09:21.728 --> 09:29.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think also it raises again the
issue that
has been so contentious over the
last several

09:29.135 --> 09:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months about the president-elect
being much
more open and candid in his
financial dealings,

09:35.241 --> 09:40.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that there is absolutely no
question of
any type of bias towards any
institution or

09:40.513 --> 09:41.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
individual or country.

09:41.881 --> 09:44.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, two other
questions.

09:44.150 --> 09:49.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, what should the U.S. do
if this is
proven that the Russians did
this hacking

09:49.756 --> 09:54.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and if they did it for the
reason that it
appears that they did?

09:54.561 --> 09:56.296 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:56.329 --> 09:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK REED: Well, first, I think
forewarned
is forearmed, where the American
people will

09:59.966 --> 10:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be aware of the tactics, the
techniques and
the motivations, if we can
determine them

10:06.873 --> 10:08.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conclusively of the Russians.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That will be useful.

10:10.310 --> 10:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, second, there is the
ability to take
action against them.

10:14.414 --> 10:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, we have sanctions in
place because
of their assault on the Crimea,
because of

10:19.686 --> 10:22.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their destabilizing activities
in the Crimea.

10:22.689 --> 10:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If this raises that level, we
could certainly
consider something like that.

10:26.125 --> 10:33.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think also in terms of
international criticism,
this is something they have done
in the past

10:34.000 --> 10:36.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in other countries.

10:36.269 --> 10:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If this is their method of
operation, we have
to be able to, I think, enlist
the aid and

10:42.742 --> 10:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the support of other countries,
our European
allies and across the globe.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would be something that
will would send
a strong message that this will
not be tolerated

10:51.618 --> 10:53.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the United States, nor by
other countries.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Final question,
Senator Reed.

10:55.722 --> 11:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, what is your
reaction to president-elect
saying in an interview yesterday
that he isn't

11:02.395 --> 11:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking all the intelligence
briefings that
he has been offered because --
quote -- "I'm,

11:07.267 --> 11:08.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like, a smart person.

11:08.968 --> 11:13.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't have to be told the same
thing in
the same words every single day
for the next

11:13.306 --> 11:14.274 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eight years"?

11:14.307 --> 11:16.009 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:16.042 --> 11:22.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK REED: I think that is not a
sensible
way to approach the issues that
the president

11:22.315 --> 11:23.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has to deal with.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Things change almost
instantaneously.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Situation arise.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Context is important.

11:29.522 --> 11:35.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also critically important
that you are
so involved in the intelligence
cycle as the

11:35.061 --> 11:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president that you are able to
be able to
judge adequately when someone
presents a viewpoint

11:41.801 --> 11:43.202 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to you.

11:43.236 --> 11:48.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A periodic sort of quick study,
if you will,
is not going to work.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It takes that constant exposure.

11:50.643 --> 11:55.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's not a good
leadership for
-- particularly for a president,
to simply

11:55.448 --> 11:59.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, I know it all, I will just
take a little
refresher course once in a
while.

11:59.986 --> 12:04.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Jack
Reed, the ranking
Democrat on the Armed Services
Committee,

12:04.624 --> 12:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thank you very much for talking
with us.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JACK REED: Thanks, Judy.

12:08.962 --> 12:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will
debate Russia's
actions with a former director
of the CIA

12:12.265 --> 12:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and former ambassador to Russia
in the Obama
administration after the news
summary.

12:17.403 --> 12:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Syrian
rebels all
but collapsed in the city of
Aleppo, and the

12:21.975 --> 12:26.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
army of President Bashar
al-Assad appeared
on the verge of recapturing the
city.

12:27.013 --> 12:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By day's end, the military said
it now controls
99 percent of Eastern Aleppo,
once a rebel

12:34.020 --> 12:36.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stronghold.

12:36.055 --> 12:40.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nonstop bombing overnight
reduced more buildings
to rubble, and heavy shelling
continued throughout

12:40.426 --> 12:41.394 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the day.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The rebels were left with a tiny
enclave.

12:43.296 --> 12:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Turkey, police roundups were
in full swing
today across Turkey after twin
bombings killed

12:49.802 --> 12:53.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
44 people in Istanbul on
Saturday.

12:53.072 --> 13:00.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials detained 235 people
who police said
were linked to the outlawed
Kurdish separatist

13:00.146 --> 13:01.914 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
party.

13:01.948 --> 13:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, scores of protesters
marched in
Istanbul to denounce the
bombings, and President

13:05.985 --> 13:11.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited the
soccer stadium
where the attack took place.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The United Nations has a new
secretary-general.

13:14.327 --> 13:19.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The former prime minister of
Portugal, Antonio
Guterres, was sworn in today.

13:19.198 --> 13:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Guterres has also served as U.N.
high commissioner
of refugees, and he vowed today
to streamline

13:25.738 --> 13:28.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
operations to meet humanitarian
needs.

13:28.608 --> 13:32.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES, United Nations
Secretary-General:
It benefits no one if it takes
nine months

13:32.078 --> 13:35.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to deploy a staff member to the
field.

13:35.348 --> 13:41.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United Nations needs to be
nimble, efficient
and effective.

13:41.621 --> 13:48.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It must focus more on delivery
and less on
process, more on people and less
on bureaucracy.

13:48.428 --> 13:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Guterres will
officially take
office January 1.

13:52.632 --> 13:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He succeeds Ban Ki-Moon, who
served 10 years
as secretary-general.

13:56.769 --> 14:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities in Britain and
Greece announced
today that they have broken up a
network that

14:01.407 --> 14:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moved hundreds of migrants into
Europe.

14:04.077 --> 14:08.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The gang supplied lost or stolen
passports
and travel documents.

14:08.281 --> 14:13.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, rescuers pulled
nearly 1,200 people
from the Mediterranean
yesterday.

14:13.553 --> 14:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 4,700 have died trying
to make the
crossing this year.

14:19.726 --> 14:24.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, an Arctic
front pushed
into the Northeast and New
England after blowing

14:24.697 --> 14:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
across the Great Lakes and Upper
Midwest.

14:27.166 --> 14:32.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The storm made morning commutes
treacherous
from Pennsylvania on up to
Maine, where two

14:32.138 --> 14:33.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people died.

14:33.973 --> 14:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, parts of Michigan got
more than
10 inches of snow, forcing
hundreds of schools

14:39.078 --> 14:40.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to close.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDY WILLIAMS, Detroit Resident:
This is a
bad snow.

14:41.647 --> 14:42.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's real wet.

14:42.648 --> 14:44.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It came down real soft.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.318 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It came down.

14:45.351 --> 14:49.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But over the night, it got warm,
and so now
it's a heavy snow.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's hard to clear off.

14:51.557 --> 14:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not too bad with this, but with
a snowblower
and stuff, it's pretty tough.

14:55.995 --> 15:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later this week,
the system
is expected to send temperatures
15 to 30

15:00.633 --> 15:05.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
degrees below normal in the
Midwest and the
Eastern U.S.

15:05.338 --> 15:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former U.S. Representative Chaka
Fattah was
sentenced to 10 years in prison
today in a

15:10.276 --> 15:12.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
racketeering scheme.

15:12.078 --> 15:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pennsylvania Democrat had
been convicted
of taking an illegal $1 million
loan in a

15:17.850 --> 15:20.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
failed bid for mayor of
Philadelphia.

15:20.520 --> 15:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also used charity funds to
pay down his
son's college loans.

15:25.258 --> 15:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fattah served 20 years in
Congress before
being ousted.

15:29.862 --> 15:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Wall Street mostly
retreated, while the
Dow Jones industrial average
maintained -- or

15:34.233 --> 15:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
managed another new record.

15:36.102 --> 15:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Dow gained 39 points to
close at 19796.

15:41.340 --> 15:47.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Nasdaq fell nearly 32
points, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped two.

15:47.113 --> 15:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

16:14.273 --> 16:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We dig deeper now into the
debate over Russian
hacking and the CIA's conclusion
the goal

16:19.879 --> 16:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was to sway the U.S. election in
Donald Trump's
favor.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we're
joined by two
men with extensive experience
with intelligence

16:28.955 --> 16:30.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and diplomacy.

16:30.456 --> 16:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Woolsey was CIA director
during the
Clinton administration.

16:33.492 --> 16:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now with Booz Allen, one of
the largest
defense and intelligence
contractors.

16:37.230 --> 16:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also serves as a senior
adviser to president-elect
Trump on issues of national
security and intelligence.

16:43.502 --> 16:47.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Michael McFaul was U.S.
ambassador to
Russia during the Obama
administration.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's now a professor of
political science
at Stanford University.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mike McFaul, let me start with
you first.

16:52.411 --> 16:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your reaction to the news that
Russia may
have played an active role in
helping president-elect

16:57.216 --> 16:59.018 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

16:59.051 --> 17:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL, Former U.S.
Ambassador to
Russia: Well, for some of us,
it's not news.

17:01.554 --> 17:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of us have been talking and
writing about
this for many months now,
especially after

17:05.925 --> 17:10.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the hacking of the DNC computers
and the data
dump from WikiLeaks.

17:10.663 --> 17:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the two pieces of news
that are new
is that the intelligence
community is now

17:15.434 --> 17:20.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
claiming that they have evidence
to show that
the Russians gave it to
WikiLeaks.

17:20.406 --> 17:21.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was uncertain.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now we know that.

17:23.142 --> 17:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the second piece is about
the Republican
-- the hacking into the
Republican side.

17:26.913 --> 17:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They now have evidence to show
that.

17:29.548 --> 17:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what it all means to me, to
be clear,
my bottom line is, we need an
independent,

17:35.554 --> 17:38.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bipartisan commission to
investigate this.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not enough for the Obama
administration
to do their review.

17:41.827 --> 17:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, it's not enough to
have hearings
on it at the U.S. Congress.

17:45.464 --> 17:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is way too big to be
handled in those
places.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need to know the facts.

17:50.603 --> 17:54.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, here, I agree with
president-elect Trump
in the piece you played with
him.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said several times, we don't
know.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, as an academic, I want to
know the facts.

17:59.178 --> 18:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the only way you're
going to get
it is if you set up that
commission.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James Woolsey,
do you agree;
is that the right course?

18:05.551 --> 18:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY, Former CIA
Director: I don't
see anything wrong with a
well-assembled commission

18:09.188 --> 18:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going into an important issue.

18:11.324 --> 18:15.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what needs to be focused
on here,
though, from the beginning is
that we have

18:15.328 --> 18:18.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got a couple of different things
going on.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And conflating them causes a lot
of confusion.

18:21.667 --> 18:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is what the Soviets and then
now the Russians
call disinformation,
dezinformatsiya, otherwise

18:27.073 --> 18:29.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
known as lying.

18:29.208 --> 18:34.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they propagate
disinformation throughout
the world on all sorts of
subjects.

18:34.814 --> 18:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they particularly focus on
organizations
and groups that embody values
that they find

18:40.720 --> 18:45.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abhorrent, such as the Catholic
Church and
Judaism.

18:45.958 --> 18:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are apparently moving into
disseminating
disinformation about Western
political parties.

18:54.166 --> 18:59.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not any different in
principle from what
they have been doing for
decades.

18:59.538 --> 19:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's one set of things
that's going
on.

19:03.876 --> 19:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another set of things that
conceivably could
go on is hacking into the
records of the voting

19:11.384 --> 19:13.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in order to change those votes.

19:13.919 --> 19:21.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know that there is any
indication
that we have that this latter is
taking place,

19:21.727 --> 19:26.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
counting people who are dead as
voters and
the sort of things that you read
about in

19:26.265 --> 19:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the American system.

19:28.134 --> 19:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, insofar as someone
says that
the Russians were not
participating in anything

19:40.880 --> 19:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may not be correct, because they
may have
been participating in
disseminating disinformation,

19:46.919 --> 19:55.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but not participating in what
most of us think
of as voting fraud, namely,
counting people

19:55.061 --> 19:56.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who vote who are dead and so
forth.

19:56.662 --> 19:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James Woolsey,
I hear some
hesitation on your part.

19:59.131 --> 20:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you doubt the credibility of
your former
agency in coming to this
conclusion?

20:03.736 --> 20:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: No, I think
they're conflating
-- they may well be conflating
the issues

20:10.209 --> 20:11.677 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

20:11.710 --> 20:15.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One really needs to separate
these out and
talk about them separately.

20:15.581 --> 20:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know what the CIA would
decide.

20:18.951 --> 20:23.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I haven't read anything they
have written
in years on something like
disinformation.

20:23.322 --> 20:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I'm sure they are up to
speed on that.

20:25.991 --> 20:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if one steals some portion
of software
-- or, rather, of material that
has a particular

20:36.402 --> 20:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cant on it hostile to the United
States or
one of its political parties and
then disseminates

20:41.574 --> 20:47.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, I guess you could say that
that was
trying to work the election or
change it in

20:47.346 --> 20:50.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some way through persuading
people with lies.

20:50.382 --> 20:52.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's not what most people
mean by this.

20:52.251 --> 20:59.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What most people mean is
fiddling with the
outcome, having, for example, no
paper trail.

20:59.825 --> 21:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a recount just based on
fingers touching
screens can be extremely
misleading.

21:06.765 --> 21:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About a quarter of our voting
machines in
the United States, very
stupidly, don't have

21:11.270 --> 21:13.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
paper trails.

21:13.139 --> 21:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mike McFaul,
James Woolsey
is drawing this distinction here
on two different

21:16.175 --> 21:19.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kinds of possible interference.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that too generous?

21:20.479 --> 21:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: No, I think
those are good
categories.

21:23.315 --> 21:26.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think both of those categories
need to be
investigated.

21:26.485 --> 21:29.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have personal experience with
that first
category.

21:29.088 --> 21:33.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had lots of disinformation
published about
me when I was ambassador.

21:33.192 --> 21:35.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I want to be clear.

21:35.060 --> 21:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a third category that
Jim was leaving
out, which is stealing data from
the Democratic

21:40.132 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Committee and from John
Podesta,
the chairman of the Hillary
Clinton campaign,

21:46.372 --> 21:51.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then disseminating that
information through
WikiLeaks -- by the way, I want
to underscore,

21:51.577 --> 21:59.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WikiLeaks is a foreign
organization as well
-- and that then having an
impact on the campaign.

21:59.451 --> 22:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most certainly, the people that
worked in
the Clinton campaign think that
the WikiLeaks

22:03.956 --> 22:10.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
data dump was a devastating
impact on their
electoral candidate's prospect
to become president

22:10.162 --> 22:11.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

22:11.964 --> 22:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that was provided by Russia
-- and that
is what we learned over the
weekend -- that

22:15.201 --> 22:20.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is something we need to
investigate, know
the facts, as president-elect
Trump said,

22:20.773 --> 22:26.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then think about what
measures can be
taken so that our election in
2020 is free

22:26.312 --> 22:27.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and fair.

22:27.780 --> 22:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: I agree with Mike
on getting
it clear with what is right.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that's important.

22:34.620 --> 22:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Sanjay, the head of the
WikiLeaks operation
says it wasn't the Russians that
gave him

22:40.593 --> 22:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the material, so there's all
sorts of things
going on here.

22:43.462 --> 22:44.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James
Woolsey...

22:44.697 --> 22:46.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: And the CIA over
the weekend
said it was.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need to know the facts.

22:48.067 --> 22:51.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James Woolsey,
you used
to run the CIA, and you are also
advising

22:51.937 --> 22:53.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president-elect Trump.

22:53.806 --> 22:58.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Have you given them any
guidance, the transition
team or the president-elect's
inner circle,

22:58.377 --> 23:03.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on doing anything other than
debasing the
credibility of the entire
intelligence organization

23:03.449 --> 23:07.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and saying, you know what, these
are the same
people that gave us that weapons
of mass destruction

23:07.086 --> 23:08.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
slam dunk that wasn't?

23:08.854 --> 23:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES WOOLSEY: Well, I have not
talked to
anyone in the campaign in the
last couple

23:12.391 --> 23:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of days, so I haven't talked to
anybody about
this issue.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has just very recently
arisen.

23:18.864 --> 23:23.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My old agency was, of course,
taken very heavily
to task for the weapons of mass
destruction

23:23.769 --> 23:25.604 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

23:25.638 --> 23:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The thing that I think is
interesting is that
two of the three weapons of mass
destruction,

23:28.374 --> 23:31.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
biological and chemical, were in
the hands
of Saddam the whole time.

23:31.343 --> 23:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the third kind that
everybody was particularly
worried about, nuclear, that was
lied about

23:37.283 --> 23:38.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and so forth.

23:38.951 --> 23:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But two-thirds of the types of
weapons of
mass destruction were, in fact,
in Iraq.

23:42.788 --> 23:47.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mike McFaul,
are you concerned
about the potential shadow that
hangs over

23:47.126 --> 23:50.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the information that none of us
have seen,
meaning, it is not just the
Podesta e-mails?

23:50.796 --> 23:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the e-mails that haven't
been released,
whether it's from the RNC or
somewhere else,

23:55.134 --> 23:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that perhaps that could be used
as leverage
in the future?

23:57.803 --> 24:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Yes, of course.

24:02.708 --> 24:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians are very good,
they're one of
the best in the world, at
gathering intelligence.

24:07.613 --> 24:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They do it not just through
hacking, by the
way, but all kinds of different
ways.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we should look at what --
try to look
at what we have.

24:15.020 --> 24:19.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By the way, I don't think we
will ever know
completely what they have.

24:19.058 --> 24:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Any person who ever travels to
Russia or lives
in Russia, like I have, knows
that they are

24:24.129 --> 24:26.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
monitored 24/7 in that country.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we should just try to dig
down to the
facts.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I want to be clear.

24:31.537 --> 24:36.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it doesn't mean that
the Russians
made Trump president.

24:36.175 --> 24:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think many people conflate
that too, that
they say because they tried to
influence the

24:41.146 --> 24:45.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election, they then jump to the
conclusion
that he is only president
because of the Russians.

24:45.284 --> 24:49.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't want to connect those
dots at all
until I know the facts.

24:49.755 --> 24:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even if they didn't produce
this outcome,
right, the fact that they tried,
that they

24:55.661 --> 25:00.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did steal this data, that they
tried to influence
the elections, that's something
we need to

25:00.532 --> 25:01.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigate.

25:01.567 --> 25:04.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, it won't happen in a
partisan
context.

25:04.403 --> 25:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It won't happen if the White
House is the
only one responsible.

25:07.306 --> 25:10.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, we will
have you back
when we have more data to work
with.

25:10.242 --> 25:13.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mike McFaul, James Woolsey,
thank you both.

25:13.846 --> 25:20.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES WOOLSEY: Sure.

25:20.719 --> 25:31.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: the future
of Obamacare
and the many questions about
what will happen

25:31.330 --> 25:33.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to those covered by it now.

25:33.365 --> 25:38.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With less than six weeks left
until Donald
Trump is sworn in as the 45th
president of

25:38.570 --> 25:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States, one of his
most common
campaign pledges remains
constant: ending

25:44.309 --> 25:46.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

25:46.145 --> 25:51.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: First,
we're going to repeal and
replace the disaster

25:51.817 --> 25:52.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
known as Obamacare.

25:52.951 --> 25:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will and must repeal and
replace Obamacare.

25:57.322 --> 26:01.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to repeal and
replace Obamacare
so quickly.

26:01.627 --> 26:06.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
president-elect says the
Affordable Care Act, more
commonly known as

26:06.932 --> 26:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obamacare, will be replaced with
more market-driven
alternatives.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.837 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:11.870 --> 26:16.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM PRICE (R), Georgia: This law
violates
the principles that every
American holds dear

26:16.308 --> 26:18.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when it comes to health care.

26:18.110 --> 26:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's tapped one
of the law's
fiercest critics, Congressman
Tom Price of

26:22.247 --> 26:27.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georgia, to oversee those
efforts as chief
of the department of Health and
Human Services.

26:27.553 --> 26:34.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The law, signed in 2010, has
experienced big
turbulence in recent months,
including double-digit

26:34.726 --> 26:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate increases in many states,
and some insurers
abandoning marketplaces.

26:41.467 --> 26:47.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But unwinding the law may be far
more difficult
than the campaign rhetoric
suggests.

26:47.172 --> 26:53.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's why more than 20 million
Americans now
have insurance, including 11
million covered

26:53.946 --> 26:56.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through an expansion of
Medicaid.

26:56.482 --> 27:02.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While some parts of the law are
unpopular,
such as the individual mandate
and costs for

27:02.087 --> 27:08.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better benefits, one piece that
Mr. Trump
has promised to keep is very
popular.

27:08.694 --> 27:13.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Insurers are barred from
discriminating against
people with preexisting
conditions.

27:13.265 --> 27:19.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, how to guarantee that while
repealing
the law is an open question.

27:19.471 --> 27:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans are divided over a
time frame
for replacing it.

27:23.542 --> 27:26.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell spoke
to that today.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:27.946 --> 27:29.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: We
will move right after the 1st of
the year

27:29.882 --> 27:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on an Obamacare replacement
resolution.

27:34.019 --> 27:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then will work expeditiously
to come up
with a better proposal than
current law.

27:39.958 --> 27:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doing nothing is not an option,
because you
have seen the headlines all
across America

27:45.030 --> 27:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all last year about the status
quo.

27:48.300 --> 27:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Health care
providers and insurers
have warned of potential chaos.

27:53.805 --> 27:59.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, two major hospital
groups warned,
repealing the law without a
suitable replacement

27:59.978 --> 28:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would lead to -- quote -- "an
unprecedented
public health crisis."

28:04.182 --> 28:07.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Protect the great
moments in your
life with an affordable health
plan through

28:07.819 --> 28:09.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Healthcare.gov.

28:09.421 --> 28:13.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, open
enrollment
season for the new year
continues.

28:13.959 --> 28:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Health and Human Services
SecretaryÂ®MDNM /MD-BO /
Sylvia Burwell has been
traveling the country

28:18.730 --> 28:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
encouraging people to sign up
before enrollment
is finished January 31.

28:24.503 --> 28:31.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I sat down with her at HHS
headquarters in
Washington earlier today.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Sylvia Burwell, thank
you for talking
with us.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL, U.S.
Health and Human
Services Secretary: Thank you so
much for

28:34.279 --> 28:36.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
having me today.

28:36.081 --> 28:39.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
president-elect Trump,
congressional Republicans are
making it very

28:39.985 --> 28:45.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clear that they plan to repeal
and replace
the Affordable Care Act.

28:45.757 --> 28:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't make any bones about
it.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you think the
consequences will be?

28:49.261 --> 28:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: The
consequences are great, and
they're great

28:51.029 --> 28:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for all Americans, not just
those that are
the 20 million who have received
insurance.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Certainly, that could all go
away, those who
were uninsured and now insured.

29:00.005 --> 29:01.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's 20 million people.

29:01.306 --> 29:05.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have the lowest rate of
uninsured in our
nation in history.

29:05.043 --> 29:06.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those folks would lose their
coverage.

29:06.878 --> 29:09.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think most people don't
realize that
there are many other benefits
for those who

29:09.781 --> 29:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get insurance through their
employer, things
like children under your plan
until 26, things

29:16.121 --> 29:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like preexisting conditions,
things like preventative
coverage without any additional
co-pays.

29:22.527 --> 29:26.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those are some, just a few
of the many
things that would go away in a
repeal.

29:26.431 --> 29:30.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Mr. Trump
has said, among
other things, that he would like
to keep the

29:30.836 --> 29:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provision that allows children,
adult children
up to age 26 to be covered under
their parents'

29:37.409 --> 29:39.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plan.

29:39.144 --> 29:42.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has also said he doesn't want
anything
to change with regard to
preexisting conditions.

29:42.648 --> 29:48.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it possible to do that and
dismantle the
rest of it and still take care
of people?

29:48.120 --> 29:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: You
know, that's the thing, is, it's
like a game

29:50.355 --> 29:55.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Jenga, where you have the
puzzle pieces,
and, if you pull one out, the
thing will topple.

29:55.761 --> 30:00.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's important to
understand, when one
has people with preexisting
conditions in

30:00.098 --> 30:02.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the insurance pool, there are
other things
that you have to do.

30:02.901 --> 30:06.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to make sure everybody
is in the
pool, so you spread that risk.

30:06.104 --> 30:07.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is what insurance is.

30:07.139 --> 30:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is about spreading risk.

30:08.940 --> 30:11.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why there is a
mandate to have
everyone in.

30:11.710 --> 30:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing is, is, it
does increase
costs to have people who are
more expensive

30:15.681 --> 30:17.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what you want to do is make
sure that
you subsidize or help those.

30:19.551 --> 30:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is where the Affordable
Care Act's
subsidies or tax credits are
very, very important.

30:25.323 --> 30:29.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it is a situation where you
can't just
pick and choose the things you
like.

30:29.795 --> 30:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everything has to work together
in order to
pay and have those with
preexisting conditions

30:34.499 --> 30:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be in and covered by insurance.

30:37.102 --> 30:41.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you
saying, Secretary
Burwell, it's literally
impossible to do what

30:41.373 --> 30:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump says he wants to
do?

30:43.175 --> 30:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said words to the effect,
people will have
other options.

30:46.344 --> 30:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, we're not going to
leave people -- quote
-- "dying in the streets."

30:50.415 --> 30:54.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there a way to do -- to
dismantle and still
take care of people?

30:54.286 --> 30:56.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: So,
Judy, I think it is now the
point in time

30:56.521 --> 31:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where this conversation about
health care
is going to move from the
rhetoric to the

31:00.826 --> 31:02.594 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reality.

31:02.627 --> 31:06.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reality of how you need
to put the
pieces together, but you really
have to focus

31:06.198 --> 31:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on what are the real facts of
how these pieces
interact.

31:08.533 --> 31:15.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are there any
parts of this
plan that could be pulled out
and still keep

31:15.807 --> 31:19.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an important piece of what is
protecting Americans
and their health care?

31:19.811 --> 31:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: You
know, I think that's the
conversation that

31:22.214 --> 31:24.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we should have about the
question of how to
go forward.

31:24.983 --> 31:26.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are there improvements that can
be made?

31:26.685 --> 31:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's -- the question I
think we
need to be focused on, three
things, access,

31:32.057 --> 31:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how many insured or uninsured,
affordability,
what does it cost people, and
quality, what's

31:37.462 --> 31:39.097 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
covered.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as you know,
right now,
among Republicans on the Hill --
at least

31:40.832 --> 31:48.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's reported that they are
talking about
a repeal vote, and then figuring
out what

31:48.440 --> 31:51.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to do next with replacement.

31:51.810 --> 31:54.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's not complete agreement
on replacement.

31:54.679 --> 31:59.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much difference does it make
it if they
go ahead and repeal, and then we
see how much

31:59.451 --> 32:01.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a delay there is before we
know what succeeds?

32:01.586 --> 32:03.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /(CROSSTALK)

32:03.421 --> 32:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL: Well,
the idea of
repeal and delayed replace is
really repeal

32:08.393 --> 32:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and collapse, because, once they
have taken
those actions to repeal and say,
oh, we will

32:14.099 --> 32:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
replace it two, three years from
now, you
already start to have the
negative impact

32:19.704 --> 32:21.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that will occur.

32:21.506 --> 32:25.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by that, I mean insurance
companies,
because of the uncertainty, will
make decisions

32:25.644 --> 32:27.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to not go into the marketplace.

32:28.013 --> 32:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will make decisions to
raise their prices
because of the uncertainty.

32:32.584 --> 32:37.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hospitals across the country who
have been
benefiting from a reduction in
uncompensated

32:37.956 --> 32:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care, when people just go to the
hospital
and don't pay, because they
don't have insurance,

32:42.594 --> 32:44.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're not going to be able to
make decisions.

32:45.030 --> 32:49.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States who have been getting the
funds for
Medicaid expansion will not know
in their

32:49.634 --> 32:51.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
budgets whether they're going to
get the funds.

32:52.003 --> 32:58.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What will happen if there is a
repeal and
a delayed replacement is,
actually, collapse

32:58.109 --> 33:01.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
will started to occur
immediately because
of the uncertainty.

33:01.513 --> 33:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you think that it's
been six years,
and there hasn't been an
agreed-upon replacement,

33:07.118 --> 33:11.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and so that will fuel this
uncertainty that
anything will really happen.

33:11.189 --> 33:13.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what does
that mean in
human terms if it collapses?

33:13.425 --> 33:15.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: In
human terms, what it means is,
we know that

33:15.694 --> 33:19.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now 20 million folks have
insurance
through the Affordable Care Act.

33:19.865 --> 33:24.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, the Urban Institute
came out with
a study that said that approach
could result

33:24.336 --> 33:28.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in up to 30 million people
uninsured.

33:28.106 --> 33:34.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And why that is, is, because
this approach
wouldn't only take away what we
gained, but

33:34.045 --> 33:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would take us back further,
because it will
affect negatively the individual
market.

33:38.817 --> 33:42.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're speaking
about what
will happen in the insurance
markets to hospitals,

33:42.821 --> 33:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decisions that they will make.

33:44.823 --> 33:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet we're already seeing in
this president-elect,
Donald Trump, he is somebody who
is not afraid

33:49.661 --> 33:56.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to go after individual
companies, individual
leaders in the private sector.

33:56.034 --> 34:02.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has done it again today in
talking about
an aerospace company.

34:02.674 --> 34:10.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who's to say he might not try to
personally
talk the hospital or insurance
industry into

34:10.348 --> 34:12.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doing something different?

34:12.284 --> 34:13.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: So,
I think this is one of those
situations where,

34:13.652 --> 34:16.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as I said, moving to the
substance.

34:16.421 --> 34:21.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And for the insurers and
providers to be able
to provide the kind of care and
insurance

34:21.993 --> 34:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they need to, there is a certain
level of
certainty that they need.

34:25.096 --> 34:26.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They need to know.

34:26.998 --> 34:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the most important things
in the marketplace
is the subsidies that occur to
help people

34:30.769 --> 34:32.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
afford health care.

34:32.671 --> 34:35.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even fans of the
accord Affordable
Care Act acknowledge there have
been issues

34:35.941 --> 34:37.676 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with it.

34:37.709 --> 34:44.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, given that, as you look
back on how you,
how the administration has
handled it, are

34:44.716 --> 34:47.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there things that could have
been, should
have been done differently?

34:47.419 --> 34:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: The
president actually made a very
public pronouncement

34:50.956 --> 34:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through the -- a journal even,
in publishing
an article about things we think
could improve

34:56.461 --> 34:58.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act.

34:58.063 --> 35:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are a number of places
where we
believe there could be
improvements.

35:01.099 --> 35:07.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they mainly focus on
affordability and
access and competition, having
competition

35:07.038 --> 35:08.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the marketplace.

35:08.907 --> 35:13.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of the things we think
could help
and improve are changes in
things like high-cost

35:13.979 --> 35:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drugs and making sure that HHS
has the ability
to negotiate, to put downward
pressure, or

35:19.985 --> 35:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the idea of, in places where you
don't have
a lot of competition, in other
words, a number

35:24.622 --> 35:29.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of insurers offering, create a
public option
that would sit beside other
market options.

35:29.794 --> 35:34.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have had some
-- a conversation
with the man who the
president-elect has chosen

35:34.199 --> 35:39.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be the next secretary, or has
appointed
to be the next secretary of
health and human

35:39.571 --> 35:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
services, Congressman Tom Price
from Georgia.

35:42.273 --> 35:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Any advice you would offer him?

35:44.075 --> 35:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Â®MDNM /MD-BO / SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL:
You know, I think the only thing
I would say

35:46.344 --> 35:52.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and I would say this to
anyone coming into
HHS -- is, it is so important to
really focus

35:52.884 --> 35:54.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on those we serve.

35:54.185 --> 35:57.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is who our boss really is.

35:57.055 --> 35:58.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is the consumer.

35:58.890 --> 36:03.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether that's the child in
Head Start,
the person getting health care
or the person

36:03.395 --> 36:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is going to benefit from NIH
research,
or any of us eating that food
that we trust

36:08.466 --> 36:14.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is safe because of the FDA,
keeping your eye
on what this department is about
for those

36:14.806 --> 36:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, and how do we achieve
and serve the
best for them, that's the one
thing that I

36:19.444 --> 36:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think helps in this job, which
has lots of
different parts and pieces.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /Sylvia
Burwell, thank you.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Â®MDNM /MD-BO /SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: Thank
you.

36:26.851 --> 36:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
discussing the
future of Obamacare with leading
Republicans

36:30.688 --> 36:37.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the coming weeks.

36:37.228 --> 36:47.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a broader look at the
latest twists
and turns in the Trump
transition now with

36:47.539 --> 36:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our Politics Monday team, Tamara
Keith of
NPR and Amy Walter of The Cook
Political Report.

36:54.145 --> 36:55.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's Monday.

36:56.281 --> 36:57.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's good to see you.

36:57.415 --> 36:59.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Tamara, we have some, I
think, breaking
news.

36:59.451 --> 37:03.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had expected Donald Trump
this week to
announce how he's going to
handle all of his

37:03.521 --> 37:04.489 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
businesses.

37:04.522 --> 37:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what have you learned?

37:06.424 --> 37:08.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes,
all of the entanglements and
potential conflicts

37:08.059 --> 37:12.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of interest, he was supposed to
address that
in a news conference on
Thursday.

37:12.130 --> 37:17.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NPR's Domenico Montanaro has
confirmed that
that news conference is not
happening and

37:17.569 --> 37:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that now there will be an
announcement, not
necessarily a news conference,
sometime in

37:22.207 --> 37:24.042 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
January.

37:24.075 --> 37:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for two weeks, Donald Trump
had the benefit
of people reporting that he was
going to have

37:28.346 --> 37:32.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a news conference to announce
his conflicts
of interest, and how he was
going to resolve

37:32.450 --> 37:33.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

37:33.451 --> 37:35.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now that is postponed.

37:35.220 --> 37:38.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, I won't
ask you to
speculate about what is going
on, because

37:38.456 --> 37:40.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it has just broken.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it does -- this is something
we have been
waiting to learn from Donald
Trump.

37:42.627 --> 37:44.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
and it is something that he is
asked continually.

37:44.729 --> 37:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was just asked this weekend
in an interview
with FOX News' Chris Wallace
about how this

37:49.534 --> 37:51.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was going to work.

37:51.302 --> 37:54.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he seemed to suggest that it
was going
to be pretty easy, that his
children will

37:54.806 --> 37:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run the business, he is going to
stay out
of it, but his children will do
it, and if

37:58.409 --> 38:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his children who are doing it,
then it means
he personally doesn't have a
vested interest

38:02.247 --> 38:04.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the success.

38:04.048 --> 38:07.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chris Wallace pushed him on
this, saying,
well, you know, if your children
do well,

38:07.185 --> 38:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's -- for your business --
that is probably
helping you.

38:09.787 --> 38:13.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Didn't really clear up all of
the potential
controversies there.

38:13.558 --> 38:18.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this comes on top of the
fact that you
have a number of members now
that Donald Trump

38:18.663 --> 38:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has offered up as Cabinet
appointments who
may have their own conflicts of
interest.

38:23.168 --> 38:25.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are going to be addressed
in hearings.

38:25.103 --> 38:28.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, and Donald
Trump in that
same interview talked about
wanting his daughter

38:28.907 --> 38:32.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared
Kushner to
be able to do work with the
administration.

38:32.644 --> 38:36.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then also he wants them to
have some involvement
with the business still.

38:36.714 --> 38:37.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

38:37.715 --> 38:39.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

38:39.083 --> 38:39.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we now wait for at least,
what, three
more weeks before...

38:39.884 --> 38:40.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

38:40.885 --> 38:41.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: January.

38:41.886 --> 38:43.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We don't have a
date.

38:43.755 --> 38:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the lead story tonight --
and, Amy,
I will turn to you on this -- is
this extraordinary

38:47.592 --> 38:53.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation where we now have the
CIA saying
flat out that the Russians
interfered, tried

38:54.032 --> 38:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to influence the U.S. election.

38:55.934 --> 39:00.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, they're concluding that the
Russians
did it in order to help Donald
Trump.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The FBI isn't there yet.

39:01.573 --> 39:04.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now you have a congressional
investigation
called for.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is -- where are we?

39:06.211 --> 39:10.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It -- you know,
Judy, like, this
is the election that will never
end.

39:10.381 --> 39:11.349 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

39:11.382 --> 39:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2016 will continue to go on and
on and on.

39:14.586 --> 39:20.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, where we are right now,
you have the
CIA -- again, this is a document
that was

39:20.091 --> 39:21.926 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leaked.

39:21.960 --> 39:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They haven't come out publicly,
made a public
statement about this, but was
leaked to The

39:25.530 --> 39:30.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington Post that they have
determined
that the Russians were involved
in, not just

39:30.902 --> 39:35.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hacking e-mails, but in trying
to ensure that
Donald Trump was elected.

39:35.473 --> 39:41.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressional leaders in the
House and the
Senate on the Republican side
taking a look

39:41.980 --> 39:45.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at this, basically, what they're
saying is,
they're not going as far as
Donald Trump is

39:45.783 --> 39:49.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying, this is absolutely
ridiculous, I don't
believe this is possible.

39:49.487 --> 39:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They do say, this is something
we need to
look into, but what we're not
going to do

39:52.757 --> 39:54.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is set up a special
investigation.

39:54.359 --> 39:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's going to go through normal
procedure.

39:57.095 --> 40:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not going to set up
something like a
9/11 Commission, something like
that to look

40:00.265 --> 40:02.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at this.

40:02.133 --> 40:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what you have is the
president being
much more direct in pushing
back, Republicans

40:05.236 --> 40:06.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
saying it is worth looking at.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they're also saying, we
don't want to
politicize this.

40:08.573 --> 40:14.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we certainly don't want to
-- and I think
that it was Paul Ryan who said
specifically

40:14.245 --> 40:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it shouldn't -- we should
make a clear
and decisive outcome.

40:17.282 --> 40:20.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We shouldn't cast doubt on a
clear and decisive
outcome of this election.

40:20.451 --> 40:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, let's try to
look at this
without politicizing this.

40:23.988 --> 40:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Tamara,
should that be
a question now?

40:26.391 --> 40:30.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does this potentially undermine
the legitimacy
of Donald Trump's win here?

40:30.528 --> 40:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: So, it depends on
how you talk
about undermining and
legitimacy.

40:35.300 --> 40:42.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration is also
calling for
a broad review of the election
hacking and

40:42.473 --> 40:44.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hacking in past elections.

40:44.575 --> 40:50.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the White House is saying
they don't believe
that there was Election Day vote
tampering.

40:50.815 --> 40:55.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They believe that the vote is --
the vote
is the vote.

40:55.353 --> 40:58.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump will be sworn in on
January 20.

40:58.389 --> 41:03.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that the way that
the Trump team
has reacted to this gets at the
legitimacy

41:03.594 --> 41:05.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
question.

41:05.496 --> 41:11.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been, in some ways,
defensive, saying
that this is just -- this is
just the latest

41:11.402 --> 41:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a long line of things, like
the recount
or people pointing to the
popular vote, as

41:18.710 --> 41:22.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a way of delegitimizing an
elected president-elect.

41:22.547 --> 41:25.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And saying the
Democrats are
somehow involved in this.

41:25.950 --> 41:31.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it also -- it points back to
-- I mean,
Amy, you said there are now
several nominees.

41:31.189 --> 41:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are going to be questions
about their
qualifications, their potential
conflicts

41:35.993 --> 41:37.962 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of interest.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do want to come back to
that news conference,
Amy, that -- or -- I'm sorry --
the interview

41:40.198 --> 41:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that Donald Trump did.

41:41.766 --> 41:44.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're still waiting for a Donald
Trump news
conference, by the way.

41:44.469 --> 41:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Since July, we have
been waiting.

41:45.970 --> 41:47.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: July.

41:47.905 --> 41:51.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the interview that he did
with Chris Wallace
on FOX News, some interesting
comments there

41:51.542 --> 41:57.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about he doesn't believe in
taking regular
intelligence briefings, comments
about China.

41:57.582 --> 42:00.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did learn a little bit more
about him from
that.

42:00.518 --> 42:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I think we did,
although, Judy,
my big takeaway from that
interview was the

42:04.455 --> 42:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump that we saw on the
campaign trail
is the Donald Trump that we're
going to see

42:08.459 --> 42:10.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Oval Office.

42:10.194 --> 42:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He still believes fundamentally
that he doesn't
need to do things in the
traditional way:

42:15.800 --> 42:19.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, there is a tradition for
doing security
briefings one way.

42:19.303 --> 42:21.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to do them a different
way.

42:21.172 --> 42:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, people said to me, don't
take this phone
call from Taiwan.

42:25.076 --> 42:29.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand the one-China
policy, but I'm
also not going to let China
dictate to me

42:29.313 --> 42:31.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what I am going to do as
president of the
United States.

42:31.416 --> 42:35.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this posture, this
attitude that we
saw on the campaign trail is
absolutely going

42:35.753 --> 42:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to follow him right into the
Oval Office.

42:37.822 --> 42:39.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He really is
saying: I'm going
do it my own way.

42:39.624 --> 42:40.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

42:40.625 --> 42:42.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

42:42.427 --> 42:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at many of his
domestic policy
Cabinet appointments, or
nominees, they are

42:44.762 --> 42:46.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people in his own image.

42:46.397 --> 42:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are outsiders that are
executives, or
successful in business and
wealthy.

42:52.770 --> 42:57.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are people who have said
that they oppose
the very work of the agencies
that they have

42:57.775 --> 43:00.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now been nominated to lead.

43:00.478 --> 43:04.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As so, we look at
this, Amy,
and we look at the -- just in
less than a

43:04.916 --> 43:09.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minute now -- the confirmation
process coming
up, there could be some
contentious...

43:09.120 --> 43:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: There's going to be
some -- very
much fireworks.

43:10.521 --> 43:11.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... discussions,
yes.

43:11.522 --> 43:13.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

43:13.357 --> 43:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that, because of the way
that the
rules are structured, it is
going to be difficult

43:15.092 --> 43:19.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Democrats alone to get -- to
oust one
of his picks.

43:19.897 --> 43:26.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But all it takes is three or so
Republicans
to go against one of these
nominees, and they

43:26.103 --> 43:27.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will not be able to be
confirmed.

43:27.939 --> 43:30.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And John McCain
and some of
the other senators have raised
some questions.

43:30.341 --> 43:31.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

43:31.342 --> 43:32.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans, I
mean.

43:32.343 --> 43:33.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

43:33.344 --> 43:35.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are a handful of
Republicans.

43:35.179 --> 43:38.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rand Paul has raised some
concerns with some
names that have floated.

43:38.583 --> 43:40.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The potential exists.

43:40.284 --> 43:44.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even if none of them are
blocked, these
hearings are going to be
fascinating, and

43:44.655 --> 43:51.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they could -- they could raise a
lot of concerns
that could dog these nominees
once they go

43:51.062 --> 43:52.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into their Cabinet positions.

43:52.830 --> 43:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hearings, hmm,
where have we
heard about those before in
Congress?

43:55.099 --> 43:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: We are going to be
watching a
lot of them.

43:57.201 --> 43:58.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:58.202 --> 43:59.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

43:59.470 --> 44:00.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, thank
you both.

44:00.204 --> 44:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

44:01.205 --> 44:07.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome,
Judy.

44:07.778 --> 44:15.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nashville often
likes to refer
to itself as Music City.

44:15.987 --> 44:19.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And given its history and
heritage, that seems
just right.

44:19.357 --> 44:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as real estate development
explodes in
one of the nation's fastest
growing cities,

44:24.128 --> 44:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the very studios,
locations and neighborhoods
that were so important to
country music, and

44:29.901 --> 44:33.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the industry as a whole, are now
threatened.

44:33.170 --> 44:34.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown reports.

44:34.372 --> 44:38.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of his ongoing series
on Culture
at Risk.

44:38.643 --> 44:46.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Inside an
unassuming house
on Nashville's 16th Avenue
South, guitarist

44:46.150 --> 44:52.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Philip Shouse is laying down a
track at the
recording studio House of David.

44:52.323 --> 45:00.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, just up the road, the
punk rock
group Paramore is recording
percussion in

45:00.698 --> 45:04.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RCA Studio A for the group's
forthcoming album.

45:04.569 --> 45:10.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just another day on Music
Row, the collection
of recording studios, publishing
houses and

45:10.841 --> 45:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offices two miles southwest of
downtown Nashville
and its famous honky-tonks, and
the place

45:16.914 --> 45:20.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collectively responsible for an
important
part of the nation's music
industry.

45:20.985 --> 45:24.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAYLOR YORK, Paramore: From,
like, the early
days even to present, there's
been such an

45:24.288 --> 45:29.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amazing group of people that
have recorded
here, you know, and when you
walk into a room,

45:29.460 --> 45:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you really can feel an energy
and an inspiration.

45:34.298 --> 45:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It all began in
the 1950s,
with

45:38.502 --> 45:43.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Owen and Harold Bradley,
brothers who opened
a recording studio in a
converted home in

45:43.174 --> 45:44.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this part of town.

45:44.976 --> 45:51.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other studios, like Capitol,
Decca, and RCA
Victor followed, and in 1957,
RCA victor's

45:51.849 --> 45:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nashville division, headed by
Chet Atkins,
opened Studio B, where Elvis
Presley would

45:56.954 --> 46:01.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
record many of his most famous
hits.

46:01.759 --> 46:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few years later, in 1963,
Studio A was built
next door.

46:09.767 --> 46:16.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And between the two, the likes
of Willie Nelson,
Waylon Jennings, Dolly Parton,
and many more

46:16.607 --> 46:19.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And between the two, the likes
of Willie Nelson,
Waylon Jennings, Dolly Parton,
and many more

46:35.092 --> 46:38.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
recorded hit records.

46:38.963 --> 46:43.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the studios came the
musicians, the publishers,
the lawyers and others, a
clustering that

46:43.834 --> 46:45.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
created a music industry.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLYN BRACKETT, National Trust
for Historic
Preservation: All of those are
still here.

46:47.605 --> 46:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you still have that sense
of community.

46:49.740 --> 46:54.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Carolyn Brackett
is a Nashville
native with the National Trust
for Historic

46:54.045 --> 46:55.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Preservation.

46:55.846 --> 46:58.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLYN BRACKETT: It's something
that we have
maybe taken for granted, because
you can walk

46:58.349 --> 47:02.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by these buildings or drive by a
lot of them
and not realize that this
incredible music

47:02.586 --> 47:06.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was made in that old house or in
this small
building.

47:06.991 --> 47:12.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a lot of the work that we
have done
in the last couple of years has
been to document

47:12.229 --> 47:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the history of Music Row all the
way up to
the present, what's happening
here today.

47:16.333 --> 47:20.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What's happening
here today
is that this history is being
threatened by

47:20.604 --> 47:25.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rising demand for housing
and office space
in what is one of the nation's
fastest growing

47:25.409 --> 47:27.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cities and hottest markets.

47:27.278 --> 47:31.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARON CORBITT-HOUSE, Partner,
All Good Factory:
There is a culture that we have
been very

47:31.148 --> 47:35.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fortunate to have on Music Row,
and it's been
squeezed

47:35.553 --> 47:40.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sharon
Corbitt-House, known
as Music Row Mama up and down
these streets,

47:40.324 --> 47:46.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been managing talent and
producers at
RCA Studio A for years.

47:46.497 --> 47:52.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two years ago, one of her
clients, Ben Folds,
learned the building was being
sold and that

47:52.803 --> 47:54.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he was being evicted.

47:54.805 --> 47:57.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Folds wrote an open letter to
Nashville's
community that went viral.

47:57.908 --> 48:03.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the 11th hour, as the
building was
about to be sold to a new
developer who would

48:03.047 --> 48:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tear it down, developer and
philanthropist
Aubrey Preston stepped in to
save it.

48:07.785 --> 48:10.488 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
AUBREY PRESTON,
Developer/Philanthropist:
I believe in Music City.

48:10.521 --> 48:15.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be the equivalent of,
in Egypt, them
allowing one of their three
pyramids or something

48:15.726 --> 48:17.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be torn down.

48:17.595 --> 48:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe it would just -- it's
just an impossibility
that this building would be torn
down.

48:20.998 --> 48:26.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new producer
in residence
at Studio A is Dave Cobb,
responsible for

48:26.504 --> 48:37.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
albums from Jason Isbell and
Chris Stapleton,
who took home last year's Grammy
for best

48:37.047 --> 48:42.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country album, "Traveller,"
recorded at Studio
A.

48:42.319 --> 48:49.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVE COBB, Record Producer: Oh,
yes, you feel
the walls.

48:49.794 --> 48:53.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you kind of know what
was recorded
there, and when you're actually
in the space

48:53.397 --> 48:57.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you realize that, you know,
that's where
Waylon Jennings recorded "Daddy
Walk the Line"

48:57.368 --> 49:00.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that's where Dolly Parton
did "Jolene,"
and you're actually in the same
space, it

49:00.471 --> 49:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
takes on a whole new, you know,
emotion.

49:03.140 --> 49:04.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And those records, I adore.

49:04.408 --> 49:07.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel like, when I make
records, I chase
those sounds.

49:07.411 --> 49:11.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This studio has
been saved,
but many others are gone.

49:11.148 --> 49:16.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolyn Brackett took us to a
new development
called Crescent Music Row, the
former site

49:16.720 --> 49:21.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Sound Shop Studio, where Paul
McCartney
recorded with Wings in the
1970s.

49:21.158 --> 49:23.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CAROLYN BRACKETT: Most of them
are high-rises.

49:23.894 --> 49:28.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's happening as they
push further
into Music Row is that we're
losing a lot

49:28.232 --> 49:34.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the historic buildings that
were studios,
were music offices, publishers
were located.

49:34.772 --> 49:40.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Also compounding
the studios'
problems, the music business
isn't what it

49:40.211 --> 49:45.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used to be, and many recording
studios don't
earn what they used to because
of the rise

49:45.115 --> 49:47.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of more affordable software and
equipment.

49:47.117 --> 49:50.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BRIGGS, Owner, House of
David: I have
been offered, you know, a $1.7
million for

49:50.688 --> 49:52.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any building I have every week.

49:52.790 --> 49:55.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Briggs is the owner of the
House of
David studios.

49:55.759 --> 49:57.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you say?

49:57.328 --> 49:58.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BRIGGS: No.

49:58.362 --> 49:59.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because?

49:59.396 --> 50:01.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BRIGGS: Because I want
these to stay.

50:01.432 --> 50:05.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first thing they will do is
tear them
down and build -- especially if
you -- I have

50:05.970 --> 50:07.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
three lots together.

50:07.071 --> 50:09.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They could build a pretty nice
skyscraper
here.

50:09.373 --> 50:14.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Briggs himself is
a Nashville
institution, a session player,
producer and

50:14.078 --> 50:17.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
music publisher who's worked
with Elvis and
a host of other stars.

50:17.848 --> 50:22.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BRIGGS: There used to be
80 studios
here within three or four
blocks.

50:22.620 --> 50:24.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now I doubt if there's 20.

50:24.421 --> 50:28.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The House of
David was just
added to the National Register
of Historic

50:28.259 --> 50:31.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Places, joining three other
studios on Music
Row.

50:31.795 --> 50:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're among 200 buildings
documented by
the National Trust that are
connected to the

50:37.034 --> 50:41.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rise of country music, as well
as the music
industry as a whole.

50:41.538 --> 50:46.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city's Metropolitan Planning
Commission
and stakeholders are now working
to finalize

50:46.310 --> 50:51.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a plan to recognize historic
buildings, with
backing from the National Park
Service.

50:51.582 --> 50:54.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARON CORBITT-HOUSE: I think
it's really
important that we're leaving it
better than

50:54.285 --> 50:56.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we found it.

50:56.053 --> 50:58.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got to make sure that
we're taking
care of the creative community,
people who

50:58.255 --> 51:02.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came here to be creatives, and
do it the way
we have always done it, which is
support one

51:02.593 --> 51:04.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
another.

51:04.328 --> 51:07.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a difficult
balancing
act between celebrating the past
and making

51:07.298 --> 51:09.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
room for the future.

51:09.400 --> 51:19.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Music Row in Nashville, I'm
Jeffrey Brown

JUDY WOODRUFF: And again to our

of American service personnel
killed in Iraq

51:29.553 --> 51:36.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And again to our
honor roll
of American service personnel
killed in Iraq

51:36.694 --> 51:38.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the Afghanistan conflict.

51:38.629 --> 51:42.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We add them as their deaths are
made official
and photographs become
available.

51:42.266 --> 51:50.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here, in silence, is one more.

located 1,040 light years from
Earth.

52:18.235 --> 52:22.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's according to the first

52:22.973 --> 52:25.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

52:25.209 --> 52:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also on our Facebook page, you
think you have
what it takes to be on the front
lines for

52:29.413 --> 52:31.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the U.S. Marine Corps?

52:31.148 --> 52:36.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Marines recently opened up
all combat
positions to female recruits.

52:36.220 --> 52:40.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to qualify for these combat
jobs, all
recruits have to pass this test.
