winds in Northern California.

00:13.480 --> 00:17.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Wednesday:
Editors from newspapers in the
middle of America

00:17.885 --> 00:21.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
share their readers' thoughts on
President
Trump's first month in office.

00:21.588 --> 00:26.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Miles O'Brien
guides us
through NASA's latest discovery
of another

00:26.660 --> 00:29.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
solar system with Earth-like
planets.

00:29.329 --> 00:35.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In the hunt for
potential alien
life, the thought of finding
places where

00:35.102 --> 00:38.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is liquid water is what
really intrigues
scientists.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:41.208 --> 00:44.344 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:44.378 --> 00:57.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A Jewish cemetery
near Saint
Louis, Missouri, won an
outpouring of support

00:57.958 --> 01:01.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today from Vice President Pence
on down.

01:01.194 --> 01:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 150 tombstones had
been toppled
or damaged over the weekend,
part of a spate

01:07.034 --> 01:10.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of anti-Semitic attacks and
threats nationwide.

01:10.804 --> 01:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vice president visited
suburban Saint
Louis this afternoon, and made a
stop at the

01:15.609 --> 01:17.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cemetery.

01:17.177 --> 01:19.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He got a firsthand look at some
of the damage
and briefly joined the cleanup.

01:19.913 --> 01:25.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
There is no place in America for
hatred or

01:25.786 --> 01:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
acts of prejudice or violence or
anti-Semitism.

01:27.587 --> 01:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I must tell you, the people of
Missouri are
inspiring the nation by your
love and care

01:37.597 --> 01:42.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for this place, for the Jewish
community in
Missouri, and I want to thank
you for that

01:42.869 --> 01:47.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inspiration, for showing the
world what America
is really all about.

01:47.140 --> 01:52.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online
fund-raising has brought
in more than $92,000 to repair
the damage

01:52.479 --> 01:54.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the cemetery.

01:54.147 --> 01:57.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Muslim groups launched the
effort in a show
of solidarity.

01:57.851 --> 02:03.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Germany, the government is
making it easier
to deport rejected
asylum-seekers.

02:03.490 --> 02:06.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Germany took in nearly 900,000
people in 2015.

02:06.827 --> 02:12.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, Chancellor Angela
Merkel's Cabinet
approved a plan that speeds up
expulsions

02:12.199 --> 02:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of those who don't gain asylum.

02:14.201 --> 02:19.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Merkel's coalition has come
under increasing
domestic criticism over the tide
of migrants,

02:20.007 --> 02:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it faces a general election
in September.

02:22.476 --> 02:27.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The United
Nations warned
today that nearly 20 million
people face starvation

02:27.481 --> 02:30.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in four countries, if help
doesn't arrive
before April.

02:30.984 --> 02:36.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The secretary-general said South
Sudan, Nigeria,
Somalia and Yemen are on the
brink of catastrophe,

02:37.024 --> 02:40.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and he called for $4.4 billion.

02:40.761 --> 02:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jonathan Rugman of Independent
Television
News reports on South Sudan,
where civil war

02:44.698 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has brought on disaster.

02:46.466 --> 02:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Parts of South
Sudan are
in famine, the world's first
since 2011, over

02:54.041 --> 03:00.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a quarter of a million severely
malnourished
children, says UNICEF, almost
three million

03:00.380 --> 03:06.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forced from their homes because
of ethnic
conflict here, massacres and
widespread rape

03:06.319 --> 03:08.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as weapons of war.

03:08.722 --> 03:13.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all the aid agencies admit
that this famine
is manmade.

03:13.860 --> 03:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those men are Salva Kiir, the
president, wearing
the hat, and Riek Machar, his
former deputy.

03:20.067 --> 03:25.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Listen to this former minister
on how South
Sudan's leaders outsource
starvation as an

03:25.238 --> 03:26.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
issue for us, rather than them.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT SHAPPS, Former Minister of
State: I
met one of the finance ministers
for South

03:29.943 --> 03:34.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sudan at the U.N. in New York,
and I said,
look, if this war continues, you
are going

03:34.414 --> 03:38.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to find your people are
starving, because
you're diverting all these
resources.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, you will feed the
people.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said, what do you mean, we
will feed the
people?

03:42.622 --> 03:46.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, I don't believe that
countries like
Britain will walk away whilst
hundreds of

03:46.927 --> 03:49.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thousands of people starve, so
we will carry
on fighting the war.

03:49.863 --> 03:54.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: But confronted
with this
suffering, doing nothing is not
an option,

03:54.501 --> 04:00.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and for those arguing that aid
needs to be
tied to political reform, what
an appalling

04:00.240 --> 04:02.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
example South Sudan is.

04:02.075 --> 04:07.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, federal
officials shut down a protest
camp close to

04:07.547 --> 04:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Dakota Access oil pipeline.

04:10.050 --> 04:14.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
About 150 people left
voluntarily, but others
were arrested.

04:14.321 --> 04:19.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier, protesters torched
their tents and
teepees near the Standing Rock
Sioux reservation

04:19.626 --> 04:23.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in North Dakota, in what they
called a ceremonial
act.

04:23.330 --> 04:27.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Army Corps of Engineers
ordered the site
closed before spring floods.

04:27.667 --> 04:32.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other protest camps have sprung
up on private
land as construction resumes on
the last stretch

04:32.939 --> 04:34.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the pipeline.

04:34.741 --> 04:37.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Trump
administration
is moving tonight to revoke
guidelines on

04:37.577 --> 04:40.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
transgender bathrooms in public
schools.

04:40.547 --> 04:44.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were issued under President
Obama, and
called for letting students
choose a bathroom

04:44.184 --> 04:46.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
based on gender identity.

04:46.319 --> 04:49.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Administration officials say Mr.
Trump is
acting because he believes
states should set

04:49.923 --> 04:54.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their own policies; 13 states
sued to block
the guidelines last year.

04:54.828 --> 04:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The organization
that oversees
the SAT college entrance exam is
beefing up

04:59.933 --> 05:02.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
security after a rash of
cheating.

05:02.836 --> 05:07.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The College Board announced
today that it
will cut back testing dates
overseas to reduce

05:07.641 --> 05:10.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunities for stealing the
exams.

05:10.210 --> 05:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also increasing the numbers
of audits
at sites where the SAT is
administered.

05:15.015 --> 05:20.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The changes follow high-profile
cases in Asia
where students obtained copies
of tests in

05:20.720 --> 05:22.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
advance.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And Wall
Street had a mixed
day, after oil prices slipped
and took energy

05:24.791 --> 05:26.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stocks lower.

05:26.226 --> 05:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 32
points to close at 20775.

05:29.296 --> 05:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell five points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped two.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
California braces for flooding
after years

05:37.704 --> 05:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of drought; newspaper editors
from the heartland
share their readers' views on
the early days

05:43.043 --> 05:52.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Trump presidency; Syrian
refugees who
would prefer not to move to the
U.S.; and

05:52.819 --> 05:57.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

05:57.090 --> 06:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's turn our
focus out
West to Northern California,
where rain and

06:04.931 --> 06:08.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flooding have wreaked havoc on a
once-drought-stricken
region.

06:08.802 --> 06:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials in San Jose ordered
some 14,000
people to evacuate overnight.

06:12.772 --> 06:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Floodwaters did stabilize today,
but neighborhoods
were inundated.

06:16.610 --> 06:21.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials said they don't yet
know when residents
will be able to return to their
homes.

06:21.848 --> 06:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're now joined by the mayor of
San Jose,
Sam Liccardo.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mayor Liccardo, I just want to
ask.

06:26.453 --> 06:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got 14,000 out for
sure, another
20,000 encouraged to leave.

06:31.758 --> 06:35.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All of them want this
information that you
can't give them yet, which is,
when will they

06:35.629 --> 06:37.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be able to go back home?

06:37.397 --> 06:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /SAM LICCARDO, Mayor of
San Jose,
California: Yes, the important
message is

06:39.899 --> 06:41.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we're not out of this yet.

06:41.701 --> 06:45.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Although the waters are
receding, we know
we have got other storms that
are coming in.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not safe to go in many
of these neighborhoods
yet.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have got a lot of very
contaminated water.

06:50.810 --> 06:53.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we don't want folks going in
there if
they're going to be in peril.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Do you have
any estimate
on how significant the damage
is?

06:56.950 --> 06:59.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAM LICCARDO: Not yet.

06:59.319 --> 07:03.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, we're really just
focused on making
sure we're taking care of the
families and

07:03.623 --> 07:05.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their immediate needs.

07:05.392 --> 07:08.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are going to have an
opportunity to get
building inspectors in there to
really look

07:08.194 --> 07:10.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the housing and make sure
it's safe.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will have a better sense
in the days
to come.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But why did it
take so long
to evacuate these folks?

07:15.535 --> 07:17.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were reporting on this in the
East Coast.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People knew that this storm was
coming.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You knew.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You had the weather forecast.

07:22.175 --> 07:25.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet now we see reports that it
was late last
night where the police were
pounding on doors

07:25.345 --> 07:27.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and saying, hey, come on, it's
too late, you
have got to move.

07:27.881 --> 07:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM LICCARDO: Yes, it's fair to
say we were
preparing for a storm, but what
really flooded

07:34.020 --> 07:41.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these neighborhoods was the
overpouring of
a dam, Anderson Dam, which
released a torrent

07:41.261 --> 07:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of water that exceeded our
100-year flood
estimate.

07:46.132 --> 07:51.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, the flood maps, the
data that
we were relying on wasn't
preparing us for

07:51.805 --> 07:53.573 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we are clearly learning
some very hard
lessons here, and we have got a
lot to fix

07:56.743 --> 07:58.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going forward.

07:58.545 --> 08:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Anderson Dam,
which feeds
that Coyote Creek area, some
engineers say

08:01.981 --> 08:06.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it could take nine weeks for
them to bring
it down to the safe levels at 68
percent,

08:06.686 --> 08:08.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or whatever the capacity is of
the reservoir.

08:08.621 --> 08:10.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And right now, it's up at 100.

08:10.523 --> 08:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, is there going to be a huge
volume of
water that floods through this
creek and basically

08:15.295 --> 08:19.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keeps this the status quo in San
Jose and
parts of other neighborhoods
here?

08:19.432 --> 08:22.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAM LICCARDO: Well, much depends
on the rains
that are to come.

08:22.702 --> 08:25.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're expecting another storm
this weekend.

08:25.238 --> 08:32.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we hope that obviously it
won't be substantial,
because we need to get some sun
on this reservoir

08:32.512 --> 08:34.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get some of that water
evaporated.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Has the city
requested any
sort of aid from the state or
the federal

08:38.485 --> 08:40.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government?

08:40.353 --> 08:43.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SAM LICCARDO: I had a
conversation with the
governor's office just a couple
of hours ago.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're working with them
collaboratively.

08:45.792 --> 08:51.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, we have been able to
manage this on
our own, really incredible work
by a lot of

08:51.464 --> 08:57.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
firefighters, first-responders
who are working
many overtime shifts to safely
evacuate hundreds

08:57.237 --> 09:01.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of residents by boat, really a
great testament
to their hard work.

09:01.574 --> 09:04.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we know we're probably going
to need help
in the weeks to come.

09:04.744 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're working now with the
state to figure
out how we can do that.

09:07.514 --> 09:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How many
people do you still
have in emergency shelters?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And is that number decreasing?

09:11.384 --> 09:16.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAM LICCARDO: We have more than
300 in shelters
right now.

09:16.656 --> 09:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The good news is really the
overwhelming majority
of the displaced residents were
able to find

09:21.795 --> 09:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
help with friends or family
members nearby.

09:25.265 --> 09:30.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're going to do everything
we can to
help folks who are displaced and
see how we

09:30.570 --> 09:32.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can help them get back on their
feet.

09:32.405 --> 09:37.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's been a remarkable thing
is to see how
the community has reached out in
various ways

09:37.577 --> 09:39.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to help these families.

09:39.179 --> 09:43.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Volunteers, a lot of
contributions and donations
we're seeing pouring in now.

09:43.349 --> 09:46.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a real testament to how
this community
is pulling together in tough
times.

09:46.619 --> 09:49.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there
anything else that
the city of San Jose needs?

09:49.689 --> 09:55.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM LICCARDO: Well, certainly,
we appreciate
any contributions through our
local community

09:55.595 --> 09:58.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
foundation to help these
families get back
on their feet.

09:58.531 --> 10:05.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, more than anything, beyond
a big bottle
of Drano, we could use some sun.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we have got some sun today.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we hope that the good
weather will persist
as long as possible.

10:10.376 --> 10:13.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an odd thing to ask for in
California,
because we get 300 days of sun a
year.

10:13.379 --> 10:16.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have just endured years
of drought.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we need more sun.

10:17.684 --> 10:18.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, Mayor Sam Liccardo of
San Jose,
thanks so much.

10:21.754 --> 10:28.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAM LICCARDO: Thank you.

10:28.928 --> 10:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now that we're
one month into
the Trump administration, we
wanted to get

10:35.835 --> 10:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sense of how different parts
of the country
are assessing the president's
time in office.

10:41.174 --> 10:45.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To do that, we have asked
newspaper editors
from three states to tell us
what they're

10:45.545 --> 10:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hearing from readers in their
communities.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they join us now.

10:49.716 --> 10:53.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lee Ann Colacioppo is the editor
of The Denver
Post.

10:54.020 --> 11:00.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Haynes is the editorial
page editor
for The Milwaukee
Journal-Sentinel in Wisconsin.

11:00.126 --> 11:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And David Bradley is the editor
of The St.
Joseph News-Press in Missouri.

11:05.965 --> 11:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all of you to the
"NewsHour."

11:08.468 --> 11:10.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Bradley, I'm going to
start with you.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Missouri is a state that went
heavily for
Donald Trump.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He won by something like 20
points.

11:15.875 --> 11:19.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are you hearing right now
from your readers
about how he's doing?

11:19.812 --> 11:25.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BRADLEY, Editor, St.
Joseph News-Press:
I think people are fairly well
satisfied with

11:25.618 --> 11:27.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what Donald Trump is doing now.

11:27.086 --> 11:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he's done a lot of
things that he
said he would do.

11:30.590 --> 11:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's made a few misstatements
over the last
few weeks, but what he's done, I
think, has

11:35.161 --> 11:36.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been pretty impressive.

11:36.963 --> 11:41.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lee Ann
Colacioppo, what about
your readers in Denver around
Colorado?

11:41.301 --> 11:47.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE ANN COLACIOPPO, Editor, The
Denver Post:
We're getting a lot of really
mixed results,

11:47.173 --> 11:48.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mixed phone calls.

11:49.008 --> 11:54.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got people calling up
really upset,
angry with the Trump
administration, angry

11:54.847 --> 12:01.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with us when we have
editorialized in the
vein of he's lying.

12:01.487 --> 12:06.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we have got a lot of
people who are
-- so we're really hearing from
both sides.

12:06.492 --> 12:09.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK, we are going
to pursue
that.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Haynes, what about in
Milwaukee?

12:11.464 --> 12:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are you picking up from
your readers?

12:13.433 --> 12:15.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HAYNES, Editorial Page
Editor, The Milwaukee
Journal-Sentinel: Well, Judy, it
always depends

12:15.735 --> 12:17.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on who you talk to.

12:17.971 --> 12:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Liberals in our state don't have
much use
of Donald Trump.

12:22.942 --> 12:27.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Independents are a little bit
divided, although
they are concerned about what
has been reported

12:27.413 --> 12:30.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as some of the chaos in the
White House.

12:30.216 --> 12:33.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Conservatives in Wisconsin
didn't support
Donald Trump in the primary.

12:33.886 --> 12:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They went for Ted Cruz, and so
they're still
a little wary and worried that
the agenda

12:38.925 --> 12:45.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Paul Ryan, who is from our
state, may not
get passed in the way they'd
like.

12:45.131 --> 12:50.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I hear from Trump
supporters, mostly,
is you in the media need to let
him get his

12:50.770 --> 12:52.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
administration organized.

12:52.672 --> 12:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I often hear them saying
that, you know,
Bill Clinton didn't exactly have
an easy transition

12:56.643 --> 13:01.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either, but, in the same breath,
they often
will say, but, gosh, I wish he
would stop

13:01.180 --> 13:02.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tweeting at 3:00 in the morning.

13:02.882 --> 13:07.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what about
that, David
Bradley, in Saint Joseph,
Missouri?

13:07.920 --> 13:13.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You mentioned a few
misstatements, but is
that just a small part of what
you're hearing?

13:13.426 --> 13:18.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are people saying about the
tweets and
the other -- some of the
controversial statements

13:18.765 --> 13:20.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he's made?

13:20.667 --> 13:26.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BRADLEY: I think people
really are getting
turned off by all the protests
and all the

13:26.939 --> 13:28.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
antagonism going on.

13:28.741 --> 13:34.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they would just like
people to
sit back, relax, let him try to
run the country

13:34.247 --> 13:38.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and work with Congress and try
to get some
things done that he said.

13:38.284 --> 13:41.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, he's done 24 executive
orders.

13:41.587 --> 13:47.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's done -- he's appointed a
Supreme Court
justice for the Congress to
approve.

13:47.326 --> 13:51.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has met with several foreign
leaders, four
foreign leaders.

13:51.798 --> 13:56.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has talked with a lot of
business leaders
and labor leaders in this
country, and he's

13:56.569 --> 14:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gotten the pipelines opened up
so they can
finish the pipelines.

14:00.707 --> 14:05.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's done quite a few things,
appointed 15
members of the Cabinets.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know it's been delayed, but
he's trying
to get those through.

14:08.614 --> 14:11.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he's done a lot of things, I
think, that
are going in the right
direction.

14:11.984 --> 14:20.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's made a mistake, I think, on
his order
on the immigration from those
seven countries.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's correcting that now.

14:22.161 --> 14:25.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think he's doing
everything he can to
try to keep the country safe.

14:25.398 --> 14:30.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lee Ann
Colacioppo in Denver,
again, are you hearing some of
those same

14:30.536 --> 14:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sentiments where you are?

14:32.371 --> 14:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE ANN COLACIOPPO: I would say
that we are
probably hearing more people who
are concerned

14:37.410 --> 14:40.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the direction of the
administration.

14:40.346 --> 14:43.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We are getting a lot of
protests, it seems
like almost every day.

14:43.416 --> 14:49.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should say
that Colorado
is a state that Hillary Clinton
won by about

14:49.455 --> 14:50.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
five points.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, let me come back to you,
David Haynes,
in Wisconsin.

14:54.827 --> 15:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were saying there's a
mixture of reactions
to the president there.

15:00.800 --> 15:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What about on the immigration
order, the tightening
announced this week and then the
seven-country

15:06.072 --> 15:07.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
travel ban?

15:07.807 --> 15:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HAYNES: Well, immigration,
as in many
states, is an issue that cuts
both ways.

15:12.378 --> 15:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a large population of
recent immigrants
in the Milwaukee area, mostly
from Mexico.

15:16.983 --> 15:20.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a big Day Without
Latinos rally
here.

15:20.753 --> 15:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you get out into the
state, out into
the rural areas, where Donald
Trump won by

15:26.125 --> 15:30.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
large margins, he won our state
by about 10,000
votes, small margin overall, but
he piled

15:30.930 --> 15:32.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up votes in the rural areas.

15:32.632 --> 15:37.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In those areas, that's also
where dairy farming
is in Wisconsin.

15:37.403 --> 15:42.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And dairy farms in Wisconsin
employ -- about
40 percent of their hired hands
are immigrants,

15:42.175 --> 15:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
many of them undocumented.

15:44.010 --> 15:48.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you have a situation in
that area of
the state where you have
neighbors who -- maybe

15:48.581 --> 15:52.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a farmer who has undocumented
immigrants working
for him, and down the road a
neighbor who

15:52.652 --> 15:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went a Trump rally and was
chanting don't
build the wall, so it's quite a
dichotomy

15:56.322 --> 15:58.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here on that issue.

15:58.224 --> 16:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Bradley, in
Missouri,
where you are, again, as we
said, Saint Joseph's,

16:04.497 --> 16:10.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
how much of an issue is
immigration and the
president's attempt to tighten
enforcement

16:10.703 --> 16:13.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the immigration laws
resonating there?

16:13.573 --> 16:18.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BRADLEY: I don't think
people are against
immigration in our part of the
world.

16:18.945 --> 16:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they would like to see
it done legally,
and they would like to go
through the regular

16:23.382 --> 16:25.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
legal channels.

16:25.284 --> 16:33.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a lot of immigrants
working in our
beef-packing or pork-packing
houses in Missouri,

16:33.659 --> 16:35.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a lot of them are great
workers.

16:35.127 --> 16:38.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we would like to see them go
through legal
channels.

16:38.598 --> 16:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, really, the main concern of
people in
our area, they want more and
better jobs.

16:44.170 --> 16:49.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want a more pro-business
environment
and not have so many
regulations, so we can

16:49.408 --> 16:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grow the number of jobs and good
jobs in our
community.

16:52.812 --> 16:58.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lee Ann
Colacioppo in Denver,
how much are you hearing from
people about

16:58.484 --> 17:02.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, about, you know, kind of
like what David
Bradley said a minute ago, that
some people

17:02.388 --> 17:07.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just want the president to get
on with it
and start to do something about
creating jobs?

17:07.760 --> 17:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE ANN COLACIOPPO: You know, I
don't -- it
seems like, from the job
creation standpoint,

17:12.832 --> 17:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is not one of the subjects
that we are
hearing a whole lot about.

17:16.769 --> 17:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're hearing more about
concerns
about the health -- health
insurance has been

17:21.974 --> 17:24.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
big in the discussion.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Immigration has been big.

17:26.279 --> 17:31.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I haven't heard as much from
people discussing
the economy.

17:31.584 --> 17:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have heard -- the bigger part
has been wishing
that so much of the kind of
national talk

17:37.590 --> 17:43.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hasn't -- wasn't drifting into,
say, state
legislature and city councils
and other parts

17:43.663 --> 17:44.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the political spectrum.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean?

17:46.198 --> 17:50.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You mean that they think more
should be done
in Washington or less?

17:50.236 --> 17:56.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE ANN COLACIOPPO: More that
the nastiness
of the national debate has
worked its way

17:56.042 --> 18:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into legislative bodies here
that are usually
more civil.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, David
Haynes -- I'm sorry.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

18:05.751 --> 18:11.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, David Haynes in Milwaukee,
is there a
sense there that the national
debate has gotten

18:11.057 --> 18:14.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rougher in the last couple of
months?

18:14.493 --> 18:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID HAYNES: Well, it's been
going on in
Wisconsin for six years.

18:18.664 --> 18:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had -- we're one of the
most polarized
states in the country.

18:23.803 --> 18:28.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think there is any
question that
the national debate is more
fractured and

18:28.975 --> 18:30.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tougher.

18:30.810 --> 18:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our newspaper, in fact, just
hosted last night
a community conversation, first
of several

18:36.282 --> 18:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're going to do, in which
we're trying to
bring people together face to
face across

18:39.752 --> 18:42.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that divide and talk about it.

18:42.955 --> 18:47.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's a tough -- it's a tough
thing to
do, because we have kind of
retreated to our

18:47.660 --> 18:49.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
echo chambers.

18:49.428 --> 18:54.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a great deal of
tribalism in
terms of people are kind of
locked in and

18:54.867 --> 18:56.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- into positions.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Bradley,
back to you
in Missouri.

19:00.873 --> 19:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What would you say -- finally, I
want to ask
all three of you, what are
people that you're

19:04.777 --> 19:08.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearing from most wanting to see
from this
president?

19:08.881 --> 19:15.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BRADLEY: I think people in
our area
would like to see a better form
of taxation

19:15.554 --> 19:20.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's pro-growth, that helps us
grow our
companies and grow our jobs in
our area.

19:20.826 --> 19:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people will like to see
less regulations,
hopefully, that bog down
businesses from growing

19:26.132 --> 19:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and adding more jobs and good
jobs.

19:29.035 --> 19:36.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they would like to
see a better
sense of communication between
all sides,

19:36.075 --> 19:41.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so they can talk to each other
in a civil
manner and get together and work
together,

19:41.914 --> 19:48.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just antagonize each other
and just wind
up trying to delay everything.

19:48.354 --> 19:53.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is an attitude that
anything he
does is not right today, and
that kind of

19:53.492 --> 19:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attitude is not going to work if
you're trying
to work with a president and a
legislature

19:57.663 --> 19:59.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to work together.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are they putting
the blame
-- just quickly, David Bradley,
so are they

20:01.400 --> 20:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting the blame on Republicans
or Democrats
or everybody?

20:05.371 --> 20:10.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BRADLEY: I think both
sides are pointing
at each other.

20:10.242 --> 20:16.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they wound up -- I
think there
is a way to get together and
talk and hopefully

20:16.615 --> 20:18.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
try to work things out.

20:18.818 --> 20:24.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think Trump is
willing -- is determined
to get everything he wants, and
I don't think

20:24.490 --> 20:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Congress is going to get
everything they
want.

20:26.859 --> 20:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there has got to be some
form of compromise
there, and we can make some
headway and get

20:31.130 --> 20:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this country off its stagnation.

20:33.332 --> 20:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly to
the other two
of you.

20:35.801 --> 20:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lee Ann Colacioppo, hopes for
this administration
from your people in your area?

20:42.508 --> 20:47.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE ANN COLACIOPPO: I hear a lot
of -- very
similar to what he was just
saying, I hear

20:47.379 --> 20:54.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of people just wishing
that the nasty
tone would come down and that
there wouldn't

20:54.053 --> 20:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just be a stalemate in Congress,
and that
they would all be able to work
together to

20:58.691 --> 21:03.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get something done that would
incorporate
the thoughts of both parties,
compromise,

21:03.929 --> 21:05.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
basically.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Haynes,
finally, in Milwaukee,
what are the hopes?

21:08.868 --> 21:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID HAYNES: Well, I think one
of the hopes
right now is that the White
House can become

21:13.572 --> 21:16.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
less chaotic and more
professional.

21:16.342 --> 21:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It really seems to be like
amateur hour right
now.

21:19.478 --> 21:25.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for both conservatives and
independents
in our state, there is concern
that it's hard

21:25.417 --> 21:28.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get anything done if there
isn't good leadership
coming from the White House.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We want to thank
all three
of you for joining us.

21:31.724 --> 21:38.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lee Ann Colacioppo, The Denver
Post, David
Bradley, The St. Joseph
News-Press in Missouri,

21:38.531 --> 21:42.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and David Haynes, The Milwaukee
Journal-Sentinel
in Wisconsin, we appreciate it.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEE ANN COLACIOPPO: Thank you.

21:44.770 --> 21:48.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID HAYNES: Thank you.

21:48.941 --> 21:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BRADLEY: Thank you.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Enjoyed it.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

21:58.017 --> 22:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
newly discovered
solar system sparks hope for
finding alien

22:03.155 --> 22:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life; and an industrial town
putting its hopes
in President Trump's promise to
revitalize

22:08.661 --> 22:10.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
manufacturing.

22:10.429 --> 22:16.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Nearly five million
Syrians have
fled their homeland for relative
safety in

22:16.135 --> 22:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
surrounding Middle Eastern
countries.

22:18.204 --> 22:22.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some hope to emigrate to Europe
and elsewhere,
and undergo processing at United
Nations'

22:22.208 --> 22:24.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
centers throughout the region.

22:24.276 --> 22:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those hoping to come to the U.S.
have an uncertain
future ahead of them, amid the
Trump administration's

22:29.281 --> 22:30.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
orders on immigration.

22:31.016 --> 22:35.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Jordan, special
correspondent Mike Cerre
reports.

MIKE CERRE: The long roads for
refugees hoping
to settle in the U.S. and other
countries

22:43.562 --> 22:50.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start at processing centers like
this one
in the region run by the U.N.
Refugee Agency,

22:50.803 --> 22:53.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
UNHCR.

22:53.539 --> 22:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Always a tedious and emotional
process, recent
changes in U.S. immigration
policy added a

22:59.178 --> 23:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new level of anxiety for many
refugees, whose
final security screenings and
departure flights

23:05.017 --> 23:11.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were abruptly canceled, while
UNHCR officials
could sort out the implications
of the executive

23:11.890 --> 23:13.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

23:13.726 --> 23:17.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Stromberg is the deputy
director of the
UNHCR refugee resettlement
immigration office

23:17.096 --> 23:18.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Jordan.

23:18.897 --> 23:23.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL STROMBERG, UNHCR: The
process doesn't
allow, really, to speed up or
slow down the

23:23.302 --> 23:29.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who are traveling, have
completed this
very thorough screening process
that has lasted,

23:29.708 --> 23:32.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for each of them, between one
and two years.

23:32.378 --> 23:37.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For many families, the ones who
were about
to leave at the end of that very
extensive

23:37.750 --> 23:40.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process, had to be rebooked on
flights.

23:40.653 --> 23:47.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: After six years of
war, the nearly
five million Syrian refugees are
still living

23:47.359 --> 23:52.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within 200 miles of their homes
in neighboring
countries like here in Jordan,
Lebanon and

23:52.464 --> 23:58.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey, with fewer options of
ever being able
to go back, or going forward, as
more Western

23:58.137 --> 24:01.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
governments start closing their
immigration
doors.

24:01.774 --> 24:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as we discovered along the
Turkey-Syria
border, settling in the U.S. has
rarely been

24:07.079 --> 24:11.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the refugees' first choice, for
geographic
and cultural reasons.

24:12.017 --> 24:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most Syrian refugees have
preferred staying
close to their homeland and
relatives, rather

24:17.790 --> 24:20.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than immigrating to Europe, let
alone the
U.S.

24:20.893 --> 24:26.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHANA, Social Worker: And, also,
they have
Syrian coffee here, and also the
trademark,

24:26.899 --> 24:28.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's Syrian.

24:28.867 --> 24:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Rhana, an English
literature professor
back in Syria, is now a social
worker, helping

24:34.173 --> 24:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her fellow Syrian refugees get
food and housing.

24:37.509 --> 24:42.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She believes many refugees'
cultural ties
to the region are holding them
back from going

24:42.581 --> 24:45.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to Europe as much as the
financial and legal
obstacles.

24:45.451 --> 24:51.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RHANA: It depends on the
mentality of Syrian
people.

24:51.190 --> 25:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, if they find jobs,
and they could
be able to afford living in
Turkey, I think

25:00.065 --> 25:02.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they will rather stay in Turkey.

25:02.534 --> 25:06.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't need to even exert
effort to learn
the language.

25:06.271 --> 25:09.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they share a lot with the
Turkish people.

25:09.842 --> 25:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: With no end of the
war in sight,
neighboring host countries
closed their borders

25:16.715 --> 25:18.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Syria last year.

25:18.817 --> 25:24.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The overwhelming strain on their
economies
and delays in foreign aid
pledges have forced

25:24.590 --> 25:29.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them to reduce social services,
prompting
more Syrian and Iraqi refugees
to choose the

25:29.995 --> 25:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immigration route, no matter how
long it takes.

25:33.165 --> 25:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL STROMBERG: There are over
650,000 registered
Syrians in Jordan, almost 10
percent of the

25:38.470 --> 25:39.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
population.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, many would like to go to
other countries.

25:41.807 --> 25:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first of all, those spaces
have to be
made available.

25:45.411 --> 25:46.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can't apply for them.

25:46.645 --> 25:47.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They don't get in line.

25:47.813 --> 25:51.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't come here and demand
anything.

25:51.550 --> 25:57.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But through spaces made
available by resettlement
countries, then we will go out
and check who

25:57.723 --> 25:59.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
best suits those conditions.

25:59.691 --> 26:06.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: The U.S. has taken
far fewer Syrian
refugees per capita than the
other 30 resettlement

26:06.598 --> 26:12.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries, fewer than 18,000,
compared to
Canada's nearly 40,000 and
Germany's more

26:12.938 --> 26:15.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than 600,000.

26:15.174 --> 26:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. also has an additional
vetting process
not required by the others.

26:20.212 --> 26:25.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL STROMBERG: As a refugee,
you are dealing
with several different security
agencies,

26:25.884 --> 26:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different security databases,
biometric registration
at different checks, at
different points of

26:31.723 --> 26:37.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the process, face-to-face
interviews at different
points to verify what you are
telling authorities.

26:37.930 --> 26:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Refuges stay abreast
of the latest
immigration developments on
local news channels

26:43.535 --> 26:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and through regular contact with
relatives
and friends already in the U.S.

26:48.640 --> 26:54.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This Syrian Kurdish refugee
family from Kobani
sold the last of their family
jewelry to pay

26:54.446 --> 26:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rent for their apartment in
an unfinished
building they are living here
until they know

26:59.585 --> 27:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where their future will be.

27:01.520 --> 27:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): God's
willing, if
Kobani is liberated, I will go
back.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wish I can reach Kobani and
die there.

27:09.862 --> 27:15.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: Even if the
immigration ban is
permanently overturned or
substantially changed,

27:15.901 --> 27:22.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's had a chilling effect on
many refugees,
who are now not sure if they
still want to

27:22.040 --> 27:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go to the U.S. if and when they
get another
chance.

27:26.645 --> 27:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," Mike
Cerre reporting
from Amman, Jordan.

27:35.854 --> 27:44.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to this
week's edition
of Leading Edge.

27:44.263 --> 27:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is new excitement tonight
about the
search for possible life in a
solar system

27:48.567 --> 27:50.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beyond our own.

27:50.536 --> 27:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Astronomers have identified
seven Earth-sized
planets orbiting a star just a
mere 230 trillion

27:56.775 --> 27:58.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
miles or so from our own planet.

27:58.810 --> 28:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That sounds like a mind-boggling
distance.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.180 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It is.

28:02.214 --> 28:05.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But researchers say the idea of
life on one
of these exoplanets, as they're
called, is

28:05.951 --> 28:07.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tantalizing.

28:07.753 --> 28:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Astronomers, using ground and
space telescopes
operated by NASA and the
European Southern

28:12.224 --> 28:14.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Observatory, made the
announcement.

28:14.359 --> 28:17.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our own Miles O'Brien is here to
guide us
through the news.

28:17.396 --> 28:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, if something is so
far away
-- this is maybe a basic science
question

28:22.134 --> 28:24.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- how do we know what we know
and what we
saw?

28:24.670 --> 28:26.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's a good
question.

28:26.171 --> 28:27.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, think about it for a
minute.

28:27.472 --> 28:31.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's trillions of miles away,
how is it
even possible?

28:31.176 --> 28:34.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, imagine -- the technique is
called transit
photometry.

28:34.680 --> 28:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, imagine you're about a mile
away from
a headlight and a mosquito goes
across the

28:39.451 --> 28:41.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
headlight.

28:41.253 --> 28:44.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Believe it not, that headlight
is slightly
dimmed by the fact that that
mosquito goes

28:44.690 --> 28:45.657 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
across.

28:45.691 --> 28:47.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, this is tantamount to what
they do.

28:47.559 --> 28:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The planet goes in front of the
star, it dims
ever so slightly, and with a lot
of complicated

28:53.398 --> 28:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sensitive instrumentation,
you can determine
that, in fact, that's a planet.

28:57.636 --> 28:59.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They discovered three of them
this way.

28:59.438 --> 29:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They said, hmm, this is an
interesting, ultra-cool
brown dwarf to look at.

29:04.943 --> 29:06.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's put some more hardware on
it.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They set more instrumentation on
it.

29:08.513 --> 29:12.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, sure enough, there ended up
to be seven
Earth-like planets, just about
the size and

29:12.985 --> 29:17.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mass of Earth, orbiting this
Jupiter-sized,
ultra-cool brown dwarf.

29:17.723 --> 29:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, you say
ultra-cool,
that doesn't mean it's a cold
sun.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just not as big or as hot
as ours, right?

29:23.061 --> 29:26.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's about like
Jupiter is
to us, OK, cooler and smaller.

29:26.565 --> 29:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And when we
talk about this
habitable zone, this Goldilocks,
not too cold,

29:31.403 --> 29:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not too hot, how do they know
that there are
planets in this group that exist
within that

29:35.807 --> 29:37.643 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
range?

29:37.676 --> 29:40.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They can measure
the radiation
off of TRAPPIST-1, this
particular ultra-cool

29:40.912 --> 29:45.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brown dwarf, and figure out the
zone at which
water would remain liquid.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's the key.

29:47.519 --> 29:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everywhere we look on this
planet and we find
liquid water, we find life.

29:50.756 --> 29:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't matter where we go.

29:52.557 --> 29:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in the hunt for potential
alien life,
the thought of finding places
where there

29:57.729 --> 30:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is liquid water is what really
intrigues scientists.

30:00.999 --> 30:07.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, these planets are a lot
closer to TRAPPIST-1
than we are to our son, but,
remember, it's

30:07.906 --> 30:09.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
smaller and dimmer.

30:09.941 --> 30:12.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they have these very tight
little orbits.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's quite likely there
might be water
on some of them.

30:14.880 --> 30:19.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, even with
just a few
weeks that we have been watching
this particular

30:19.751 --> 30:25.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system, what do we know about
what it would
be like to stand on one of these
perhaps rocky,

30:25.357 --> 30:26.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inhabitable planets?

30:26.491 --> 30:28.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It would be a
very interesting
place.

30:28.527 --> 30:33.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For one thing, we believe they
are tidal-locked,
which means -- it's like our
moon facing us.

30:33.732 --> 30:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We only see one side of the moon
as it orbits
around.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These planets face their star
all the time.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you have got a sunny side and
you have
got a nighttime side.

30:41.973 --> 30:45.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you're buying real
estate, I would
go on the sunny side of one of
these planets,

30:45.043 --> 30:46.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for sure.

30:46.044 --> 30:47.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:47.879 --> 30:49.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: If you were to
stand there,
you would see probably kind of
almost perpetual

30:49.848 --> 30:52.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sunset kind of idea.

30:52.184 --> 30:57.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these other planets would be
perhaps larger
than our moon in the sky.

30:57.189 --> 30:59.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would be a very interesting
place to be.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it
wouldn't take 365
days to go around.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These things are spinning
around...

31:03.528 --> 31:04.496 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:04.529 --> 31:06.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right?

31:06.131 --> 31:07.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: No, no, the one
closest in
is about a day-and-a-half
around.

31:07.165 --> 31:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The one farthest out, they think
about 20
days.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you are going to live out
there, you
are going to get old quickly.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, this is
just the first
little look that we had.

31:12.971 --> 31:16.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And scientists love to start to
point every
other piece of technology they
have.

31:16.508 --> 31:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do we hope to learn with
perhaps the
satellites that are coming up?

31:19.778 --> 31:22.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, exoplanet
researchers
are very excited about this.

31:22.547 --> 31:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a matter of fact, they're
deploying existing
instrumentation on it.

31:26.318 --> 31:29.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's listen briefly to Sara
Seager, who is
an exoplanet researcher at MIT.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARA SEAGER, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology:
The great news is we can observe
in the near

31:32.858 --> 31:34.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We no longer have to rely on
what we think
and speculation, because nature
usually is

31:36.828 --> 31:38.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
smarter we are.

31:38.430 --> 31:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if there is any way for life
to get a
foothold, we like to believe it
will.

31:42.467 --> 31:45.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is like
the Super Bowl
for exoplanet researchers.

31:45.203 --> 31:46.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

31:46.204 --> 31:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It is indeed.

31:48.006 --> 31:51.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're looking ahead toward a
big improvement
in the space-based telescope
capability.

31:51.176 --> 31:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The James Webb Space Telescope,
long delayed,
overbudget NASA project, is
finally slated

31:57.115 --> 31:59.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for launch in October of 2018.

31:59.351 --> 32:04.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will have spectroscopy
equipment on it,
which means it will be able to
analyze the

32:04.422 --> 32:09.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
atmosphere of these planets and
identify some
of the key building blocks of
life, whether

32:09.394 --> 32:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's oxygen, or hydrogen, or
methane or carbon,
and make some determination as
to whether

32:15.500 --> 32:19.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is even more likely that
there is potential
life on some of these planets.

32:19.871 --> 32:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,

MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome,
Hari.

32:32.317 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our series
on the economic
concerns of Trump voters in a
few hard-hit

32:39.524 --> 32:41.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
areas of the country.

32:41.526 --> 32:46.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, we're listening to
them describe
their hopes for Mr. Trump now
that he is president.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is here with more.

32:48.166 --> 32:52.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Our colleagues at
"Frontline"
traveled to regions that once
voted Democratic,

32:52.270 --> 32:54.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but voted for Donald Trump in
this election.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night, we heard from miners
in West Virginia
coal country.

32:57.642 --> 33:01.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, a profile of a couple
in Erie County,
Pennsylvania.

33:01.279 --> 33:05.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of How the Deck Is
Stacked, the
"NewsHour"'s collaboration with
"Frontline"

33:05.417 --> 33:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and marketplace, in conjunction
with the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting.

33:09.521 --> 33:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE ORENGIA, Owner, Joe's Gym:
OK.

33:14.125 --> 33:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm Joe Orengia, and this is my
business,
Joe's Gym, Erie, Pennsylvania,
current world

33:20.232 --> 33:21.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
champion.

33:21.566 --> 33:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a veteran, I'm on Social
Security, and
I'm a businessman.

33:26.004 --> 33:30.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been undefeated world
champion since
1993.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I teach people how to get their
life back.

33:32.878 --> 33:38.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only way you're going to get
your life
back is to get your strength
back.

33:38.984 --> 33:42.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to see Erie the way it
used to be.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have got to get our
manufacturing back.

33:45.156 --> 33:51.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the sake of my children and
grandchildren,
I hope something happens.

33:51.129 --> 34:04.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
So, Erie has lost nearly one in
three manufacturing

34:04.476 --> 34:05.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs.

34:05.477 --> 34:06.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know that.

34:06.978 --> 34:08.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All you do.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.682 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I flew over.

34:10.715 --> 34:14.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're looking at the plants,
but you see
them.

34:14.819 --> 34:18.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're falling over, the rain,
the sleet,
the snow, the wind.

34:18.323 --> 34:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are great buildings that
are falling
apart.

34:28.366 --> 34:33.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are great buildings that
are falling
apart.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I promise, we can fix it so
fast.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to bring it back.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to bring back our
jobs.

34:40.378 --> 34:41.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to bring back our
companies.

34:41.880 --> 34:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE ORENGIA: Fifties and '60s,
when I was
a kid, it was awesome.

34:50.355 --> 34:55.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My dad raised seven of us kids,
as a coal
miner, worked his butt off.

34:55.060 --> 34:58.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They moved up here when I was 1
years-old
to go to work at G.E.

34:58.697 --> 35:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My brothers and my nephews, they
all worked
at G.E.

35:03.134 --> 35:07.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They wanted me to go down to
G.E., but I said,
I like this physical stuff,
because I was

35:07.272 --> 35:10.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a bridge builder, ironworker and
bridge builder,
at Local 348 union.

35:10.775 --> 35:16.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I was one of their best
climbers, so I always
got the job of putting the
buildings together,

35:16.348 --> 35:17.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
which was fun.

35:17.549 --> 35:20.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You climb up the column, big
piece of steel
comes up.

35:20.585 --> 35:22.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You bolt it up.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You walk out, unhook the cable
and stand there
and wait for the next piece.

35:24.856 --> 35:25.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody had good jobs.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everybody had good-paying jobs.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I need a car, I had the money to
go buy one.

35:30.929 --> 35:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was making my house payments,
feeding the
family.

35:34.299 --> 35:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even when I when I retired from
the ironwork,
I didn't have to retire.

35:37.502 --> 35:38.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They didn't want me to retire.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I says, I want to run a gym.

35:40.605 --> 35:45.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to get my gym going.

35:45.343 --> 35:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I put up the big buildings for
the Hammermill
Paper Company, 10-story
buildings in Erie.

35:50.548 --> 35:51.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I put them up.

35:51.549 --> 35:52.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was a connector.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I put these -- ah, I would have
fun.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I loved it.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're gone.

35:57.422 --> 36:00.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the people are gone.

36:00.492 --> 36:15.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems like, about the last 15
years, things
have really sucked, because a
lot of people

36:15.240 --> 36:18.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are leaving the area because the
manufacturing
jobs have left.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There's no work.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I used to see all these guys
walking down
the street with their lunch
bucket in their

36:23.915 --> 36:25.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hand going to work.

36:25.216 --> 36:39.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now you see them walking down
the street with
food stamps.

36:39.064 --> 36:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had a lot of members here from
G.E.

36:41.266 --> 36:42.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't anymore.

36:42.267 --> 36:45.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think I have two.

36:45.336 --> 36:46.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A lot of them left Erie.

36:46.337 --> 36:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not even around Erie
anymore.

36:52.710 --> 36:53.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My wife runs a business.

36:53.912 --> 36:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She owns Custom Audio, right up
the road here.

36:58.716 --> 37:01.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The minimum I put in here is
eight hours a
day.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Last night, I was here 14 hours.

37:03.655 --> 37:08.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My wife puts in a minimum of 60
hours a week,
and sometimes 80.

37:08.359 --> 37:09.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We have to.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONDRALEE ORENGIA, Owner, Custom
Audio: So,
I'm Sondralee Orengia.

37:12.864 --> 37:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have owned an electronics
store for 33 years.

37:17.168 --> 37:23.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a couple of years ago, I
really cut back
on the staff.

37:23.074 --> 37:26.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're just -- we're really
lean right
now, and I think a lot of
business owners

37:26.611 --> 37:32.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are treating their businesses
that way.

37:32.550 --> 37:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's happening to Erie is,
G.E. is transitioning
down to Texas and Mexico.

37:43.294 --> 37:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So those really good-paying jobs
will be leaving.

37:46.798 --> 37:51.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the other shops can't
afford those
higher-paying jobs.

37:51.936 --> 37:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can pay well, but not as
well as what
some of the other workers, you
know, at G.E.

37:56.741 --> 38:00.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are used to.

38:00.078 --> 38:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE ORENGIA: I love people, all
kinds of people.

38:10.188 --> 38:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE ORENGIA: I love people, all
kinds of people.

38:22.534 --> 38:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to see the American
patriots, the American
people that love this country,
be happy and

38:29.574 --> 38:30.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
healthy.

38:30.575 --> 38:33.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When your health goes, this
goes.

38:33.044 --> 38:38.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have been knocked down
thousands of times
in my life in everything I have
done, and

38:38.716 --> 38:40.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I came back stronger than ever.

38:40.885 --> 38:50.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was actually a Democrat way
back, because
my family was, back when
Democrats made more

38:50.929 --> 38:57.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was actually a Democrat way
back, because
my family was, back when
Democrats made more

38:57.936 --> 38:59.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sense to me.

38:59.704 --> 39:02.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SONDRALEE ORENGIA: The
Democratic Party's
so strong here, and then you get
someone like

39:02.740 --> 39:06.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump who is really a
very different
candidate.

39:06.144 --> 39:11.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we have never seen
anything like him
before, and I think that scares
people.

39:12.016 --> 39:15.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think the people who voted
for him,
they are hopeful.

39:15.820 --> 39:23.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE ORENGIA: So that night,
during the election,
I sat up until the local news
came on.

39:23.294 --> 39:35.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He won Erie, which has not been
won by a Republican
since the '80s.

39:35.340 --> 39:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If things get a little even just
a little
bit better, OK, let's give him
another four

39:39.444 --> 39:46.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years, because maybe they will
get a little
bit more better.

39:46.451 --> 39:48.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
If things get worse, no.

39:48.786 --> 39:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have got to give him a chance.

39:54.659 --> 39:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm still probably going to
go back to
independent because I don't --
still don't

39:59.097 --> 40:00.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agree with a lot of either one
of them.

40:00.932 --> 40:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have my own ideas, and I
try to go with
the best person, not the best
party.

40:12.310 --> 40:21.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We asked two
economists who've
served in past administrations
to watch these

40:21.219 --> 40:22.587 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reports.

40:22.620 --> 40:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Douglas Holtz-Eakin served in
the George W.
Bush administration.

40:25.189 --> 40:27.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now with the American
Action Forum.

40:27.592 --> 40:30.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jared Bernstein worked for
Vice President
Biden.

40:30.161 --> 40:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now at the Center on Budget
and Policy
Priorities.

40:33.298 --> 40:34.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jared, let me start with you.

40:36.067 --> 40:38.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no denying the problem
that we just
saw.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What struck you watching these
videos?

40:40.738 --> 40:42.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN, Former Chief
Economist to
Vice President Joe Biden: I saw
considerable

40:42.640 --> 40:47.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
despair, but I also heard a
great deal of
hope there.

40:47.578 --> 40:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was a kind of hope that
has been very
much amped up by Donald Trump's
rhetoric around

40:53.584 --> 40:59.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the campaign, the kind of jobs
and sectors
he's arguing that he can bring
back to those

40:59.524 --> 41:00.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
communities.

41:00.558 --> 41:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, man, they really need those
jobs and
sectors.

41:03.695 --> 41:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My concern, my fear, really, is
that he can't
deliver on that hope.

41:07.665 --> 41:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And despair met with hope that
doesn't end
up being delivered, that's a
problem.

41:13.171 --> 41:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, let
get a first
impression from Douglas
Holtz-Eakin.

41:16.307 --> 41:17.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you see?

41:17.308 --> 41:19.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you hear?

41:19.110 --> 41:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, Former
Congressional
Budget Office Director: Well, I
think a lot

41:19.944 --> 41:22.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the things Jared heard.

41:22.246 --> 41:24.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number one, this is -- these are
stories of
great distress.

41:24.816 --> 41:25.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's real.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's palpable, and unmistakable.

41:27.485 --> 41:32.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is also a longing for a
past that it's
not realistic to expect to
return.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Erie, Pennsylvania, is close to
my hometown.

41:35.660 --> 41:40.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's no longer the
transportation hub it was
when we had the Erie Canal and
water transportation

41:40.264 --> 41:42.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the central part of the U.S.
economy.

41:42.867 --> 41:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And coal is not the same in the
presence of
Western coal that competes with
it or natural

41:48.406 --> 41:50.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gas that competes with it.

41:50.241 --> 41:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a realistic assessment talks
about, what
can their future be, not what
was their past?

41:54.545 --> 41:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, that -- so,
Doug, start
with that.

41:56.414 --> 42:00.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Help us think about what a
president can do
and look at some of the things
Donald Trump

42:01.018 --> 42:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is talking about, at least, tax
reform, for
example, tax cuts.

42:05.089 --> 42:10.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think
there is an enormous
amount that the president can do
on tax reform.

42:10.828 --> 42:15.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a tax code that, broadly
speaking,
favors foreign production over
domestic production.

42:15.900 --> 42:20.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A good reform would neutralize
that and shift
things back to the U.S. when
they're driven

42:20.838 --> 42:21.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
offshore by taxes.

42:21.839 --> 42:23.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That would a great step.

42:23.641 --> 42:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't mean they will land
in Erie or
that doesn't mean they will land
in coal country,

42:25.309 --> 42:27.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it's something that should
be done.

42:27.145 --> 42:31.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Jared,
would those kinds
of things have an impact on the
workers we

42:32.016 --> 42:33.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
saw?

42:33.818 --> 42:36.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Perhaps at the
margin, but
I think we put way too much
weight on tax

42:36.354 --> 42:38.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reform as economists.

42:38.456 --> 42:43.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had very different tax
regimes while
globalization has been ongoing,
and you have

42:43.895 --> 42:45.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seen what's happened in these
communities.

42:45.963 --> 42:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I don't think we can count on
tweaks in
the tax code -- and Doug and I
could probably

42:49.267 --> 42:53.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agree on some very good ones,
because the
tax code is pretty messed up --
and hope that

42:53.037 --> 42:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this globalization toothpaste
will somehow
go back in the tube, which is
what I hear

42:56.874 --> 42:58.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump promising.

42:58.609 --> 43:00.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I agree with Doug.

43:00.511 --> 43:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What needs to happen is that
these communities
have to adapt to globalization,
which doesn't

43:04.148 --> 43:06.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean you can get back jobs that
aren't coming
back.

43:06.584 --> 43:10.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it does mean that you can
make a play
for advanced manufacturing, for
new industries,

43:11.022 --> 43:12.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for new types of energy.

43:12.557 --> 43:14.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't hear that coming out of
this administration.

43:14.325 --> 43:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about -- one
thing you
do here is pushing individual
companies to

43:18.162 --> 43:20.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stay, right, to not move jobs
offshore.

43:20.565 --> 43:21.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Yes.

43:21.699 --> 43:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, that's mostly public
relations.

43:23.401 --> 43:25.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not a systematic economic
plan.

43:25.603 --> 43:29.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, frankly, I kind of like
when the president
takes the bully pulpit and says,
we want you

43:29.440 --> 43:30.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to keep jobs here.

43:30.508 --> 43:31.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's kind of old-school.

43:31.809 --> 43:33.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it resonates with me.

43:33.311 --> 43:34.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But it's not...

43:34.545 --> 43:35.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That could be
old-school liberal,
right?

43:35.713 --> 43:37.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Yes, but it's
not an economic
plan.

43:37.715 --> 43:42.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a systematic strategy
that will help
deliver the goods to the kinds
of communities

43:42.987 --> 43:44.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we're talking about.

43:44.856 --> 43:46.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Doug, Doug
Holtz-Eakin, what
do you think about that kind of
move and -- that

43:46.724 --> 43:47.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kind of move?

43:48.025 --> 43:50.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there's also the
deregulation that
he talks about.

43:50.761 --> 43:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think the
bully pulpit
is fine, but businesses follow
economic incentives.

43:56.300 --> 44:00.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once you give them a good
chastising,
the economic incentives are
still the same.

44:00.171 --> 44:03.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And unless you change them, over
the long
haul, the results will be the
same.

44:03.441 --> 44:07.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the bully pulpit is great,
but following
through and actually changing
the incentives

44:07.478 --> 44:10.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have and the kinds of
things that get
produced in these communities is
the key.

44:10.915 --> 44:15.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that taking a good,
hard look
at the regulatory state makes
sense.

44:15.586 --> 44:20.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen a dramatic decline
in the startup
of new businesses in the United
States.

44:20.625 --> 44:22.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's something that's happened
across sectors.

44:22.126 --> 44:25.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just in manufacturing
or just in
retail.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so there's something going
on there.

44:27.164 --> 44:31.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that, when you start
new businesses,
that's when you get the job
growth, that's

44:31.469 --> 44:33.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when you get the new
opportunities.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something that I
think any administration
should look closely at.

44:35.673 --> 44:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What is the -- I
think, Jared,
you brought up the word hope,
which you heard

44:39.577 --> 44:41.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from these people.

44:41.345 --> 44:45.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard the woman in Erie say
people who
voted for him, Donald Trump,
they're hopeful.

44:45.850 --> 44:47.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How important is the
psychological factor?

44:47.985 --> 44:51.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Well, I think
it's important,
but I also think it's
omnipresent.

44:51.556 --> 44:53.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have been to places like this.

44:53.224 --> 44:57.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you constantly run into
folks like that
who really have hope for the
future.

44:57.795 --> 45:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what it is, is that they
want to participate
in the economy.

45:02.199 --> 45:08.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Structural changes,
globalization, these kinds
of -- the loss of the unions,
the kind of

45:08.706 --> 45:12.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
labor standards kind of eroding,
they have
really hurt these folks.

45:12.944 --> 45:16.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what they would like is a
chance to ply
their trade.

45:16.480 --> 45:20.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like the guy who says, I'm a
hard worker and
hard work is good, that --
again, that resonated

45:20.851 --> 45:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with me, but he doesn't have the
employment
opportunity.

45:24.188 --> 45:25.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

45:25.957 --> 45:26.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: So, what we
really ought
to be talking about is how he's
going to get

45:26.991 --> 45:27.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

45:27.992 --> 45:29.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One idea is infrastructure.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can look at those films, and
you see these
places really need some
infrastructure.

45:32.797 --> 45:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this is something that the
Trump administration
has talked about, but it doesn't
seem to be

45:37.034 --> 45:38.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
getting anywhere.

45:38.035 --> 45:39.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's a concern of mine.

45:39.870 --> 45:42.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: What's a
particular thing that,
if you could wave your magic
wand, Doug, that

45:42.673 --> 45:44.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you would like to see?

45:44.041 --> 45:47.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, look,
the reality
is this.

45:47.144 --> 45:49.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can only have the
infrastructure if you
have businesses that are going
to use it.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so that becomes an issue.

45:51.415 --> 45:54.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reality is that, in the
manufacturing
sector, it's been automation.

45:54.385 --> 45:57.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It takes 10 percent of the
workers that it
used to, to create the same
things in the

45:57.955 --> 45:59.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S. and export them.

45:59.657 --> 46:01.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so there are fewer
opportunities.

46:01.592 --> 46:05.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you need to be the worker
who can take
advantage of those
opportunities.

46:05.796 --> 46:11.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is unsurprising that people
with a college
degree have an unemployment rate
of 2.5 percent.

46:11.235 --> 46:12.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the magic elixir in this
economy.

46:13.004 --> 46:17.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these communities have too
many people
who have not had the educational
foundation

46:17.308 --> 46:19.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to take advantage of that.

46:19.143 --> 46:22.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're missing the programs
that get people
who want to work hard, but do
not have the

46:22.580 --> 46:23.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
skills up to speed.

46:23.581 --> 46:24.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:24.582 --> 46:25.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, go ahead,
Jared.

46:25.950 --> 46:28.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: So, here I have
-- kind of
flip the politics a bit.

46:28.386 --> 46:32.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm completely for people being
able to get
all the skills they can.

46:32.189 --> 46:37.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you -- you can get be all
educated
and still not have a job that
will suffice

46:37.561 --> 46:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for you in your community.

46:39.430 --> 46:43.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so here is where I think
Donald Trump
has said something important and
useful.

46:43.367 --> 46:46.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's not just about
education or infrastructure.

46:46.303 --> 46:47.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's about trade.

46:47.838 --> 46:49.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's actually the case.

46:49.707 --> 46:54.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's right that these
communities have been
hurt by our large and persistent
trade deficits.

46:54.345 --> 46:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we need to take steps to
reduce those
as well.

46:56.714 --> 47:00.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, I don't hear them really
talking about
it, other than some tariffs,
which are bad

47:00.384 --> 47:01.352 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ideas.

47:01.385 --> 47:02.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there are good ways to do
that also.

47:02.753 --> 47:05.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, Doug
Holtz-Eakin, a last
word here from you?

47:05.222 --> 47:08.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: I think the
trade piece
is vastly overblown.

47:08.993 --> 47:10.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think that's the source
of their problems.

47:10.895 --> 47:14.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the -- even the
tape on Erie,
their problems began in the
'70s, well before

47:14.999 --> 47:19.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we saw NAFTA, well before we saw
the famed
entry of China into the WTO.

47:19.537 --> 47:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are deep, structural
trends in the economy.

47:21.772 --> 47:27.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are places that had
valuable resources,
coal and transportation access,
that no longer

47:27.078 --> 47:29.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have those as their economic
playing card.

47:29.447 --> 47:32.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They need to create a new one,
or the people
who stay there simply aren't
going to have

47:32.583 --> 47:34.385 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an opportunity.

47:34.418 --> 47:36.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Douglas Holtz-Eakin,
Jared Bernstein, thank you both
very much.

47:36.420 --> 47:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Thank you.

47:37.488 --> 47:39.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: Thank you.

47:39.423 --> 47:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And for a look at
the extended-length
videos in this series, Betting
on Trump, go

47:43.761 --> 47:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the "NewsHour" Web site.

47:50.768 --> 47:57.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

47:57.408 --> 48:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration today
announced that
it would soon make a major
change regarding

48:02.246 --> 48:07.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the contentious issue of
transgender youth
and which bathrooms they use at
school.

48:07.918 --> 48:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that story.

48:09.820 --> 48:13.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Department
of Justice
and Education are expected to
roll back Obama-era

48:14.024 --> 48:19.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guidance that advises schools to
let transgender
kids use the bathroom that
corresponds with

48:19.597 --> 48:23.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their gender identity, not
necessarily the
gender they were born with.

48:23.868 --> 48:27.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if that guidance goes away,
what does
this mean for schools?

48:27.304 --> 48:30.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Evie Blad from Education Week is
back to help
us sort it all out.

48:30.741 --> 48:31.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome back.

48:31.742 --> 48:32.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVIE BLAD, Education Week: Thank
you.

48:32.877 --> 48:34.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's do
this chronologically.

48:34.211 --> 48:37.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Last year, the Obama
administration put out
these guidelines.

48:37.114 --> 48:43.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said, if you, schools, have
transgender
students in your schools, let
them use the

48:43.687 --> 48:46.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bathrooms that correspond with
their gender
identity.

48:46.624 --> 48:48.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's the rationale for that
argument?

48:48.793 --> 48:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVIE BLAD: Well, the Obama
administration
argued that the sex
discrimination protections

48:52.963 --> 48:59.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Title IX, the federal law,
applied to gender
identity, rather than merely
biological sex.

49:00.004 --> 49:04.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they had heard from many
districts and
states and some educational
groups that there

49:04.842 --> 49:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a lack of clarity at the
state and local
level.

49:07.711 --> 49:13.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they put out this federal
civil rights
guidance to say, not only do you
have to allow

49:13.450 --> 49:17.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
these children access to
facilities that match
their gender identity.

49:17.588 --> 49:19.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to respect that on
forms.

49:19.490 --> 49:26.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to provide a safe
learning environment
free from bullying based on this
identity.

49:26.463 --> 49:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you cannot disclose their
transgender
status if they don't want it to
be disclosed.

49:31.702 --> 49:35.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now, a lot of
states welcomed
this guidance and said they were
already doing

49:36.006 --> 49:37.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those sort of practices.

49:37.741 --> 49:39.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of states resisted.

49:39.143 --> 49:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
About a dozen or so sued.

49:41.111 --> 49:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was their argument against
this guidance?

49:42.980 --> 49:44.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EVIE BLAD: Right.

49:44.215 --> 49:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, so there is actually two
big multistate
lawsuits.

49:47.451 --> 49:51.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, more than 20 states are
litigating the
issue.

49:51.055 --> 49:53.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their argument are -- several
things.

49:53.257 --> 49:58.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some made a student privacy
argument, suggesting
that it violated the privacy of
students who

49:58.395 --> 50:04.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aren't transgender to share
facilities with
students who are.

50:04.702 --> 50:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some made a states' rights
claim this
was federal overreach and an
abuse of the

50:09.473 --> 50:14.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power of the department, that
they weren't
actually interpreting federal
law, but rather

50:14.078 --> 50:16.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
creating new policy through a
back door.

50:16.180 --> 50:21.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, if, as we
expect, the
Trump administration to pull
back this guidance,

50:21.151 --> 50:25.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what does that mean tomorrow or
next week
if I'm a transgender kid in a
school somewhere

50:25.155 --> 50:26.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the country?

50:26.156 --> 50:28.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does it mean for me?

50:28.058 --> 50:32.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVIE BLAD: Well, about 15 states
have anti-discrimination
laws that cover transgender
students.

50:32.129 --> 50:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So students in those states,
their reality
would remain the same.

50:36.500 --> 50:39.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are districts around
the country
that have made the decision on
their own,

50:39.837 --> 50:47.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long before this guidance, to
put rules in
place that largely mirror what
it requires.

50:47.044 --> 50:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for states and districts
that don't have
those kinds of rules, they're
kind of on their

50:51.782 --> 50:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own to interpret the federal law
and to make
their own determination on what
they think

50:57.821 --> 50:59.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they should do for these
children.

50:59.790 --> 51:03.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Of course,
this is all happening
in the backdrop of a very big
Supreme Court

51:04.028 --> 51:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case that is happening where a
boy in Virginia,
a transgender boy, sued his
school district

51:09.166 --> 51:13.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to say, let me use the boys'
bathroom.

51:13.137 --> 51:18.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does the withdrawal of these
guidelines do
anything to his standing in the
Supreme Court?

51:18.409 --> 51:23.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVIE BLAD: Well, to this point,
many transgender
students who have won in federal
courts have

51:23.881 --> 51:29.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won under the argument that the
courts should
defer to federal interpretation
of Title IX.

51:29.687 --> 51:32.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that does take one
argument away.

51:32.423 --> 51:37.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Gavin Grimm, the student
from Virginia,
can still go forward, his
attorneys say, arguing

51:37.594 --> 51:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the fundamental meaning of
Title IX,
what was implied when it was
written, and

51:42.733 --> 51:44.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should that apply to him today?

51:44.768 --> 51:49.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
arguments that
undergirds a lot of this, I
know, is the fear

51:49.340 --> 51:54.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that some people have expressed
that, if you
allow a transgender student to
use the bathroom

51:54.812 --> 52:01.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
according to their gender
identity, that you
might have men masquerading as
women, in effect,

52:01.552 --> 52:04.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get into a bathroom and
somehow get up
to no good.

52:05.022 --> 52:08.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there any evidence that
that's really something
that's going on?

52:08.392 --> 52:10.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVIE BLAD: I don't believe so.

52:10.861 --> 52:14.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the districts that have had
these rules
for a long time, they say that
they have had

52:14.465 --> 52:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very little problems with them.

52:16.600 --> 52:20.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say that students' requests
to use them
are pretty rare.

52:20.537 --> 52:26.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most recent estimate on
transgender students
said that transgender children
between the

52:26.543 --> 52:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ages of 13 and 17, they make up
about 0.7
percent of the population.

52:30.614 --> 52:34.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we're talking about a very
small number
of students here.

52:34.685 --> 52:38.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is some argument on
the other side
that it can be difficult to
implement and

52:38.722 --> 52:43.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interpret these rules for such a
confusing
thing as gender identity,
especially when

52:43.093 --> 52:45.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it can be in flux for some
children.

52:45.095 --> 52:49.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Evie Blad of
Education Week, thanks so much.

52:49.233 --> 52:55.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
