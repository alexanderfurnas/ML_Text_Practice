WEBVTT

00:05.405 --> 00:07.441
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.441 --> 00:12.346
On tonight's "PBS NewsHour":
Presidential candidates fight to
stand out on stage -- the

00:12.346 --> 00:17.618
hits and misses from the
first Republican debate.

00:17.618 --> 00:21.688
Also ahead: In Ferguson,
Missouri, one year after the
death of Michael Brown, a
community

00:21.688 --> 00:25.225
seeks justice and
lasting change.

00:25.225 --> 00:30.597
BRITTANY PACKNETT, Activist: We
stand here not even halfway
through 2015, and nearly

00:30.597 --> 00:34.401
700 people have been killed
by police in the U.S. alone.

00:34.401 --> 00:38.338
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to analyze last

00:38.338 --> 00:42.476
night's debate and the
rest of the week's news.

00:42.476 --> 00:47.581
And a force in the water --
American swimmer Katie Ledecky
wins gold and breaks records

00:47.581 --> 00:50.517
at the world championships.

00:50.517 --> 00:54.855
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:54.855 --> 00:58.325
(BREAK)

00:58.325 --> 01:10.437
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. economy
turned in another solid month of
job creation in July.

01:10.437 --> 01:16.109
Labor Department numbers
released today show that
employers added a net of 215,000
new

01:16.109 --> 01:22.716
jobs for the month. The actual
unemployment rate held steady at
5.3 percent.

01:22.716 --> 01:28.188
A wave of violent attacks broke
out in the capital of
Afghanistan today, killing
scores

01:28.188 --> 01:34.528
of people. The first, a massive
truck bomb, flattened an entire
city block in Kabul and

01:34.528 --> 01:41.735
left a 30-foot crater. The blast
killed 15 people and wounded
240. Later, a suicide bomber

01:41.735 --> 01:48.842
blew himself up at a police
academy, killing at least 20
recruits and wounding 24.

01:48.842 --> 01:55.282
The nuclear agreement with Iran
faces a fresh challenge within
President Obama's own party.

01:55.282 --> 02:00.120
Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer
of New York, in line to become
minority leader, announced

02:00.120 --> 02:06.393
his opposition last night. He
said in a statement: "The very
real risk that Iran will not
moderate

02:06.393 --> 02:12.466
and will instead use the
agreement to pursue its
nefarious goals is too great."

02:12.466 --> 02:17.170
Today, traveling in Vietnam,
Secretary of State John Kerry
said he profoundly disagrees

02:17.170 --> 02:19.639
with Schumer's decision.

02:19.639 --> 02:24.644
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: If all you do is refuse
this deal and say no to this

02:24.644 --> 02:31.618
agreement, you just say no,
there is no other alternative to
the fact that Iran will begin

02:31.618 --> 02:37.691
to enrich, will pursue its
program, we will lose
international support, we will
lose the

02:37.691 --> 02:42.329
sanctions, we will wind up in a
situation where we do not have
the ability to inspect

02:42.329 --> 02:45.232
or to check their program.

02:45.232 --> 02:49.503
JUDY WOODRUFF: Other Senate
Democrats have been lining up in
favor of the deal. Wisconsin

02:49.503 --> 02:54.307
Senator Tammy Baldwin
announced her support today.

02:54.307 --> 03:00.447
In Central Syria, Islamic State
militants have abducted at least
230 people, including

03:00.447 --> 03:06.420
dozens of Christians. Activists
say it happened overnight at a
town in Homs province after

03:06.420 --> 03:10.957
the extremists captured the town
from pro-government forces. The
rest of those seized were Sunni

03:10.957 --> 03:13.960
Muslims.

03:13.960 --> 03:19.833
The World Anti-Doping Agency
says an independent commission
will investigate allegations of

03:19.833 --> 03:26.873
widespread use of illegal
substances in international
athletics. German broadcaster
ARD has reported

03:26.873 --> 03:34.181
that more than 800 athletes had
suspicious blood test results
between 2001 and 2012.

03:34.181 --> 03:38.018
The reports are based on data
leaked from the International
Association of Athletics

03:38.018 --> 03:40.987
Federation.

03:40.987 --> 03:46.993
In California, hundreds of
evacuees from a wildfire north
of San Francisco were allowed

03:46.993 --> 03:53.533
to return home today.
Firefighters now have the Rocky
Fire nearly half contained.
Since

03:53.533 --> 04:00.273
last weekend, the fire has
destroyed 43 homes as it charred
nearly 109 square miles. About

04:00.273 --> 04:06.813
12,000 residents are still under
evacuation orders or warnings.

04:06.813 --> 04:11.751
And Wall Street ended the week
with more losses for the seventh
day in a row. The Dow Jones

04:11.751 --> 04:19.759
industrial average gave up 46
points to close near 17370. The
Nasdaq fell 13 points, and

04:19.759 --> 04:25.298
the S&P 500 shed six. For the
week, the Dow and Nasdaq lost
nearly 2 percent. The S&P

04:25.298 --> 04:28.969
was down more than 1 percent.

04:28.969 --> 04:33.874
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
memorable moments from last
night's Republican debate;

04:33.874 --> 04:43.984
how Ferguson has changed a year
after the death of Michael
Brown, and much more.

04:43.984 --> 04:58.265
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was one year
ago this weekend when the city
of Ferguson, Missouri, quickly

04:58.265 --> 05:02.402
moved to the center of national
attention. Protests followed the
fatal shooting of Michael

05:02.402 --> 05:05.672
Brown by a police officer.

05:05.672 --> 05:10.944
The police response and the
unrest that came afterwards
called more attention to
shootings

05:10.944 --> 05:16.082
and the militarization of police
forces across the country and
triggered more debate and

05:16.082 --> 05:18.818
calls for reform.

05:18.818 --> 05:23.690
Hari Sreenivasan returned there
to see how Ferguson is faring.

05:23.690 --> 05:28.895
HARI SREENIVASAN: Clifton Kinnie
had no idea how much his life
was about to change at this

05:28.895 --> 05:34.801
time last year. Then 17 years
old, his mother had just died
from stage four breast cancer.

05:34.801 --> 05:38.138
He was at home and depressed,
when social media brought him a
picture of Michael Brown's

05:38.138 --> 05:40.941
body just a few miles away.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.444
CLIFTON KINNIE, Youth Activist:
And at first, I didn't think it
was real. I grabbed my keys

05:44.444 --> 05:49.783
and I drove straight out there.
And just seeing the reaction
from the people, the community

05:49.783 --> 05:52.319
there, who were trying to figure
out what's going on, right,
trying to figure out, why

05:52.319 --> 05:54.888
is this kid laying
in the street?

05:54.888 --> 05:57.991
HARI SREENIVASAN: Outrage pulled
Kinnie out of his grief and led
him into the nightly

05:57.991 --> 05:59.793
protests.

05:59.793 --> 06:06.733
CLIFTON KINNIE: My first getting
hit with tear gas, rubber
bullets was August the 12th.

06:06.733 --> 06:11.204
My lungs were stinging. I began
throwing up. I think there was a
little blood in there.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.405
And I was crying.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.874
MAN: You must
disperse immediately.

06:14.874 --> 06:19.879
CLIFTON KINNIE: But I wasn't
tearing up because it was
painful. Yes, it was painful,
but I

06:19.879 --> 06:23.817
tearing up because I couldn't
believe something like this
could happen in 21st century
America

06:23.817 --> 06:26.319
or a small town like Ferguson.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.089
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kinnie went
back to high school. He started
a week late because of

06:29.089 --> 06:33.627
the unrest and channeled
that outrage into action.

06:33.627 --> 06:39.733
Texting among his friends led
300 classmates to his backyard
to start what became Our Destiny

06:39.733 --> 06:44.704
Saint Louis, a small student
group promoting social
engagement among young people.
Ever

06:44.704 --> 06:48.508
since, Kinnie has organized his
peers to pursue justice in their
communities.

06:48.508 --> 06:52.612
CLIFTON KINNIE: The problem in
Saint Louis has become far
deeper than just policing.

06:52.612 --> 06:57.183
HARI SREENIVASAN: In February,
Clifton spoke in front of the
Ferguson Commission, volunteers

06:57.183 --> 07:00.787
appointed by the governor of
Missouri to examine the root
causes of the shooting, the
reaction

07:00.787 --> 07:04.557
to it, and ways to prevent
this from happening again.

07:04.557 --> 07:07.927
The group has met more than a
dozen times, tackling topics
such as health disparities,

07:07.927 --> 07:12.866
education equity, and
law enforcement policy.

07:12.866 --> 07:17.537
On that commission is Brittany
Packnett, someone who grew up
grocery shopping in this
neighborhood,

07:17.537 --> 07:21.107
getting her hair done along West
Florissant Avenue. A year ago,
this familiar street was

07:21.107 --> 07:22.776
unrecognizable.

07:22.776 --> 07:28.214
BRITTANY PACKNETT, Activist:
What flashes through my mind are
the armored vehicles and

07:28.214 --> 07:35.555
rifles and body armored police
officers that would fill these
parking lots. What crosses

07:35.555 --> 07:40.760
my mind is trying to Vine videos
of when rifles are pointed in
people's faces and of us being

07:40.760 --> 07:44.998
tear-gassed to make sure
that people knew the truth.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.067
HARI SREENIVASAN: The year has
been filled with keeping the
issues from Ferguson front

07:47.067 --> 07:50.937
and center, including a
trip to the White House.

07:50.937 --> 07:55.208
BRITTANY PACKNETT: There is
still so much more to be done.
We stand here even not even

07:55.208 --> 08:01.681
halfway through 2015, and nearly
700 people have been killed by
police in the U.S. alone.

08:01.681 --> 08:05.752
HARI SREENIVASAN: That sense of
urgency is not lost on police
Sergeant Dominica Fuller.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.520
SGT. DOMINICA FULLER, Ferguson
Police Department: I was
surprised. I was hurt. I was
afraid.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.223
I was saddened.

08:10.223 --> 08:17.030
HARI SREENIVASAN: A lifelong
Ferguson resident and mother,
Fuller is also a 17-year member

08:17.030 --> 08:22.235
of the police force. Three
months ago, she rose to the rank
of sergeant. A year ago,

08:22.235 --> 08:25.672
some of her family sided with
the protesters against the
police.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.308
SGT. DOMINICA FULLER: When
you're family, you are going to
agree to disagree, but my

08:28.308 --> 08:31.244
safety came first, and
they understood that.

08:31.244 --> 08:35.982
HARI SREENIVASAN: This spring,
the U.S. Justice Department
investigated the practices of
Ferguson

08:35.982 --> 08:40.687
police, finding officers
routinely arrested citizens
without probable cause and used
unreasonable

08:40.687 --> 08:44.491
force against the city's
African-Americans.

08:44.491 --> 08:48.595
The sergeant wears a body
camera, like all Ferguson police
do now, one change in the

08:48.595 --> 08:52.999
past year, but Fuller says she
hopes some of the basic tactics
she has learned working

08:52.999 --> 08:56.236
a beat will spread throughout
the department, part of an
emphasis on community policing

08:56.236 --> 08:58.571
going forward.

08:58.571 --> 09:02.675
SGT. DOMINICA FULLER: You have
to have compassion in this job.
You have to have understanding

09:02.675 --> 09:07.447
and you have to be patient. We
now focus on the community a
little bit more. We're in

09:07.447 --> 09:11.651
the schools. We're able to go
sit with the kids in the park.

09:11.651 --> 09:15.955
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ferguson has a
new judge, new city manager and
the city's leadership

09:15.955 --> 09:19.692
is now more diverse. The interim
police chief is
African-American, as are two
newly elected

09:19.692 --> 09:22.295
city council members.

09:22.295 --> 09:26.166
SGT. DOMINICA FULLER: What
happened in the city of
Ferguson, a lot of cities can
learn

09:26.166 --> 09:31.304
from. When they sit back and
realize, it could have happened
to us, let me pay attention

09:31.304 --> 09:34.174
and see how they're
addressing it.

09:34.174 --> 09:38.077
HARI SREENIVASAN: Missouri
legislators proposed a number of
measures, ranging from bills
requiring

09:38.077 --> 09:43.183
body cameras for police officers
to ending racial profiling and
the use of lethal force

09:43.183 --> 09:48.388
by police. In the end, only one
bill passed, a missed
opportunity for progress,
according

09:48.388 --> 09:51.458
to Missouri State Assemblyman
Courtney Allen Curtis.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.827
COURTNEY ALLEN CURTIS, Missouri
State Assemblyman: We had the
worldwide attention on us. We
could

09:53.827 --> 09:57.297
have been a leader, but we
haven't been. We could have
implemented the body cameras. We

09:57.297 --> 10:02.602
could have made significant
strides towards improving the
education system. We could have

10:02.602 --> 10:07.340
done economic development
packages to bring more jobs to
the area.

10:07.340 --> 10:11.444
And while we talked about doing
that, we haven't done nearly
enough to actually implement
those

10:11.444 --> 10:13.713
talking points.

10:13.713 --> 10:18.017
HARI SREENIVASAN: The new law
limits how much of a municipal
budget can come from traffic

10:18.017 --> 10:22.889
fines, ironically leading
Ferguson into a budget deficit.

10:22.889 --> 10:27.961
New rules also ban courts from
jailing someone over small
traffic fines, practices the
Justice

10:27.961 --> 10:33.032
Department condemned. News of
the Justice Department report
and the new state law continued

10:33.032 --> 10:36.903
to keep Ferguson under a
spotlight, a light some local
residents wanted to turn towards

10:36.903 --> 10:38.872
something different.

10:38.872 --> 10:44.010
BRIAN FLETCHER, Former Ferguson
Mayor: We started making up
T-shirts. Then it came into

10:44.010 --> 10:52.218
coffee mugs, a license plate,
stickers, wristbands. You got
kids and toddlers. These are
onesies

10:52.218 --> 10:55.255
for the babies. They got a
little caboose on the bottom.

10:55.255 --> 11:00.226
HARI SREENIVASAN: Former
Ferguson Mayor Brian Fletcher is
currently a city council member.

11:00.226 --> 11:04.063
Struck by the negative portrayal
of his hometown, he began
getting his own message out
starting

11:04.063 --> 11:07.700
with yard signs that say
"I heart Ferguson."

11:07.700 --> 11:11.938
BRIAN FLETCHER: Starting moving
across Saint Louis and actually
orders from across the

11:11.938 --> 11:17.143
United States and the world to
the state. We have issued 10,450
yard signs.

11:17.143 --> 11:22.949
HARI SREENIVASAN: So far, he
says that they have donated
$130,000 to local businesses,

11:22.949 --> 11:28.254
all part of a larger campaign to
show Ferguson moving on. We
heard this radio ad on his
phone.

11:28.254 --> 11:32.125
NARRATOR: You can't change
history, but you can learn from
it. And there is definitely

11:32.125 --> 11:36.396
a spirit of optimism in the air.
So, grab your keys and the
family and come see and

11:36.396 --> 11:40.600
enjoy the new face of urban
America, Ferguson. Better than
ever with more to come,
Ferguson,

11:40.600 --> 11:43.736
we can do this together.

11:43.736 --> 11:47.440
HARI SREENIVASAN: But the
campaign sends a different
message to some.

11:47.440 --> 11:52.178
RASHEED ALDRIDGE, Ferguson
Commission: It was almost like a
counterprotest to the protest.

11:52.178 --> 11:56.950
It was almost say -- to not even
acknowledge of what happened.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.552
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rasheed
Aldridge, a Saint Louis native,
is the youngest member on the

11:59.552 --> 12:01.788
Ferguson Commission.

12:01.788 --> 12:06.259
RASHEED ALDRIDGE: To just be
like, oh, there's nothing wrong.
We love Ferguson. You see?

12:06.259 --> 12:11.464
Just look at us. We're happy,
we're people, we're having a
good time, look at the
businesses,

12:11.464 --> 12:16.502
and not to acknowledge life
was taken in Ferguson.

12:16.502 --> 12:20.873
How do you love Ferguson and not
acknowledge the hurt that the
people in Ferguson are going

12:20.873 --> 12:24.310
through? It didn't make sense.

12:24.310 --> 12:28.781
HARI SREENIVASAN: The QuikTrip
minimart convenience store that
burned down in the aftermath of

12:28.781 --> 12:33.353
the shooting was behind this
fence on West Florissant Avenue.
The Saint Louis Urban League

12:33.353 --> 12:39.726
plans to open a job training on
this site, one more sign of
Ferguson moving forward.

12:39.726 --> 12:43.830
For activists like Packnett,
it's the single step on a long
road.

12:43.830 --> 12:46.532
BRITTANY PACKNETT: We cannot
quit. We absolutely cannot stop.
In fact, we need to move
further,

12:46.532 --> 12:48.368
faster.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.838
HARI SREENIVASAN: When Clifton
Kinnie gets disillusioned with
the pace of the justice

12:51.838 --> 12:56.542
movement, he turns to this, one
of the last pictures of his mom.

12:56.542 --> 13:01.648
CLIFTON KINNIE: It reminds me
that, despite everything
negative going on in my life,
that

13:01.648 --> 13:08.087
I can accomplish what I want to
accomplish. If she could do it,
having stage four breast

13:08.087 --> 13:12.158
cancer and eight kids, going
back to school and getting a
degree, I can do what I want

13:12.158 --> 13:14.727
to do and need to do in
order to help people.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.329
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.
She'd be proud of you.

13:16.329 --> 13:25.271
CLIFTON KINNIE: Thanks, man.

13:25.271 --> 13:32.912
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kinnie begins
Howard University in Washington,
D.C., in the fall.

13:32.912 --> 13:49.095
I'm Hari Sreenivasan for the
"PBS NewsHour" in Ferguson,
Missouri.

13:49.095 --> 13:54.100
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Shields and Brooks analyze the
GOP debate and more of the
week's

13:54.100 --> 13:58.871
news; a stroke of gold for
American swimmer Katie Ledecky;
and lifting the curtain on

13:58.871 --> 14:02.542
diversity in film.

14:02.542 --> 14:08.314
But, first, the European Union
today appealed to its member
states to live up to the
financial

14:08.314 --> 14:15.188
pledges made to Greece and
Hungary to assist with some of
the nearly 225,000 refugees and

14:15.188 --> 14:20.126
migrants who this year alone
have left upheaval in Africa, in
the Middle East and Southwest

14:20.126 --> 14:23.496
Asia to try to reach Europe.

14:23.496 --> 14:29.068
In the north, near the English
Channel, several thousand people
are camped out, many hoping

14:29.068 --> 14:34.207
to pass from France to England.
The British government says
taking in the displaced people

14:34.207 --> 14:39.445
will only encourage more to
come. But just today, it was
reported that a 40-year-old

14:39.445 --> 14:46.052
Sudanese man managed to evade
elaborate security and walked
almost the entire dangerous
31-mile

14:46.052 --> 14:51.190
length of the underwater Channel
Tunnel before he was arrested.

14:51.190 --> 14:57.964
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant reports tonight
from the French port of Calais.

14:57.964 --> 15:04.637
MALCOLM BRABANT: Under British
pressure, reinforcements, the
French riot police have been
sent to Calais

15:04.637 --> 15:09.375
to try thwart the migrants on
the final leg of their odyssey,
among them, a man fleeing

15:09.375 --> 15:16.916
the Syrian civil war who
didn't want to be identified.

15:16.916 --> 15:25.525
MAN: Police closed the border.
So, we try go to train, but the
police is big people.

15:25.525 --> 15:32.031
They're like animals. We don't
like it. They're not behaved
police. They told me you have

15:32.031 --> 15:40.039
to go back. I go back and try
again, but it's very hard to go.
We need a solution. I don't

15:40.039 --> 15:44.777
know what we're going to do
here. We don't like to stay in
France.

15:44.777 --> 15:49.582
MALCOLM BRABANT: Additional
measures designed to beef up
security at the Eurotunnel
carrying

15:49.582 --> 15:52.952
trains between France and
England appear to be working,
according to the British foreign

15:52.952 --> 15:55.288
secretary, Philip Hammond.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.591
PHILIP HAMMOND, British Foreign
Secretary: I think we have a
grip on the crisis. We saw

15:58.591 --> 16:05.731
a peak last week since when the
illegal migrants has tailed off.
We have taken a number of

16:05.731 --> 16:10.469
measures in collaboration with
the French authorities and
Eurotunnel.

16:10.469 --> 16:14.540
MALCOLM BRABANT: As a result
there's increasing frustration
among migrants. They have
established

16:14.540 --> 16:19.478
a squalid camp in the sand dunes
called the Jungle. It's a launch
pad for thousands of

16:19.478 --> 16:23.482
dreams that failed to fly.

16:23.482 --> 16:28.321
Having risked his life crossing
the Sahara Desert and the
Mediterranean, Tasbe Tasbasalasi

16:28.321 --> 16:33.659
(ph) is dismayed at the
conditions. A reluctant
conscript in the Eritrean army,
this computer

16:33.659 --> 16:37.230
expert fled the Horn of Africa
country whose government has
been accused of widespread

16:37.230 --> 16:39.966
human rights abuses.

16:39.966 --> 16:46.539
MAN: We considered Europe as the
heaven of the earth, but it was
not just like that.

16:46.539 --> 16:53.312
I really didn't expect the
places that we are living here
to be like this. I'm trying

16:53.312 --> 17:01.420
to go to the train. But it's
very difficult for me. I'm being
here in order to go to England.

17:01.420 --> 17:08.794
But it's very difficult. But
everybody who is living here has
his or her own ambition.

17:08.794 --> 17:12.265
MALCOLM BRABANT: Why should
England allow you to come into
the country?

17:12.265 --> 17:18.571
MAN: My dream is to go to
England. When I compare -- for
example, when I compare England

17:18.571 --> 17:22.708
with Germany, England
is comfortable for me.

17:22.708 --> 17:28.714
MALCOLM BRABANT: Calais used to
have a Red Cross refugee camp,
but it was closed in 2002

17:28.714 --> 17:32.451
after Britain protested that it
was encouraging illegal
immigration.

17:32.451 --> 17:36.522
The problem has never gone away.
And at city hall, there is
irritation from Deputy Mayor

17:36.522 --> 17:39.592
Philippe Mignonet that Britain
is calling the shots.

17:39.592 --> 17:44.196
PHILIPPE MIGNONET, Deputy Mayor:
We really are desperate because
it's killing the major

17:44.196 --> 17:51.170
oft city more so than ever. It's
killing the economy of the city
as well. We all know they

17:51.170 --> 17:54.607
want to go to England. Whether
they are right or wrong, whether
benefits in England are

17:54.607 --> 17:59.211
right or wrong, it's not a
problem. They want to go to
England.

17:59.211 --> 18:06.786
This is where we must have in
Calais a summit between France
and England involving the city

18:06.786 --> 18:09.455
of Calais, because at the
moment, the ministers are
talking with each other, but
where is

18:09.455 --> 18:13.092
the city of Calais in that?

18:13.092 --> 18:17.363
MALCOLM BRABANT: Now, if the
European Union law on asylum
seekers and refugees was being

18:17.363 --> 18:21.500
applied properly, France would
take many of these people in, or
it would return them to

18:21.500 --> 18:24.570
the first European country
where they landed.

18:24.570 --> 18:29.542
But this is not happening. The
Conservative government in
London believes that many of

18:29.542 --> 18:34.347
these people are attracted to
the United Kingdom's generous
welfare benefits. And they have
started

18:34.347 --> 18:39.585
the process of reducing the
amount of money available. And
according to Britain's
immigration

18:39.585 --> 18:44.423
minister, he says the current
system shouldn't offer what he
calls any perverse incentives

18:44.423 --> 18:50.963
for illegal migrants to lodge
spurious asylum applications or
encourage those without genuine

18:50.963 --> 18:55.868
claims for humanitarian
protection to prolong their stay
in the United Kingdom.

18:55.868 --> 19:00.406
TIM FARRON, Liberal Democrats:
The majority of people they see
are not economic migrants.

19:00.406 --> 19:04.377
They are probably fleeing
insecurity of one kind or
another.

19:04.377 --> 19:08.481
MALCOLM BRABANT: The most senior
British politician to visit the
Jungle has been Tim Farron of

19:08.481 --> 19:12.818
the Liberal Democrats. Once, as
part of the governing coalition,
the party could soften

19:12.818 --> 19:16.689
British policy. Now, in
opposition, it can only roar.

19:16.689 --> 19:22.628
TIM FARRON: It seems to me that
the approach of the U.K.
Conservative government is about

19:22.628 --> 19:27.900
being confrontational on two
levels, first of all,
confrontational towards the
desperate

19:27.900 --> 19:33.906
people here, and then also
confrontational towards our
colleagues throughout the rest

19:33.906 --> 19:38.544
of Europe, many of whom now look
at the United Kingdom as being
just unnecessarily belligerent,

19:38.544 --> 19:42.648
not a team player, and indeed
exacerbating this crisis.

19:42.648 --> 19:45.518
My attitude is to work with
others to try and find long-term
solutions and to treat

19:45.518 --> 19:48.387
these people here
like human beings.

19:48.387 --> 19:52.191
MALCOLM BRABANT: But isn't the
problem that, if you start
opening the floodgates, as the

19:52.191 --> 19:54.894
Conservatives would see it, what
you're going to do is you're
going to encourage even more

19:54.894 --> 19:58.631
people in the rest of the world
to head in this direction?

19:58.631 --> 20:03.202
TIM FARRON: So, first of all,
I'm not arguing to open the
floodgates at all. I'm arguing

20:03.202 --> 20:07.907
for us to sign up to the
European concord that would that
we would be taking our fair

20:07.907 --> 20:10.943
share, a few hundred from
across the European Union.

20:10.943 --> 20:15.147
WOMAN: I don't know.

20:15.147 --> 20:20.586
MALCOLM BRABANT: In recognition
that many migrants won't make it
to Britain, there is

20:20.586 --> 20:24.790
a school teaching French to
those considering seeking
political asylum here. Its
founder

20:24.790 --> 20:28.427
is an exuberant Nigerian
called Zimarco Jones.

20:28.427 --> 20:33.833
ZIMARCO JONES, School Founder:
If I went to Japan today, I
would try to go to school to

20:33.833 --> 20:39.271
learn Japanese language. It's
something everywhere to do. You
need to speak the language.

20:39.271 --> 20:45.144
My dream is to change this camp.
I want to make something
different in this Jungle to

20:45.144 --> 20:49.148
show people that we are not what
they are thinking. For example,
they say Jungle. In

20:49.148 --> 20:53.486
jungle -- animal is living in
the jungle. We -- we don't live
in a jungle here.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.555
MALCOLM BRABANT: Throughout the
camp, there are the reminders of
the perils of jumping

20:56.555 --> 21:01.260
on trains or trucks. Ten people
have been killed since June. The
risk is a major incentive

21:01.260 --> 21:03.796
to remain in France.

21:03.796 --> 21:08.334
MAN: Over there, I say to
myself, I want to go there, but
I really can't chance to go

21:08.334 --> 21:13.706
there. To see my friends, they
are dying and they are cutting
their hands and fingers.

21:13.706 --> 21:18.410
MALCOLM BRABANT: For nearly
1,000 years, the narrow English
Channel has protected Britain

21:18.410 --> 21:24.884
from invasion. Migrants face the
same obstacles that defeated
great armies. The refugee influx

21:24.884 --> 21:28.587
is perhaps Europe's biggest
crisis of the decade.

21:28.587 --> 21:33.092
And Calais port boss Jean-Marc
Puissesseau wants to see a
change in Western foreign
policy.

21:33.092 --> 21:37.863
JEAN-MARC PUISSESSEAU, Port
Boss: The wars which has been
done has increased the number

21:37.863 --> 21:43.802
of refugees coming to Europe. I
think we should take care to
help more of the countries which

21:43.802 --> 21:52.611
are (INAUDIBLE) the Sudan, as
Eritrea (INAUDIBLE) which
belongs to Iraq and to Syria, is
something

21:52.611 --> 21:55.814
much more difficult.

21:55.814 --> 22:01.820
MALCOLM BRABANT: Another day in
the Jungle dawns with devotions
at a church from tarpaulins

22:01.820 --> 22:06.859
by African Christians. They're
seeking intervention.

22:06.859 --> 22:12.898
For their prayers to be
answered, Britain must soften
its stance. And at the moment,

22:12.898 --> 22:16.268
there is no sign of compromise
across the Channel.

22:16.268 --> 22:20.372
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Calais.

22:20.372 --> 22:28.447
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:28.447 --> 22:33.819
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.
That's syndicated columnist Mark

22:33.819 --> 22:36.255
Shields and New York Times
columnist David Brooks.

22:36.255 --> 22:38.324
Welcome, gentlemen.

22:38.324 --> 22:43.829
So, the first debate among,
David, 10 of the 17 Republicans
running for president last

22:43.829 --> 22:45.664
night, what's your assessment?

22:45.664 --> 22:50.603
DAVID BROOKS: It was great. It
was a great debate. Trump brings
the party, and I hope

22:50.603 --> 22:53.172
he stays. Maybe in the general,
they can stick him in. I thought
he was -- he livens the

22:53.172 --> 22:55.107
atmosphere. He's not
a real candidate.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.876
JUDY WOODRUFF: He's
not a real candidate?

22:57.876 --> 23:01.480
DAVID BROOKS: No. He doesn't
have an ideology. He doesn't
have a belief system.

23:01.480 --> 23:06.518
He has himself. And they went
after him, the three excellent
moderators. And he defended

23:06.518 --> 23:10.956
himself and I think he did fine.
Probably 70 percent of
Republicans disapprove of him.

23:10.956 --> 23:14.760
A lot of the things he said were
astonishingly inappropriate,
that he wouldn't support the

23:14.760 --> 23:17.062
Republican Party nominee. That's
kind of a big one. He likes
single-payer health system.

23:17.062 --> 23:20.733
That's the first Republican
that sort of likes that.

23:20.733 --> 23:28.440
He is outside of all the
categories, but he is a lord of
self-esteem. And his main
message

23:28.440 --> 23:32.845
is society is filled with
losers, and they happen to be
running it, and society has some

23:32.845 --> 23:35.014
winners who are being ignored.
And if you're a winner like me,
we got to get rid of those

23:35.014 --> 23:37.650
losers.

23:37.650 --> 23:41.787
And that's an ideology that is
not a political ideology. It is
a narcissistic ideology. But

23:41.787 --> 23:45.557
I suspect the 20 percent who
like him will continue to like
him and like him even more.

23:45.557 --> 23:48.093
And so he will be
hanging around there.

23:48.093 --> 23:52.665
Among the real candidates, I
thought Rubio did quite well.
Carly Fiorina in the underdebate

23:52.665 --> 23:57.903
card did quite well. And John
Kasich did quite well. And so I
think those three helped
themselves

23:57.903 --> 24:00.839
and they actually are viable
candidates and make us rethink
the race.

24:00.839 --> 24:03.075
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do
you size it up, Mark?

24:03.075 --> 24:04.443
MARK SHIELDS: I don't know where
to agree and where -- no.

24:04.443 --> 24:05.978
(LAUGHTER)

24:05.978 --> 24:11.083
MARK SHIELDS: I agree. Donald
Trump fills up the hall. There
were 24 million people

24:11.083 --> 24:13.585
who watched. That's more people
than had ever watched a cable
event, other than a sports

24:13.585 --> 24:13.952
event.

24:13.952 --> 24:14.320
JUDY WOODRUFF: Huge numbers.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.389
MARK SHIELDS: And this
was a sports event.

24:17.389 --> 24:21.727
Donald Trump indicated right at
the outset he is going to run as
Donald Trump. And I

24:21.727 --> 24:26.765
thought it was an indication of
the magic he has established,the
chemistry he has with

24:26.765 --> 24:31.236
Republican voters, that the only
person on the stage, candidate
who would even take a

24:31.236 --> 24:34.907
shot at him was Rand Paul.

24:34.907 --> 24:40.245
All the others ducked him, John
Kasich included, Jeb Bush
included, when given
opportunities.

24:40.245 --> 24:46.685
Who went after him? The three
FOX moderators, who were tough.
They really did. And I really

24:46.685 --> 24:53.225
think he made a serious mistake
by going, retaliating, attacking
Megyn Kelly. First

24:53.225 --> 24:54.893
of all...

24:54.893 --> 24:56.962
JUDY WOODRUFF: When she asked
him about his comments about
women.

24:56.962 --> 24:59.898
MARK SHIELDS: Asked him about
women, his misogynist comments.

24:59.898 --> 25:04.937
First of all, FOX News is the
validator, it's the gatekeeper
for Republican, particularly

25:04.937 --> 25:10.075
conservative voters. And you
don't go after -- it is not like
you're attacking Chuck Todd

25:10.075 --> 25:15.047
or Judy Woodruff or some of the
liberal elite establishment.
You're attacking the mother

25:15.047 --> 25:17.649
church when you go after FOX.

25:17.649 --> 25:20.452
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's make
a distinction here, please. I'm
not part of the liberal

25:20.452 --> 25:20.719
media.

25:20.719 --> 25:22.554
(CROSSTALK)

25:22.554 --> 25:28.260
MARK SHIELDS: No, but I'm
talking about by the definition
of conservative America, where

25:28.260 --> 25:32.564
FOX really is the gatekeeper --
I think you would agree, the
gatekeeper and the validator.

25:32.564 --> 25:37.302
And when he went after her, I
think he made a serious mistake.
I thought, as far as the

25:37.302 --> 25:38.637
others were concerned...

25:38.637 --> 25:40.072
JUDY WOODRUFF: You don't
think he helped himself?

25:40.072 --> 25:45.644
MARK SHIELDS: I think he
hurt himself. I really do.

25:45.644 --> 25:50.983
He's a combination quite unlike
anything I have ever seen
before. I agree partially with

25:50.983 --> 25:56.922
David that it is sort of egotism
and cynicism. Everybody is
transactional. You believe
nothing.

25:56.922 --> 25:59.958
Why do you give money to
Democrats? You give money to
Democrats because you are going
to

25:59.958 --> 26:02.060
give them a call and they're
going to do what you want.

26:02.060 --> 26:07.099
Everything. There's no ideal.
John Kennedy said he was an
idealist without illusions.

26:07.099 --> 26:13.572
Donald Trump is a cynic without
illusions. Nothing is on the
level. You go into bankruptcy

26:13.572 --> 26:19.011
four times. You screw the
investors. Hey, that's the way
it's done now.

26:19.011 --> 26:25.617
I just -- I thought he came
across really, by having taken
on FOX News, and particularly

26:25.617 --> 26:30.222
Chris Wallace and Bret Baier,
and particularly Megyn Kelly, I
think he made a mistake.

26:30.222 --> 26:33.425
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you said,
David, a minute ago you thought
Marco Rubio did well and you

26:33.425 --> 26:35.427
thought John Kasich did
well. What stood out?

26:35.427 --> 26:37.095
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. So,

26:37.095 --> 26:41.800
Rubio has a message. The message
is, America is changing fast.
I'm surrounded by a bunch

26:41.800 --> 26:45.904
of old guys who don't get it.
And I get it. I get Amazon. I
get Airbnb. That's actually

26:45.904 --> 26:51.109
a pretty good message. And it
goes with his belief system. And
he presents very well.

26:51.109 --> 26:56.381
And he's very articulate and
well-spoken and smart. And so he
has a message.

26:56.381 --> 27:01.320
Kasich has a different message,
which is unique and I think
reflective also of the times,

27:01.320 --> 27:06.124
which is we need growth, but we
need compassion. And so he
defends some of the New Deal
social

27:06.124 --> 27:08.494
programs, even Great Society
social programs. But he said we
got to grow. And then once

27:08.494 --> 27:11.296
we grow, we got to share.

27:11.296 --> 27:16.168
And early in the program, we had
his passage on going to a
marriage of a gay friend. That

27:16.168 --> 27:20.839
is a broadening message. That is
actually a general election
message. And Rubio also

27:20.839 --> 27:27.346
has a general election message.
And so if you are a Republican
mainstreamer, and you

27:27.346 --> 27:29.381
are trying to think, who can
win, well, walking in, you
thought, well, Jeb Bush appeals
to

27:29.381 --> 27:31.650
a lot of people.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.953
And we all go around the country
and we hear a lot people who are
not particularly political,

27:34.953 --> 27:41.260
but they think, Jeb Bush, he
seems acceptable. He was meh at
the debate. He was fine, but

27:41.260 --> 27:47.099
not terrible, not great. But
these two guys have something
new, and something that actually

27:47.099 --> 27:50.402
could be viable. And you know,
Florida and Ohio, if those two
are on the ticket, you're

27:50.402 --> 27:52.304
doing OK.

27:52.304 --> 27:55.941
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, but you
see some delineation there? I
mean, there's now some

27:55.941 --> 27:59.378
-- more separation between these
candidates as a result of this
debate?

27:59.378 --> 28:02.047
MARK SHIELDS: Yes. Yes. It
wasn't -- nobody has called -- I
will say the person who probably

28:02.047 --> 28:04.616
had the best night
was Carly Fiorina.

28:04.616 --> 28:08.987
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who was on
earlier. She wasn't even in the
big debate.

28:08.987 --> 28:10.822
MARK SHIELDS: She was
on the early one.

28:10.822 --> 28:15.227
And Mark Russell, the great
satirist, said, who won the 5:00
debate? Carly Fiorina. Who

28:15.227 --> 28:21.967
won the 9:00 debate? Carly
Fiorina. I think she represents
something Republicans need.

28:21.967 --> 28:26.271
They want her on that stage,
because when she goes after
Hillary Clinton, again, we

28:26.271 --> 28:29.942
can't be accused of misogyny
if it's a woman doing it.

28:29.942 --> 28:36.114
And she does it quite
effectively. I thought Marco
Rubio had a good night. Marco
Rubio

28:36.114 --> 28:42.854
plays better to the
punditocracy, those of us who
cover it, than he has directly
to voters.

28:42.854 --> 28:46.191
His numbers have not been great.
He doesn't seem to have a base.
But he really -- I thought

28:46.191 --> 28:49.461
he handled himself
quite well last night.

28:49.461 --> 28:54.700
I wasn't as impressed as other
-- David and others were with
John Kasich. He was given

28:54.700 --> 28:59.871
the opportunity by Chris Wallace
after Donald Trump made this
outrageous statement about

28:59.871 --> 29:05.077
Mexico, the government is
sending criminals across the
border. And Chris Wallace asked

29:05.077 --> 29:07.446
him for any evidence.
He had no evidence.

29:07.446 --> 29:13.185
He said, I was at the Border
Patrol, had a visit in Laredo.
And he said, what about that?

29:13.185 --> 29:17.489
He said, no, we're doing it
because American politicians and
leaders are dumb, and the

29:17.489 --> 29:20.892
Mexican government is smart. And
they're sticking us with the
bill. And he turns to John
Kasich

29:20.892 --> 29:25.497
and he said, what about that,
Governor? And John Kasich said,
Donald Trump has touched

29:25.497 --> 29:29.134
into something in America,
instead of confronting him.

29:29.134 --> 29:34.906
I just -- I thought that Rubio
had a good, good night. And Jeb
Bush was wallpaper. There

29:34.906 --> 29:36.808
was no sense of command to him.

29:36.808 --> 29:39.077
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whoa.
That's tough.

29:39.077 --> 29:42.381
Just quickly, if both of you
think Fiorina had a good night,
what does that say though

29:42.381 --> 29:47.352
about the system that is leaving
the other seven, the people who
don't make the cut of

29:47.352 --> 29:50.555
10, apart in a separate event?
What does it say about...

29:50.555 --> 29:54.826
DAVID BROOKS: There's a super
bad problem with the polls,
which is they're polling
everybody.

29:54.826 --> 29:57.562
They're not polling people who
are actually going to vote.

29:57.562 --> 30:01.600
And Donald Trump's voters are
what they call low-information
voters. They're classically

30:01.600 --> 30:05.003
the kind of people who don't
vote in primaries. In some
sense, his lead is completely --
not

30:05.003 --> 30:07.606
completely, but
largely artificial.

30:07.606 --> 30:12.010
Meanwhile, we have been hearing
on the campaign trail there's
been a buzz about Fiorina for

30:12.010 --> 30:16.782
a couple months. And so she just
got to show it to a broader
audience. But she has earned

30:16.782 --> 30:18.717
her way into the next calendar.

30:18.717 --> 30:22.154
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quick
questions about the Democrats.

30:22.154 --> 30:27.125
Earlier this week, Mark, a lot
of reporting about whether or
not Joe Biden may get into

30:27.125 --> 30:32.030
the race. There's some fairly
reliable reporting that he's
thinking about it. Pros, cons.

30:32.030 --> 30:35.100
MARK SHIELDS: He's
thinking about it.

30:35.100 --> 30:42.908
Judy, he ran for first time in
1988. He ran in 2008. He's been
vice president for eight

30:42.908 --> 30:47.379
years. It's always been in his
DNA to run for president. And
Hillary Clinton's numbers

30:47.379 --> 30:53.919
in the Wall Street Journal/NBC
poll took a bad tumble between
June and August.

30:53.919 --> 31:00.092
Among woman, she now has a
negative rating. This was
supposed to be her golden source

31:00.092 --> 31:05.330
of support to give her the new
coalition. It has to be tempting
at this point. I don't

31:05.330 --> 31:08.934
think anybody knows. I would bet
that he doesn't, but it's got to
be tempting if she starts

31:08.934 --> 31:10.302
to look very vulnerable.

31:10.302 --> 31:12.370
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pros and cons?

31:12.370 --> 31:13.805
DAVID BROOKS: He shouldn't do
it. He shouldn't do it. He's a
wonderful, wonderful man. He's

31:13.805 --> 31:16.975
a great public servant.

31:16.975 --> 31:22.347
This country and especially the
Democratic Party is in the mood
for systemic change and

31:22.347 --> 31:26.151
something fundamental,
different. They don't want a
sign of the establishment
running their

31:26.151 --> 31:29.488
party. That's what she is
facing. She's in a dominant
position, but the tide is
against

31:29.488 --> 31:31.389
her. The mood of the times are
against her. The mood of the
times are certainly against

31:31.389 --> 31:33.091
him.

31:33.091 --> 31:36.528
So you got to pick your year.
It's not his year. If he runs, I
think he will do some

31:36.528 --> 31:38.263
damage to his
long-term reputation.

31:38.263 --> 31:39.731
MARK SHIELDS: He doesn't have a
lot of other years to choose,
David.

31:39.731 --> 31:40.465
DAVID BROOKS: Well...

31:40.465 --> 31:41.366
(LAUGHTER)

31:41.366 --> 31:44.336
JUDY WOODRUFF: We
will talk about that.

31:44.336 --> 31:48.173
Very different subject here at
the end, the Iran nuclear deal.
The president gave another

31:48.173 --> 31:52.377
passionate defense this week,
made a speech at American
University. He has had a number

31:52.377 --> 31:57.816
of Democrats come out, Mark, in
favor, but he lost a big one in
Senator Chuck Schumer

31:57.816 --> 31:59.451
last night.

31:59.451 --> 32:03.822
How significant is that? Is the
president making any headway
with this argument?

32:03.822 --> 32:08.326
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, the president
is. He needs a third plus one in
either the House or the

32:08.326 --> 32:11.263
Senate, one of the two.

32:11.263 --> 32:20.872
And, obviously, Jewish members,
including such as Chuck Schumer,
are very much a target,

32:20.872 --> 32:28.547
because of, understandably,
Israel's position; 92 countries
have endorsed this nuclear
agreement,

32:28.547 --> 32:33.752
Judy, including Lebanon and
Saudi Arabia and Iraq and
Jordan, as well as...

32:33.752 --> 32:35.687
JUDY WOODRUFF: Egypt.

32:35.687 --> 32:39.357
MARK SHIELDS: ... great American
ally, Egypt, but -- Algeria.

32:39.357 --> 32:47.999
But the United States here,
there is a real premium on Sandy
Levin of Michigan supporting

32:47.999 --> 32:53.538
it. Chuck Schumer is an
important legislator. He's going
to be the next Democratic
leader.

32:53.538 --> 33:01.179
The fact that Kirsten
Gillibrand, his colleague in New
York and very close, at the same
time

33:01.179 --> 33:05.150
came out in support of the
president's position may
indicate that Chuck Schumer is
not going

33:05.150 --> 33:07.819
to spend a lot of time, effort,
energy trying to proselytize
other members.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.021
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
significant is this?

33:10.021 --> 33:12.724
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, first of all,
I don't think Bibi Netanyahu's
opposition has anything to

33:12.724 --> 33:15.427
with Chuck Schumer's opposition
or the Israeli position has
anything to do -- I think it's

33:15.427 --> 33:18.029
a terrible deal not
because Israel does.

33:18.029 --> 33:21.633
I just think it's a terrible
deal that will endanger the
Middle East for generations to

33:21.633 --> 33:26.338
come. And I'm sure Schumer came
to the same conclusion. In the
public opinion, Obama is

33:26.338 --> 33:31.176
losing the argument. The latest
poll I saw was 2-1 against among
the American public.

33:31.176 --> 33:34.613
And, frankly, I thought Obama's
speech -- he's a great
speechmaker, he's a great
arguer.

33:34.613 --> 33:37.616
Certainly one of his weakest
speeches, in which you're
sitting on the fence.

33:37.616 --> 33:41.519
It's a close issue. He says, oh,
it's not a close issue. It's
transparently a close

33:41.519 --> 33:47.893
issue. It's a tough debate.
Second, if you are on the fence,
he was insulting you in

33:47.893 --> 33:51.329
your thinking that, you're so
stupid. You were wrong in the
past.

33:51.329 --> 33:54.532
JUDY WOODRUFF: Equating it with
opposing -- or going to war in
Iran.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.035
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. It was just,
I found, a very high-handed
speech designed to offend,

33:57.035 --> 33:59.104
not to persuade.

33:59.104 --> 34:05.377
MARK SHIELDS: I really -- I do
think Judy, quite frankly, that
the president is making

34:05.377 --> 34:10.448
the same case that Ronald Reagan
made in dealing with the
Soviets, negotiating with Iran.
They're

34:10.448 --> 34:15.954
not nice people. They're not
good people, but it is
important. And I think he's
making

34:15.954 --> 34:19.124
the case.

34:19.124 --> 34:30.368
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks, we thank you.

34:30.368 --> 34:35.173
Champion swimmer Katie Ledecky
is stunning the world this week
with feats that have rarely

34:35.173 --> 34:41.279
been seen. The 18-year-old
cruised along during her final
heat at the world championships

34:41.279 --> 34:47.152
in Russia today, putting her in
the top spot for tomorrow's
final in the 800-meter
freestyle.

34:47.152 --> 34:50.388
Throughout the week, she has
been blowing past the
competition, setting records and

34:50.388 --> 34:52.924
generating talk of
historic milestones.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.694
Hari Sreenivasan has the story.

34:55.694 --> 35:00.632
HARI SREENIVASAN: Just to try to
put this in perspective, if
Katie Ledecky wins tomorrow,

35:00.632 --> 35:06.905
she will have completed an
unprecedented sweep of the 200,
the 400, the 800 and 1,500 meter

35:06.905 --> 35:10.575
freestyles at a single
world championship.

35:10.575 --> 35:15.880
She also set world records this
week. And assuming all goes
well, she will have raced

35:15.880 --> 35:21.720
6,200 meters in seven days when
you include heats and relays.
Since winning the gold medal

35:21.720 --> 35:28.727
at the 2012 Olympics, she has
set 13 of the fastest racing
times in history.

35:28.727 --> 35:32.597
Summer Sanders is a former
Olympic gold medal swimmer
herself, as well as a sports
commentator

35:32.597 --> 35:36.201
and reporter who's been watching
all of this. She joins me now
from Salt Lake City.

35:36.201 --> 35:38.570
You know, there's a lot of
people who don't follow swimming
who are starting to wake up

35:38.570 --> 35:42.140
to this story. Why is
this so spectacular?

35:42.140 --> 35:46.344
SUMMER SANDERS, Olympic Gold
Medalist: Well, I think it goes
back in history.

35:46.344 --> 35:52.317
I think most people remember
Janet Evans, the queen of
distance swimming. She held most

35:52.317 --> 35:57.522
of these world records up until
Katie broke them. And so we
haven't seen this dominance

35:57.522 --> 36:02.827
from the American swimmers in
the sport of distance swimming.
Honestly, most kids, if

36:02.827 --> 36:06.898
they have the distance gene,
prefer to push themselves to the
400 and 200, because it's

36:06.898 --> 36:10.802
so difficult to train
for the 800 and 1,500.

36:10.802 --> 36:16.141
But the fact that Katie is doing
it and she's dominating time and
time and time again -- and

36:16.141 --> 36:21.880
she just sort of has this inner
personality. I describe it as
like she's a sprinter
personality

36:21.880 --> 36:27.052
on the inside, but a distance on
the outside. I love her fist
pump when she wins and her

36:27.052 --> 36:31.689
enthusiasm that she is showing.
She's making distance swimming
cool.

36:31.689 --> 36:36.327
HARI SREENIVASAN: She are
incredibly different events.
Training for a 200 meter, a
sprint-type

36:36.327 --> 36:40.398
event, vs. essentially a mile in
the pool, and she actually did
both races in one day

36:40.398 --> 36:42.600
earlier this week.

36:42.600 --> 36:47.372
SUMMER SANDERS: Yes, she had the
semifinals of the 200 freestyle
right after she, like,

36:47.372 --> 36:52.477
shattered her own record
in the 1,500 freestyle.

36:52.477 --> 36:56.781
And I would love for people to
understand how that is a huge
difference in swimming.

36:56.781 --> 37:01.619
We haven't seen it for a long
time where we had prelims, then
a semis, and then the next

37:01.619 --> 37:06.524
day a finals. Now, she doesn't
have to do that for 800 and
1,500, but that's really,

37:06.524 --> 37:09.994
really difficult to do that over
a stretch of about seven days of
a world championships

37:09.994 --> 37:12.664
or an Olympic Games.

37:12.664 --> 37:17.502
It takes its toll. So, that
makes all of these records and
wins so much more astonishing.

37:17.502 --> 37:21.005
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
things people are wondering is,
how does she do it? Is she

37:21.005 --> 37:24.876
a natural? Does she just work
harder? These are amazing times
that she's setting and then

37:24.876 --> 37:26.978
breaking.

37:26.978 --> 37:35.220
SUMMER SANDERS: I interviewed
Katie at the 2012 Olympic
trials, young Katie. Right? She

37:35.220 --> 37:40.725
is 14 now. Sorry. She's 18
now, so she was 15 back then.

37:40.725 --> 37:47.332
And her big milestone next was,
is she going to get her driver's
license? She wasn't too

37:47.332 --> 37:51.436
excited about her driver's
license, but she was real
excited to be going to London to

37:51.436 --> 37:53.505
compete in the Olympic Games.
And then of course she has,
like, blown everyone away

37:53.505 --> 37:56.508
at London, wins the gold medal.

37:56.508 --> 38:01.713
And now, all of a sudden, we
really get to know this Katie
Ledecky. She has an incredible

38:01.713 --> 38:05.750
natural talent. But I will say
this like standing on the top of
a building to all the young

38:05.750 --> 38:10.722
swimmers out there. Your natural
talent takes you only to a
certain point. And then you

38:10.722 --> 38:15.360
have got to decide that you want
to put the work in and really,
really go for it.

38:15.360 --> 38:20.665
I mean, she's like American
ninja warrior inside of a
distance swimmer. She works her

38:20.665 --> 38:28.640
tail off every single day to be
at her absolute best on game
day. And she has the mentality.

38:28.640 --> 38:33.611
I know you can see it. She looks
so innocent and sweet. But,
inside, she's just a tiger.

38:33.611 --> 38:38.449
She wants to win. She wants to
dominate, not only for herself,
but for her team, her family

38:38.449 --> 38:41.553
and for the sport of swimming
and for distance swimming.

38:41.553 --> 38:45.190
HARI SREENIVASAN: There are
stories about how she continued
even when she was in high

38:45.190 --> 38:49.427
school to race with her high
school team, play, and go and
swim with her club team.

38:49.427 --> 38:53.531
This is an Olympic medalist who
still enjoys swimming at her
core.

38:53.531 --> 38:57.335
But there was also something
interesting. As you start seeing
these world records, sometimes,

38:57.335 --> 39:01.773
she is really just racing
herself. Nobody is even close to
her. How do you push yourself

39:01.773 --> 39:05.410
when you're in the pool and
you're working against the world
record that's held by you?

39:05.410 --> 39:09.581
SUMMER SANDERS: Yes, I know. I
never had that problem, Hari.

39:09.581 --> 39:13.885
I wish I did at times. But that
would mean I would have to swim
a really, really long

39:13.885 --> 39:20.792
race, and my longest was the 400
I.M. It is. It's an inner drive.
We swimmers, people look

39:20.792 --> 39:23.595
at it, and they're like, how do
you do it? You stare at a black
line for hours and hours

39:23.595 --> 39:26.564
and hours?

39:26.564 --> 39:31.336
But we're really not. It's like
the original Zen workout,
swimming. You have got to get

39:31.336 --> 39:35.673
inside your head, and you have
got to decide that you want to
push yourself super hard

39:35.673 --> 39:41.679
today. And why? Because you want
to beta that person or that
time, or you want that feeling

39:41.679 --> 39:45.984
of touching the wall and
dominating, knowing that you
gave it your absolute best,
nothing

39:45.984 --> 39:51.022
was left outside the pool, it
was all left inside the pool.

39:51.022 --> 39:55.426
And I think that that's
something that needs to be
recognized and celebrated in
Katie.

39:55.426 --> 40:00.999
It's what makes her so unique,
not just this feat that she's
probably going to pull off

40:00.999 --> 40:04.702
on Saturday, but that inner
drive, that she came back from
an Olympic Games and a gold

40:04.702 --> 40:09.674
medal to dominate again
four years later.

40:09.674 --> 40:13.745
That is so incredibly difficult
and it's what makes the Olympic
Games so amazing and beautiful

40:13.745 --> 40:15.413
still to this day.

40:15.413 --> 40:17.882
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Summer Sanders, thanks so much.

40:17.882 --> 40:26.124
SUMMER SANDERS: Thank you.

40:26.124 --> 40:32.897
JUDY WOODRUFF: The past few
years have brought growing
attention to the lack of
diversity

40:32.897 --> 40:37.502
among film actors and the
creators of American movies.

40:37.502 --> 40:41.506
And a new report this week shows
just how wide the gap remains,
despite some high-profile

40:41.506 --> 40:42.940
successes.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.810
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

40:45.810 --> 40:55.553
JEFFREY BROWN: Special effects,
action and suspense, big
production films in recent years

40:55.553 --> 41:00.558
have provided plenty of what
audiences have come to expect,
including, according to various

41:00.558 --> 41:02.860
studies, a widespread
lack of diversity.

41:02.860 --> 41:08.833
The latest research comes from
the Annenberg School for
Communication and Journalism at

41:08.833 --> 41:15.506
the University of Southern
California. The survey of the
annual 100 top grossing films

41:15.506 --> 41:22.814
between 2007 and 2014 found that
just 30 percent of all speaking
or named characters were women,

41:22.814 --> 41:27.118
while 73 percent of such
roles went to whites.

41:27.118 --> 41:33.157
As to the filmmakers, only about
2 percent of the movies were
directed by women. The

41:33.157 --> 41:38.529
Web site Every Single Word has
made a mission of highlighting
the lack of diversity in movies

41:38.529 --> 41:44.936
by compiling every line spoken
by a person of color in any
major film. This video, from

41:44.936 --> 41:51.042
the 2014 movie "Maleficent,"
lasted just 18 seconds.

41:51.042 --> 41:56.414
This creator of Every Single
Word, Dylan Marron, joins us
now. He's also an actor and
writer.

41:56.414 --> 42:00.251
Also with us, Washington Post
movie critic Ann Hornaday.

42:00.251 --> 42:04.422
Well, Dylan Marron, you have
been documenting this for a long
time. How does this new study

42:04.422 --> 42:07.225
sharpen the picture?
What jumps out at you?

42:07.225 --> 42:11.262
DYLAN MARRON, Every Single
Word: I think a lot jumps out.

42:11.262 --> 42:15.666
One of the biggest things that
jumped out for me is the
correlation between black
directors

42:15.666 --> 42:20.138
and putting black characters in
their movie. And that speaks a
lot to this conversation

42:20.138 --> 42:25.977
we have of we need more
creators. The creators are
already out there, but what we
need do

42:25.977 --> 42:29.280
is we need to take those
creators and we need to project
their stories onto a bigger
screen

42:29.280 --> 42:32.750
and they need to be distributed
to a larger audience.

42:32.750 --> 42:35.286
And that way, there will be more
accurate reflections of the
populations that they're

42:35.286 --> 42:36.754
serving.

42:36.754 --> 42:39.791
JEFFREY BROWN: You're an actor
yourself, so you have seen this
play out?

42:39.791 --> 42:43.594
DYLAN MARRON: I have
seen this firsthand.

42:43.594 --> 42:46.798
Yes, I have seen it in meetings
with agents. I have seen it in
casting calls. And I have

42:46.798 --> 42:49.667
just seen it in
general reception.

42:49.667 --> 42:55.072
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Ann Hornaday,
we have talked about this
before. For both women and
African-Americans,

42:55.072 --> 43:00.511
actors and directors, there have
been some very successful and
critically acclaimed films,

43:00.511 --> 43:03.347
especially in recent years. Do
we see these as exceptions? What
do you see when you look

43:03.347 --> 43:05.216
out there?

43:05.216 --> 43:08.252
ANN HORNADAY, Film Critic, The
Washington Post: Well,
absolutely.

43:08.252 --> 43:11.989
You know, the last couple of
years have really seen a
flowering, and we have seen this
wonderful

43:11.989 --> 43:17.094
renaissance in African-American
filmmaking, from the likes of
Dee Rees and Ava DuVernay

43:17.094 --> 43:21.165
and Ryan Coogler, and Gina
Prince-Bythewood, of course, who
has been around for a while,

43:21.165 --> 43:24.202
but has just been
doing wonderful work.

43:24.202 --> 43:29.373
So there's been a lot to
celebrate. And then this year, a
number of the top 10 movies this

43:29.373 --> 43:34.479
year are female-centric, from
things like ""Fifty Shades of
Grey" and "Cinderella" to

43:34.479 --> 43:41.352
"Spy" and "Trainweck," also
did very well this summer.

43:41.352 --> 43:44.522
And there are smaller movies
that are featuring women, like
"Ricki and the Flash" is coming

43:44.522 --> 43:50.728
out this weekend and "The Diary
of a Teenage Girl." Things like
this, studies like this,

43:50.728 --> 43:55.600
we get these statistics as sort
of a steady drumbeat, and it's
just a reminder that we

43:55.600 --> 44:00.838
should remember not to fall over
ourselves with gratitude for
crumbs, when the bigger

44:00.838 --> 44:03.841
picture, as you point out,
is a lot more sobering.

44:03.841 --> 44:09.213
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Ann, one of
the possible responses will be,
this is what audiences

44:09.213 --> 44:14.352
want, this is what sells, it's a
business, right? Is that true?
Does that help explain

44:14.352 --> 44:15.820
what we see or not?

44:15.820 --> 44:18.823
ANN HORNADAY: No.

44:18.823 --> 44:24.862
Yes, you're right it's a
business. I think this kind of
lack of representation actually

44:24.862 --> 44:29.333
has three costs. And the first
is absolutely financial. I mean,
Hollywood is leaving money

44:29.333 --> 44:34.872
on the table when women and
African-American audiences prove
over and over again that they

44:34.872 --> 44:39.510
go see movies about themselves.

44:39.510 --> 44:46.417
And so, for studios to not cater
to those audiences, women alone,
women of all races

44:46.417 --> 44:51.789
buy 50 percent of the movie
tickets, and they heavily
influence the other 50 percent.
The

44:51.789 --> 44:56.093
other big cost would be
aesthetic in terms of just the
actual stories that are being

44:56.093 --> 45:04.635
told and the grand diversity and
sort of texture and depth of the
stories that we're missing

45:04.635 --> 45:07.138
up on screen.

45:07.138 --> 45:12.677
And then maybe the most profound
cost is really psychic, in terms
of when -- especially when

45:12.677 --> 45:17.048
young people are going to the
movies and they see this sort of
monolithic, monotone,
monochromatic

45:17.048 --> 45:21.919
version of what it is to be
human. That's what we're
internalizing as the norm.

45:21.919 --> 45:26.757
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Dylan Marron,
what do you see as the causes?
Why does it continue?

45:26.757 --> 45:32.296
DYLAN MARRON: I think this is
largely structural, right?

45:32.296 --> 45:38.369
So, people are just so concerned
about losing money. And you
mentioned leaving money on

45:38.369 --> 45:42.840
the table. I think these
financiers, everyone who is
putting up money for these
films, they

45:42.840 --> 45:49.213
are really operating on archaic
and even imaginary statistics.
They are so afraid that if they

45:49.213 --> 45:53.751
change up the formula, if they
don't keep putting white people
in the leads of these

45:53.751 --> 45:57.288
movies as these protagonist
roles, that they are going to
lose money.

45:57.288 --> 46:00.524
So, as we see with the "Fast and
the Furious" and other big
franchises that kind of branch

46:00.524 --> 46:03.194
out, this is just not true.

46:03.194 --> 46:09.467
JEFFREY BROWN: And yet, Dylan,
there is a growing awareness,
right? Your site is popular,

46:09.467 --> 46:13.638
made a lot of in-way on social
media. We see a lot of studies
like this, so there is certainly

46:13.638 --> 46:16.340
more awareness at least.

46:16.340 --> 46:20.911
DYLAN MARRON: I think there's a
lot of awareness. But what does
that do?

46:20.911 --> 46:25.249
We just saw the trailer for the
"Stonewall" movie come out.
That's the new the Roland

46:25.249 --> 46:31.789
Emmerich film about the
Stonewall Riots. And it's
completely whitewashed, right?
There

46:31.789 --> 46:35.726
is a black trans woman who
actually was one of the leaders,
and she's completely silenced.

46:35.726 --> 46:41.165
It's rewritten to include
a white cis male lead.

46:41.165 --> 46:46.537
The whitewashing continues.
People have been aware for so
long. I'm continuing the
tradition

46:46.537 --> 46:49.740
of awareness. I just
presented it in a new way.

46:49.740 --> 46:53.277
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Ann Hornaday,
just you started to mention some
films that are -- I

46:53.277 --> 46:58.983
just want to give you a brief
chance here for people that want
to see films that portray

46:58.983 --> 47:03.754
this piece of American life that
often is not portrayed. Where do
they look?

47:03.754 --> 47:11.162
ANN HORNADAY: Well, you know, I
think to Dylan's point, a big
problem is the financing
structure,

47:11.162 --> 47:15.199
and more and more the financings
that are coming from
international financiers or it

47:15.199 --> 47:18.369
is being oriented to
international audiences.

47:18.369 --> 47:26.343
And there's this assumption that
only certain stories and
characters will sell overseas.

47:26.343 --> 47:31.916
But we are seeing some really
encouraging work on the indie
scale. I mentioned "Diary

47:31.916 --> 47:37.021
of a Teenage Girl," which is a
wonderful depiction of a young
woman coming of age.

47:37.021 --> 47:42.860
I would include a really
interesting movie called
"Tangerine" about two trans
women in

47:42.860 --> 47:49.166
L.A. It's kind of this raucous,
picaresque day in the life, very
funny, very closely

47:49.166 --> 47:53.070
and intimately and
compassionately observed.

47:53.070 --> 47:58.008
And then sort of midrange
movies, like "Ricki and the
Flash" with Meryl Streep, they
are

47:58.008 --> 48:02.079
still getting made. And,
generally, when they do get
made, they do really well if
they can

48:02.079 --> 48:04.348
hang on long enough
and find an audience.

48:04.348 --> 48:11.622
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Ann
Hornaday, Dylan Marron, thank
you both very much.

48:11.622 --> 48:24.235
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: You may have seen the
stellar photo earlier this

48:24.235 --> 48:30.007
week. A science satellite
captured the moon photo bombing
Earth, revealing its rarely

48:30.007 --> 48:35.279
seen dark side. It got us
thinking, why don't we ever get
to see the far side of the moon

48:35.279 --> 48:38.749
from here on Earth? Well, we
have got an explainer, and
that's on our home page. All
that and

48:38.749 --> 48:44.755
more is on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

48:44.755 --> 48:48.859
And a reminder about some
upcoming programs from our PBS
colleagues.

48:48.859 --> 48:53.197
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week," which airs
later this evening. Here's a
preview:

48:53.197 --> 48:59.336
GWEN IFILL: What we know for
sure: Donald Trump isn't going
away. What else we know?

48:59.336 --> 49:04.241
No one else is either. We will
get to the bottom of it all,
including why the candidates

49:04.241 --> 49:09.013
spent more time attacking each
other than going after Hillary
Clinton, what last night's

49:09.013 --> 49:15.152
debate tells us about the state
of the 2016 race -- tonight on
"Washington Week" -- Judy.

49:15.152 --> 49:20.257
JUDY WOODRUFF: On "PBS NewsHour
Weekend" Saturday: a report on
patients facing life-and-death

49:20.257 --> 49:24.461
decisions, and the doctors who
are required to talk to them
about it.

49:24.461 --> 49:30.000
A final news note. We're waiting
now on a decision coming shortly
from a Colorado jury

49:30.000 --> 49:40.845
on whether the Aurora movie
theater gunman gets life in
prison or the death penalty.

49:40.845 --> 49:43.247
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy Woodruff.

49:43.247 --> 49:44.315
Have a great weekend. Thank
you, and good night.
