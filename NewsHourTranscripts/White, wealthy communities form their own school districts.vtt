GEOGRAPHIC COMMUNITIES TO BREAK

00:04.637 --> 00:06.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY FROM LARGE PUBLIC SCHOOL

00:06.139 --> 00:08.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTRICTS AND FORM THEIR OWN.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS A RESULT, A GROWING NUMBER OF

00:09.342 --> 00:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREDOMINANTLY WHITE,

00:10.910 --> 00:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DOING JUST THAT AND TAKING THEIR

LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES WITH THEM.

00:16.249 --> 00:17.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MAKES RACIAL AND ECONOMIC

DISPARITIES IN ADJACENT SCHOOL

00:19.252 --> 00:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LAUREN, LET'S JUST BREAK DOWN

00:35.068 --> 00:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW SECESSION OF A SCHOOL

00:37.670 --> 00:38.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTRICT WORKS.

00:38.738 --> 00:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU TOOK A LOOK AT A STORY IN

ALABAMA.

>> THIS RECENTLY CAME TO LIGHT

00:43.209 --> 00:46.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN A SCHOOL DISTRICT IN

00:46.513 --> 00:49.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALABAMA, JEFFERSON COUNTY SCHOOL

00:49.115 --> 00:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTRICT, WHICH INCLUDES

00:50.817 --> 00:53.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIRMINGHAM, A COMMUNITY THERE

00:53.086 --> 00:55.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH IS MAJORITY WHITE AND

00:55.789 --> 00:56.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIDDLE-CLASS.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S CALLED GARDENDALE, AND, FOR

00:58.491 --> 00:59.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A WHILE, THEY HAVE BEEN WANTING

00:59.993 --> 01:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SPLINTER OFF UNDER THE GUISE

01:02.162 --> 01:04.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF CONTROLLING MORE OF THEIR

01:04.597 --> 01:06.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES, WHICH, OF

01:06.299 --> 01:08.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURSE, MAKE UP THE BULK OF ANY

01:08.601 --> 01:10.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL'S BUDGET.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR

01:12.572 --> 01:13.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTRODUCTION, HARI, THIS IS

01:13.973 --> 01:15.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY LEGAL IN 30 STATES.

01:15.942 --> 01:17.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE POLICIES ON THE BOOKS

01:17.911 --> 01:19.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOWING COMMUNITIES TO DO THIS

01:19.679 --> 01:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THEY SO WISH.

01:21.147 --> 01:22.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, IT'S

01:22.048 --> 01:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT JUST IN ALABAMA.

01:23.283 --> 01:24.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE SEEING THIS HAPPEN ACROSS

01:24.751 --> 01:26.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

01:26.619 --> 01:28.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINCE 2000, MORE THAN 70

01:28.822 --> 01:30.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITIES HAVE TRIED TO DO

01:30.790 --> 01:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS.

01:31.524 --> 01:33.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
47 HAVE SUCCEEDED.

01:33.226 --> 01:34.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: I'M ASSUMING

01:34.094 --> 01:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE RATIONALE BEHIND IT IS,

01:36.529 --> 01:38.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"HEY, WE WANT TO KEEP OUR

01:38.498 --> 01:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOLS GREAT.

01:39.065 --> 01:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ARE POURING ALL OF OUR

01:40.333 --> 01:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROPERTY TAX INTO IT.

01:42.068 --> 01:43.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WANT TO KEEP THIS AROUND

01:43.036 --> 01:44.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE OUR KIDS ARE ACTUALLY

01:44.170 --> 01:45.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO BENEFIT FROM IT."

01:45.105 --> 01:46.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THERE'S A FLIP SIDE TO THAT.

01:46.406 --> 01:47.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

01:47.907 --> 01:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN A COMMUNITY THAT IS

01:49.876 --> 01:51.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEALTHIER OR HAS HIGHER PROPERTY

01:51.845 --> 01:53.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAX RATES, WHEN THEY SPLINTER

01:53.613 --> 01:55.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFF FROM THEIR LARGER SCHOOL

01:55.115 --> 01:56.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTRICT, THAT CREATES THIS

01:56.483 --> 01:58.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINANCIAL HOLE IN THE SCHOOL

01:58.218 --> 01:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTRICT THAT THEY LEAVE BEHIND.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, IN EDUCATION POLICY,

02:01.020 --> 02:03.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE TALK A LOT ABOUT SUBGROUP

02:03.490 --> 02:04.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERFORMANCE AND ACHIEVEMENT

02:04.657 --> 02:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAPS, AND A LOT OF TIMES THAT

02:05.792 --> 02:07.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOCUSES ON THE DIFFERENCE

02:07.727 --> 02:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN STUDENTS OF COLOR AND

02:09.829 --> 02:11.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHITE STUDENTS, FOR EXAMPLE.

02:11.164 --> 02:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT REALLY THE FASTEST GROWING

02:13.333 --> 02:15.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAP IS BETWEEN SOCIOECONOMIC

02:15.969 --> 02:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDICATORS.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, POOR STUDENTS AND THEIR

02:18.805 --> 02:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEALTHIER PEERS, THAT IS THE

02:20.006 --> 02:21.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FASTEST GROWING GAP IN THE U.S.

02:21.107 --> 02:21.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY.

02:21.608 --> 02:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU POINT OUT

02:22.308 --> 02:23.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THERE'S NINE ACTIVE

02:23.810 --> 02:24.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECESSION EFFORTS THAT ARE

02:24.978 --> 02:25.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M JUST GOING TO RATTLE OFF

02:26.279 --> 02:27.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS LIST ACROSS THE U.S.:

02:27.247 --> 02:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALABAMA, CALIFORNIA, GEORGIA,

02:28.581 --> 02:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOUISIANA, NORTH CAROLINA,

02:29.716 --> 02:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TENNESSEE, VERMONT, AND

02:30.650 --> 02:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WISCONSIN.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, DO THESE STATES, OF THE 30

02:33.319 --> 02:35.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ALLOW FOR THIS, HAVE TO

02:35.088 --> 02:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDY ANY SORT OF POTENTIAL

02:37.357 --> 02:39.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPACT, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A

02:39.559 --> 02:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECESSION OCCURS TO THOSE

02:41.194 --> 02:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURROUNDING SCHOOL DISTRICTS?

02:42.762 --> 02:44.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ONLY A HANDFUL ACTUALLY

02:44.531 --> 02:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIRE THAT THE DISTRICT LOOK

02:46.966 --> 02:50.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THE IMPACT OF THE... THE

02:50.103 --> 02:51.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RACIAL IMPACT, THE SOCIOECONOMIC

02:51.371 --> 02:53.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPACT AND THE FINANCIAL IMPACT

02:53.106 --> 02:54.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE COMMUNITIES SPLINTERING

02:54.541 --> 02:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFF.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN TENNESSEE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE

02:56.843 --> 02:59.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY THING THAT THEY REQUIRE FOR

02:59.045 --> 03:00.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A COMMUNITY TO SPLINTER OFF IS

03:00.914 --> 03:02.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE MUNICIPALITY MUST HAVE

03:02.916 --> 03:05.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE THAN 1,500 STUDENTS.

03:05.485 --> 03:07.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, ALSO, THE MAJORITY OF THE

03:07.253 --> 03:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESIDENTS IN THE MUNICIPALITY

03:09.455 --> 03:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WANTS TO SPLINTER OFF, THEY

03:12.192 --> 03:15.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUST AGREE WITH THAT MOVE.

03:15.495 --> 03:16.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THAT MEANS THEY'RE NOT

03:16.563 --> 03:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANYONE, ANY

03:19.766 --> 03:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN THE

03:21.267 --> 03:22.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGER SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT

03:22.368 --> 03:23.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE SPLINTERING OFF FROM.

03:23.770 --> 03:24.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: LAUREN CAMERA,

03:24.470 --> 03:26.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.
