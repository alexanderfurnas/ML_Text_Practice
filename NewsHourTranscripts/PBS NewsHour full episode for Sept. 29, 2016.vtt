JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:01.602 --> 00:03.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:03.170 --> 00:03.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:03.637 --> 00:05.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:05.806 --> 00:06.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: At least one person is
dead and more than

00:06.740 --> 00:08.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
100 injured after a New Jersey
commuter train crashes into the
Hoboken station.

00:08.041 --> 00:09.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday: how the
candidates are taking advantage
of

00:09.076 --> 00:14.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
early voting, with up to a third
of Americans casting their
ballot before November 8.

00:14.147 --> 00:19.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a report from
Afghanistan on the fight for
women's rights, despite
injustices

00:19.219 --> 00:23.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
embed in the society even
before there was a war.

00:23.657 --> 00:27.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM MOTLEY, Attorney: A lot of
people don't realize that
Afghanistan is a country where

00:27.294 --> 00:32.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's been reported that over 85
percent of the women are victims
of domestic violence.

00:32.232 --> 00:35.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus: Making
Sense of Donald Trump's taxes,
what voters should know, and

00:35.936 --> 00:39.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how the U.S. tax system
often favors the wealthy.

00:39.606 --> 00:43.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON, Author, "The
Making of Donald Trump": For
certain very wealthy people,

00:43.277 --> 00:48.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our federal income tax system is
a subsidy system that makes them
richer.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:50.751 --> 01:31.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:31.692 --> 02:53.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Investigators
in Northern New Jersey have a
big question to ponder tonight:

02:53.440 --> 02:57.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why did a commuter train smash
into a station in the midst of
rush hour?

02:57.077 --> 03:02.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For now, the answer is
anything but clear.

03:02.616 --> 03:06.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was 8:45 this morning, when a
New Jersey transit train came
barreling into Hoboken

03:06.887 --> 03:09.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
without slowing down.

03:09.389 --> 03:12.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A passenger in the first car
said there'd been no hint of
anything wrong.

03:12.893 --> 03:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: There wasn't even a
screeching, like it was halting.

03:16.029 --> 03:19.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It just kept going.

03:19.499 --> 03:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe there was some kind of,
like, braking involved, because
the lights went off and

03:22.702 --> 03:25.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people started screaming.

03:25.372 --> 03:29.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The speeding
railcars crashed through a
barrier and into the outer wall

03:29.743 --> 03:32.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the terminal waiting room,
crushing the front of the train
and collapsing part of

03:32.179 --> 03:34.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the ceiling.

03:34.347 --> 03:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We have a train that's into
the train station at Hoboken
terminal.

03:35.715 --> 03:40.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to need multiple
EMS for multiple injuries.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Police and
emergency workers rushed to the
station, a commuter hub just

03:43.857 --> 03:48.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outside New York that handles
50,000 passengers every day.

03:48.462 --> 03:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bystanders jumped in to help
people pinned under mangled
steel and concrete.

03:53.333 --> 03:57.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The second half of the
first car was completely
destroyed, to where they were
crawling

03:57.037 --> 03:59.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on their hands and knees.

03:59.039 --> 04:02.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we were trying to
get as many people out.

04:02.309 --> 04:06.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I assisted in maybe three
or four people getting out.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The lone
fatality was a woman on the
platform killed by the falling

04:08.815 --> 04:10.717 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debris.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BLAINE, Witness: They
were pulling people out.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People were jumping out, cuts
and bruises, and -- but I didn't
realize, when I ran, I

04:15.989 --> 04:16.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stepped over a body.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a dead woman.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dozens
were sent to area hospitals.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Three were in critical
condition, including the train's
conductor.

04:23.530 --> 04:27.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Many more made it out
with minor injuries.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hours later, New Jersey Governor
Chris Christie and New York
Governor Andrew Cuomo toured

04:29.903 --> 04:32.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the scene.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Christie said it appeared to be
an accident, but key questions
remain.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), New Jersey:
What we know is that the train
came in at much too high

04:38.745 --> 04:41.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a rate of speed, and the
question is, why is that?

04:41.982 --> 04:45.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The National
Transportation Safety Board has
now opened an investigation.

04:45.919 --> 04:49.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And New Jersey transit's
terminal at Hoboken is closed.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Other parts of the
station have reopened.

04:51.858 --> 04:55.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A short time ago, officials
announced that the train's
engineer has been released from

04:55.328 --> 04:58.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hospital, and they plan
to interview him soon.

04:58.865 --> 05:02.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're joined now by Brenda
Flanagan of NJTV News, part of
our public broadcasting family.

05:02.569 --> 05:03.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Brenda, you have been
there reporting all day.

05:03.603 --> 05:06.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is the scene like now?

05:06.573 --> 05:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDA FLANAGAN, NJTV News:
Well, right now, you can see
that the building is still
surrounded

05:10.944 --> 05:14.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by police vehicles
and command centers.

05:14.714 --> 05:18.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Transportation
Safety Board just held a
briefing in which they told us
that

05:18.885 --> 05:22.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the train was equipped with
outward-facing cameras.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obviously, they're going to
be looking at those tapes.

05:24.124 --> 05:28.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're also going to be
pulling the black box tonight.

05:28.662 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the train station remains
closed, they will be looking for
issues like operator error,

05:33.633 --> 05:37.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mechanical issues, signal
problems, track issues.

05:37.537 --> 05:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, they will not determine the
cause of this accident today or
on the scene.

05:43.376 --> 05:46.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to take seven to 10
days before they're able to come
up with possibly a reason

05:46.513 --> 05:49.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for this catastrophe -- Hari.

05:49.216 --> 05:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Brenda, it's
almost surprising that it's as
few people were injured,
considering

05:54.554 --> 05:58.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what a busy transit hub this is
in the New York area and that it
happened during rush

05:58.758 --> 06:00.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hour, when trains
are usually packed.

06:00.460 --> 06:05.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRENDA FLANAGAN: Absolutely.

06:05.165 --> 06:08.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was -- I know it's a
cliche, but it's like the
perfect storm, when you had so
many

06:08.368 --> 06:10.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wrong things.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You had all of these
people jampacked.

06:13.006 --> 06:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a standing-room-only type
of commuter train coming in at
8:45 in the morning, everybody

06:18.945 --> 06:22.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heading into downtown Manhattan,
to the ferries, to the PATH.

06:22.349 --> 06:26.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fact that only one person
was killed in this accident is
amazing.

06:26.553 --> 06:31.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Transportation Safety Board
is going to be looking at this
tonight, but positive train

06:31.791 --> 06:35.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
control is another
issue that was raised.

06:35.629 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Christie was asked
whether or not that might have
slowed the train down.

06:40.033 --> 06:47.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Jersey Transit has no
positive train control apparatus
on any of its tracks or
facilities.

06:47.974 --> 06:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Senators Menendez and
Booker of New Jersey held a news
conference this afternoon.

06:53.813 --> 06:58.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They said they are alarmed about
the lack of security and the
lack of safety and that

06:58.218 --> 07:00.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are going to be looking
into this seriously, Hari.

07:00.787 --> 07:04.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tell us also a
little about all the civilians
that actually responded

07:04.524 --> 07:08.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because of the structural
threat right after the crash.

07:08.862 --> 07:13.700 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
BRENDA FLANAGAN:
That was amazing.

07:13.700 --> 07:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this area, you know, we
always have in the back of our
minds, because of 9/11, this

07:18.371 --> 07:21.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could be a terror attack.

07:21.975 --> 07:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as you well know, New
Jersey and New York has been the
scene of bombings that have

07:25.812 --> 07:31.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been linked to a possible terror
threat just a week-and-a-half
ago.

07:31.184 --> 07:36.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, be that as it may, people
who are in the terminal when
there was this huge boom,

07:36.890 --> 07:40.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they said the building shook,
the lights flickered, and
several people ran toward the
source of

07:40.427 --> 07:42.862 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the boom.

07:42.862 --> 07:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They got to the scene, they
helped remove some of the
passengers from the area.

07:46.866 --> 07:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Looking up, seeing that that
ceiling just might collapse,
they said, it's too dangerous,

07:50.470 --> 07:54.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have to help move these
people out of the way.

07:54.708 --> 07:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One man actually took the shirt
off his back to fold it around
some of the victims.

07:59.412 --> 08:04.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said they were shaking
because they were cold and
scared and in pain.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Brenda Flanagan joining us from
the scene in Hoboken from

08:06.353 --> 08:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NJTV News, thanks so much.

08:09.155 --> 08:14.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Republican leaders
in both houses of Congress
opened

08:14.294 --> 08:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the door to changes in a new law
allowing relatives of the 9/11
victims to sue the government

08:20.133 --> 08:25.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Saudi Arabia, this just one
day after lawmakers pushed the
measure through to passage, and,

08:25.772 --> 08:31.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in so doing, managed the first
override of a veto by President
Obama.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell faulted the White
House for being too slow to
point

08:34.681 --> 08:35.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out problems.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.118 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I think it was an
example of an issue we should

08:39.886 --> 08:47.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have on a bipartisan basis
talked about much earlier,
because everybody was aware of
who

08:47.961 --> 08:52.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the potential beneficiaries
were, but nobody really had
focused on the potential
downside

08:52.031 --> 08:55.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in terms of our international
relationships.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think it was
just a ball dropped.

08:58.037 --> 09:02.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: House Speaker
Paul Ryan also suggested a fix
might be needed.

09:02.709 --> 09:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And White House spokesman Josh
Earnest took note of the shift.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: I think what we have
seen in the United States

09:09.115 --> 09:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress is a pretty classic
case of rapid-onset buyer's
remorse.

09:14.020 --> 09:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there are members of Congress
that have had a change of heart,
are now prepared to

09:17.557 --> 09:23.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take a principled position, we
would welcome a conversation
about that.

09:23.329 --> 09:28.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We would welcome action to solve
the problem that they have
created.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama

could lead to retaliation

HARI SREENIVASAN: The United
States is on the verge of ending
its Syrian talks with

09:38.845 --> 09:44.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia because of the assault on
Aleppo that from Secretary of
State John Kerry today.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a Washington event, he said
diplomacy can't continue in the
face of an all-out Russian-

09:46.920 --> 09:49.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syrian offensive.

09:49.389 --> 09:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: It's irrational in the
context of the kind of bombing

09:52.258 --> 10:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taking place to be sitting there
trying to take things seriously.

10:00.033 --> 10:05.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no notion or indication
of a seriousness of purpose with
what is taking place right

10:05.405 --> 10:07.740 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Earlier,
Russia brushed aside
Washington's warnings.

10:10.910 --> 10:14.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the defense minister
suggested a possible 48-hour
truce to let humanitarian aid
into

10:14.314 --> 10:16.916 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Aleppo.

10:16.916 --> 10:21.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: American Olympic
and Paralympic athletes had
their White House moment today.

10:21.654 --> 10:25.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president hailed their
success at this summer's Games
in Rio de Janeiro, winning

10:25.492 --> 10:30.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
46 Olympic gold medals
and 40 Paralympic golds.

10:30.296 --> 10:35.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: It inspires us to
do what we do much harder.

10:35.702 --> 10:41.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We admire your athleticism but
we also admire your character
and your stick-to-itiveness.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know you don't do this
for the money or the fame.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

10:46.379 --> 10:51.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama also
hosted families of
African-American Olympians from
the 1936

10:51.451 --> 10:53.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Games.

10:53.786 --> 10:57.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those athletes were left out of
a White House welcome 80 years
ago.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stocks fells
sharply on Wall Street today, as
drug companies and banks

10:59.993 --> 11:02.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suffered major losses.

11:02.128 --> 11:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
plunged nearly 196 points to
close at 18143.

11:06.933 --> 11:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 49 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 lost 20.

11:12.138 --> 11:16.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Congress
hopes to help parents who need
to change babies' diapers

11:16.342 --> 11:19.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in federal buildings.

11:19.045 --> 11:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A bill sent to the president
today requires changing stations
be installed in men's and

11:24.217 --> 11:28.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women's restrooms in all federal
sites open to the public.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That includes courthouses, post
offices and some government-run
museums.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's about time.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It is.

11:35.695 --> 11:39.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the candidates start their sweep
through swing states as

11:39.632 --> 11:44.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
early voting gets under way; the
changing lives of Afghan women
after 15 years of war;

11:44.704 --> 11:51.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Making Sense of Donald Trump's
taxes; and much more.

11:51.644 --> 12:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Election Day may
be 40 days away, but voting has
already started in a

12:01.621 --> 12:04.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
number of states.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins reports on
the candidates ground game.

12:07.493 --> 12:11.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: I am so
happy to be back here in Iowa

12:11.130 --> 12:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Just hours
after Iowa started early voting,
Hillary Clinton was in Des
Moines

12:15.001 --> 12:18.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with a turnout push.

12:18.271 --> 12:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Are
you ready to go to the polls?

12:26.145 --> 12:28.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

12:28.181 --> 12:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
luckily in Iowa, you can start
today.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Performance
from the state's high-profile
caucuses back in February, when

12:31.317 --> 12:34.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she barely eked out a win
over Bernie Sanders.

12:34.721 --> 12:39.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's now neck and neck
with Donald Trump in Iowa.

12:39.025 --> 12:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democratic nominee is also
visiting another state kicking
off early voting today,
Illinois,

12:43.129 --> 12:46.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to host two fund-raisers
in Chicago.

12:46.366 --> 12:52.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Donald Trump returned
to the site of his first 2016
win, New Hampshire.

12:52.205 --> 12:56.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He cleaned up in the state's
primary, but it's a general
election tossup.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: They said the biggest
single problem they

12:57.944 --> 13:01.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have up here is heroin.

13:01.280 --> 13:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I win, I get the nomination,
and I win, we're going to build
that wall, and we're

13:06.452 --> 13:07.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to stop that
heroin from pouring in.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

13:10.223 --> 13:12.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Away from the
campaign trail, the Republican's
business investments took

13:12.792 --> 13:15.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the spotlight.

13:15.361 --> 13:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Newsweek" reported that Trump's
hotel and casino business spent
$68,000 in Cuba in the

13:21.367 --> 13:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
late 1990s, routing it through a
third party, to try and gain a
business foothold there.

13:27.840 --> 13:33.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That apparently violated strict
U.S. bans on doing any business
with the communist nation.

13:33.946 --> 13:37.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's campaign manager,
Kellyanne Conway, defended him
on "The View," but she seemed

13:37.183 --> 13:40.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to admit there was
business conducted.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Manager: And it turns out that
he didn't -- he decided

13:41.487 --> 13:42.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not to invest there.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:44.991 --> 13:48.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: So, are you denying
they said that -- that his
company spent any money in Cuba?

13:48.561 --> 13:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: I think they
paid money -- as I understand
from the story, they paid

13:49.762 --> 13:51.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
money in 1998.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not supposed to talk about
years ago when it comes to the
Clintons.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Later,
Clinton weighed in.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Donald
Trump knew what the law was.

13:57.170 --> 14:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from everything we can tell
by the investigative reporting
that has been done, he
deliberately

14:07.013 --> 14:09.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flouted it.

14:09.282 --> 14:14.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another set of
headlines today for Libertarian
Gary Johnson.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One big win: He earned the
endorsement of The Detroit News,
which called Trump unstable

14:17.890 --> 14:20.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and possibly dangerous.

14:20.960 --> 14:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the first time in the
paper's 143-year history that it
hasn't endorsed a Republican.

14:27.533 --> 14:31.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Johnson also faced some bad
press, after he was asked on
MSNBC last night to name a

14:31.671 --> 14:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
foreign leader he respects:

14:34.407 --> 14:36.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON, Libertarian
Presidential Candidate: I guess
I'm having an Aleppo moment, and
the

14:36.809 --> 14:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
former president of Mexico...

14:38.411 --> 14:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC: But I'm
giving you the whole world.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: I know, I
know, I know, I know.

14:41.681 --> 14:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS MATTHEWS: Anybody in
the world you like, anybody.

14:41.848 --> 14:43.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pick any leader.

14:43.449 --> 14:45.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: The former
president of Mexico.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS MATTHEWS: No.

14:46.018 --> 14:47.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Which one?

14:47.920 --> 14:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: I'm having a
brain -- I'm having a brain...

14:49.622 --> 14:50.156 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
CHRIS MATTHEWS:
Well, name anybody.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:52.024 --> 14:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL WELD, Libertarian Vice
Presidential Candidate: Fox.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Johnson is
polling at 7 percent nationwide,
much higher in a few states, but

14:56.429 --> 15:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not enough yet to make the
stage for the second
presidential debate in two
weeks.

15:00.032 --> 15:03.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

15:03.636 --> 15:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All told, more
than a third of all votes are
expected to be cast early

15:07.774 --> 15:09.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this year.

15:09.642 --> 15:14.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that math has changed
the way campaigns organize.

15:14.046 --> 15:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reporter Sasha Issenberg with
Bloomberg News has been digging
in on the role of early voting

15:17.517 --> 15:19.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in this election, and
he joins me now.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sasha Issenberg, welcome.

15:22.622 --> 15:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is really changing the
way the campaign -- the
candidates and the campaigns are
organized.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA ISSENBERG, Bloomberg
Politics: Yes, you know, within
Hillary Clinton's campaign

15:29.328 --> 15:31.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- we saw her today.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She went to Iowa to try to
basically start get-out-the-vote
activities five weeks before

15:34.634 --> 15:37.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Election Day.

15:37.136 --> 15:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But within her headquarters in
Brooklyn, they have basically
changed the internal org chart.

15:41.140 --> 15:45.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In past years, campaigns have
split up the country by
geography.

15:45.211 --> 15:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They put all the Western states
in one group, and they put all
the Southern states in one

15:48.681 --> 15:51.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
group.

15:51.250 --> 15:56.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year, she set up her pods,
as they call them, separating
out the early vote states.

15:56.055 --> 15:59.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's because the sort of
rhythm and strategy and tactics
they use there is now

15:59.559 --> 16:02.662 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so different.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of these states, it's --
you know, well over 50 percent
of votes are going to be cast

16:05.898 --> 16:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before Election Day.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that changes who you're
talking to and when.

16:09.902 --> 16:13.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is there much
more of that going on this year,
Sasha, than it was in

16:13.139 --> 16:14.874 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2012?

16:14.874 --> 16:17.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SASHA ISSENBERG: Yes, we
see steady increases.

16:17.977 --> 16:22.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, we won't know until
after Election Day what
percentage of the vote is early,

16:22.615 --> 16:25.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but this tends to go
in one direction.

16:25.618 --> 16:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, as people vote early,
they develop a habit, much as
they do with regular voting.

16:30.590 --> 16:34.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so early voters
tend to vote early.

16:34.460 --> 16:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of states, although
obviously not all, have taken
strides to make it easier,

16:39.232 --> 16:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that people who can request
absentee ballots don't need
excuses to do it.

16:44.604 --> 16:51.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some states like Ohio are now
automatically sending out
absentee ballots to most voters.

16:51.444 --> 16:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, in a lot of
places, voters are being pushed
into this, and so it could be

16:55.448 --> 17:00.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as high as 40 percent this year
of the total electorate that
votes before Election Day.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about the difference in how
these two campaigns are

17:02.488 --> 17:05.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
positioned to take
advantage of this.

17:05.391 --> 17:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just mentioned that Clinton
has reorganized the way the
whole campaign is organized.

17:08.327 --> 17:11.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How about Donald Trump?

17:11.397 --> 17:15.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA ISSENBERG: Yes, Trump's
campaign has been pretty public
about the fact that they're

17:15.534 --> 17:19.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaving all sorts of field
activities, get-out-the-vote
stuff, to the Republican
National Committee

17:19.839 --> 17:22.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and to state parties.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is a place where they
may have different interests.

17:24.543 --> 17:29.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You may have in, let's say Iowa,
where Chuck Grassley is running,
the senator, is running

17:29.715 --> 17:34.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for reelection, you could have
voters who decided early that
they are on board with

17:34.720 --> 17:40.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Grassley, but are still
undecided in the presidential
race, or are considering a
third-party candidate.

17:40.092 --> 17:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if Trump is relying on the
state party to turn those voters
out, he could find that,

17:45.598 --> 17:48.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you know, people aren't
necessarily voting a straight
ticket when they get that
reminder

17:48.834 --> 17:51.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
phone call to return
their ballot.

17:51.404 --> 17:56.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
really the targeted voters for
the national candidates

17:56.676 --> 17:59.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might be different from those
of the state candidates.

17:59.178 --> 18:01.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But what about the
Clinton campaign?

18:01.113 --> 18:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Have they now perfected this?

18:04.717 --> 18:07.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How would you describe
how far along they are?

18:07.553 --> 18:12.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA ISSENBERG: You know, I
think that there's been a lot of
focus on this, as there was

18:12.658 --> 18:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 2012 from the Obama campaign,
among Democrats, who see it as
an opportunity, especially in

18:18.364 --> 18:24.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
larger, more diverse states like
North Carolina, Florida, that
have early voting, to use the

18:24.103 --> 18:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
extended period to mobilize some
of the communities that are very
important to the Democratic

18:28.607 --> 18:34.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
coalition, especially
minorities, who are often
difficult to turn out

18:34.480 --> 18:39.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, you know, we see North
Carolina as a very good example
of where Democrats have

18:39.285 --> 18:44.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worked hard to move up the
African-American vote, taking
advantage of the multiweek early

18:44.290 --> 18:46.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vote window.

18:46.058 --> 18:50.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, those people are voting
in often mid-October.

18:50.863 --> 18:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as the campaign gets later,
Hillary Clinton will be more
likely there to speaking to sort

18:55.901 --> 18:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of persuadable moderate white
voters, because she will feel
that she's locked in many of

18:59.372 --> 19:01.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the votes from her base.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what are a
couple of other swing states in
this election that -- where

19:05.811 --> 19:08.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
early voting, you see,
could make a difference?

19:08.481 --> 19:12.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA ISSENBERG: Nevada is a
state that's majority early vote
now.

19:12.451 --> 19:14.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They make it very easy
to vote in Nevada.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are registration forms
in supermarkets there.

19:17.223 --> 19:20.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have weekend early voting.

19:20.426 --> 19:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can vote on Saturdays
in late October.

19:23.629 --> 19:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then Colorado is sort of
the, you know, extreme case of a
battleground state.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is no in-person
Election Day voting.

19:30.302 --> 19:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everybody gets a mail ballot.

19:33.439 --> 19:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can drop it off until, I
believe, 7:00 p.m. on Election
Day.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But Election Day itself
is an afterthought.

19:39.812 --> 19:46.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just one more day that you
can drop off your absentee
ballot or put it in the mail.

19:46.252 --> 19:51.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, by the time we get to
Election Day in Colorado, most
of the votes will be banked.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the campaigns will probably
wake up on Election Day and
think they know who's won.

19:54.326 --> 19:56.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Huh.

19:56.562 --> 19:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it certainly is -- we paid
attention to it in 2012, but it
sounds like it is much

19:59.432 --> 20:01.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more of a factor this year.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sasha Issenberg with Bloomberg
News, we thank you.

20:03.569 --> 20:11.610 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SASHA ISSENBERG:
Thank you, Judy.

20:11.610 --> 20:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fifteen since
the United States went into
Afghanistan, the U.S. has

20:22.388 --> 20:27.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spent an estimated $1.5 billion
to develop women's rights in the
country.

20:27.493 --> 20:32.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also a new $300 million
five-year program to continue to
help women have a say

20:32.264 --> 20:34.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in their society.

20:34.567 --> 20:39.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, despite the money, the fact
that only a quarter of
parliamentarians are now women,

20:39.305 --> 20:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and laws protecting them from
violence, Afghan women still
face significant challenges.

20:44.276 --> 20:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Jennifer
Glasse reports from Kabul.

20:47.713 --> 20:52.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Kobra
Dastgirzada is a successful
Afghan businesswoman.

20:52.952 --> 20:57.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S.-funded program Promote
has sent these women to learn
from her.

20:57.289 --> 21:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's sharing more than a
decade's experience running
companies in Afghanistan.

21:01.560 --> 21:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Helped in part with U.S. funds
over the years, her enterprises
include making jams, pickles,

21:05.131 --> 21:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
baskets and dried soup packs.

21:08.567 --> 21:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She remembers life under the
Taliban, and says things have
improved since 2001.

21:12.438 --> 21:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KOBRA DASTGIRZADA, Entrepreneur:
In this 15 period, or years, it
was a very good chance

21:16.142 --> 21:21.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for women, because there
was a good program.

21:21.647 --> 21:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every day, the new program
come, especially about the
business, about the society,
about

21:25.951 --> 21:27.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything did come.

21:29.088 --> 21:32.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the women get a lot of
benefits from this program too.

21:32.291 --> 21:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right now, the women has a
good state to the society.

21:36.262 --> 21:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: But even with
experience, it's not easy.

21:40.432 --> 21:44.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She can't manufacture on this
day because there's no
electricity, and this is Kabul.

21:44.870 --> 21:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She knows life is much harder in
business and other ways for
women elsewhere in Afghanistan.

21:48.774 --> 21:52.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KOBRA DASTGIRZADA: Right now, in
the province, it is a very big
problem, because the women

21:52.945 --> 21:58.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cannot go out of the home,
because the Taliban has the
control.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know that.

21:59.518 --> 22:02.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then maybe they kill them.

22:02.588 --> 22:07.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And maybe, one day, they kill me
too, because I work and have a
lot of activity.

22:07.159 --> 22:11.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If they come and get Kabul,
the first person will be I.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They kill me.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Kobra says she
can't worry about the Taliban's
recent military gains

22:17.269 --> 22:18.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the country.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She wants to concentrate
on her work.

22:21.707 --> 22:25.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kobra has advantages many other
Afghan women don't, not just a
supportive husband, but

22:25.911 --> 22:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her factory is in her backyard,
so she can work at home.

22:28.214 --> 22:34.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And her shop is just
in front of her house.

22:34.787 --> 22:37.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her small shop is just one
outlet for her goods.

22:37.122 --> 22:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She also sends them to markets.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
For that, she needs a man.

22:41.393 --> 22:45.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Afghan society would frown on
women selling in the bazaar.

22:45.164 --> 22:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That man makes three times the
salary of her female Afghan
employees.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kobra says that can't be helped.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She needs him.

22:52.504 --> 22:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even where women succeed, the
culture of discrimination here
finds its place.

22:56.642 --> 23:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM MOTLEY, Attorney: A lot of
people don't realize that
Afghanistan is a country where

23:00.346 --> 23:04.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's been reported that over 85
percent of the women are victims
of domestic violence.

23:04.950 --> 23:10.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's a country where I
understand that 72 percent of
women are uneducated.

23:10.856 --> 23:15.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Kim Motley is a
lawyer who takes on some of
Afghanistan's most desperate

23:15.527 --> 23:20.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases, like Sahar Gul, who was
tortured and abused by her
husband's family.

23:20.699 --> 23:27.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She testified against them and
they were jailed, a rare victory
here.

23:27.740 --> 23:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Motley's newest client is Gul
Meena, attacked with an axe by
her brother, uncle and husband

23:31.243 --> 23:33.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and left for dead.

23:33.078 --> 23:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KIM MOTLEY: This incident
happened over three years ago.

23:36.315 --> 23:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is deplorable that not
one person in the Afghan
government has bothered to talk

23:41.453 --> 23:44.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to her about what happened.

23:44.390 --> 23:49.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, literally, there are
three axe murderers on the loose
in Afghanistan or Pakistan.

23:49.228 --> 23:53.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't know, but no one has
bothered to sort of find out.

23:53.399 --> 23:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Gul Meena says
she is still afraid of her
attackers, but would like to

23:57.336 --> 24:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see them punished and would
be willing to testify.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUL MEENA, Victim of Axe Attack
(through translator): I'm
worried that, if I go to court,
then the

24:04.943 --> 24:08.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
judge might put me in
jail because I ran away.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Hundreds of
women have been jailed for
so-called moral crimes, like
leaving

24:11.884 --> 24:14.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their husbands or even
being alone with a man.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Ghani released many.

24:17.523 --> 24:21.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Regardless of their cases, both
Gul Meena and Sahar Gul want to
leave Afghanistan.

24:21.660 --> 24:25.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They feel there's no
future here for them.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Susan DeCamp is one of the
stewards of the five-year, $300
million U.S.-funded Promote

24:28.534 --> 24:30.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
program for women.

24:30.869 --> 24:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says she knows women's
rights are tenuous here.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN DECAMP, USAID: It's a
challenge, and it's always been
a challenge, and it's going

24:37.209 --> 24:41.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to continue to be a challenge
for quite a while.

24:41.347 --> 24:47.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we hope to do is get enough
women out there working together
in a positive way,

24:47.720 --> 24:50.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so that they can have
their own voice.

24:50.889 --> 24:54.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not so much about us
deciding what they want and
need, but about them being in a
position

24:54.760 --> 24:59.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to influence what they
want and what they need.

24:59.598 --> 25:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: On a farm on
the outskirts of Kabul, that's
what Sophia Wilcox is doing

25:03.001 --> 25:06.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
teaching, women to
stand on their own.

25:06.872 --> 25:11.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She's taken a somewhat
tough-love approach with her
farming training programs.

25:11.276 --> 25:15.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anyone who wants to participate
has to pay dues to be part of
the collective.

25:15.781 --> 25:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since she arrived in 2009,
Wilcox has avoided creating what
she calls NGO disease,
dependency

25:20.452 --> 25:22.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on international aid.

25:22.888 --> 25:26.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SOPHIA WILCOX, Women in
Agriculture: I don't give them
anything because we need to
teach

25:26.258 --> 25:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them to be independent and use
what they have, become creative
in their use of their own

25:30.996 --> 25:32.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
resources to build
themselves up.

25:32.898 --> 25:36.268 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JENNIFER GLASSE:
And it's working.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the gardeners has a
daughter who's a hospital
worker, so they devised these
drip

25:38.737 --> 25:40.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
feeding systems.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Women are motivated,
with good reason.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOPHIA WILCOX: There's decisions
that they're not allowed to
make.

25:46.745 --> 25:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they're given a slight
bit of income, they can make
those decisions, children going

25:52.785 --> 25:56.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to school, whether or not they
go to school, if we buy
medicine, if we don't buy
medicine.

25:56.422 --> 26:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those types of decisions are
not given to women freely.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when they have their own
income, they are able to make
those decisions.

26:05.697 --> 26:10.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: The Afghan
women started managing this farm
on their own last October.

26:10.369 --> 26:15.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So far, each of the 15 workers
has made about $100 a month.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Considering a taxi driver in
Kabul makes about $150 a month,
it's good money, more than they

26:19.411 --> 26:21.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have ever made in their lives.

26:21.346 --> 26:24.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lump sum is expected at the
end of the summer harvest.

26:24.283 --> 26:29.321 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Next year, they
expect to earn more.

26:29.321 --> 26:32.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Farm manager Lailajan Yousafzai
needs no help with marketing.

26:32.224 --> 26:35.694 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
She knows her
products inside out.

26:35.694 --> 26:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's proud to support the 15
women farmers here, and to give
some income to 25 more.

26:40.866 --> 26:45.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can't leave their homes, so
they grow products in their own
gardens.

26:45.170 --> 26:51.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAILAJAN YOUSAFZAI, Farm Manager
(through translator): One woman
sent her son to university.

26:51.176 --> 26:54.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She can pay for his transport
and she can pay for his books.

26:54.079 --> 26:56.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We all use the money
for our families.

26:56.582 --> 26:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Four years ago,
this was all dirt and weeds.

26:59.585 --> 27:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But as often happens here,
success brings problems.

27:05.023 --> 27:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Although this project paid for
the local water pump and its
repair, the man who has the key

27:09.628 --> 27:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
demands money to supply water.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
For Sophia, it's a dilemma.

27:13.866 --> 27:20.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOPHIA WILCOX: It's a problem
for me, because I'm working for
essentially the U.S. taxpayer,

27:20.072 --> 27:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we can't pay bribes, and --
but bribes are really common.

27:23.575 --> 27:26.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it's a frustration,
and it's everywhere.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's rampant.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can't get anything
done, really.

27:31.116 --> 27:36.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: A rival project
nearby, funded by the Afghan
government, is failing.

27:36.755 --> 27:41.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its politically connected
manager is threatening to take
the women's land away.

27:41.059 --> 27:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The women here say they will
fight that to stay, that the
money they're making is changing

27:44.329 --> 27:47.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their lives.

27:47.065 --> 27:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But like so many things here, as
women, they ultimately may not
have a choice.

27:51.270 --> 27:58.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jennifer Glasse in Kabul.

27:58.810 --> 28:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now what we know
about Donald Trump's taxes, what
we don't know, and how

28:10.622 --> 28:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his real estate business could
be affecting his tax bill.

28:15.260 --> 28:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That subject led to one of the
more memorable exchanges of this
week's presidential debate.

28:20.465 --> 28:25.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman, sat down with a
Pulitzer-Prize winning
investigative

28:25.337 --> 28:30.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalist, David Cay Johnston,
who's been reporting on Trump
since the late '80s.

28:30.642 --> 28:34.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's also the author of a
bestselling book, "The Making of
Donald Trump."

28:34.446 --> 28:37.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
series Making Sense.

28:37.115 --> 28:39.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: David Cay
Johnston, welcome.

28:39.685 --> 28:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON, Author, "The
Making of Donald Trump": Thank
you, Paul.

28:41.520 --> 28:48.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Let's begin with
Secretary Clinton's claim that
Mr. Trump pays no federal income

28:48.360 --> 28:51.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
taxes, and, in the
debate, his response.

28:51.630 --> 28:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: Maybe he
doesn't want the American
people,

28:54.666 --> 28:59.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of you watching tonight, to
know that he's paid nothing in
federal taxes, because

28:59.705 --> 29:04.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the only years that anybody's
ever seen were a couple of years
when he had to turn them

29:04.476 --> 29:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over to state authorities when
he was trying to get a casino
license, and they showed he

29:08.947 --> 29:10.849 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
didn't pay any
federal income tax.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: That makes me smart.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON:
So, if he's paid...

29:14.152 --> 29:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The media are
making a big fuss about that
offhand remark of Mr. Trump's,

29:17.556 --> 29:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but isn't he right to say
he's smart to pay no taxes?

29:22.661 --> 29:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: Well, there
are two issues here to separate.

29:26.131 --> 29:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of them is, because he
is a -- the owner of a lot of
real estate that he manages,

29:30.102 --> 29:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he may well pay no income taxes.

29:33.739 --> 29:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know for a fact that he
didn't pay any income taxes in
1978, 1979, 1984, 1992 and

29:38.644 --> 29:40.979 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1994.

29:40.979 --> 29:44.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know because of the reports
of the New Jersey Casino Control
Commission.

29:44.983 --> 29:47.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't know about
any year after that.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But that's because
he's depreciating the
properties, right, while, in
fact, they're

29:50.756 --> 29:53.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
increasing in value.

29:53.191 --> 29:56.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I depreciate the
home office in my house.

29:56.094 --> 29:57.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I work there.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't have another office.

29:59.498 --> 30:01.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's just not much of a
benefit for me, obviously.

30:01.967 --> 30:05.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: Most
Americans cannot save more than
$6,000 a year from depreciating

30:05.937 --> 30:08.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
real estate.

30:08.407 --> 30:11.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's all they can write off
against their salary or business
profits.

30:11.576 --> 30:14.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, I don't
come close to $6,000.

30:14.446 --> 30:18.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: But people
like Trump can take all the
money that's made from a

30:18.684 --> 30:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TV show, from selling neckties
made in China, running golf
courses, and wipe out that
income

30:23.321 --> 30:26.358 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
for tax purposes
with depreciation.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Only a narrow segment of
people qualify for this.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And how
does he qualify?

30:30.495 --> 30:33.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: Because he
spends at least 15 hours a week
managing real estate that

30:33.765 --> 30:35.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he owns.

30:35.434 --> 30:37.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's the rule.

30:37.936 --> 30:42.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're a full-time manager of
your own property -- and
full-time, according to
Congress,

30:42.040 --> 30:46.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is 15 hours a week -- you can
take unlimited depreciation and
use it to offset your income

30:46.545 --> 30:50.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from other areas and
pay little in tax.

30:50.182 --> 30:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Years ago, one of the biggest
real estate tax lawyers in New
York said to me, if you're

30:54.519 --> 30:58.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a major real estate family and
you're paying income taxes, you
should sue your tax lawyer

30:58.857 --> 31:00.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for malpractice.

31:00.992 --> 31:04.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, but then he's
just doing what everybody else
does.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON:
That's right.

31:06.431 --> 31:11.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress has all sorts of rules,
Paul, that certain people, hedge
fund managers, private

31:11.069 --> 31:16.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
equity managers, executives,
movie stars, fall into that
allow them to escape or defer

31:16.975 --> 31:20.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into the future not
paying their taxes.

31:20.145 --> 31:24.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you can defer your tax
into the future, it's the best
deal in the world, because you

31:24.182 --> 31:26.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't just get to eat your
cake and have it too.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You get to eat your cake
and have a bigger cake.

31:27.853 --> 31:31.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But you mean you
get to keep the money...

31:31.323 --> 31:33.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: Right.

31:33.191 --> 31:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: ... that you would
otherwise have had to pay in
taxes.

31:34.359 --> 31:35.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON:
That's right.

31:35.460 --> 31:37.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: You then
invest that money.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: Correct.

31:39.097 --> 31:40.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And in the future,
you pay taxes.

31:40.532 --> 31:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I will give you the example
I have used with Donald Trump.

31:44.136 --> 31:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he really made $65 million a
year for his television show,
which NBC says is absurd,

31:47.739 --> 31:48.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but let's assume he did.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But he says that.

31:50.175 --> 31:52.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON:
He says that.

31:52.377 --> 31:56.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he would have paid about $23
million in federal income tax.

31:56.882 --> 32:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he's able to wipe that out by
depreciating the various
buildings that he owns, he would

32:01.286 --> 32:03.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
keep the $23 million.

32:03.321 --> 32:06.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, the normal rules
say he has 20 years.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So let's assume he keeps it 20
years, and he earns a net of 10
percent a year.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, after all, he's Donald
Trump, who says he's a great
investor.

32:13.064 --> 32:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the 20 years,
Trump would give the government
the $23 million, which is worth

32:16.701 --> 32:21.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot less because of inflation,
and he would pocket, after tax,
$130 million.

32:21.606 --> 32:25.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That's the $23
million at 10 percent a year.

32:25.177 --> 32:29.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: For all
those years, that's the interest
on it.

32:29.314 --> 32:35.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think most Americans
understand that, for certain
very wealthy people, our

32:35.220 --> 32:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal income tax system is a
subsidy system that makes them
richer.

32:40.192 --> 32:42.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But you can't blame
Mr. Trump for taking advantage
of the system.

32:42.994 --> 32:43.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: I agree.

32:43.995 --> 32:45.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I do not blame him one bit.

32:45.263 --> 32:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's only part one of it.

32:48.166 --> 32:54.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second part is the 1984 tax
trials, when he appealed his New
York state and New York

32:54.272 --> 33:01.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
City audits, were about Donald
claiming zero revenue for his
consulting business and taking

33:01.546 --> 33:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over $600,000 of deductions, for
which he couldn't produce any
documentation, no receipts,

33:06.151 --> 33:09.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no checks, nothing.

33:09.421 --> 33:15.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When shown a tax return that
Donald Trump had been audited on
-- he appealed the audits

33:15.427 --> 33:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- his tax guy said, well,
that's my signature, but I
didn't prepare that.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In fact, it was a photocopy.

33:21.933 --> 33:25.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No one could find the original.

33:25.070 --> 33:30.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, those two elements, zero
income and huge deductions,
combined with his own tax guy

33:30.909 --> 33:34.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
testifying under oath, that's my
signature, but I didn't prepare
that tax return, those

33:34.913 --> 33:39.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are very strong badges of fraud.

33:39.417 --> 33:44.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And seen in the context of Trump
having committed sales tax fraud
in the past, which is
indisputable,

33:44.589 --> 33:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that it's reasonable for
the American public to ask, did
you go beyond what's lawful,

33:49.194 --> 33:52.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maybe scandalously lawful, but
lawful, and violate the law?

33:52.464 --> 33:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Sales tax fraud?

33:55.267 --> 34:01.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: Well, Donald
participated in something known
as the empty box scam.

34:01.439 --> 34:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He bought $65,000 worth of
jewelry from Bulgari across the
street from Trump Tower, and had

34:07.312 --> 34:11.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the record show that it was
mailed to him in an out-of-state
address.

34:11.850 --> 34:17.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, if you're not a New York
resident, you may not have to
pay sales tax if the jewelry

34:17.022 --> 34:19.524 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
is mailed to you
in another state.

34:19.524 --> 34:20.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The problem is, they
were empty boxes.

34:20.725 --> 34:22.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was proven.

34:22.027 --> 34:23.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Was he convicted?

34:23.795 --> 34:26.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: No.

34:26.464 --> 34:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, the attorney general of
New York prosecuted the store
manager and one of the

34:30.335 --> 34:34.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Italian owners of the store.

34:34.406 --> 34:39.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that led Mayor Ed Koch to
say, the customers who took part
in this fraud, they should serve

34:39.577 --> 34:41.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
15 days in jail.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're really the criminals
here, not the store.

34:43.949 --> 34:45.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But he
didn't serve any time.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: No.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he wasn't charged
in the case either.

34:48.653 --> 34:52.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, so, then, why
are you making a big deal of it?

34:52.157 --> 34:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: Lots of
people commit crimes and don't
get arrested.

34:53.858 --> 34:55.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not the measure.

34:55.460 --> 34:58.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The measure is, did you
engage in unlawful conduct?

34:58.530 --> 35:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, Joe Blow does this, we
don't particularly care.

35:02.767 --> 35:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you're going to be the
president of the United States,
we're reasonably going

35:06.137 --> 35:09.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to put you under a microscope.

35:09.641 --> 35:16.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump's tax behavior
is absolutely important to
understanding, is he qualified,

35:16.681 --> 35:22.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is he morally fit, is he
capable, is he trustworthy to
have everything from the powers
of federal

35:22.387 --> 35:26.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
law enforcement to
the nuclear codes?

35:26.057 --> 35:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Peter Navarro,
economic adviser to Mr. Trump,
economist, University of
California

35:32.364 --> 35:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Irvine, says, Mr. Trump
should not release his income
taxes, and here's why.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER NAVARRO, Trump Economic
Adviser: It gives the opposition
too much information.

35:39.104 --> 35:40.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why would you do that?

35:40.805 --> 35:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because every other
presidential candidate ever has.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PETER NAVARRO: Ah, but
here's the difference.

35:48.947 --> 35:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's self-funding his campaign.

35:52.317 --> 35:56.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you release your tax
returns when you're self-funding
your campaign, you reveal to

35:56.121 --> 36:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the opposition how much you
have to run that campaign.

36:00.025 --> 36:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: I think the
reasonable response to this is,
what are you hiding?

36:03.628 --> 36:05.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Almost every
lawyer says, you don't release
your returns until the audit's

36:05.730 --> 36:07.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
complete.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.234 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
When the audit's
complete, I will do it.

36:09.234 --> 36:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: Let's take
Trump at his word: I can't
release the returns that are

36:10.035 --> 36:11.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under audit.

36:11.770 --> 36:15.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, let's have your
returns from 1977 to 2008.

36:15.273 --> 36:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The audits are closed on those.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no excuse, by your own
standard, not to release those
returns.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Why do you
care so much about this?

36:23.782 --> 36:27.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON: Because I
want to make sure that the
American public knows who this

36:27.152 --> 36:29.687 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man is.

36:29.687 --> 36:34.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I met Donald Trump in June of
1988, when I went to Atlantic
City to cover the casino

36:34.259 --> 36:36.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
industry.

36:36.327 --> 36:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so my standard here is,
you should know these facts.

36:41.232 --> 36:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the minute you know, and you
still want to vote for someone,
you should go ahead and

36:42.467 --> 36:43.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vote for them.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.237 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But don't later
say, I had no idea.

36:46.237 --> 36:47.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: David Cay
Johnston, thank you very much.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID CAY JOHNSTON:
Thank you, Paul.

36:50.408 --> 36:55.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The IRS says
nothing prevents Trump from
sharing his tax information even

36:55.013 --> 36:58.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if he is being audited.

36:58.283 --> 37:02.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For his part, Trump told Bill
O'Reilly on FOX News Channel
last night that he didn't

37:02.887 --> 37:06.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
admit at the debate that he
doesn't pay federal taxes.

37:06.291 --> 37:12.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he also didn't confirm
that he does pay such taxes.

37:12.130 --> 37:27.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Today, the Pew
Research center reported on how
different

37:27.712 --> 37:31.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
racial groups see the police.

37:31.182 --> 37:35.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Only a third of all
African-Americans view the
police as doing an excellent
job, compared

37:35.053 --> 37:38.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to roughly three-quarters
of all whites.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Working with the police is one
of the many responsibilities of
Newark, New Jersey, Mayor

37:41.526 --> 37:44.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ras Baraka.

37:44.262 --> 37:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For over a year, "NewsHour"
special correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault has explored
solutions

37:48.666 --> 37:53.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the nation's racial tensions
and sits down with him for the
latest in our series.

37:53.571 --> 37:58.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Ras
Baraka's election as mayor of
Newark, New Jersey, sent chills

37:58.576 --> 38:00.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through the city's
establishment.

38:00.311 --> 38:02.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAS BARAKA (D), Mayor of Newark,
New Jersey: We need a mayor that
is radical.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

38:04.716 --> 38:08.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Out of
nowhere, Ras Baraka has won over
most of his critics, and

38:08.253 --> 38:09.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we sat down with him
to find out how.

38:09.821 --> 38:12.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what do you mean by radical?

38:12.123 --> 38:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAS BARAKA: Well, I mean going
to the root of the problem.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what it means to me.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what radical is.

38:18.796 --> 38:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But,
somehow -- and I will start with
the white people who doubted

38:23.768 --> 38:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you -- and yet, according to The
New York Times and other
articles I have read, you

38:28.173 --> 38:29.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have won them over.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What did you do?

38:31.609 --> 38:37.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAS BARAKA: We have -- you know,
I, as the mayor, have been able
to lead very well and

38:37.182 --> 38:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring people together and
negotiate and fight for what we
think we need and compromise
around

38:42.020 --> 38:45.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the issues that we
can gain ground on.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, ultimately, I mean, the
chair belongs to the people.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't belong to me.

38:49.494 --> 38:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, how
do you balance off creating
opportunities and supporting

38:55.767 --> 39:01.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business with the people who
live in these poverty-stricken
neighborhoods?

39:01.472 --> 39:05.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAS BARAKA: These are not poor
cities in terms of it resources.

39:05.777 --> 39:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's just the wealth is not
staying in the hands of the
people that are here.

39:09.814 --> 39:14.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have to create scenarios
where more wealth is -- remains
behind for the people

39:14.052 --> 39:16.521 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this town.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: In the
two years that you have been
mayor, have you seen substantial

39:18.656 --> 39:20.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
change there?

39:20.725 --> 39:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAS BARAKA: We have a municipal
I.D. that we didn't have before.

39:23.962 --> 39:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have 6,000, 7,000 more people
who now can involve themselves
in the city, pull themselves

39:29.734 --> 39:35.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out of the shadows and
participate in city services,
that can put their money in
specific

39:35.974 --> 39:41.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
banks, that can, you know,
participate in the economy of
this city that could not prior,

39:41.045 --> 39:44.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when -- if they had a record
or if they were immigrants.

39:44.515 --> 39:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have begun to attack the
unemployment rate in the city.

39:49.354 --> 39:53.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's spiraling downwards, but
there is still a huge way to go.

39:53.424 --> 39:57.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're pushing for a jobs
plan on a state and federal
level.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's been extremely helpful.

40:00.531 --> 40:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: One of
the things I was interested in
that I read about was

40:04.302 --> 40:11.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how you support the Black Lives
Matter movement, as well as
police.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you reconcile
those two things?

40:13.511 --> 40:17.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAS BARAKA: Well, I don't think
they're mutually exclusive.

40:17.749 --> 40:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, you know, safety
in the community,
African-Americans want to be
safe in their

40:23.354 --> 40:26.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community, like any other
nationality that lives in
America.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't want to be robbed.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't want to be beat.

40:29.627 --> 40:33.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't want to be shot down
in their neighborhoods, whether
it's by police officers or
people

40:33.097 --> 40:35.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who live there.

40:35.800 --> 40:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to advocate for police in a
community, I don't think is a
contradiction.

40:40.638 --> 40:43.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it's necessary.

40:43.975 --> 40:47.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I think we want is
community policing and police
officers who care about the
community

40:47.712 --> 40:51.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they live in, who think
that they're part of a
community, and not an occupying

40:51.149 --> 40:54.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
force in a community.

40:54.852 --> 40:59.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is important
for us to create, change the
culture of the police
department,

40:59.023 --> 41:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they begin to see that
they have to police our
neighborhoods the same way other

41:02.894 --> 41:05.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people's neighborhoods are
policed in suburban communities
and other areas.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So,
how are you doing that?

41:08.066 --> 41:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAS BARAKA: We have developed a
civilian complaint review board.

41:10.335 --> 41:15.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We changed the makeup of
the internal affairs.

41:15.139 --> 41:19.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We provide training for new
recruits that is not like the
training that they normally

41:19.210 --> 41:20.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
get.

41:20.645 --> 41:21.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They get sensitivity training.

41:21.946 --> 41:27.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They get the kind of
de-escalation training.

41:27.118 --> 41:29.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin to sensitize them to
what's happening in their
neighborhoods and the
communities

41:29.754 --> 41:32.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where they police.

41:32.790 --> 41:36.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We try to advocate that police
officers live in a community
longer than they normally do.

41:36.861 --> 41:38.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, those are things
that have to happen.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And
what result are you seeing?

41:39.997 --> 41:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RAS BARAKA: Well,
we have just begun.

41:42.033 --> 41:46.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, we can't, like, give
you empirical data on it.

41:46.471 --> 41:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have only been in office two
years, not 25, and this problem
has been, like, decades

41:50.575 --> 41:53.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of work.

41:53.044 --> 41:55.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But
you're getting feedback from
both sides, are you not?

41:55.046 --> 42:00.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAS BARAKA: I think that some of
the concerns about a civilian
complaint review board are

42:00.952 --> 42:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
based on knee-jerk reactions
that people have about police
supervision that they have
always

42:05.423 --> 42:08.025 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
had.

42:08.025 --> 42:12.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we live in a new time and a
new place, and people have to
begin to be ready for the

42:12.063 --> 42:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kind of oversight that
the public is demanding.

42:15.233 --> 42:20.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't see any of that as
contradictory to supporting the
Black Lives Matter movement.

42:20.905 --> 42:23.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People say all lives matter.

42:23.508 --> 42:27.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's true, but it's just
black people that are getting
shot in the back running

42:27.345 --> 42:32.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or choked to death for having
cigarettes or playing their
music too loud.

42:32.216 --> 42:38.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's important for us to
uphold all life, but we have to
be honest and say that, you

42:38.322 --> 42:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, African-Americans are
being disproportionately
affected by, you know, the kind
of misuse

42:42.927 --> 42:45.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and abuse of power.

42:45.897 --> 42:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there needs to be,
obviously, some light shed on
that, which is why Black Lives

42:49.267 --> 42:51.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Matter is important.

42:51.335 --> 42:58.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there needs to be some
reconciliation and repair of
what's going on.

42:58.576 --> 43:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, all of the things, from body
cameras to review boards, to
training, to people calling

43:06.851 --> 43:10.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for independent investigators,
all those things are important
for us to get a handle on what's

43:10.588 --> 43:13.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happening in our cities.

43:13.057 --> 43:16.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You have
just described a situation that
exists in many cities across

43:16.227 --> 43:19.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this nation.

43:19.130 --> 43:23.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What kind of solutions
would you propose?

43:23.801 --> 43:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what kinds of things have
you done that you could share
with others to improve these

43:27.572 --> 43:29.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
circumstances?

43:29.941 --> 43:33.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAS BARAKA: I think that,
ultimately, the only thing that
affects race relations is

43:33.544 --> 43:35.413 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fair treatment.

43:35.413 --> 43:39.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, the problems that exist
in Newark are national problems.

43:39.016 --> 43:43.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're systemic problems that
existed before I was even born.

43:43.621 --> 43:48.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they exist all over the
country, which means that we
need a systemic solution for

43:48.893 --> 43:50.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these problems.

43:50.194 --> 43:52.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we don't know everything.

43:52.396 --> 43:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're experimenting and trying
to do the best that we can with
the ideas that we have, creating

43:56.734 --> 44:03.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opportunities for cooperatives,
so we can get people to begin to
own business and own

44:03.007 --> 44:05.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what they have in their
community to offer.

44:05.109 --> 44:07.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Cooperatives?

44:07.512 --> 44:11.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAS BARAKA: Cooperatives where
we have collective ownership,
workers begin to own the
businesses

44:11.782 --> 44:14.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that they work in.

44:14.118 --> 44:17.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Based on
everything I have read, you have
a really good relationship

44:17.121 --> 44:21.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with business, the business
community, for the most part.

44:21.592 --> 44:27.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So how do you see getting them
invested in the things that you
have just talked about?

44:27.098 --> 44:35.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAS BARAKA: Prudential held a
convention or conference for us
here in Newark about procurement

44:35.206 --> 44:43.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and convening the folks in a
community, the business
community, to begin to help us
invest

44:43.347 --> 44:45.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more in this community.

44:45.816 --> 44:53.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saint Barnabas has invested in
the capital project of our
cooperative laundry, reentry

44:53.024 --> 44:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
laundry, made up mostly of folks
who are 100 percent Newark
residents, predominantly black

44:58.930 --> 45:04.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and brown folks in the city,
folks who were formally
incarcerated who are now
beginning

45:04.435 --> 45:08.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to learn how to run and
operate a laundry business.

45:08.940 --> 45:12.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're going to own and
operate a cooperative laundry
that does business with the
local

45:12.910 --> 45:17.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hospitals in this area.

45:17.315 --> 45:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We haven't hit a home run yet,
but, you know, I think we're up
at the plate and we're swinging.

45:21.686 --> 45:24.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Mr. Mayor, thank you for joining
us.

45:24.822 --> 45:33.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAS BARAKA: No problem.

45:33.798 --> 45:40.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An acclaimed
deejay has been traveling the
globe documenting the changing

45:40.805 --> 45:45.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
landscape of music
and digital culture.

45:45.076 --> 45:47.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has another
edition to our Bookshelf looking
at the result of these travels,
the

45:47.912 --> 45:50.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
new volume, "Uproot."

45:50.247 --> 45:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON,
Author, "Uproot: Travels in
21st-Century Music and Digital

45:51.115 --> 45:57.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Culture": So, what I will start
off with, scratchy old 45 that I
found in Morocco, just

45:57.521 --> 45:59.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of randomly dropping
the needle on the record.

45:59.624 --> 46:02.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's see.

46:02.026 --> 46:06.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: What
does a deejay do?

46:06.130 --> 46:12.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, Jace Clayton, AKA DJ
/rupture, takes musical pieces
from around the world, adds

46:12.403 --> 46:17.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his own sounds and mixes them
together, creating something
that will make you get up and
dance,

46:17.008 --> 46:20.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or maybe listen in
a brand-new way.

46:20.845 --> 46:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON:
Activating music, you know,
keeping music alive.

46:25.650 --> 46:29.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Each part
is alive on its own.

46:29.820 --> 46:34.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON: Each
part is alive on its own, but I
love the way in which, when

46:34.291 --> 46:37.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you bring these things into
overlap or superimposition, they
start talking to each other in
new and

46:37.361 --> 46:40.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
surprising ways.

46:40.731 --> 46:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you can tell all sorts
of stories with this.

46:43.968 --> 46:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The 41-year-old
Clayton graduated from Harvard
with a degree in English, but

46:48.439 --> 46:52.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
music has been his passion
since middle school.

46:52.309 --> 46:57.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2001, he put a mix called
"Gold Teeth Thief" on his Web
site and was stunned when
hundreds

46:57.515 --> 47:04.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of thousands of people around
the globe started sharing it.

47:04.388 --> 47:09.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's traveled the world ever
since, both making music and
collecting it, and tells what
he's

47:09.393 --> 47:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
found in a new book, "Uproot:
Travels in 21st-Century Music
and Digital Culture."

47:15.366 --> 47:18.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These days, New York is home,
and that's where we talked.

47:18.869 --> 47:22.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON: All
this disruption through
technology, how all these
digital

47:22.306 --> 47:25.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
changes are transforming how we
think about analog, how we think
about what music used

47:25.676 --> 47:28.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be and what it's becoming.

47:28.012 --> 47:31.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, when you say
travels in 21st century music
and digital culture, what

47:31.782 --> 47:33.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are you looking for?

47:33.951 --> 47:37.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON: I'm
looking for the surprises, you
know, and...

47:37.788 --> 47:40.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The surprises?

47:40.191 --> 47:42.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON:
Exactly, the unexpected moments
of technology, the unexpected
moments

47:42.226 --> 47:45.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of musical creation.

47:45.096 --> 47:48.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every time I'm in a foreign
place and a different city, I'm
always asking around to say, OK,

47:48.699 --> 47:51.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well, what's special here
in this particular place?

47:51.535 --> 47:54.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What makes these people
move here and why?

47:54.071 --> 47:56.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I'm one of the people who
will hear a song in a taxi and
be like, stop, stop the

47:56.774 --> 47:58.042 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
car.

47:58.042 --> 47:58.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Like, let's go back.

47:58.943 --> 48:00.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What was that?

48:00.344 --> 48:01.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You
mean literally?

48:01.479 --> 48:02.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE"
CLAYTON: Literally, yes.

48:02.179 --> 48:03.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Stop the car.

48:03.514 --> 48:05.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE"
CLAYTON: Stop the car.

48:05.015 --> 48:05.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because you heard
it coming out of some
storefront?

48:05.516 --> 48:07.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE"
CLAYTON: Exactly, yes.

48:07.885 --> 48:12.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That approach has
taken him to side streets off
the beaten path in more

48:12.223 --> 48:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than three dozen countries,
Morocco, for instance, where he
spent time with local musicians
and

48:18.429 --> 48:23.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
performed with his own group,
Nettle, mixing his electronic
sounds with traditional
instruments

48:23.234 --> 48:40.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a singer, and Mexico where,
again, he found that, in the age
of globalization, while

48:40.384 --> 48:44.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everyone now has access to the
same music, local culture
continues to thrive, and music

48:44.955 --> 48:48.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a way to understand it.

48:48.259 --> 48:54.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clayton writes of the young
people he encountered making
North Mexican teen rave music.

48:54.098 --> 49:01.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON:
They're saying, oh, we hear all
this sort of international

49:01.105 --> 49:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
techno is really popular here.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then they grew up in this
world of hearing rodeo music,
sort of cowboy music from their

49:06.510 --> 49:08.546 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
parents.

49:08.546 --> 49:12.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then they go on YouTube and
they're seeing Shakira videos.

49:12.750 --> 49:17.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they're thinking, so,
like, what is local to us right
now?

49:17.555 --> 49:22.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the idea that local now
draws on all sorts of
international, all sorts of
layers

49:22.793 --> 49:27.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of input, and yet they're still
making something which would
only be made in Monterrey,
Mexico,

49:27.765 --> 49:28.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this moment.

49:28.933 --> 49:30.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is urgent music.

49:30.234 --> 49:32.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need to discuss it.

49:32.770 --> 49:38.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is there a
general theory why, in Benin,
there's this, and, in Morocco,
there's

49:38.142 --> 49:40.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that, and in North
Mexico, there is this?

49:40.110 --> 49:41.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON:
Well, that is why is so
exciting.

49:41.779 --> 49:44.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's like there is
no general theory.

49:44.615 --> 49:49.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, if there's anything I
have learned, it's to sort of be
sensitive to what -- to

49:49.320 --> 49:53.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how much -- to how creative the
act of listening is and to how
powerful the act of listening

49:53.123 --> 49:55.726 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

49:55.726 --> 49:58.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He makes his
living playing at clubs and at
major festivals like here

49:58.128 --> 50:06.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Pitchfork in Chicago.

50:06.570 --> 50:18.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a world in which music
travels as never before, when a
young producer can bypass big

50:18.082 --> 50:22.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
record labels, and so much music
is consumed for free, I asked
Clayton how he sees his

50:22.186 --> 50:24.655 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
role.

50:24.655 --> 50:29.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON: I do
think of myself as a
taste-maker, yes, absolutely.

50:29.360 --> 50:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so much of what deejays like
myself do is, I'm very
interested in -- I'm constantly

50:35.566 --> 50:39.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
looking for new music,
constantly digging, but then
also I am thinking about how to
present

50:39.770 --> 50:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it in a way that kind of makes
sense to people who are less --
sort of less with their hands

50:44.275 --> 50:46.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in it than I am.

50:46.777 --> 50:50.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I wonder if you
run into people, if you say,
what about just the human voice?

50:50.915 --> 50:54.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, what about just
somebody playing a guitar?

50:54.485 --> 50:56.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love watching -- going to a
cafe, and I just -- somebody
plays a guitar, and that's

50:56.954 --> 50:58.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beautiful.

50:58.822 --> 51:00.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON:
You know, I say, me, too.

51:00.024 --> 51:02.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:02.559 --> 51:05.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE" CLAYTON: Most
of the summer here in New York
City, I have just been going

51:05.262 --> 51:10.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to hear coral music in churches,
completely unamplified, the
human voice, maybe an organ.

51:10.601 --> 51:14.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The guy who is
writing about digital technology
and musical culture just

51:14.204 --> 51:16.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
goes to church and
listens to a chorus?

51:16.206 --> 51:18.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACE "DJ /RUPTURE"
CLAYTON: I know.

51:18.175 --> 51:23.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, I have got to look at the
flip side of things, because, in
a way, music is always

51:23.113 --> 51:25.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a conversation, you know?

51:25.549 --> 51:29.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a conversation between the
musician and their tools and
their technologies.

51:29.586 --> 51:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a conversation between
people and their community, you
know, people and -- and
deejaying,

51:33.791 --> 51:37.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is a way of amplifying that
conversation and kind of putting
that conversation on blast

51:37.895 --> 51:39.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in a way.

51:39.797 --> 51:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But at a very basic level, it's
records talking to records.

51:42.266 --> 51:53.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From New York
City, I'm Jeffrey Brown for the
"PBS NewsHour."

51:53.744 --> 52:00.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to another
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where ask interesting

52:00.084 --> 52:02.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to describe
their passions.

52:02.853 --> 52:07.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from artist iO
Tillett Wright, whose
photography projects have
sparked a

52:07.424 --> 52:10.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
dialogue on gender
identification and sexuality.

52:10.260 --> 52:14.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
iO's memoir, "Darling Days," was
released this week by Ecco.

52:14.465 --> 52:18.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IO TILLETT WRIGHT, Author,
"Darling Days": My earliest
memory of wanting to be a boy

52:18.002 --> 52:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was when I was -- had my fifth
birthday party, and I had this
lacy blue dress.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second I got home, I was
just like, get this thing off of
me.

52:24.908 --> 52:27.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I ripped it off.

52:27.311 --> 52:30.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I, like, put on warrior
paint and I went up to the roof,
and I, like, took a piss
standing

52:30.080 --> 52:31.648 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

52:31.648 --> 52:39.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was my, like,
ownership of it.

52:39.857 --> 52:42.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These kids were like, are
you a boy or a girl?

52:42.493 --> 52:45.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I was like, why
does that matter?

52:45.062 --> 52:47.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can play better than you.

52:47.097 --> 52:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they didn't let me play.

52:49.233 --> 52:51.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I went to my dad and I was
like, hey, I'm a boy now.

52:51.902 --> 52:55.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he was like, OK.

52:55.672 --> 53:01.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My mom's attitude was, yes, as
long as you can get acting roles
as a boy, I don't care.

53:01.612 --> 53:03.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My mom put me into child acting.

53:03.514 --> 53:06.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I only played boys
until I was 17.

53:06.483 --> 53:09.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then I played
a couple girls.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's was when people
started to tell me that I was
too unique.

53:11.355 --> 53:14.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was like, if one more
person tells me I'm too unique,
out of here.

53:14.224 --> 53:15.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I did.

53:15.125 --> 53:16.293 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I quit.

53:16.293 --> 53:18.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I miss acting.

53:18.095 --> 53:19.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But do you cast me as a boy?

53:19.463 --> 53:21.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you cast me as a girl?

53:21.198 --> 53:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you cast me as the gay girl?

53:23.200 --> 53:24.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you cast me as the trans kid?

53:24.668 --> 53:26.403 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Oh.

53:26.403 --> 53:27.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: You have got
incredible range.

53:27.538 --> 53:30.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IO TILLETT WRIGHT: I have
got incredible range.

53:30.374 --> 53:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the last six years, I have
done this project where I have
been photographing 10,000 people

53:34.011 --> 53:37.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who identify as anywhere on the
LGBT spectrum in all 50 states.

53:37.748 --> 53:42.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you look into the eyes of
a person that you discriminate
against or you think

53:42.486 --> 53:45.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is so different than you that
they deserve less rights than
you, it becomes almost
impossible

53:45.189 --> 53:48.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to deny their humanity.

53:48.025 --> 53:52.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The complicated part of that is,
I'm not trying to say we are all
the same.

53:52.696 --> 53:58.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I'm trying to say is, we
are all completely different,
and that's the beauty of it.

53:58.302 --> 54:03.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had set out to photograph
gay people and trans people.

54:03.373 --> 54:07.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I had found was that
people from older generations
identified super strongly

54:07.511 --> 54:10.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with labels because they'd
had to fight for them.

54:10.447 --> 54:13.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But younger people were more
like, well, yes, like I loved a
guy, and now I love a girl,

54:13.750 --> 54:16.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and maybe I'm more
boyish tomorrow.

54:16.787 --> 54:19.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're more fluid on
a spectrum of things.

54:19.890 --> 54:24.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that the most dignified
gift you can give them as a
human, as part of their family

54:24.528 --> 54:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or their family of friends,
is the right to change.

54:29.166 --> 54:31.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm iO Tillett Wright.

54:31.668 --> 54:36.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this is my Brief But
Spectacular take on expanding
one's circle of normalcy.
