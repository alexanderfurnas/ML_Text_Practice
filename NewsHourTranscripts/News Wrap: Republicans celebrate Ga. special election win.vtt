00:45.533 --> 00:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eye to eye on everything, but
rather than demonizing each
other, we find common ground

00:51.166 --> 00:53.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to move forward.

his father assumed
the throne in 2015.

03:10.066 --> 03:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER WALDMAN, Bloomberg
Businessweek: He wants to bring
entrepreneurship and initiative

03:13.966 --> 03:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and kind of a high-tech
sensibility to Saudi Arabia.

03:17.300 --> 03:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On social issues, he is
relatively progressive,
meaning that he clearly
can see a point in

03:24.700 --> 03:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time when women will be
driving and can essentially
travel and take jobs
without their husband's

03:30.033 --> 03:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or male guardian's permission.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

03:38.466 --> 03:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fierce rival to the Saudis
and their Sunni allies.

03:41.666 --> 03:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prince Mohammed has
also overseen the Saudi
military campaign against
Yemen's Shiite Houthi

03:47.800 --> 03:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

03:49.733 --> 03:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER WALDMAN: His confrontation
with Iran across the Persian
Gulf is a bit dangerous.

03:56.566 --> 04:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has said and is willing
to do military interventions
in Yemen, most notably, where

04:02.100 --> 04:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lots of civilians have
died in this ongoing war.

04:05.200 --> 04:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

necessarily have the wisdom
of age and experience.

HARI SREENIVASAN: On the
domestic side, the prince has
championed economic reforms.

04:15.766 --> 04:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants to reduce the country's
dependence on oil, and allow
an initial public offering

04:22.166 --> 04:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of stock in the state-owned
oil giant, Saudi Aramco.

04:25.300 --> 04:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The elevation of Mohammed bin
Salman came after he met with
President Trump during the

04:29.766 --> 04:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president's visit last month.

group has destroyed a
historic mosque in Mosul.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The centuries-old site is
where the group's leader,
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,
declared a so-called

05:03.966 --> 05:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

jet near a plane carrying the

05:24.600 --> 05:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russian defense minister.

05:26.233 --> 05:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then, a Russian fighter
moves in, before the
NATO plane pulls away.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

standard procedure.

This will be a severe weather
event that will primarily

05:58.500 --> 06:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consist of threats of rain and
flooding, but there also is
a potential for wind damage

as well.

06:04.833 --> 06:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No one should be under
the belief that this
storm is only going to
affect coastal Louisiana

06:11.533 --> 06:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
