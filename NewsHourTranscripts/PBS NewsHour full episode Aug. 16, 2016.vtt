largest single

00:11.278 --> 00:17.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
release of Guantanamo Bay
prisoners yet, in
a push to close the
controversial detention

00:17.284 --> 00:19.019 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
center.

00:19.052 --> 00:21.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Tuesday:
The candidates take on the
battle against

00:21.655 --> 00:23.523 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ISIS.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We compare the strategies laid
out by Donald
Trump and Hillary Clinton to
defeat the terror

00:26.126 --> 00:27.861 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
group.

00:27.895 --> 00:31.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, the
struggle of early
child care workers to make a
living, and why

00:31.431 --> 00:33.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children are the ones losing out
in the end.

00:33.934 --> 00:36.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCY WHITEBOOK, University of
California,
Berkeley: The care and education
of young

00:36.837 --> 00:44.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children, before kindergarten,
is just as
complex as teaching children who
are older.

00:44.444 --> 00:50.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we haven't restructured our
system, and
invested the public dollars that
it will take.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

HARI SREENIVASAN: The toll from
days of historic
flooding in Louisiana kept on
climbing today.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Local officials raised the
number of fatalities
to 10.

01:12.873 --> 01:17.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Early estimates indicate at
least 40,000 homes
have been impacted..

01:17.210 --> 01:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The water did start to slowly
recede in areas
near Baton Rouge.

01:21.248 --> 01:25.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, some residents
managed to return
to their homes to assess the
damage.

01:25.352 --> 01:29.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor John Bel Edwards
acknowledged recovery
efforts have been tough.

01:29.156 --> 01:30.891 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

01:30.924 --> 01:34.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D), Louisiana:
This is a
very difficult situation to get
response out

01:34.494 --> 01:36.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as quickly as we would like to.

01:36.730 --> 01:43.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We still have about 34,000
meters without
electricity.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's customers, so those are
homes or businesses.

01:46.239 --> 01:49.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We understand that there is
still a lot of
people who are suffering.

01:49.343 --> 01:53.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The governor
also reported
about 8,000 people remain in
shelters, a number

01:53.313 --> 01:55.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he expects will rise.

01:55.182 --> 01:59.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In California,
crews have gained
ground on a massive wildfire
north of San

01:59.619 --> 02:01.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Francisco.

02:01.355 --> 02:06.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's charred nearly seven square
miles, and
destroyed 175 homes and other
buildings.

02:06.994 --> 02:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But local officials said the
fire is now about
20 percent contained.

02:11.298 --> 02:15.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The progress came as authorities
arrested
a man they believe set the fire.

02:15.836 --> 02:21.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was charged with 17 counts of
arson, and
is suspected of starting several
other fires

02:21.041 --> 02:22.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the area.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The nation's
third largest
health insurer, Aetna, has
announced plans

02:25.579 --> 02:29.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to leave most of the health care
exchanges
set up under President Obama's
Affordable

02:29.850 --> 02:31.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

02:31.685 --> 02:35.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It will sharply cut its
participation from
15 states to just four next
year, citing heavy

02:35.989 --> 02:37.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
financial losses.

02:37.791 --> 02:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aetna is the third major health
insurer to
pull out of the ACA in recent
months, joining

02:41.695 --> 02:43.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
UnitedHealth and Humana.

02:43.530 --> 02:48.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia widened
its bombing
campaign in Syria today, this
time launching

02:48.068 --> 02:50.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
airstrikes from Iran.

02:50.137 --> 02:56.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The warplanes took off from a
base near Hamedan
about 175 miles southwest of
Tehran.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They targeted Islamic State
fighters and other
militants.

02:59.980 --> 03:06.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first time Russia has
used another
country's territory for attacks
in Syria.

03:06.486 --> 03:10.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An American military official
said the U.S.
was warned in advance.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.359 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS GARVER, Spokesman,
Operation Inherent
Resolve: They informed us they
were coming

03:14.094 --> 03:18.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through, and we ensured safety
of flight as
those bombers passed through the
area and

03:19.032 --> 03:21.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
toward their target and then
when they passed
out again.

03:21.701 --> 03:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They didn't impact coalition
operations in
either Iraq or Syria during the
time.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We knew in time.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not a lot of time, but it's
enough.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was enough time to make
sure that we
could ensure safety of flight.

03:32.946 --> 03:37.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's believed to
be the first
time that Tehran has allowed a
foreign country

03:37.751 --> 03:43.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to use one of its bases for
military operations
since the 1979 Islamic
Revolution.

03:43.690 --> 03:48.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of
Britain's most well-known
radical Muslim preachers has
been convicted

03:48.361 --> 03:50.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of rallying support for the
Islamic State.

03:50.964 --> 03:54.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anjem Choudary was found guilty
in a London
court last month.

03:54.167 --> 03:57.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was unreportable until now
due to criminal
proceedings.

03:57.070 --> 04:01.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His followers have been linked
to a number
of high-profile attacks,
including last year's

04:01.641 --> 04:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beheading of a British soldier
in London.

04:04.211 --> 04:06.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Choudary could face up to 10
years in prison.

04:06.913 --> 04:11.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Here in the U.S.,
regulators
today unveiled new
fuel-efficiency rules for

04:11.718 --> 04:14.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
large trucks and other
heavy-duty vehicles.

04:14.888 --> 04:21.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The caps will cut greenhouse gas
emissions
by over one billion tons, and
save over $170

04:21.761 --> 04:24.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
billion in fuel costs.

04:24.498 --> 04:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By 2027, heavy-duty trucks will
be 25 percent
more fuel-efficient than those
sold in 2018.

04:32.706 --> 04:37.244 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
Heavy-duty vehicles account for
more than
20 percent of
transportation-related
pollution.

04:37.277 --> 04:42.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stocks slipped
on Wall Street
today, due in part to a lag in
phone and utility

04:42.449 --> 04:43.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
company shares.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 84 points
to close at 18552.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell nearly 35
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 dropped 12.

04:50.857 --> 04:55.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A passing to
note: Renowned
TV host John McLaughlin has
died.

04:56.029 --> 05:00.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the creator, executive
producer and
host of "The McLaughlin Group,"
a long-running

05:00.867 --> 05:02.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
weekly public affairs show.

05:02.869 --> 05:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McLaughlin was too ill to host
this past Sunday,
the first time he's missed a
taping in 34

05:09.176 --> 05:10.777 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

05:10.810 --> 05:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Besides his work in TV, he
served as a speechwriter
for Presidents Nixon and Ford.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John McLaughlin was 89 years
old.

05:17.684 --> 05:22.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And now some
highlights
from today's Summer Games in
Rio.

05:22.289 --> 05:26.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. women gymnasts ended an
exhilarating
Olympic run where they began it,
atop the

05:26.793 --> 05:28.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
winners podium.

05:28.195 --> 05:31.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Simone Biles won her fourth gold
of the Games
in the floor exercise.

05:31.164 --> 05:35.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her teammate Aly Raisman was at
her side,
taking the silver.

05:35.068 --> 05:40.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in the men's finals,
American gymnast
Danell Leyva grabbed silvers on
both the parallel

05:40.774 --> 05:42.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bars and the high bar.

05:42.642 --> 05:46.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
the largest Guantanamo detainee
transfer under

05:46.913 --> 05:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama; how Donald
Trump and Hillary
Clinton plan to defeat ISIS;
allegations against

05:53.787 --> 06:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FOX News' Roger Ailes spark a
larger discussion
on workplace harassment; and
much more.

06:03.897 --> 06:10.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FOX News' Roger Ailes spark a
larger discussion
on workplace harassment; and
much more.

06:10.904 --> 06:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When President Obama took
office, there were
242 detainees being held at the
Guantanamo

06:16.776 --> 06:18.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bay prison.

06:18.111 --> 06:21.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He stated his priority was to
close the facility
in Cuba.

06:21.982 --> 06:26.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But finding places for the
inmates to go,
even after they had been legally
cleared,

06:27.020 --> 06:28.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has proven difficult.

06:28.855 --> 06:34.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yesterday, the Pentagon
announced the latest
transfer out, 15 prisoners to go
to the United

06:34.394 --> 06:39.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arab Emirates, meaning the
number left is
down to 61.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

06:40.967 --> 06:44.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On his first
day in office,
President Obama promised to
close Guantanamo.

06:44.971 --> 06:49.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's called it expensive,
unnecessary and
a -- quote -- "recruitment
brochure for our

06:49.376 --> 06:51.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enemies."

06:51.411 --> 06:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While Congress has blocked the
transfer of
high-risk detainees to U.S.
prisons, the administration

06:55.115 --> 06:59.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has focused on moving those who
are cleared
for release to other nations.

06:59.052 --> 07:03.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Monday's announcement, which
was the single
biggest transfer for this
administration,

07:03.056 --> 07:07.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has been criticized by
Republicans, who say
these 15 men are dangerous and
should never

07:07.627 --> 07:08.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been let go.

07:08.895 --> 07:11.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm joined now by Charlie Savage
of The New
York Times.

07:11.498 --> 07:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's covered Gitmo and the war
on terror for
many years.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charlie, help us understand, who
are these
15 men that were just recently
released?

07:17.904 --> 07:19.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE, The New York
Times: Hi.

07:19.205 --> 07:20.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for having me on.

07:20.273 --> 07:24.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So these men, these 15, none of
them are Emirate.

07:24.077 --> 07:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twelve of them are from Yemen
and three of
them are from Afghanistan.

07:28.948 --> 07:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were approved for
transfer to a stable
country that could provide
various security

07:35.255 --> 07:44.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assurances some time ago in many
cases either
by a task force in 2009 or later
by a parole-like

07:44.364 --> 07:51.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
review panel, in both cases made
up of six
security agencies, the Central
Intelligence

07:51.104 --> 07:54.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Agency, the Defense Department,
the State
Department, the Justice
Department, and so

07:54.240 --> 07:55.408 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are career officials, not
political
appointees.

07:57.844 --> 08:02.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they unanimously agreed that
these men
no longer posed such a threat to
the United

08:02.716 --> 08:07.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States that it was necessary to
keep holding
them in indefinite detention
without trial.

08:07.921 --> 08:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But because they came from,
especially in
the case of the Yemenis,
countries that were

08:12.992 --> 08:18.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not stable, in fact, chaotic and
had a weak
central government, they were
stranded until

08:18.131 --> 08:23.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some other country that could
meet these security
assurances was willing to take
them in.

08:23.370 --> 08:29.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in this very sizable
transfer, the UAE
solved that problem for the
United States

08:29.275 --> 08:34.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and brought them to its country,
and is now
putting them through a
rehabilitation program.

08:34.547 --> 08:36.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have not been released on
to the streets.

08:36.483 --> 08:41.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are still in custody, but
with an eye
towards eventually moving them
out towards

08:41.454 --> 08:47.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a halfway house and then life in
relative
freedom in that country under
monitoring.

08:47.260 --> 08:50.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Several
Republicans have
pointed out that these -- they
argue that

08:50.897 --> 08:56.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these 15 men are very dangerous
and they point
out that in a prior
classification, these

08:56.336 --> 08:58.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
men were ruled as being very
high-risk.

08:58.571 --> 09:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what has changed in their
status as far
as the U.S. government's view of
these men?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: Right.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, there are two things to
understand about
that.

09:06.012 --> 09:14.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is that it has become a
politically potent
sort of partisan fodder to say
that any transfer

09:14.154 --> 09:20.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
release from Guantanamo is
endangering national
security as a sort of way to
attack the Obama

09:20.927 --> 09:21.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it polls well.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And no matter who is released
under what circumstances,
this is a recurring theme.

09:26.833 --> 09:31.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it has to be understood
as part of
this, the texture of these
policy debates.

09:31.137 --> 09:36.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, as to your question
specifically, what
they're referring to is, there
was a group

09:36.743 --> 09:42.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of reports or dossiers prepared
by the military
about everyone at Guantanamo in
the first

09:42.315 --> 09:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
few years that they were there
under the Bush
administration that later became
public when

09:47.821 --> 09:51.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were released by Private
Chelsea Manning
through WikiLeaks.

09:51.458 --> 09:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they raised the threat level
of the detainees
and sort of described who the
military at

09:56.129 --> 09:58.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that point thought they were.

09:58.331 --> 10:02.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And almost everyone who was
there was rated
either a medium or a high risk.

10:02.368 --> 10:06.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And most of the men in this
group were also
rated a high risk.

10:06.473 --> 10:12.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a snapshot in time based
on the military's
understanding in the year 2004,
2005, 2006.

10:12.679 --> 10:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what happens later, as years
continue to
pass, is that then the Obama
administration

10:18.151 --> 10:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came in and appointed that task
force I mentioned
earlier, and then later since
2013 that parole-like

10:23.857 --> 10:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
review board with these six
agencies.

10:25.658 --> 10:30.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they come back and they
take another
look at these men and how have
they behaved

10:30.897 --> 10:32.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in custody.

10:32.532 --> 10:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What kind of trouble have they
gotten into
or do they comply with the
rules?

10:35.768 --> 10:37.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What have they said over the
years?

10:37.470 --> 10:40.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are their family members
saying about
them?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What kind of situation would
they go into?

10:42.909 --> 10:47.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now things are different, in
that we have
this very well-developed system,
some of it

10:47.747 --> 10:53.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imposed by Congress, over the
Obama administration's
objection, that requires
detainees to go to

10:53.520 --> 10:58.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a place where there are adequate
security
assurances of monitoring and
other steps to

10:58.358 --> 11:04.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reduce the chance of recidivism,
whereas,
in 2004, 2005, 2006, if someone
was released,

11:04.731 --> 11:06.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they really were just simply let
go.

11:06.733 --> 11:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what could be a threat,
what could
be perceived as a threat at the
time of those

11:10.370 --> 11:14.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reports may or may not still be
the case 10,
12 years later.

11:14.173 --> 11:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that is the basis of the
attacks that
you're hearing in the political
sphere.

11:18.411 --> 11:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, we have 61
men who are
still at Guantanamo now.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's likely to happen with
those men?

11:25.118 --> 11:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: So, 20 more of
them have also
been recommended for transfer if
security

11:30.323 --> 11:33.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conditions can be met in the
receiving countries.

11:33.092 --> 11:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Obama administration is
clearly trying
very hard to get that list down
to zero or

11:38.264 --> 11:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as close to zero as they can get
it before
President Obama leaves office.

11:43.336 --> 11:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a few more names may be
added to it over
time by that parole-like review
board.

11:48.308 --> 11:54.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are still going to be
dozens of
men, currently 41, who are not
recommended

11:55.014 --> 11:59.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for transfer, either because
they're facing
charges before a military
commission, or more

11:59.419 --> 12:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likely because, by numbers, they
are simply
still deemed too dangerous to
release, but

12:05.091 --> 12:06.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
untriable.

12:06.192 --> 12:08.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will have to be housed
somewhere.

12:08.428 --> 12:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama's plan to close
Gitmo wasn't
to let them go, but to bring
them to a different

12:12.899 --> 12:14.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prison on domestic soil.

12:14.601 --> 12:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congress has forbidden him from
doing that.

12:17.170 --> 12:22.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so most likely, come January
20, when
the next president takes office,
those men

12:22.175 --> 12:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at least will still be there.

12:23.943 --> 12:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Charlie Savage
of The New York Times, thank you
very much.

12:31.851 --> 12:36.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: Thank you.

12:36.756 --> 12:44.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
most contentious
issues during the current
presidential election

12:44.263 --> 12:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is how to confront ISIS and who
was responsible
for the rise of the extremist
group.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Margaret Warner reports.

12:50.970 --> 12:56.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: This was the
scene recently
in a village not far from Mosul
in Northern

12:56.643 --> 12:58.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iraq.

12:58.678 --> 13:05.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newly uploaded video purports to
show Islamic
State fighters doing battle with
Iraqi Kurdish

13:05.218 --> 13:06.853 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces.

13:06.886 --> 13:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite battlefield setbacks in
Iraq and Syria,
the militant group remains
lethal.

13:11.891 --> 13:15.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How to fight ISIS has become a
central theme
in the 2016 U.S. presidential
race.

13:15.828 --> 13:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
ISIS is honoring President
Obama.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is the founder of ISIS.

13:25.838 --> 13:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say the co-founder would
be crooked
Hillary Clinton.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

13:31.511 --> 13:33.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That was last
week.

13:33.813 --> 13:39.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, Republican nominee
Donald Trump
delivered a fuller anti-ISIS
message in Youngstown,

13:39.485 --> 13:41.421 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ohio.

13:41.454 --> 13:46.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: My administration
will aggressively
pursue joint and coalition
military operations

13:46.492 --> 13:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to crush and destroy ISIS,
international cooperation
to cut off their funding,
expanded intelligence-sharing,

13:55.868 --> 14:01.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and cyber-warfare to disrupt and
disable a
their propaganda and recruiting.

14:01.607 --> 14:06.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: He also
proclaimed that he
would end what he called an era
of nation-building,

14:06.846 --> 14:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and would take harsh steps to
stop ISIS from
penetrating the United States.

14:11.818 --> 14:19.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The time is
overdue to develop
a new screening test for the
threats we face

14:19.625 --> 14:20.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

14:20.960 --> 14:25.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I call it extreme vetting.

14:25.131 --> 14:28.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I call it extreme, extreme
vetting.

14:28.234 --> 14:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It would screen
out those
who sympathize with terror
groups and those

14:35.108 --> 14:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have, in his words, any
hostile attitude
towards our country or its
principles.

14:39.946 --> 14:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Those who do not
believe in
our Constitution.

14:42.982 --> 14:47.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In a Web video
released last
night, Democrat Hillary
Clinton's campaign

14:47.887 --> 14:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tried to turn Trump's own words
against him,
saying he would fail the test
he'd set for

14:53.659 --> 14:55.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigrants.

14:55.495 --> 15:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last November, Clinton said she
would defeat
ISIS by massing more U.S. ground
troops against

15:00.566 --> 15:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the group, though with limits.

15:02.535 --> 15:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
And we should be honest about
the fact that,

15:06.038 --> 15:12.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be successful, airstrikes
will have to
be combined with ground forces
actually taking

15:12.211 --> 15:15.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
back more territory from ISIS.

15:15.348 --> 15:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like President Obama, I do not
believe that
we should again have 100,000
American troops

15:21.521 --> 15:23.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in combat in the Middle East.

15:23.356 --> 15:28.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That fits with
the picture
of Clinton in a joint Washington
Post/ProPublica

15:28.127 --> 15:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report today about the early
Obama administration
debate over whether to fulfill
his campaign

15:34.333 --> 15:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pledge to pull out of Iraq
altogether.

15:37.603 --> 15:42.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It notes that Clinton was --
quote -- "one
of the most vocal advocates for
a muscular

15:42.275 --> 15:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. presence in Iraq after the
withdrawal
deadline at the end of 2011."

15:47.880 --> 15:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton lost that argument, and
all U.S. fighting
forces left.

15:52.018 --> 15:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also been widely reported
that, in 2013,
Clinton and then CIA Director
David Petraeus

15:58.524 --> 16:03.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proposed arming and training the
so-called
moderate rebels in neighboring
Syria, but

16:03.796 --> 16:06.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the president rejected it.

16:06.299 --> 16:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those U.S.-backed rebels are
still doing battle
against Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad,

16:11.871 --> 16:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but with mixed results, in the
brutal five-year
old civil war that continues to
this day.

16:17.443 --> 16:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

16:20.680 --> 16:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what are
the differences
between how Donald Trump and
Hillary Clinton

16:25.351 --> 16:26.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would combat ISIS?

16:26.919 --> 16:30.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For that, we turn to Walid
Phares, a foreign
policy adviser to Donald Trump.

16:30.690 --> 16:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wendy Sherman, she was
undersecretary
of state for political affairs
while Hillary

16:35.228 --> 16:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton was secretary of state.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's now an outside adviser to
the Hillary
Clinton campaign.

16:39.298 --> 16:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Walid Phares, what's the key
strategic difference
that Donald Trump wants to make
in the fight

16:43.936 --> 16:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against ISIS that the Obama
administration
has not?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES, Donald Trump
Foreign Policy
Adviser: Well, first of all,
very important

16:48.507 --> 16:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to know that, between now and
2017, many things
will change on the ground, and
they will change

16:53.880 --> 16:56.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for either Mrs. Clinton or Mr.
Trump.

16:56.148 --> 16:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, anything we're projecting
right now has
to do with the moment.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are major differences.

17:00.386 --> 17:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, in looking at the three
battlefields,
one is Iraq, Syria and, of
course, Libya has

17:04.991 --> 17:06.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be dealt with.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three levels are important in
terms of difference.

17:08.694 --> 17:13.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Level number one is who -- what
forces are
going to be engaging ISIS on the
ground?

17:13.165 --> 17:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it Kurdish forces, the Iraqi
army or others
in Syria?

17:17.236 --> 17:19.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And why do we ask this question?

17:19.171 --> 17:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because we don't want to end up
with a sect
controlling another sect on the
ground, which

17:23.542 --> 17:25.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will found the next war.

17:25.678 --> 17:29.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second is also, who would take
over after
liberation from ISIS?

17:29.081 --> 17:33.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Should it be the locals,
national, the government,
or a coalition of regional
forces that would

17:33.419 --> 17:34.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
help them?

17:34.921 --> 17:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, thirdly, of course, what is
the future
of civil wars such as in Syria?

17:38.658 --> 17:39.625 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who will stay?

17:39.659 --> 17:41.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who will go?

17:41.494 --> 17:44.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we have tremendous
differences
in how to go in, how to manage
and, of course,

17:44.363 --> 17:46.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the negotiations for the future.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Mr.
Phares, one of the
things that Donald Trump has
said in a debate

17:48.267 --> 17:52.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in March is that he's open to up
to 20,000
to 30,000 U.S. troops being on
the ground.

17:52.672 --> 17:53.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that necessary?

17:53.673 --> 17:54.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that the right course?

17:54.674 --> 17:56.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALID PHARES: Mr. Trump made
that statement.

17:56.175 --> 17:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He may make other statements.

17:58.077 --> 18:02.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are decisions that only
when Mr. Trump
is the president, hopefully,
with his national

18:02.748 --> 18:05.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security Cabinet, will decide
upon the time.

18:05.851 --> 18:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama, for example,
didn't want
to send forces to the region
after the withdrawal

18:09.188 --> 18:10.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Iraq.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had engaged in a warfare
situation in Libya.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is sending forces.

18:14.994 --> 18:18.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, these are national security
decisions
that would be decided once there
is an evaluation

18:18.764 --> 18:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the situation on the ground.

18:20.700 --> 18:25.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The American public in general
has no appetite
for sending tens of thousands,
but each situation

18:25.471 --> 18:27.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has a condition.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ms. Sherman,
Secretary Clinton
has also called for ground
troops, but in

18:30.042 --> 18:31.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a limited capacity.

18:31.811 --> 18:36.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What do you see as the
differences between
what Mr. Trump is proposing and
what Mrs.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton would carry out?

18:38.317 --> 18:40.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN, Former U.S.
Undersecretary
of State for Political Affairs:
Well, first

18:40.086 --> 18:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all, all of the things that
Walid just
outlined were not discussed in
Mr. Trump's

18:44.991 --> 18:47.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
speech at all yesterday.

18:47.393 --> 18:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the strategy that Mr.
Trump put on
the table, other than the
extreme vetting,

18:52.365 --> 18:57.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is exactly what President Obama
and Secretary
Clinton have worked toward.

18:57.103 --> 19:04.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is an international
coalition with local
troops on the ground, having a
very aggressive

19:04.110 --> 19:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strategy in the cyberworld to
stop the financial
flows.

19:09.648 --> 19:16.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of these are part of a
multivector strategy
that has been under way under
President Obama

19:16.188 --> 19:19.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for quite some time now and is
actually having
success.

19:19.291 --> 19:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just today, Secretary of Defense
Carter said
that Syrian democracy forces had
indeed taken

19:28.367 --> 19:37.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back Manbij, which is a very key
transit point,
and now opens the way to
ultimately getting

19:37.143 --> 19:44.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Raqqa, which ISIL has said is
its centerpiece
for a caliphate, which is
disappearing on

19:44.850 --> 19:47.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the ground in Syria.

19:47.153 --> 19:50.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is a very complex
environment in the
Middle East.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In that, Walid is correct.

19:52.458 --> 19:57.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it can't come without some
knowledge and
some background.

19:57.463 --> 20:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And every day, we get a
different message
from Mr. Trump.

20:00.399 --> 20:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would like to know, does he
still support
torture, which is not the
American way and

20:05.571 --> 20:07.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doesn't bring results?

20:07.473 --> 20:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does he still believe that we
ought to be
killing innocent civilians if
there is a family

20:12.378 --> 20:14.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of terrorists that have nothing
to do with
the terror?

20:14.980 --> 20:20.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is he someone who still believes
in, as you
pointed out, Hari, sending
thousands and thousands

20:20.519 --> 20:22.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of troops?

20:22.354 --> 20:26.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump has been on all sides
of that issue
over the history of the last
several years.

20:26.959 --> 20:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's very difficult to know
whether Mr.
Trump stands and whether he has
an understanding

20:31.897 --> 20:36.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the complexity of the
situation and the
progress that's being made, but
the progress

20:36.936 --> 20:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is still absolutely needed
to protect
our homeland and to make sure
that Americans

20:41.540 --> 20:43.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feel safe and secure.

20:43.309 --> 20:46.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
things that she
said about extreme vetting, what
does that

20:46.445 --> 20:47.780 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mean?

20:47.813 --> 20:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have heard that there might
be an ideological
questionnaire.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But if I'm a terrorist, wouldn't
I just lie?

20:52.151 --> 20:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: The final goal of
this is to
interdict jihadists from coming
to the United

20:58.624 --> 20:59.592 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everything else could be
reconstructed.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He needs to have the input of
national security
agencies.

21:04.864 --> 21:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the problems with our
analysts and
our national security agencies
over the past

21:08.100 --> 21:13.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
eight years have been
encountering is that
the ideological discourse that
the jihadists

21:13.038 --> 21:16.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have among themselves has been
removed, removed
from the analysts.

21:17.009 --> 21:21.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it would be very difficult to
be preemptive
in the sense to understand when
there is radicalization.

21:21.780 --> 21:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is something that our
liberal democratic
allies in France, in Britain and
also in other

21:27.153 --> 21:30.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries and also in the Arab
world have
not done.

21:30.055 --> 21:32.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have retreated from the
ideological element.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not that we are against one
or the other
ideology.

21:34.927 --> 21:39.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we need some indicators that
these people
are Salafis, are Takfiri, are
jihadists, so

21:40.032 --> 21:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we can vet them.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Extreme vetting is not a
physical extreme
vetting.

21:43.836 --> 21:47.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an intellectual exercise
that would bring
us back to where we should have
been, understanding

21:47.907 --> 21:49.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
better the ideas that
radicalizes these jihadists.

21:49.942 --> 21:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
things that Mr.
Trump also said yesterday was
that he was

21:53.212 --> 21:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- the similarity that existed
between Orlando
and San Bernardino, the attacks,
were that

21:57.850 --> 22:00.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they were carried out by
children and grandchildren
of immigrants.

22:00.553 --> 22:06.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a particular generation
where Americans
are patriotic enough where they
wouldn't be

22:06.292 --> 22:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- fall under the spell of ISIS?

22:08.060 --> 22:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WALID PHARES: What he meant by
that was not
actually a sociological
interpretation of

22:11.997 --> 22:16.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how these communities would
work, because
we also have immigrants and sons
and daughters

22:16.302 --> 22:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of immigrants from the Arab and
Muslim war
who fought in our armed forces
and who died

22:20.506 --> 22:22.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for America.

22:22.241 --> 22:26.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he meant by that is,
despite the fact
of integration, the French are
telling us

22:26.745 --> 22:28.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same thing, the Germans are
telling us
the same thing.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, integration is not the
answer.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's basically deradicalization.

22:32.451 --> 22:36.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we want to make sure that
this ideology
doesn't go and thrust through
the generations

22:36.822 --> 22:38.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to a third one.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be the same case for a
neo-Nazi or
an anti-Semite or a Bolshevik.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not about a social problem.

22:43.462 --> 22:45.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about an intellectual,
ideological problem.

22:45.264 --> 22:50.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Wendy Sherman,
one of the
distinctions that I think exists
between Hillary

22:50.402 --> 22:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton and President Obama is
the institution
of a no-fly zone over Syria.

22:57.009 --> 23:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama, even as recent
as the G20,
said that that would be
counterproductive.

23:01.780 --> 23:07.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What would a President Clinton
do in that
case to make it work?

23:07.152 --> 23:11.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: First of all,
Hari, in answer
to your question about what
extreme vetting

23:11.090 --> 23:14.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, quite frankly, I didn't
understand Walid's
answer.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not an intellectual
exercise.

23:16.629 --> 23:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is about our immigration
policies.

23:19.965 --> 23:23.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are very strict, and
the vetting
is very tough.

23:23.369 --> 23:27.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our authorities are always
looking at
ways to make sure that we are as
clear as

23:27.439 --> 23:29.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we possibly can be.

23:29.275 --> 23:34.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Walid himself knows -- he's
not a Muslim,
but he came here himself in
1990, when he

23:34.847 --> 23:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no longer felt personally safe
in Lebanon
because of his own history,
which we could

23:39.852 --> 23:41.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
discuss at another time.

23:41.620 --> 23:47.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't quite understand yet
what extreme
vetting means, other than a nice
sound bite

23:47.192 --> 23:48.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on television.

23:48.961 --> 23:56.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To your point about a no-fly
zone, Secretary
Clinton has said that she wants
to explore

23:56.201 --> 24:01.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whatever alternative may deal
with the really
tragic humanitarian disaster
which has played

24:01.173 --> 24:03.409 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out in Syria.

24:03.442 --> 24:07.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You know that there are
literally millions
of people who are now refugees.

24:07.246 --> 24:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are millions of people who
are internally
displaced.

24:10.316 --> 24:16.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leader of Syria, Bashar
al-Assad, has
used starvation as a weapon of
war, has used

24:16.755 --> 24:22.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chemical weapons against his own
people, has
used chlorine gas probably
against his own

24:22.161 --> 24:23.862 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

24:23.896 --> 24:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the question is, in fact,
how do we
create some humanitarian safety
for all of

24:29.968 --> 24:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these millions of people who are
really in
a desperate, desperate
situation?

24:34.373 --> 24:41.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have put enormous pressure on
Turkey, on
Jordan, on Iraq, and now on
Europe, as migrants

24:41.480 --> 24:46.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and refugees pour out of Syria
looking for
safety.

24:46.318 --> 24:50.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I applaud Secretary Clinton
in wanting
to explore every alternative,
even knowing

24:50.956 --> 24:53.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of these are quite tough to
do.

24:53.392 --> 24:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she will look very carefully
to see what
is doable.

24:55.728 --> 25:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we can't not try to see if
there is an
answer to this humanitarian
tragedy.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Wendy Sherman,
Walid Phares, thank you both.

25:03.469 --> 25:05.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WALID PHARES: Thank you.

25:05.904 --> 25:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Thank you.

25:13.612 --> 25:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:18.317 --> 25:23.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
child care workers
struggle to make ends meet on
near minimum

25:23.222 --> 25:30.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wage; a new book explores the
history of poor
white Americans; and inside the
extraordinary

25:30.162 --> 25:33.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nose of a search-and-rescue dog.

25:33.098 --> 25:39.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, an update on the
fallout at FOX
News over allegations that its
co-founder,

25:39.138 --> 25:43.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Roger Ailes, sexually harassed
women employees
for years.

25:43.776 --> 25:49.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ailes resigned in late July with
a reported
$40 million severance package,
that after

25:49.481 --> 25:55.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lawsuit by former FOX anchor
Gretchen Carlson
alleged that her show was
canceled because

25:55.821 --> 25:58.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she'd rebuffed sexual advances
from Ailes.

25:58.524 --> 26:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the following weeks, a
growing number of
women, including prime-time
anchor Megyn Kelly,

26:04.530 --> 26:08.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reportedly came forward with
similar stories
of impropriety.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ailes has called Ms. Carlson's
accusations
false.

26:11.236 --> 26:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And an internal investigation by
FOX's parent
company is still under way.

26:16.775 --> 26:21.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a closer look, not only at
this case,
but at the wider matter of
sexual harassment

26:21.713 --> 26:26.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the workplace, we turn to
Sarah Ellison,
a contributing editor at "Vanity
Fair."

26:26.151 --> 26:29.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She recently reported on the
Ailes allegations.

26:29.555 --> 26:35.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Shelley Ross, she's a former
network television
news executive, best known for
her 17-year

26:35.494 --> 26:37.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tenure at ABC News.

26:37.629 --> 26:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She recently wrote about her own
professional
experiences with Roger Ailes,
and the news

26:42.301 --> 26:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business at large, in The Daily
Beast.

26:45.137 --> 26:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we should note at the
outset, Roger Ailes
back in the news today because
of a New York

26:50.943 --> 26:55.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Times report that he's now
advising Donald
Trump's campaign.

26:55.747 --> 26:58.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we should say the campaign
denies that.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Sarah Ellison, I want to
turn to you
first.

27:00.886 --> 27:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is the state of what is
known about Roger
Ailes' alleged harassment of
women at FOX

27:07.493 --> 27:09.328 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News?

27:09.361 --> 27:13.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH ELLISON, "Vanity Fair":
Well, we know
-- largely, what we know is what
we have learned

27:14.032 --> 27:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from our reporting, which is
that the internal
investigation that is ongoing
that you referred

27:18.036 --> 27:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to earlier has identified at
least women in
the double digits who have come
forward and

27:23.709 --> 27:25.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
spoken to the internal
investigation.

27:25.711 --> 27:29.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we know that it was
something that implicated
Ailes certainly.

27:29.214 --> 27:32.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people who have come
out and told
their stories, but there are
people who have

27:33.018 --> 27:37.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not yet come forward, and I
think that we're
going to see more women, even
more women come

27:37.222 --> 27:38.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
forward in the coming days.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, we should
say that he's
denied any wrongdoing.

27:40.759 --> 27:42.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARAH ELLISON: That's right.

27:42.528 --> 27:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He did reportedly
receive this
$40 million settlement when he
left FOX.

27:47.966 --> 27:52.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does that mean he's legally free
and clear,
whatever is discovered?

27:52.037 --> 27:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH ELLISON: Well, no, I don't
know that
any kind of a contractual
arrangement could

27:59.177 --> 28:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually put someone legally
free and clear
from any kind of behavior.

28:04.249 --> 28:08.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, one of the things that
we know and
that I reported last week was
that there are

28:08.787 --> 28:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- in the course of this --
these discussions
that have been going on with the
internal

28:12.658 --> 28:17.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation and also with the
women who
initially brought a lawsuit
against Roger

28:17.496 --> 28:21.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ailes, Gretchen Carlson, is that
there have
been some settlement discussions
that have

28:21.133 --> 28:23.001 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
begun.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at issue in the settlement
discussions
are tapes that multiple women,
including Gretchen

28:26.038 --> 28:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carlson, have made of their
interactions with
Roger Ailes.

28:29.541 --> 28:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that those are now
circulating,
at least among the people who
are discussing

28:36.448 --> 28:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this possible settlement, just
makes every
bit of this a bit more
explosive.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Sarah
Ellison, one more.

28:42.821 --> 28:48.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there then the potential for
more legal
action against Roger Ailes?

28:48.160 --> 28:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH ELLISON: Well, what we
have seen in
the press, we -- again, he
denies any kind

28:54.533 --> 28:56.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of wrongdoing.

28:56.268 --> 29:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are -- beyond sexual
harassment
charges, there are sort of
intimidation and

29:01.173 --> 29:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bullying and leaking stories
about people.

29:05.010 --> 29:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear to me if he was
using the company
money to settle multiple
lawsuits against

29:13.685 --> 29:16.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
multiple women and not
disclosing that.

29:16.321 --> 29:20.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know at what point that
reaches the
level that corporate governance
experts or

29:20.459 --> 29:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FEC people would be interested
in, or at what
point any of this becomes
actually criminal.

29:26.131 --> 29:31.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And which is a
question we
can't know the answer to at this
point.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shelley Ross, let me turn to you
now.

29:33.505 --> 29:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You did write that you have
known Roger Ailes
for -- since the beginning of
your career,

29:39.077 --> 29:40.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
practically.

29:40.078 --> 29:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You wrote of meeting him over
lunch.

29:42.981 --> 29:49.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He made -- proposed what you
described as
a sexual alliance as you were
going to work

29:49.287 --> 29:50.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for him.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Your lawyer contacted his
lawyers.

29:51.923 --> 29:53.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He then apologized.

29:53.558 --> 29:54.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You did work with him.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have since stayed in touch
with him over
the years.

29:57.462 --> 30:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you go on to say -- in this
article you
wrote in The Daily Beast, you
said, "Sexual

30:02.234 --> 30:07.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
harassment in network television
is pervasive."

30:07.105 --> 30:08.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How pervasive is it?

30:08.373 --> 30:10.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHELLEY ROSS, Former Network
News Executive:
It's everywhere.

30:10.742 --> 30:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's everywhere I worked.

30:11.743 --> 30:16.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it has many levels, many
faces.

30:16.682 --> 30:22.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Being thrown into a swimming
pool on a company
picnic is sexual harassment.

30:22.521 --> 30:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's an act of hostility.

30:25.090 --> 30:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was the one at ABC, I was the
producer doing
the very first stories on sexual
harassment

30:33.331 --> 30:39.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the time of Anita Hill's
testimony
against Clarence Thomas.

30:39.805 --> 30:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my boss presented me with a
birthday cake
with a phallus on it.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a hostile environment.

30:47.345 --> 30:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know executive producers who
turn to their
young girls on their staff, and,
"I haven't

30:53.952 --> 30:56.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had my morning hug."

30:56.888 --> 31:06.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was once -- as I was leaving
ABC, I had
a correspondent grab me and grab
my behind

31:06.732 --> 31:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and said to me, "I can do this
now that you're
no longer my boss."

31:11.737 --> 31:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I stepped back and said,
"No, you can't."

31:14.439 --> 31:16.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's pretty ugly.

31:16.341 --> 31:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's -- the reason I wrote this
piece in The
Daily Beast is that we have got
to stop, we

31:22.814 --> 31:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have got the end harassment now.

31:24.750 --> 31:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Shelley Ross, let
me just stop
you there.

31:26.918 --> 31:32.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think it's worse in the
news business
than it is across the board for
women?

31:32.424 --> 31:36.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHELLEY ROSS: No, I don't think
it's any different.

31:36.995 --> 31:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just you think, since we
report on it,
that our colleagues should know
better, that

31:43.769 --> 31:47.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they should be a little more
elevated.

31:47.439 --> 31:48.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And they're not.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do you -- no,
go ahead.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What were you going to say?

31:51.576 --> 31:53.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHELLEY ROSS: It's men and
women.

31:53.545 --> 31:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have had a lot of men and
former male colleagues
reach out to me since I wrote
The Daily Beast

31:59.718 --> 32:04.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
article to tell me things have
happened to
them years ago.

32:04.189 --> 32:07.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they sound as scarred as
women in the
workplace.

32:07.759 --> 32:12.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you do go on,
Shelley Ross,
to write about what you think
needs to be

32:12.130 --> 32:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
done, that there just needs to
be more candor.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Explain what you're talking
about.

32:17.803 --> 32:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELLEY ROSS: Well, I think,
even at FOX -- I
think FOX has the opportunity --
now that

32:24.843 --> 32:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Shine, who was Roger Ailes'
number two,
has become president, I think --
everybody

32:31.082 --> 32:34.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thinks he's a really good guy
and he's very
popular.

32:34.653 --> 32:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he has an opportunity to
become a hero.

32:38.323 --> 32:45.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could say, I want FOX News to
become the
safest place in the world for
men and women.

32:45.730 --> 32:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think there has to be public
airings.

32:49.334 --> 32:55.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What usually happens, which
happened at FOX
for 20 years, is a woman is
sexually harassed.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do they go?

32:57.976 --> 33:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They go to human resources.

33:00.712 --> 33:03.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Human resources is working for
the corporation.

33:03.415 --> 33:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't want a lawsuit.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there is a settlement.

33:06.918 --> 33:09.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's hush money paid.

33:09.087 --> 33:10.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there's a nondisclosure.

33:10.722 --> 33:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, everything is swept under
the carpet.

33:14.125 --> 33:16.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it goes on and on and on.

33:16.962 --> 33:24.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I say we need something akin
to the Truth
and Reconciliation hearings
after apartheid

33:24.236 --> 33:25.237 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1974.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Nelson...

33:26.271 --> 33:28.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In South Africa?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHELLEY ROSS: Yes.

33:30.175 --> 33:39.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nelson Mandela had a great idea
to say, come
forward, clear the air, without
any retribution,

33:39.050 --> 33:41.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we can all move forward
safely.

33:41.419 --> 33:43.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me turn
to Sarah
Ellison.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having written as much as you
have about what
happened at FOX, and I know
you're familiar

33:46.892 --> 33:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with other news organizations,
whether it's
something exactly like what
Shelley Ross describes

33:52.197 --> 33:58.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or something akin to that, what
do you see
as a real potential solution
here, or is there

33:58.703 --> 34:00.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one?

34:00.505 --> 34:04.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH ELLISON: Well, I mean, I
can tell you
what is happening at FOX News,
and -- with

34:05.010 --> 34:06.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the internal investigation that
is ongoing.

34:06.811 --> 34:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is that someone very
close to that
said to me, this is not a
therapy session

34:10.482 --> 34:12.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the women involved.

34:12.117 --> 34:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a law firm that has been
hired to
give legal advice to 21st
Century Fox.

34:15.921 --> 34:21.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't want to -- I think
that what Shelley
is proposing is quite
interesting.

34:21.793 --> 34:27.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been some lip
service paid to
the notion that they want to
create a very

34:27.365 --> 34:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
safe place to work, but it's --
you look at
how pervasive this is in
something like television,

34:33.238 --> 34:39.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and where people are invited to
comment in
the newsroom on how someone
looks on air,

34:39.044 --> 34:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and people are constantly
talking about appearance
and weight and hair and makeup.

34:43.982 --> 34:47.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I think it's a very
difficult environment.

34:47.052 --> 34:52.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can tell you only what I'm
seeing unfold
so far, and it's not that
promising.

34:52.891 --> 34:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we -- this
is a subject
that's much, much bigger than
what we have

34:58.363 --> 34:59.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time for tonight.

34:59.864 --> 35:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we thank both of you for
certainly giving
us something to think about.

35:03.134 --> 35:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARAH ELLISON: Thank you.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Shelley Ross and
Sarah Ellison,
we thank you.

35:06.838 --> 35:12.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHELLEY ROSS: Thank you.

35:12.877 --> 35:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now a look at
how pre-K
teachers and early child care
workers struggle

35:26.224 --> 35:31.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make ends meet, earning
little better than
subsistence wages, even as
parents and the

35:31.062 --> 35:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama administration say they
increasingly
value what they do.

35:35.400 --> 35:40.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
education series Making
the Grade, produced this week in
collaboration

35:40.105 --> 35:41.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with The Hechinger Report.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHANEE WILSON, Teacher,
Salvation Army Booth
Memorial Child Development
Center: OK.

35:42.440 --> 35:43.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What color is this?

35:43.842 --> 35:44.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILDREN: Yellow.

35:44.843 --> 35:47.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANEE WILSON: Yellow and white.

35:47.045 --> 35:51.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Chanee Wilson
teaches at
the Salvation Army's Child
Development Center

35:51.149 --> 35:54.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Oakland, California.

35:54.552 --> 36:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year, the center received a
top quality
rating from the state.

36:00.592 --> 36:01.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHERYL MURRAY, Program Director,
Salvation
Army Booth Memorial Child
Development Center:

36:01.593 --> 36:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our teachers are doing a really
good job.

36:04.362 --> 36:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not just baby-sitting.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're actually teaching.

36:08.733 --> 36:13.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But program
director Cheryl
Murray says, despite the high
rating, she

36:13.104 --> 36:16.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not able to pay her teachers
a livable
wage.

36:16.074 --> 36:18.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHERYL MURRAY: We're unable.

36:18.109 --> 36:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we pay them more, then we
wouldn't be able
to serve the families, and the
families really

36:22.514 --> 36:24.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need the service.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wish I could hit the lottery
and pay more
for them.

36:28.019 --> 36:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The center
serves low-income
families and gets 80 percent of
its funding

36:33.458 --> 36:35.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from state subsidies.

36:35.360 --> 36:39.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Families pay on a sliding scale
based on their
income, and teachers are paid
minimum wage

36:39.998 --> 36:43.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or slightly higher.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
One issue is staffing.

36:45.703 --> 36:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because they have younger
children, child
care classes require more
teachers than kindergarten.

36:53.144 --> 37:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chanee Wilson lives in Section 8
subsidized
housing with her two children
and receives

37:00.752 --> 37:03.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a small amount of money in food
stamps.

37:03.188 --> 37:04.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She makes $13.25 an hour.

37:04.856 --> 37:09.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHANEE WILSON: It's a struggle
every month
paycheck to paycheck.

37:09.694 --> 37:11.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have kids and you have
bills.

37:11.763 --> 37:17.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We more focus on the needs,
which is like
providing the roof over their
heads, the clothes,

37:17.535 --> 37:19.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then the food, and things like
that.

37:19.537 --> 37:22.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Her problem is
a common
one.

37:22.373 --> 37:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Labor experts say child care
workers all over
the country fail to earn a
livable wage.

37:27.145 --> 37:29.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCY WHITEBOOK, University of
California,
Berkeley: Early childhood jobs
are amongst

37:29.314 --> 37:31.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the lowest jobs across any
occupation.

37:31.282 --> 37:36.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Marcy
Whitebook is the director
of the Center for the Study of
Child Care

37:36.187 --> 37:38.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Employment at the University of
California,
Berkeley.

37:38.490 --> 37:45.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCY WHITEBOOK: Forty-six
percent of child
care workers are relying on some
type of federal

37:45.663 --> 37:47.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
income support.

37:47.398 --> 37:54.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The wages are so low that
somebody working
full-time isn't making a living
wage, and

37:54.105 --> 38:00.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what that means is that in order
to meet the
needs of their families, they
need to get

38:00.044 --> 38:01.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assistance.

38:01.813 --> 38:05.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Wilson has her
associate's
degree in early childhood
education and is

38:05.216 --> 38:08.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attending weekend and night
classes to earn
her bachelor's degree.

38:08.953 --> 38:12.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even with a bachelor's
degree, Wilson's
salary will still hover around
the minimum

38:12.824 --> 38:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wage, like lead teacher Laronda
Rainey (ph),
who earns $12.55 an hour.

38:18.363 --> 38:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To make ends meet, Rainey, who
has a bachelor's
degree, works as a security
guard at night.

38:22.700 --> 38:26.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHERYL MURRAY: I think most of
our teachers
here really teach from the
heart, because,

38:26.471 --> 38:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if their heart is not in it,
they wouldn't
be here, because of the wages.

38:30.275 --> 38:35.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCY WHITEBOOK: College
graduates who majored
in early childhood have the
distinction of

38:35.380 --> 38:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having the lowest lifetime
earnings compared
to any other degree.

38:39.817 --> 38:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's hardly a recruitment and
retention
strategy.

38:42.253 --> 38:47.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In fact,
Whitebook says
fewer and fewer colleges offer
early education

38:47.158 --> 38:50.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
degrees because students say
they can't make
a living with them.

38:50.528 --> 38:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Blue Skies for Children,
another high-quality
preschool in Oakland,
co-director Claire Bainer

38:55.867 --> 38:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can't find the skilled teachers
the program
strives to recruit.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE BAINER, Co-Director, Blue
Skies for
Children: It's very difficult.

39:02.073 --> 39:07.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year, especially with the
economy up,
people can get jobs, even with
our high minimum

39:07.645 --> 39:15.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wage, flipping burgers, and
working the parking
lot attendants and things like
that pay the

39:16.020 --> 39:19.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
same, and much easier work.

39:19.524 --> 39:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Teachers here
are paid more,
but Bainer says, on top of a
bachelor's degree,

39:26.431 --> 39:31.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she wants them to have extensive
training
in early education, and be good
critical thinkers.

39:31.569 --> 39:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE BAINER: Children are
learning to talk
and learning to negotiate.

39:34.672 --> 39:43.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's very important to have
an articulate,
smart teacher who knows how to
help the children

39:43.581 --> 39:45.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
develop those skills.

39:45.483 --> 39:51.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As a result,
the school,
which operates on parent fees
and fund-raising,

39:51.122 --> 39:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will increase their tuition this
fall.

39:52.991 --> 39:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAIRE BAINER: We can't hire
anybody at the
amount that we're paying the
teachers, so

39:57.095 --> 39:59.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have to do a fee increase.

39:59.464 --> 40:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That only translates to parents
paying more.

40:02.734 --> 40:03.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Poor parents.

40:03.768 --> 40:04.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's terrible.

40:04.802 --> 40:06.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a lot of money.

40:06.604 --> 40:12.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A recent study
by the Economic
Policy Institute reported infant
care in 33

40:12.443 --> 40:17.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states costs more than in-state
college tuition
and care for 4-year-olds exceeds
college tuition

40:17.882 --> 40:24.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in 24 states.

40:24.789 --> 40:30.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, early
educators say preschool
is increasingly valued, and
point to new science

40:30.495 --> 40:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about critical brain development
occurring
well before kindergarten.

40:33.731 --> 40:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCY WHITEBOOK: The care and
education of
young children before
kindergarten is just

40:39.070 --> 40:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as complex as teaching children
who are older.

40:44.075 --> 40:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we haven't restructured our
system and

HARI SREENIVASAN: For her part,
program director
Cheryl Murray wants her staff to
be compensated

40:55.753 --> 40:57.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
equal to what public school

CHERYL MURRAY: I believe they
should be paid

HARI SREENIVASAN: Even some
conservative think
tanks are exploring the idea of
expanding

program.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHARINE STEVENS, American
Enterprise Institute:
If we approach this in a smart,
efficient

41:17.975 --> 41:26.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, what we will be able to
accomplish is
getting the neediest kids off to
a good start.

41:26.984 --> 41:32.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If kids are arriving in
kindergarten better
prepared, ultimately, our K-12
system will

41:32.523 --> 41:33.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cost less.

41:33.524 --> 41:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will be reducing special ed
costs.

41:36.728 --> 41:40.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will be reducing grade
retention costs.

41:40.498 --> 41:47.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, throwing money at this
problem is
not going to assure us of that
kind of result.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Stevens
cautions that new
pre-K programs shouldn't repeat
the mistakes

41:52.243 --> 41:53.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of schooling for older children.

41:54.011 --> 42:00.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHARINE STEVENS: It would be a
really big
mistake to scale up huge new
public spending

42:00.718 --> 42:08.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
programs without any idea about
whether or
not those are going to be
effective, because

42:08.292 --> 42:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's going to be very difficult
to roll that
back.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Recently, the

42:46.364 --> 42:47.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's Jeffrey Brown.

42:47.432 --> 42:50.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "This book tells
many stories.

42:50.168 --> 42:55.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arguably, the most important is
the one we
as a people have trouble
embracing, the pervasiveness

42:55.139 --> 42:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a class hierarchy in the
United States."

42:57.975 --> 43:02.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That line comes from a new book
with the provocative
title "White Trash," which makes
a provocative

43:02.847 --> 43:07.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
argument that, from the nation's
earliest
history to now, ideals such as
opportunity

43:07.618 --> 43:11.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and upward mobility haven't
characterized
the lives of many Americans.

Author Nancy Isenberg is a
professor of history
at Louisiana State University.

43:16.661 --> 43:18.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY ISENBERG, Author, "White
Trash: The
400-Year Untold History of Class
in America":

43:19.096 --> 43:20.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, thanks for having me.

43:20.832 --> 43:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I think what hit
me most is
the idea that the poor have not
only been

43:22.567 --> 43:29.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accepted, but expected, that
it's a part of
our national DNA.

43:29.373 --> 43:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the argument you're
making?

43:31.275 --> 43:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY ISENBERG: Well, I think
one of the things
we forget is that, for half of
our history,

43:34.645 --> 43:36.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we were an agrarian nation.

43:36.347 --> 43:39.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, white trash really comes out
of notions
of rural poverty.

43:39.584 --> 43:46.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it goes all the way back to
British ideas,
because, in the colonial period
and well throughout

43:46.491 --> 43:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 19th century, the mark of
being a successful
American was being a property
owner.

43:51.896 --> 43:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we have forgotten is
that large numbers
of Americans didn't own
property.

43:56.100 --> 44:01.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For example, in Thomas
Jefferson's Virginia
at the time of the revolution,
40 percent

44:01.739 --> 44:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of white men were landless.

44:03.274 --> 44:07.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, when you
refer to white
trash, I just want to be clear.

44:07.178 --> 44:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea of white trash,
literally, the
term was used, the terms like
waste.

44:13.217 --> 44:15.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who do you mean?

44:15.119 --> 44:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY ISENBERG: Yes, the word
white trash,
at least as far as we have been
able to discover,

44:20.291 --> 44:23.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first appeared in newspaper
print in the 1820s.

44:23.494 --> 44:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it has a much older meaning,
because,
if we go back to some of the
leading promoters

44:28.499 --> 44:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of British colonization, when
they imagined
what were they going to do with
the new world,

44:33.137 --> 44:37.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the new world, first of all, was
imagined
as a wilderness, what they
called a wasteland.

44:37.842 --> 44:42.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was the perfect place for
literally
dumping the idle poor.

44:42.914 --> 44:45.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these were referred to as
waste people.

44:45.049 --> 44:49.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, those are the
beginnings,
but your argument is that that
has pervaded

44:49.387 --> 44:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to our own time, that we have
the national
myth of opportunity and social
mobility.

44:55.259 --> 45:00.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you saying that those don't
exist for
everyone, or that they don't
exist for one

45:00.231 --> 45:01.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
subset of people?

45:02.033 --> 45:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY ISENBERG: No, I think
there is clearly
-- you can find examples of
people who have

45:05.102 --> 45:08.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been able to rise up and improve
themselves.

45:08.239 --> 45:14.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The problem is that we
exaggerate the idea
that, at the time of the
revolution, we abandoned

45:14.045 --> 45:19.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the class system, we created an
exceptional
society, where we celebrated
upward mobility.

45:19.951 --> 45:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in fact, what the founders
like Franklin
and Jefferson really believed in
is similar

45:25.489 --> 45:32.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to what the British had in mind,
that the
poor would be allowed to move
into the frontier,

45:32.129 --> 45:36.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what was known as the southern
backcountry
and the old Northwest, and what
they were

45:36.601 --> 45:40.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really promising was horizon
mobility, not
upward mobility.

45:40.972 --> 45:47.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And land then, as
you say,
was the key factor, not
education, not energy

45:47.545 --> 45:48.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or earning.

45:48.946 --> 45:50.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But what about now?

45:50.348 --> 45:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY ISENBERG: I would say that
land is still
extremely important.

45:53.217 --> 45:55.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Class has a geography.

45:55.186 --> 45:59.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we think about the way most
Americans live
-- and the other measure of
class that I highlight

45:59.757 --> 46:01.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is homeownership.

46:01.692 --> 46:05.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're poor, the same way
they have different
names for the poor, they have
different names

46:05.696 --> 46:11.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for what they live in, a shack,
a shebang,
or if we talk about trailer
trash.

46:11.736 --> 46:15.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What we live in today, we live
in class-zoned
neighborhoods.

46:15.539 --> 46:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have taken into account the
importance
of racial segregation, and we
know that history,

46:21.078 --> 46:25.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but we also live in
neighborhoods that are
divided by class.

46:25.249 --> 46:29.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you live in a better
neighborhood,
you have more amenities, you
have better infrastructure,

46:29.553 --> 46:31.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
better schools.

46:31.355 --> 46:36.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so geography still plays a
very important
part, and land -- owning a house
is a very

46:36.761 --> 46:39.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important measure of being a
member of the
middle class.

46:39.230 --> 46:43.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I know you wrote
the book before
we got into the politics of the
current campaign,

46:43.801 --> 46:48.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but how do you see class driving
our politics
today?

46:48.039 --> 46:52.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY ISENBERG: I don't see
Donald Trump and
the issues brought up by Bernie
Sanders as

46:52.743 --> 47:01.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that surprising, because at
crucial moments
when politicians are involved,
they do use

47:01.852 --> 47:02.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
class language.

47:02.953 --> 47:07.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do heighten and emphasize
class distinctions.

47:07.158 --> 47:11.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that gets pulled -- we get
pulled in two
directions there, too, because,
sometimes,

47:11.662 --> 47:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politicians like to say, we are
all in the
middle class, or we all have
ambition to be

47:15.766 --> 47:19.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the middle class, or we're
all capable
of being in the middle class.

47:19.170 --> 47:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's when they want to sort of
draw from
the more positive script.

47:22.406 --> 47:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at other times, I talk
about key politicians
who use class as a way to
mobilize political

47:31.482 --> 47:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
divisions or to accentuate
political divisions
in our country.

47:34.885 --> 47:39.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you
briefly, if
you could, does anything at all
that you have

47:39.557 --> 47:43.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
studied through history give you
any hope
that there's -- that we could
lessen these

47:43.828 --> 47:45.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of class divisions in the
country?

47:45.763 --> 47:50.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY ISENBERG: Our history
forces us to confront
things that at times we don't
want to deal

47:50.901 --> 47:51.869 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

47:51.902 --> 47:53.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We would prefer to have the
myth.

47:53.904 --> 47:59.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I actually think it's
healthy if we can
get to the point where we can
talk about class,

47:59.110 --> 48:04.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just use it as a slogan, not
just use
it as political rhetoric, but
actually to

48:04.215 --> 48:08.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think about it more deeply and
to think about
how it affects who we are.

48:08.419 --> 48:12.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I often like to refer to the
musical "My
Fair Lady."

48:12.156 --> 48:17.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We judge people by the way
they're dressed,
by the way they talk, by the
unwritten codes

48:17.428 --> 48:19.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of class behavior.

48:19.230 --> 48:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is "White
Trash: The 400-Year Untold
History of Class

48:23.000 --> 48:24.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

Nancy Isenberg, thank you very

HARI SREENIVASAN: We all know
that a dog can
detect smells far better than
humans can,

48:41.886 --> 48:43.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but do you know why?

48:43.721 --> 48:47.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our science producer Nsikan
Akpan has the
answer in the latest edition of
"ScienceScope."

48:47.491 --> 48:53.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Meet Zinca, the
rescue dog.

48:53.464 --> 48:55.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dogs are relentless smellers.

48:55.132 --> 48:59.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their noses can catch a scent
from a mile
away, five times farther than we
are.

48:59.703 --> 49:04.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These pooches can follow a smell
for hundreds
of miles, which allows them to
save lost people

49:04.475 --> 49:06.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or catch bad guys.

49:06.210 --> 49:09.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are millions of reasons
why the canine
sense of smell is better than
ours.

49:09.480 --> 49:14.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to tackle all of
them in the
next three minutes.

49:14.351 --> 49:18.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ready, set, sniff.

49:18.422 --> 49:22.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's start by hopping inside a
dog's nose.

49:22.326 --> 49:24.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Whee.

49:24.762 --> 49:28.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One key to a canine's super
snout is its long
and intricate nasal cavity.

49:28.399 --> 49:31.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCIA JACOBS, University of
California, Berkeley:
It's like a little cathedral
inside your nose

49:31.769 --> 49:32.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
full of these bones.

49:32.870 --> 49:35.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Allow me to
introduce Lucia
Jacobs.

49:35.506 --> 49:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a neuroscientist at the
University of
California at Berkeley.

49:38.242 --> 49:41.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she's absolutely obsessed
with how dog
noses work.

49:41.245 --> 49:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCIA JACOBS: There's all these
intricate
bony plates that they're all --
they're bending

49:46.250 --> 49:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's called turbinates, which
control how
air moves through the nose.

49:50.721 --> 49:54.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Turbinates create
a labyrinth
of folds and corridors that
filter odors towards

49:54.925 --> 49:58.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different parts of a dog's nose,
T-bone steak
lands here.

49:58.128 --> 49:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A neighbor's cat lands there.

49:59.730 --> 50:02.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the same time, dog seem to
smell in stereo.

50:02.233 --> 50:04.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their two nostrils sniff at
different rates.

50:04.068 --> 50:08.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they can tell whether or not
your gym socks
are to the left or to the right.

50:08.172 --> 50:11.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This leads to some pretty funky
behavior,
like circling.

50:11.041 --> 50:16.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LUCIA JACOBS: Olfactory
navigators circle
when they lose -- they have got
the scent,

50:16.914 --> 50:20.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they don't know, is it going
off in a
different direction?

50:20.317 --> 50:24.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: In our last
episode of "ScienceScope,"
we showed you how an odor isn't
a uniform

50:24.388 --> 50:25.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cloud.

50:25.890 --> 50:28.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its shape is scraggly and wild,
and its portions
are stretched like taffy.

50:28.626 --> 50:30.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sitting inside an odor plume
doesn't tell
you much.

50:30.661 --> 50:32.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're surrounded by a jumbled
mess.

50:32.563 --> 50:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But traveling along the edge of
an odor gives
you context and direction.

50:36.400 --> 50:37.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's why dogs circle.

50:37.401 --> 50:39.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're looking for the edge.

50:39.236 --> 50:44.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCIA JACOBS: And so what they
do is, they
do a circle to pick up, where is
it strongest?

50:44.642 --> 50:47.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then they will start
exploring in that
direction.

50:47.144 --> 50:49.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Remember those
millions of reasons
I promised?

50:49.480 --> 50:53.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A dog has 300 million smell
sensors, which
are also known as olfactory
receptors, inside

50:53.851 --> 50:55.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of it nose.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Humans only have five million.

50:57.755 --> 50:59.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Wah-wah.

50:59.490 --> 51:03.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many think dogs are great
sniffers because
of all of those smell sensors,
but Jacobs

51:03.060 --> 51:04.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disagrees.

51:04.862 --> 51:07.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her theory is, the strength of
an animal's
sense of smell depends on the
size of its

51:07.798 --> 51:09.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
habitat.

51:09.566 --> 51:12.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Her idea starts with the
olfactory bulb, a
relay station just above the
nose that sends

51:12.536 --> 51:14.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
smell information deeper into
the brain.

51:14.705 --> 51:19.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUCIA JACOBS: In carnivores,
like wolves and
coyotes and foxes, and if you
look at the

51:19.476 --> 51:23.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
size of their home range, the
olfactory bulb
scales with the size of their
home range.

51:23.380 --> 51:27.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: They modern human,
in contrast,
relies on smells for short
distances, which

51:27.551 --> 51:29.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may explain why human olfactory
systems are
smaller.

51:29.954 --> 51:30.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hey, do you smell that?

51:31.021 --> 51:34.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Smells like cookies in the break
room.

51:34.792 --> 51:39.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will be right back.

51:40.030 --> 51:42.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Oh, man.

51:42.132 --> 51:44.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, where were we?

51:44.134 --> 51:48.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, but Jacobs believes, deep
down, all animals
react to smells the same way.

51:48.205 --> 51:53.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her lab is testing this theory
in a cornucopia
of species, dogs, human, hermit
crabs, two

51:53.377 --> 51:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
types of cockroaches, and the
leopard slug.

51:55.579 --> 51:57.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LUCIA JACOBS: They all move in
the same way.

51:57.648 --> 51:59.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They all track odors in the same
way.

51:59.450 --> 52:02.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we think there's got to be a
common algorithm
that they're all using.

52:02.853 --> 52:06.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Jacobs is part of
a nationwide
team trying to code those smell
algorithms

52:06.824 --> 52:07.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into robots.

52:07.992 --> 52:09.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's all for now.

52:09.426 --> 52:11.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm Nsikan Akpan, and this is
"ScienceScope"
from the "PBS NewsHour."

52:12.029 --> 52:17.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Didn't know
there were science
-- nose algorithms or smell
algorithms, what

52:17.534 --> 52:18.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he was talking about.

52:18.535 --> 52:19.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:19.970 --> 52:21.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm never going
to look at
a dog's nose the same way.

52:21.739 --> 52:24.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You can watch
our first
"ScienceScope" episode online on
our Science

52:24.208 --> 52:26.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
page at PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:26.043 --> 52:30.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also on the
"NewsHour" online
right now: what's it like to
swim next to

52:30.948 --> 52:32.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Michael Phelps.

52:32.816 --> 52:38.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One columnist remembers the
record-smashing
Olympian as a 12-year-old
athlete, still years

52:38.355 --> 52:42.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away from fame, but already
showing signs
of greatness.

52:42.126 --> 52:44.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:44.828 --> 52:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And a quick
correction before
we go tonight.

52:47.731 --> 52:51.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier in the news summary, we
said followers
of Anjem Choudary, one of
Britain's most high-profile

52:51.335 --> 52:55.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radical Muslim preachers, were
linked to last
year's beheading of a British
soldier.

52:55.272 --> 52:57.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That incident actually happened
back in 2013.

52:57.975 --> 52:59.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We apologize for the error.

52:59.510 --> 53:01.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:01.345 --> 53:04.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wednesday, Miles O'Brien
takes us to the
edge of the most studied volcano
in the world.

53:04.915 --> 53:05.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:05.916 --> 53:07.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

evening.

53:09.319 --> 53:15.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

53:15.559 --> 53:19.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
