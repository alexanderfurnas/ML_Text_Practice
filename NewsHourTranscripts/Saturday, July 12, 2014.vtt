WEBVTT

00:01.133 --> 00:04.033
ON THIS EDITION FOR SATURDAY,
JULY 12TH,

00:04.100 --> 00:04.967
ISRAEL DESTROYS A MOSQUE IN GAZA
THAT IT SAYS WAS LOADED WITH

00:05.033 --> 00:07.067
WEAPONS.

00:07.133 --> 00:10.967
AND INTERCEPTS HAMAS
ROTHLISBERGER OVER TEL AVIV.

00:11.033 --> 00:12.533
WE'LL HAVE A REPORT FROM ISRAEL.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.033
A LEADING MILITARY ANALYST
WEIGHS IN ON THAT CONFLICT AND
THE

00:16.100 --> 00:20.067
INTENSE NEW FIGHTING IN THE
UKRAINE.

00:20.133 --> 00:24.067
AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,
PREPARING FOR THE INEVITABLE.

00:24.133 --> 00:27.967
THE YEAR AFTER SOMEBODY PASSES
IS ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:28.033 --> 00:35.067
TIMES FOR IDENTITY THEFT.

00:35.133 --> 00:48.067
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:48.133 --> 00:52.033
FROM THE TISSUE STUDIOS AT
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK.

00:52.100 --> 00:54.033
GOOD EVENING, THANKS FOR JOINING
US.

00:54.100 --> 00:58.067
THE LATEST ROUND OF MIDDLE
EASTERN VIOLENCE TRIGGERED BY THE

00:58.133 --> 01:00.000
KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF THOSE
THREE JEWISH TEENAGERS

01:00.067 --> 01:03.200
ESCALATED AGAIN TODAY.

01:03.267 --> 01:09.200
TONIGHT ISRAEL SAID ITS IRON
DOME SYSTEM INTERCEPTED THREE

01:09.267 --> 01:15.200
ROCKETS FIRED OVER TEL AVIV AND
THREE OTHERS NEAR JERUSALEM.

01:15.267 --> 01:17.133
EARLIER TODAY ISRAELI BOMBS
DESTROYED A MOSQUE ON THE GAZA

01:17.200 --> 01:20.200
STRIP.

01:20.267 --> 01:21.500
ISRAEL SAID WEAPONS WERE BEING
STORED THERE.

01:21.567 --> 01:24.167
AT LEAST 135 PALESTINIANS HAVE
DIED DURING THE RECENT FIGHTING.

01:24.233 --> 01:30.067
FOR THE LATEST WE ARE JOINED
ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT FROM JERUSALEM

01:30.133 --> 01:36.067
VIA SKYPE BY JOSEF FEDERMAN.

01:36.133 --> 01:38.067
WHAT ISRAEL SAYS IS THE AREA WAS
USED TO STORE ROCKETS AND

01:38.133 --> 01:40.133
OTHER WEAPONS.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.067
THIS HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE, I
THINK FOR ISRAEL FROM DAY ONE.

01:44.133 --> 01:46.100
IT SAYS THAT A LOT OF THE
WEAPONS IT'S TACKING ARE HIT NOT

01:46.167 --> 01:47.067
GUILTY CIVILIAN AREAS LIKE
MOSQUES, SCHOOLS,

01:47.133 --> 01:52.167
RES TERRIBLE AREAS,

01:52.233 --> 01:54.067
AND IT SAYS IT IS TAKING
PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID DAMAGE TO
THESE

01:54.133 --> 01:58.133
BUILDINGS AND TO CIVILIANS,

01:58.200 --> 02:01.200
BUT IT IS STILL SOMETIMES THESE
ATTACKS TAKE PLACE.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.233
WHAT ABOUT THE PACE OF ROCKET
FIRE FROM GAZA?

02:03.300 --> 02:06.200
THE SITUATION IN THE SOUTH WAS A
LITTLE MORE CALM IN SOUTHERN

02:06.267 --> 02:10.200
ISRAEL, THE HARDEST HIT AREA.

02:10.267 --> 02:13.233
THAT SAID, THERE IS STILL DOZENS
OF ROCKETS TODAY,

02:13.300 --> 02:16.267
I THINK OVER 60 THE LAST TIME I
CHECKED,

02:16.333 --> 02:19.233
INCLUDING ONE THAT SET UP AIR
RAID SIRENS HERE IN JERUSALEM.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.200
AND WHAT MORE ARE WE HEARING
ABOUT THE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES IN

02:21.267 --> 02:24.167
GAZA?

02:24.233 --> 02:26.267
WELL THE DEATH TOLL NOW,

02:26.333 --> 02:29.267
OVERALL IN THIS OPERATION HAS
EXCEEDED 125,

02:29.333 --> 02:31.200
I THINK IT IS UP TO 127 AT THIS
POINT.

02:31.267 --> 02:34.133
BUT MANY, DOZENS, WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW THE EXACT NUMBER,

02:34.200 --> 02:38.200
MANY OF THE DEAD ARE CIVILIANS.

02:38.267 --> 02:41.200
IN SOME DAYS RELATIVES OF MEN
WHO WERE TARGETED BY ISRAEL.

02:41.267 --> 02:44.200
AND OTHER TIMES, IT IS
ACCIDENTAL.

02:44.267 --> 02:47.133
AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS
ALWAYS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR

02:47.200 --> 02:50.167
ISRAEL, BECAUSE OF THE LANDSCAPE
IN GAZA.

02:50.233 --> 02:53.167
YOU ARE DEALING WITH A VERY
DENSELY POPULATED URBAN LANDSCAPE

02:53.233 --> 02:55.100
WHERE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
PINPOINT,

02:55.167 --> 02:58.167
AS HARD AS ISRAEL TRIES,

02:58.233 --> 03:00.133
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO AVOID
THESE TYPE OF CASUALTIES.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.300
SO TODAY, FOR EXAMPLE,

03:03.367 --> 03:05.333
WE SAW AN ATTACK THAT HIT A
CENTER FOR THE DISABLED,

03:05.400 --> 03:08.333
AND TWO WOMEN WHO WERE SEVERELY
DISABLED WERE KILLED.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.333
IS THERE AN ACTIVE CONVERSATION
OR DEBATE HAPPENING IN ISRAELI

03:10.400 --> 03:13.267
SOCIETY ABOUT HOW LONG THIS
OPERATION SHOULD TAKE?

03:13.333 --> 03:15.267
YEAH.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.300
THERE SEEMS TO BE.

03:17.367 --> 03:22.267
THERE ARE SIGNS THAT DIPLOMACY
IS STARTING TO TAKE HOLD.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.300
WE SEE A MEETING OF THE SECURITY
COUNCIL TODAY CALLING ON

03:24.367 --> 03:27.333
ISRAEL OR CALLING ON BOTH SIDES
FOR A CEASEFIRE.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.300
AND AN INTERESTING STATEMENT
CAME OUT OF LONDON FROM THE

03:31.367 --> 03:35.300
BRITISH FOREIGN MINISTER ALSO
CALLING FOR AN IMMEDIATE

03:35.367 --> 03:39.267
CEASEFIRE EXPRESSING CONCERNS
ABOUT CIVILIAN CASUALTIES ON THE

03:39.333 --> 03:40.267
PALESTINIAN SIDES AND ANNOUNCING
A NUMBER OF HIS COUNSELOR

03:40.333 --> 03:44.333
PARTS,

03:44.400 --> 03:45.267
INCLUDING JOHN KERRY WILL BE
MEETING TOMORROW TO DISCUSS

03:45.333 --> 03:48.333
CEASEFIRE EFFORTS.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.333
EVEN IF THERE ARE THESE OPTION
TO HIS MEDIATE A SETTLEMENT

03:51.400 --> 03:53.333
WHETHER FROM THE U.S. OR ARAB
LEAGUE,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.333
WOULD PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU
CONSIDER THIS?

03:55.400 --> 03:58.333
I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH HIS
OFFICE,

03:58.400 --> 04:01.467
I HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO ISRAELI
OFFICIALS ALL DAY.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.400
THEY SAY IT CAN GO IN EITHER
DIRECTION.

04:03.467 --> 04:06.467
THEY ARE READY TO KEEP ON
POUNDING TARGETS IN GAS.

04:06.533 --> 04:09.467
ISRAEL SAYS IT IS GOING TO KEEP
ON PUSHING FORWARD,

04:09.533 --> 04:13.433
NOT GOING TO BE DETERRED BY
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE.

04:13.500 --> 04:16.467
BUT WHEN ALL OF ITS ALLIES START
GANGING UP AND SAYING ENOUGH

04:16.533 --> 04:19.467
IS ENOUGH, IT IS GOING TO HAVE
TO LISTEN.

04:19.533 --> 04:21.467
I THINK OVER THE NEXT DAY OR
TWO,

04:21.533 --> 04:23.400
YOU ARE GOING TO SEE MORE OF
THAT.

04:23.467 --> 04:24.400
JOSEF FEDERMAN, THANKS SO MUCH.

04:24.467 --> 04:26.467
THANK YOU.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.400
TRY TO PUT THE LATEST ROUND OF
FIGHTING BETWEEN ISRAEL AND

04:28.467 --> 04:32.367
HAMAS IN A BROADER CONTEXT,

04:32.433 --> 04:34.400
WE ARE JOINED TONIGHT BY ANTHONY
CORDESMAN OF THE CENTER FOR

04:34.467 --> 04:36.400
STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL
STUDIES IN WASHINGTON.

04:36.467 --> 04:40.400
CORDESMAN PREVIOUSLY SERVED IN
THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND WAS

04:40.467 --> 04:41.333
THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE
ASSESSMENT IN THE OFFICE OF THE

04:41.400 --> 04:43.400
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

04:43.467 --> 04:48.333
SO LET'S TRY IT LAY OUT THE
OPTIONS FOR BOEING SIDES HERE.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.300
LET --BOTH SIDES HERE.

04:50.367 --> 04:52.400
THE ISRAELI SIDE.

04:52.467 --> 04:58.400
THE ISRAELIS AT THIS POINT HAVE
FLOWN WELL OVER 1000 SORT TIS.

04:58.467 --> 05:00.333
WITH AIR POWER THEY CAN GO ON
BUT IT IS A SLOW PROCESS OF

05:00.400 --> 05:03.533
ATTRITION.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.433
THE PALESTINIANS AND HAMAS HAVE
HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO RELOCATE

05:05.500 --> 05:08.467
AND MOVE.

05:08.533 --> 05:11.500
THEY CAN NOW, ALSO,

05:11.567 --> 05:14.500
LAUNCH A GROUND DEFENSIVE AND
THAT CAN TAKE TWO FORMS.

05:14.567 --> 05:15.467
ONE WOULD BE A LIMITED GROUND
DEFENSIVE AIMED AT HAMAS TARGETS

05:15.533 --> 05:19.533
OUTSIDE THE CITIES,

05:19.600 --> 05:20.433
THE OTHER WOULD BE ONE WHICH
WOULD TRY TO TAKE CONTROL OF

05:20.500 --> 05:24.533
POPULATED AREAS,

05:24.600 --> 05:27.500
WHICH WOULD MEAN A LOT MORE
FIGHTING BUT GIVE THEM DIRECT

05:27.567 --> 05:30.467
CONTROL OVER THE GOVERNMENT, THE
STRUCTURE INSIDE GAZA.

05:30.533 --> 05:34.433
THE PROBLEM WITH BOTH OF THOSE
OFFENSES IS THAT THEY WOULD

05:34.500 --> 05:37.367
HAVE TO STAY THERE FOR A
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME,

05:37.433 --> 05:41.433
AT A MINIMUM, TO HAVE AN IMPACT.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.467
CONTROL A VERY LARGE PALESTINIAN
POPULATION.

05:43.533 --> 05:48.433
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH STOPPING
IS,

05:48.500 --> 05:54.433
THEY PROBABLY HAVE NOT REAL WHEN
I INTIMIDATED HAMAS -- REALLY

05:54.500 --> 05:59.433
INTIMIDATED HAMAS ENOUGH TO MAKE
IT STOP FOR A LONG PERIOD OF

05:59.500 --> 06:00.367
TIME AND MOST ISRAELI ESTIMATES
ARE THE ROCKETS ARE STILL

06:00.433 --> 06:04.600
THERE AND NOT DESTROYED.

06:04.667 --> 06:07.533
WHAT ABOUT THE OPTIONS FOR
HAMAS?

06:07.600 --> 06:12.567
HAMAS'S OPTIONS ARE LIMITED.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.567
THEY HAVE TRIED LIMITED RAIDS
OUTSIDE THE GAZA.

06:14.633 --> 06:17.600
THEY HAVE FAILED, FRANKLY
BECAUSE SECURITY IS TOO TIGHT.

06:17.667 --> 06:21.567
THEY CAN KEEP LAUNCHING ROCKETS
AND THEY HAVE DONE THAT AT

06:21.633 --> 06:26.633
LEAST OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, IN
SPITE OF ALL THE AIR STRIKES.

06:26.700 --> 06:30.500
BUT THESE HAVE MORE OF A
PSYCHOLOGICAL THAN A MILITARY
EFFECT.

06:30.567 --> 06:35.500
BASICALLY THEY KEEP SENDING
SIGNALS TO ISRAEL THAT HAMAS CAN

06:35.567 --> 06:39.600
STRIKE DEEP BUT THEY ARE NOT
LETHAL OR ACCURATE ENOUGH TO HIT

06:39.667 --> 06:40.433
KEY TARGETS AND SO FAR THEY
HAVEN'T PRODUCED EITHER
CASUALTIES

06:40.500 --> 06:44.500
OR MEANINGFUL STRATEGIC RESULTS.

06:44.567 --> 06:47.500
HAMAS CAN DECLARE A CEASEFIRE,
REGROUP,

06:47.567 --> 06:51.533
TRY TO CAPITALIZE ON THE
FIGHTING POLITICALLY,

06:51.600 --> 06:53.467
ACCUSE ISRAEL OF WAR CRIMES AND
A WHOLE LITANY OF CHARGES THEY

06:53.533 --> 06:57.500
HAVE MADE IN THE PAST,

06:57.567 --> 07:00.567
BUT THAT HAS NOT GIVEN HAMAS ANY
REAL BENEFITS, TO DATE.

07:00.633 --> 07:03.567
THE ONE THING THAT IS
POTENTIALLY OMINOUS IS THERE HAVE
BEEN

07:03.633 --> 07:07.500
STRIKES FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM
LEBANON.

07:07.567 --> 07:08.767
EVIDENTLY FROM HEZBOLLAH.

07:08.833 --> 07:13.567
NOW A TWO FRONT WAR WOULD HAVE A
VERY DIFFERENT CHARACTER,

07:13.633 --> 07:16.600
AND THE MISSILES IN HEZBOLLAH --
MISSILES IN HEZBOLLAH HANDS

07:16.667 --> 07:20.533
ARE MORE ACCURATE AND MORE
LETHAL.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.567
WHAT ABOUT THE COSTS HERE?

07:23.633 --> 07:25.533
THESE AIR STRIKES OVER TIME COST
HUMAN LIVES AND CASUALTIES AS

07:25.600 --> 07:28.567
WELL.

07:28.633 --> 07:32.467
THE HUMAN LIVES AND CASUALTIES
ARE VERY SERIOUS.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.500
YOU HAVE OVER 100 DEAD,

07:34.567 --> 07:36.500
OVER 600 WOUNDED AND THE NUMBERS
KEEP COUNTING.

07:36.567 --> 07:40.467
BUT THE THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT
GAZA IS,

07:40.533 --> 07:41.433
THAT THOSE DIRECT CASUALTIES ARE
ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE

07:41.500 --> 07:44.500
PROBLEM.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.467
THE 1.8 MILLION PEOPLE, ACTUALLY
MORE THAN THAT,

07:46.533 --> 07:49.467
MOST OF THEM ARE VERY YOUNG.

07:49.533 --> 07:52.533
IT IS A VERY YOUNG POPULATION.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.467
THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN ISOLATED
FOR YEARS,

07:55.533 --> 07:58.467
AS A RESULT OF THE LAST ROUND OF
FIGHTING.

07:58.533 --> 08:01.600
THE SCHOOLS, THE MEDICAL
SERVICES,

08:01.667 --> 08:04.667
THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES ARE
TERRIBLE.

08:04.733 --> 08:09.667
AND YOU SEE, BASICALLY, THAT IN
THE AREA AROUND GAZA,

08:09.733 --> 08:10.600
YOU HAVE A PER CAPITA INCOME
WHICH IS ABOUT HALF THAT ON THE

08:10.667 --> 08:13.600
WEST BANK.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.667
YOU HAVE FAR LESS DEVELOPMENT,

08:16.733 --> 08:18.667
THIS IS A PROBLEM WHERE EVERY
ROUND OF FIGHTING DOES MORE

08:18.733 --> 08:20.600
DAMAGE TO THE PALESTINIANS AND
GAZA.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.633
YES.

08:22.700 --> 08:25.633
AND THE QUESTION ALWAYS FOR
HAMAS IS,

08:25.700 --> 08:28.633
CAN YOU GET THE PEOPLE TO PUT UP
WITH THIS?

08:28.700 --> 08:32.600
CAN YOU KEEP THEM FOCUSED AND
ANGRY AT ISRAEL?

08:32.667 --> 08:37.600
OR DO THEY BECOME FOCUSED AND
ANGRY AT YOU?

08:37.667 --> 08:40.500
ANTHONY CORDESMAN, THANKS SO
MUCH.

08:40.567 --> 08:43.600
IN KABUL,

08:43.667 --> 08:46.567
AFGHANISTAN AFTER A SECOND DAY
OF PROTRACTED TALKS SECRETARY

08:46.633 --> 08:48.600
OF STATE JOHN KERRY ANNOUNCED
THERE WILL BE AN INTERNATIONALLY

08:48.667 --> 08:50.600
SUPERVISED AUDIT OF THE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THERE.

08:50.667 --> 08:55.567
BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE AGREED TO
ABIDE BY THE RESULTS.

08:55.633 --> 08:59.600
THE NATION'S FOREIGN MINISTER
ABDULLAH TRAILED

08:59.667 --> 09:00.600
FINANCE MINISTER ASHRAM GHANI
AHMADZAI AFTER THE RECENT RUN

09:00.667 --> 09:02.733
OFF ELECTION.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.700
BUT ABDULLAH CLAIMED THERE WAS
SIGNIFICANT FRAUD.

09:04.767 --> 09:07.733
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS
BROUGHT CHARGES AGAINST A CHINESE

09:07.800 --> 09:09.667
BUSINESSMAN ACCUSED OF HACKING
COMPUTERS AND STEALING

09:09.733 --> 09:12.667
SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM U.S.

09:12.733 --> 09:13.733
DEFENSE CONTRACTORS.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.700
INCLUDING BOEING AND LOCKHEED
MARTIN.

09:15.767 --> 09:19.733
SOME OF WHAT WAS ALLEGEDLY
STOLEN HAD TO DO WITH TWO OF THE

09:19.800 --> 09:24.733
UNITED STATES'S MOST ADVANCED
FIGHTER JETS THE F-22 AND F-35.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.633
THE ACCUSED MAN IS CURRENTLY IN
CANADA BUT IS EXPECTED TO BE

09:26.700 --> 09:28.700
EXTRADITED TO THE UNITED STATES.

09:28.767 --> 09:32.600
AFTER A RECENT LULL, THE
CONFLICT IN EASTERN UKRAINE,

09:32.667 --> 09:36.667
ONCE AGAIN, IS INTENSIFYING.

09:36.733 --> 09:41.633
UKRANIAN GOVERNMENT TROOPS ARE
AMASSING NEAR DONESTK,

09:41.700 --> 09:44.633
A CITY OF A MILLION PEOPLE FOR A
LIKELY GROUND OFFENSIVE

09:44.700 --> 09:48.600
AGAINST RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS WHO
RETREATED THERE.

09:48.667 --> 09:50.667
THIS,

09:50.733 --> 09:51.600
A DAY AFTER THE REBELS KILLED
MORE THAN 20 GOVERNMENT TROOPS

09:51.667 --> 09:52.667
IN A MISSILE ATTACK.

09:52.733 --> 09:55.667
FOR MORE ABOUT THE SITUATION
THERE,

09:55.733 --> 09:58.667
WE ARE ONCE AGAIN JOINED BY
ANTHONY CORDESMAN.

09:58.733 --> 10:01.667
SO WHAT ARE THE PRO RUSSIAN
SEPARATISTS'S CHANCES WITHOUT

10:01.733 --> 10:04.633
RUSSIAN INVOLVEMENT?

10:04.700 --> 10:05.667
THEY SEEM TO BE LIMITED.

10:05.733 --> 10:08.667
THEY ARE STILL NOT UNIFIED.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.667
THEY ARE NOW CONCENTRATED IN ONE
MAJOR URBAN AREA.

10:10.733 --> 10:14.733
THEY, AT LEAST,

10:14.800 --> 10:17.733
ARE COMPLAINING THAT THEY ARE
RUNNING OUT OF AMMUNITION,

10:17.800 --> 10:21.733
RUNNING OUT OF SUPPLIES, THEY
HAVE MONEY PROBLEMS,

10:21.800 --> 10:22.633
THEIR WEAPONS SIMPLY DON'T
COMPETE IN ANY SENSE WITH THE

10:22.700 --> 10:25.733
UKRANIAN FORCES.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.733
AND THESE DO NOT SEEM TO BE THE
KIND OF TRAINED FORCES,

10:28.800 --> 10:31.667
IN ANY SENSE, THAT EXISTED IN
THE CRIMEA.

10:31.733 --> 10:35.667
MANY OF THEM SEEM TO BE PEOPLE
WITH NO REAL MILITARY

10:35.733 --> 10:39.600
BACKGROUND OR CAPABILITY FOR
FIGHTING YOUR REGULAR WARFARE.

10:39.667 --> 10:42.633
THE PROBLEM IS, HOWEVER, FOR THE
UKRANIAN FORCES,

10:42.700 --> 10:46.667
MOVING INTO URBAN WARFARE IS A
MASSIVE PROBLEM.

10:46.733 --> 10:48.733
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE
POPULATION.

10:48.800 --> 10:53.633
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
BUILDINGS, YOU HAVE VERY SHORT
AREAS,

10:53.700 --> 10:58.667
RANGES, LINE OF SIGHT WHERE YOUR
HEAVY WEAPONS ARE HARD TO USE.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.667
SO IT IS A PROBLEM FOR BOTH
SIDES.

11:00.733 --> 11:05.800
IN BALANCE, HOWEVER,

11:05.867 --> 11:09.800
THE EVIDENCE SEEMS TO BE THAT
RUSSIA IS PULLING BACK,

11:09.867 --> 11:10.700
IT IS NOT ACTIVELY SUPPORTING
THE PRO RUSSIAN FORCES,

11:10.767 --> 11:13.800
THE INDEPENDENCE FORCES.

11:13.867 --> 11:19.767
IT SEEMS TO BE MOVING TOWARD A
POSITION WHERE, BASICALLY,

11:19.833 --> 11:21.733
IT CAN LEAVE THE UKRAINE IN A
STATE OF ALMOST CONSTANT TENSION

11:21.800 --> 11:26.800
IN THE EAST, POOR,

11:26.867 --> 11:27.700
WITHOUT ENOUGH AID FROM THE
OUTSIDE TO HELP ITS ECONOMY

11:27.767 --> 11:31.700
RECOVER,

11:31.767 --> 11:32.667
AND ESSENTIALLY FIGHT MORE OF A
POLITICAL THAN A MILITARY

11:32.733 --> 11:34.733
BATTLE.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.700
BRIEFLY WHAT ABOUT THE LONGER
ECONOMIC COSTS TO UKRAINE IF

11:37.767 --> 11:41.667
RUSSIA WANTS TO INCREASE NATURAL
GAS PRICES?

11:41.733 --> 11:43.733
AS THEY SAY THEY DO?

11:43.800 --> 11:45.667
WELL THE NATURAL GAS PRICES
RUSSIA HAS PROPOSED WOULD
BANKRUPT

11:45.733 --> 11:48.700
THE COMPANY.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.733
BUT THEN THE COUNTRY IS ALREADY
BANKRUPT.

11:50.800 --> 11:54.700
ONE THING TO REMEMBER ABOUT THE
UKRAINE IS IT HAS HAD ONE OF

11:54.767 --> 11:55.667
THE WORST GOVERNMENTS OF ANY OF
THE COUNTRIES IN EASTERN

11:55.733 --> 11:58.733
EUROPE.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.733
IT HAS SEEN A STEADY DECLINE IN
DEVELOPMENT,

12:00.800 --> 12:01.867
HAS FAILED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF
THE PEOPLE TO EITHER IMPROVE

12:01.933 --> 12:03.800
SERVICES OR ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT.

12:03.867 --> 12:06.867
UH-HUH.

12:06.933 --> 12:07.800
SO YOU HAD A CRISIS POINT THAT
LED TO THE OVERTHROW OF THE

12:07.867 --> 12:14.800
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT,

12:14.867 --> 12:15.800
AND IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO KEEP
THE UKRAINE VERY POOR AND

12:15.867 --> 12:18.867
VERY UNSTABLE.

12:18.933 --> 12:21.867
ANTHONY CORDESMAN, THANKS SO
MUCH.

12:21.933 --> 12:25.867
THE FDA IS WARNING A POPULAR
LAPAROSCOPIC SURGICAL PROCEDURE

12:25.933 --> 12:29.767
TO REMOVE FIBROIDS AND PERFORM
HISTORY RESPECT MS.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.800
.

12:31.867 --> 12:32.733
MIGHT SPREAD UNDETECTED CANCER
CELLS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE

12:32.800 --> 12:34.800
BODY.

12:34.867 --> 12:37.733
THE PROCESS KNOWN AS
MORCELLATION INVOLVES ELECTRONIC
TOOLS TO

12:37.800 --> 12:40.733
GRIND DOWN FIBROIDS.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.733
IT REQUIRES A SMALLER INCISION,

12:43.800 --> 12:44.700
CAUSES LESS PLEADING AND
TYPICALLY MEANS LESS TIME IN THE

12:44.767 --> 12:46.767
HOSPITAL.

12:46.833 --> 12:50.767
AN FDA ADVISORY PANEL SAYS WOMEN
SHOULD BE PRESENTED WITH A

12:50.833 --> 12:54.767
CONSENT FORM ADVISING THEM OF
THE RISK.

12:54.833 --> 13:01.933
A NEW MEDICAL STUDY CONDUCTED BY
EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AT HARVARD

13:02.000 --> 13:03.867
FOUND MEN THAT UNDERGO
VASECTOMIES ARE 20% MORE LIKELY
TO DIE

13:03.933 --> 13:07.933
OF PROSTATE CANCER.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.900
AT RISK ARE THOSE WHO HAVE THE
PROCEDURE BEFORE THEIR MID-30S.

13:10.967 --> 13:12.833
THE STUDY WAS PUBLISHED LAST
MONDAY IN THE JOURNAL OF CLINICAL

13:12.900 --> 13:14.933
ONCOLOGY.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.900
AMAZON.COM IS FEUDING WITH THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT.

13:16.967 --> 13:20.900
LAST MONTH IN AN EFFORT TO
PROTECT THE OWNERS OF INDEPENDENT

13:20.967 --> 13:24.933
BOOKSTORES THE FRENCH PARLIAMENT
PASSED A BILL MAKING IT

13:25.000 --> 13:28.867
ILLEGAL FOR ONLINE RETAILERS TO
SHIP BOOKS FOR FREE.

13:28.933 --> 13:32.867
NOW AMAZON SAYS IT WILL SHIP ITS
BOOKS THERE FOR A SINGLE

13:32.933 --> 13:36.933
EUROPEAN CENT.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.933
ITS DECISION IT SAYS WILL
GUARANTEE THE LOWEST PRICE
POSSIBLE

13:43.000 --> 13:43.833
NOT LAST SURVIVING ORIGINAL
MEMBER OF THE BAND THE RAMONES

13:43.900 --> 13:46.867
HAS DIED.

13:46.933 --> 13:50.933
DRUMMER TOMMY RAMONES WAS 65.

13:51.000 --> 14:12.000
IT WAS INDUCTED INTO THE ROCK N
ROLL HALL OF FAME 12 YEARS AGO.

14:12.067 --> 14:13.433
AND NOW TO OUR SIGNATURE
SEGMENT.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.033
TONIGHT SOMETHING YOU MIGHT NOT
HAVE GIVEN A LOT OF THROAT TO,

14:16.100 --> 14:19.067
BUT INEVITABLY WILL AFFECT THOSE
CLOSEST TO YOU.

14:19.133 --> 14:21.967
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HELPING
YOUR LOVED ONES CLEAN UP YOUR

14:22.033 --> 14:26.033
DIGITAL FOOTPRINT AFTER YOU DIE.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.133
IT'S BECOMING A MORE AND MORE
COMPLICATED JOB.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.967
THERE ARE NEARLY 4 BILLION
REGISTERED E-MAIL ACCOUNTS AND
MORE

14:32.033 --> 14:34.933
THAN A BILLION FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS
WORLDWIDE.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.967
IN THE U.S. ALONE,

14:37.033 --> 14:37.900
MORE THAN HALF OF ADULTS ARE NOW
USING THE INTERNET FOR

14:37.967 --> 14:39.933
BANKING.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
AND ACCORDING TO ONE STUDY,

14:43.067 --> 14:47.000
NEARLY HALF OF BILLS ARE PAID
ONLINE.

14:47.067 --> 14:48.933
BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THAT
ONLINE INFORMATION AFTER WE ARE

14:49.000 --> 14:51.933
GONE?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.033
THE DIGITALLY DEPARTED.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.000
DO YOU HAVE AN E-MAIL ACCOUNT?
A FACEBOOK PAGE?

14:56.067 --> 14:58.000
DO YOU BANK ONLINE?
SHOP ONLINE?

14:58.067 --> 15:00.967
PAY YOUR GAS, LIGHT OR CABLE TV
BILL OVER THE INTERNET?

15:01.033 --> 15:03.033
I HAVE JUST LAID OUT MORE THAN A
HALF DOZEN ACCOUNTS MANY OF

15:03.100 --> 15:06.067
US HAVE.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.133
LIKELY EACH WITH ITS OWN
PASSWORD.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.133
THESE ACCOUNTS DON'T DIE WITH
US.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.067
THE PASSWORDS TO EACH OF THEM
ARE OFTENTIMES LOCKED AWAY WITH

15:12.133 --> 15:15.100
ONLY ONE PERSON, THE DECEASED.

15:15.167 --> 15:20.133
WHICH MEANS THAT VALUABLE ONLINE
ASSETS COULD BE LOST FOREVER.

15:20.200 --> 15:24.133
OR BE FOUND BY THOSE LOOKING TO
EXPLOIT THEM.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.100
TAKE THE CASE OF GLENN
WILLIAMSON.

15:27.167 --> 15:29.133
A TECH ENTREPRENEUR IN PORTLAND,
OREGON.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.000
TWO YEARS AGO HE GOT THE WORST
NEWS POSSIBLE.

15:31.067 --> 15:34.067
I WAS IN THE PHILIPPINES
SPEAKING AT A CONFERENCE.

15:34.133 --> 15:37.067
WHEN YOUR PHONE GOES OFF 15
TIMES AND IT IS 3:00 IN THE

15:37.133 --> 15:41.000
MORNING IN THE UNITED STATES,
YOU HAVE A BAD FEELING.

15:41.067 --> 15:44.067
GLENN'S 73-YEAR-OLD MOTHER, LEE,
HAD DIED.

15:44.133 --> 15:47.033
AS HER FIDUCIARY AND AS A 25
YEAR VETERAN OF THE TECH WORLD,

15:47.100 --> 15:51.033
IT FELL TO HIM TO MANAGE HER
ONLINE ACCOUNTS.

15:51.100 --> 15:54.067
I KNEW MY MOM, BEING A COOL
GRANDMA, WAS ON TWITTER.

15:54.133 --> 15:57.967
I KNEW SHE HAD A YAHOO ACCOUNT
SO WE HAD A BASELINE TO START.

15:58.033 --> 16:01.033
BUT THAT IS ALL WE KNEW.

16:01.100 --> 16:04.133
Reporter: AFTER 20 HOURS OF
SEARCHING GLENN FOUND 13 ACCOUNTS

16:04.200 --> 16:06.133
BELONGING TO HIS MOTHER,
INCLUDING E-MAIL,

16:06.200 --> 16:09.167
SOCIAL MEDIA AND SHOPPING
ACCOUNTS.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.133
SO WE BROKE IT DOWN INTO
CATEGORIES.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.167
TRAVEL, SENTIMENTAL, SECURITY,

16:13.233 --> 16:16.133
AND BASICALLY WE SEARCHED ON
ABOUT 75 DIFFERENT SITES.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.167
Reporter: SOME HAD REAL VALUE.

16:18.233 --> 16:21.167
AFTER GOING THROUGH ALL THE
AIRLINES,

16:21.233 --> 16:25.200
UNITED DID INDEED HAVE MY MOM AS
A CUSTOMER,

16:25.267 --> 16:26.133
AND THERE WAS 54,000 MILES THAT
WE WERE ABLE TO RETRIEVE FOR

16:26.200 --> 16:28.133
OUR FAMILY.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.133
Reporter: ALL THIS, WHILE HE WAS
GRIEVING.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.033
IT IS A PAINFUL, LONG PROCESS.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.200
AND EVERYBODY MEANS WELL.

16:33.267 --> 16:35.033
BUT IF ONE MORE PERSON TELLS YOU
THEY ARE SORRY,

16:35.100 --> 16:40.100
IT IS LIKE OKAY,

16:40.167 --> 16:43.133
I JUST NEED TO KNOW DID SHE HAVE
AN ACCOUNT OR NOT?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.133
WILLIAMSON AND HIS WIFE ARE
ONLINE SAVVY,

16:45.200 --> 16:47.067
RELATIVELY YOUNG AND IT WAS
TOUGH TO FIND ALL THE ACCOUNTS.

16:47.133 --> 16:50.067
THE AVERAGE PERSON,

16:50.133 --> 16:51.067
ESPECIALLY IF THE AVERAGE PERSON
IS IN THEIR 60s,

16:51.133 --> 16:54.100
IT IS A VERY,

16:54.167 --> 16:57.133
VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS -E
GLENN'S PROBLEMS MANAGING HIS

16:57.200 --> 16:58.067
MOTHER'S ONLINE ESTATE HELPED
INSPIRE HIM TO START A BUSINESS

16:58.133 --> 17:01.100
SOLUTION CALLED WEB CEASE.

17:01.167 --> 17:04.133
AN ONLINE SERVICE THAT HELPS
PEOPLE SEARCH FOR THEIR DECEASED

17:04.200 --> 17:08.200
LOVED ONE'S DIGITAL ASSETS.

17:08.267 --> 17:10.133
IT USES BASIC INFORMATION AND
FINDS THE MAJOR ONLINE ACCOUNTS

17:10.200 --> 17:13.200
LINKED TO IT.

17:13.267 --> 17:17.200
AND ALTHOUGH IT WON'T SHUT DOWN
AN ACCOUNT FOR YOU,

17:17.267 --> 17:18.100
IT WILL TELL YOU WHAT CAN BE
DONE UNDER A WEBSITE'S SPECIFIC

17:18.167 --> 17:21.167
TERMS OF SERVICE.

17:21.233 --> 17:25.200
MY MOM HAD AN ASSET INVENTORY OF
FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS BUT NOT OF

17:25.267 --> 17:26.133
ALL THINGS DIGITAL AND THAT IS
REALLY WHAT WE PROVIDE TO THE

17:26.200 --> 17:29.167
FAMILY.

17:29.233 --> 17:35.133
IS WE PROVIDE THEM AT A HIGH
LEVEL, A DIGITAL ASSET INVENTORY.

17:35.200 --> 17:38.067
SO YOU CAN SAY MY MOM WAS ON
AMAZON AND ITUNES.

17:38.133 --> 17:39.467
THAT IS THE VALUE.

17:39.533 --> 17:43.133
Reporter: WEB CEASE IS ONE OF A
HANDFUL OF WEBSITES THAT HAS

17:43.200 --> 17:47.133
SPRUNG UP OVER THE LAST FEW
YEARS.

17:47.200 --> 17:51.100
SITES LIKE NAVIGATOR, CAPSULE,
MY CYBER SAFE AND AFTER NOTE,

17:51.167 --> 17:52.067
ALL OF THEM TRYING TO TACKLE
WHAT IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY

17:52.133 --> 17:55.033
COMMON PROBLEM.

17:55.100 --> 17:58.133
NOWADAYS,

17:58.200 --> 18:02.167
EVERYONE KEEPS THEIR FILING
CABINETS ON THEIR COMPUTERS,

18:02.233 --> 18:03.167
AND THEY MAY NOT HAVE SHARED
ACCESS TO THAT WITH THEIR

18:03.233 --> 18:04.467
FAMILIES.

18:04.533 --> 18:05.200
SUZANNE WALSH IS AN ESTATE
LAWYER FROM WEST HARTFORD,

18:05.267 --> 18:07.267
CONNECTICUT.

18:07.333 --> 18:10.267
I HAVE RECEIVED PANICKED CALLS
FROM FAMILY MEMBERS WHO DON'T

18:10.333 --> 18:14.267
KNOW PASSWORDS, DON'T KNOW THE
NATURE OF THE ONLINE ACCOUNTS,

18:14.333 --> 18:15.200
THEY SIMPLY KNOW MOM PAID BILLS
ONLINE AND TELEMAY NOT EVEN BE

18:15.267 --> 18:19.233
SURE ABOUT THE BANK.

18:19.300 --> 18:23.267
Reporter: WALL SAYS THE MAIN
PROBLEM IS ONE OF ACCESS.

18:23.333 --> 18:26.167
IN MANY CASES WE HAVE MADE IT
VIRTUALLY ILLEGAL FOR ANYONE

18:26.233 --> 18:29.233
ELSE TO USE OUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.133
IT STARTS WITH THOSE TERMS OF
SERVICE AGREEMENT THE FINE PRINT

18:31.200 --> 18:33.167
OF THE ONLINE WORLD.

18:33.233 --> 18:35.133
ONCE THE I AGREE BUTTON IS
PRESSED,

18:35.200 --> 18:38.133
IT IS AS GOOD AS A CONTRACT.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.133
MANY OF THEM PROHIBIT THE
SHARING OF PASSWORDS AND PROHIBIT

18:40.200 --> 18:42.133
THIRD PARTY ACCESS.

18:42.200 --> 18:45.167
SO RIGHT NOW,

18:45.233 --> 18:46.100
THEY TEND TO BAR ANYBODY BUT THE
ACCOUNT HOLDER ACCESSING THE

18:46.167 --> 18:48.200
ACCOUNT.

18:48.267 --> 18:50.200
THAT MEANS EVEN IF THE ACCOUNT
HOLDER IS DEAD.

18:50.267 --> 18:51.133
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS SAY
THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE LETTER

18:51.200 --> 18:56.200
OF THE LAW,

18:56.267 --> 18:59.200
AS SPELLED OUT IN THE 1986
STORED COMMUNICATIONS ACT,

18:59.267 --> 19:00.133
WHICH PROHIBITS ANYONE FROM
ACCESSING PRIVATE INFORMATION

19:00.200 --> 19:04.333
ONLINE WITHOUT PERMISSION.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.267
THE PROBLEM WITH FIDUCIARY
ACCESS NOW IS,

19:08.333 --> 19:09.267
IT MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL
PRIVACY LAW OR A COMPUTER

19:09.333 --> 19:12.300
FRAUD AND ABUSE ACT.

19:12.367 --> 19:15.267
IT MAY BE AN ACTUAL CRIMINAL ACT
TO VIOLATE THE TERMS OF

19:15.333 --> 19:18.300
SERVICE AGREEMENT.

19:18.367 --> 19:22.333
BUT BEING UNABLE TO ACCESS OR
SHUT DOWN A DECEASED LOVED ONE'S

19:22.400 --> 19:27.267
ACCOUNT COULD HAVE UNFORESEEN
RISKS.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.667
AS WILLIAMSON WILL TELL YOU.

19:28.733 --> 19:31.167
THE YEAR AFTER SOMEBODY PASSES
IS ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE

19:31.233 --> 19:34.200
TIMES FOR IDENTITY THEFT.

19:34.267 --> 19:36.200
IT IS A HEINOUS CRIME.

19:36.267 --> 19:40.267
WHAT THE BAD GUYS DO,

19:40.333 --> 19:41.167
THEY'LL GO OUT THERE AND COMB
FOR RECENTLY DECEASE AND CREATE

19:41.233 --> 19:43.200
A FAKE IDENTITY.

19:43.267 --> 19:48.233
BECAUSE THE DECEASED DON'T CHECK
E-MAILS OR GET THE MAIL.

19:48.300 --> 19:52.200
EVERY YEAR MORE THAN 2 MILLION
AMERICANS ARE VICTIMS OF

19:52.267 --> 19:56.267
IDENTITY FRAUD AFTER DEATH.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.267
THIEVES CAN APPLY FOR LOANS, OR
EVEN FILE FALSE TAX RETURNS.

19:58.333 --> 20:01.200
MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION CAN BE
FOUND ON THE INTERNET THROUGH

20:01.267 --> 20:04.233
SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A
SHOPPING ACCOUNT.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.333
TO DATE,

20:06.400 --> 20:07.233
ONLY SEVEN STATES HAVE ANY LAWS
ON THE BOOKS GOVERNING ONLINE

20:07.300 --> 20:09.267
ESTATE PLANNING.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.333
SUZANNE WALSH,

20:12.400 --> 20:15.333
WHO CHAIRS A COMMITTEE ON THE
UNIFORM LAW COMMISSION,

20:15.400 --> 20:17.333
AN ORGANIZATION WHICH DRAFTS
LAWS IT HOPES TO STANDARDIZE IN

20:17.400 --> 20:20.233
ALL 50 STATES, IS HOPING TO
CHANGE THAT.

20:20.300 --> 20:24.400
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS,

20:24.467 --> 20:29.300
WALSH'S COMMITTEE HAS BEEN
DRAFTING THE FIDUCIARY ASSETS
ACT.

20:29.367 --> 20:33.267
WHICH IS GIVING THE FIDUCIARY
RISE THE SAME RIGHTS OVER ONLINE

20:33.333 --> 20:37.200
ESTATES AS THEY NOW HAVE OVER
TRADITIONAL ESTATES.

20:37.267 --> 20:39.200
THAT USED TO MEAN OPENING UP THE
MAILBOX,

20:39.267 --> 20:43.267
OPENING UP THE FILE CABINET,

20:43.333 --> 20:44.167
GOING THROUGH THE DESK OF THE
OUR ACT IS DESIGNED TO CONTINUE

20:44.233 --> 20:47.267
THAT AND FACILITATE THAT,

20:47.333 --> 20:49.267
GIVEN THE DIFFERENT NATURE OF
THE DIGITAL ASSETS.

20:49.333 --> 20:52.267
THE BILL IS CURRENTLY BEING
REVIEWED BY THE UNIFORM LAW

20:52.333 --> 20:56.200
COMMISSION AND WILL BE VOTED ON
FOR APPROVAL ON WEDNESDAY.

20:56.267 --> 20:57.500
AFTER THAT,

20:57.567 --> 20:59.233
IT WILL BE UP TO THE STATE
LEGISLATURES TO PROPOSE IT.

20:59.300 --> 21:04.400
ON AVERAGE, CURRENT ACTS
APPROVED BY THE U LC,

21:04.467 --> 21:06.333
HAVE ACHIEVED ENACTMENT IN A
LITTLE MORE THAN 20 DIFFERENT

21:06.400 --> 21:10.333
STATES AND TERRITORIES.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.300
BUT SUZANNE WALSH IS HOPEFUL THE
LEGISLATION WILL BE MORE

21:12.367 --> 21:15.400
WIDELY RECEIVED.

21:15.467 --> 21:17.400
WIDESPREAD ENACTMENT IS OUR
PRIMARY GOAL.

21:17.467 --> 21:20.400
CERTAINLY WE HOPE AND EXPECT IT
WON'T TAKE MORE THAN A YEAR OR

21:20.467 --> 21:23.300
TWO FOR MOST STATES TO ADOPT
THIS PRODUCT.

21:23.367 --> 21:26.400
FOR NOW,

21:26.467 --> 21:28.367
THERE ARE STEPS PEOPLE CAN TAKE
IT MAKE THE PROCESS OF DIGITAL

21:28.433 --> 21:30.400
ESTATE MANAGEMENT EASIER ON NEXT
OF KIN.

21:30.467 --> 21:33.267
FIRST CREATE AN INVENTORY LIST
OF ALL YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS AND

21:33.333 --> 21:36.333
PASSWORDS FOR YOUR FIDUCIARY.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.333
STIPULATE WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR
E-MAIL ACCOUNTS IN A WILL,

21:39.400 --> 21:44.333
AND READ THE TERMS OF SERVICE
AGREEMENTS,

21:44.400 --> 21:46.267
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW OR
EVEN IF ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNTS

21:46.333 --> 21:49.333
CAN BE GRANTED TO SOMEONE ELSE.

21:49.400 --> 21:54.400
GLENN WILLIAMSON SAYS NO MATTER
WHAT STEPS YOU TAKE OR WHAT

21:54.467 --> 21:57.300
LAWS ARE PASSED MANAGING A
DIGITAL ESTATE FOR A LOVED ONE
WILL

21:57.367 --> 22:01.367
ALWAYS BE A LONG, ARDUOUS AND
PAINFUL PROCESS.

22:01.433 --> 22:07.400
TO LEARN HOW TO BETTER MANAGE
YOUR OWN DIGITAL ESTATE,

22:07.467 --> 22:14.433
VISIT NEWSHOUR PBS.ORG.

22:14.500 --> 22:22.400
THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND
SATURDAY.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.467
THIS COMING TUESDAY,

22:24.533 --> 22:26.500
FRONT LINE PREMIERES A PROGRAM
CALLED SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL.

22:26.567 --> 22:31.333
IT EXAMS HOW PARENTS AND
BUSINESS LEADERS FROM BATON
ROUGE,

22:31.400 --> 22:34.400
LOUISIANA ARE TRYING TO CREATE A
NEW CITY BECAUSE OF THEIR

22:34.467 --> 22:38.333
FRUSTRATION WITH MANY OF THEIR
SCHOOL'S POOR PERFORMANCE.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.733
HERE'S AN EXCERPT.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.333
IF MARTIN LUTHER KING WERE TO
COME BACK AND SEE WHERE WE ARE

22:40.400 --> 22:45.367
NOW,

22:45.433 --> 22:47.367
I THINK HE WOULD BE SHOCK TO SEE
THE SCHOOLS ARE MORE

22:47.433 --> 22:50.400
SEGREGATED THAN THEY WERE WHEN
HE DIED.

22:50.467 --> 22:53.333
THE PROFESSOR SAYS A SERIES OF
SUPREME COURT RULINGS HAVE

22:53.400 --> 22:55.400
ERODED MUCH OF THE PROGRESS MADE
SINCE THE LANDMARK BROWN

22:55.467 --> 22:58.400
VERSUS THE BOARD OF EDUCATION
DECISION 60 YEARS AGO.

22:58.467 --> 23:02.467
THE SUPREME COURT REALLY BEGAN
TO TURN BACKWARDS DECISIVELY ON

23:02.533 --> 23:07.467
DESEGREGATION IN 1991.

23:07.533 --> 23:09.533
SO BASICALLY,

23:09.600 --> 23:10.433
THAT BEGAN THE DISMANTLING OF
DESEGREGATION PLANS ACROSS THE

23:10.500 --> 23:11.800
COUNTRY.

23:11.867 --> 23:14.467
AND ALMOST ALL OF THE LARGER
ONES HAVE BEEN DISMANTLED IN OUR

23:14.533 --> 23:17.567
BIG CITIES.

23:17.633 --> 23:22.533
IN BATON ROUGE, THE
DESEGREGATION ORDER WAS LIFTED IN
2003.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.533
THE STUDENT POPULATION IS NOW
11% WHITE,

23:25.600 --> 23:28.500
AND MANY IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
ARE CONCERNED THAT NUMBER WILL

23:28.567 --> 23:31.500
DROP EVEN LOWER IF THE ST.
GEORGE PROPOSAL SUCCEEDS.

23:31.567 --> 23:34.433
THAT IS NOT FAIR TO THE CHILDREN
WHO REMAIN BEHIND.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.533
Reporter: BELINDA DAVIS,

23:37.600 --> 23:38.433
A LOCAL ACTIVIST WITH THREE
CHILDREN IN THE BATON ROUGE

23:38.500 --> 23:42.500
SCHOOLS,

23:42.567 --> 23:43.467
IS VOWING TO PREVENT THE
CREATION OF THE NEW CITY OF ST.

23:43.533 --> 23:44.833
GEORGE.

23:44.900 --> 23:47.533
YOU WERE AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO
BE CREATING A CITY THAT IS

23:47.600 --> 23:51.567
LESS DIVERSE THAN THE ONE YOU
ARE LEAVING.

23:51.633 --> 23:53.467
AND WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF
SPECIALIZED SERVICES IN SCHOOLS
THAT

23:53.533 --> 23:56.500
WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE,

23:56.567 --> 23:58.467
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF OUR
SCHOOL DISTRICT.

23:58.533 --> 24:02.567
I MEAN, THIS IS ABOUT LIVES,

24:02.633 --> 24:04.667
THERE IS ABOUT POTENTIAL THAT WE
ARE SQUASHING BY CONTINUING

24:04.733 --> 24:07.633
TO CARVE UP OUR SCHOOL
DISTRICTS,

24:07.700 --> 24:10.667
THAT WE COULD DO WONDERFUL
THINGS TOGETHER.

24:10.733 --> 24:19.667
WE ARE STRONGER AS ONE THAN WE
ARE BROKEN UP INTO PIECES.

24:19.733 --> 24:27.667
THE FORMER BRITISH LEADER TONY
BLAIR MET IN CAIRO TODAY WITH

24:27.733 --> 24:30.567
EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT IN AN EFFORT
TO END PROBLEMS WITH

24:30.633 --> 24:35.500
ISRAEL AND HAMAS.

24:35.567 --> 24:37.567
IN IRAQ,

24:37.633 --> 24:39.567
GOVERNMENT FORCES AND SLIGHT
MILITIAS ARE BATTLING FOR CONTROL

24:39.633 --> 24:41.567
OF A MILITARY BASE 60 MILES
NORTH OF BAGHDAD.

24:41.633 --> 24:44.500
GUNMEN KILLED AT LEAST 20 PEOPLE
IN THE CAPITAL TODAY,

24:44.567 --> 24:47.600
ALMOST ALL WOMEN.

24:47.667 --> 26:04.733
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU BACK HERE
TOMORROW NIGHT.
