GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.539 --> 00:07.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.507 --> 00:12.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: candidates'
last pitches to voters before
Super Tuesday.

00:12.379 --> 00:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk with Amy Walter and
Tamara Keith about
what's at stake.

00:16.350 --> 00:22.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead:
Moderates and reformists
score big wins in Iran's
elections, raising

00:22.589 --> 00:27.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions about what change is
possible under
a powerful hard-line leadership.

00:27.561 --> 00:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And "Spotlight" wins
the top prize
at the Oscars. We examine the
state of today's

00:33.367 --> 00:35.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigative journalism.

00:35.235 --> 00:37.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTY BARON, Executive Editor,
The Washington
Post: Clearly, it's going to be
more difficult,

00:37.437 --> 00:42.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given that there are fewer
resources to do
it. This is very expensive work
to do. And

00:42.709 --> 00:45.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yet we have to commit ourselves
to doing it.

00:45.245 --> 00:53.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.453 --> 00:56.323 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.356 --> 01:06.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: It was
no-holds-barred on the
presidential campaign today,
underscoring

01:06.967 --> 01:10.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the all-important races on tap
tomorrow, Super
Tuesday.

01:10.804 --> 01:17.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as tensions flared, the
Republican race
was thrown into uproar again.

01:17.110 --> 01:22.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Donald Trump, barreling
toward tomorrow's
big voting day with the wind at
his back in

01:22.883 --> 01:28.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost all 13 of the Super
Tuesday states.
Today, in Southwestern Virginia,
the Republican

01:28.855 --> 01:32.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
front-runner boasted his
campaign is on a
nonstop roll.

01:32.459 --> 01:35.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Republicans have a hard time,
because, structurally,

01:35.462 --> 01:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have to win Pennsylvania,
you have to
win Ohio, you have to -- you
know, they have

01:38.966 --> 01:44.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like a map of in particular six
states. And
you lose one, it's over. The
Democratic ride

01:44.938 --> 01:46.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a much easier ride.

01:46.673 --> 01:50.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if I pick up New York, or if
I pick up
Michigan, it's over, folks. It's
over. It's

01:50.544 --> 01:51.078 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:52.879 --> 01:57.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But his speech was
interrupted
today by protesters representing
the Black

01:57.784 --> 01:59.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lives Matter movement.

01:59.586 --> 02:06.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Get them out of
here, please.
All right, folks, you're going
to hear it

02:07.027 --> 02:08.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
once. All lives matter.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:10.364 --> 02:15.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Party leaders
denounced his refusal
yesterday to reject support from
white supremacist

02:15.068 --> 02:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
groups, including the KKK and
David Duke.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, just so you
understand,
I don't know anything about
David Duke. OK?

02:22.009 --> 02:26.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know anything about what
you're even
talking about with white
supremacy or white

02:26.580 --> 02:28.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supremacists.

02:28.415 --> 02:32.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In a tweet, the
Republicans' last
presidential nominee, Mitt
Romney, called

02:32.085 --> 02:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's words -- quote -- "a
disqualifying
and disgusting response."

02:37.324 --> 02:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While Donald Trump traveled in
Virginia, which
has 49 delegates at stake,
Florida Senator

02:42.396 --> 02:50.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marco Rubio cast a wider net for
the 174 delegates
up for grabs in Tennessee,
Georgia and Arkansas.

02:50.904 --> 02:56.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio, in a stop in Atlanta,
also knocked
Trump for his comments
yesterday.

02:56.276 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
Honestly, you know our country,
you know your

02:59.713 --> 03:04.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
neighbors, you know your family
and you know
your friends. Do you really
believe that those

03:04.051 --> 03:07.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- that they're going to vote
for someone
who refuses to disavow the Ku
Klux Klan?

03:07.421 --> 03:09.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: No.

03:09.222 --> 03:11.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Do you think
they're going
to vote for someone with a
record like his?

03:11.291 --> 03:12.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AUDIENCE: No!

03:13.026 --> 03:16.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: They're not.
That means
we're going to lose. That means
the winner

03:16.596 --> 03:18.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this election will be Hillary
Clinton.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AUDIENCE: No!

03:20.667 --> 03:24.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Ted Cruz, who
spent today
in his home state of Texas,
piled on as well.

03:24.771 --> 03:30.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With 155 delegates at stake
there, the Lone
Star State is Super Tuesday's
biggest prize.

03:30.877 --> 03:37.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz took aim at the practices
of a Trump-owned
club in Florida, one that he
said turned aside

03:37.417 --> 03:39.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American workers looking for
jobs.

03:39.886 --> 03:45.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Now, listen, that's not a whole
lot different,

03:45.625 --> 03:52.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Donald's doing, than a
whole lot of other
big companies. But you don't get
to abuse

03:52.065 --> 03:57.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and take advantage of American
workers, and
then suddenly style yourself a
champion for

03:57.637 --> 03:59.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American workers.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The heated
Republican rhetoric
became the focus today on the
Democratic campaign

04:03.143 --> 04:08.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trail as well. Hillary Clinton,
fresh off
her nearly 50-point victory in
South Carolina,

04:08.882 --> 04:10.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weighed in this morning from
Massachusetts.

04:10.851 --> 04:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
What we need to do now is make
America whole,

04:14.688 --> 04:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working together, rejecting the
mean-spiritedness,
the hateful rhetoric, the
insults. That's

04:25.499 --> 04:26.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not who we are.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:28.435 --> 04:32.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Bernie Sanders,
in Minneapolis,
spent more time taking on Trump
than he did

04:32.906 --> 04:34.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

04:34.908 --> 04:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
We will defeat Mr. Trump,
because the American

04:38.145 --> 04:44.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people believe that community,
working together
trumps selfishness.

04:44.251 --> 04:46.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:46.553 --> 04:54.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: And, most
importantly,
we will defeat Mr. Trump because
the American

04:54.594 --> 04:58.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people understand, and always
have, that love
trumps hatred.

04:59.032 --> 05:00.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:00.834 --> 05:05.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tomorrow is likely
to provide
a definitive turning point for
both parties.

05:05.372 --> 05:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a thorough look at
the Republican
and Democratic races after the
news summary.

05:10.477 --> 05:14.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news, the
United States secretary-general
pronounced

05:14.681 --> 05:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the three-day-old truce in Syria
is holding,
by and large. But Syrian
government forces

05:21.121 --> 05:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continued airstrikes in Hama and
ground assaults
near Aleppo and elsewhere.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the main opposition group
warned, the
U.S. and U.N. have to intervene.

05:31.097 --> 05:34.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SALIM AL-MUSLAT, High
Negotiations Committee:
Are they aware of the violations
there? I

05:34.901 --> 05:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe there has to be a
mechanism to really
stop this violation on the
ground for -- to

05:40.874 --> 05:44.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
encourage others to go and sit
on the table
and negotiate.

05:44.244 --> 05:49.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Washington,
the White House
said it's too early to assign
blame for the

05:49.282 --> 05:51.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
truce violations.

05:51.051 --> 05:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Iraq, Shiites
were hit hard
again by a suicide bombing that
killed at

05:55.889 --> 06:02.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
least 40 people northeast of
Baghdad. Meanwhile,
the death toll rose to 73 after
Sunday's twin

06:02.462 --> 06:07.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suicide bombings in the Iraqi
capital. Islamic
State militants claimed
responsibility for

06:08.001 --> 06:09.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that attack.

06:09.869 --> 06:15.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Anger boiled over
today among
Iraqi and Syrian refugees
stranded at Greece's

06:15.108 --> 06:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
northern border with Macedonia.
They have
run into restrictions as they
try to head

06:19.879 --> 06:21.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deeper into Europe.

06:21.414 --> 06:24.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Geraint Vincent of Independent
Television
News reports.

06:24.818 --> 06:29.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GERAINT VINCENT: In the
footsteps of thousands
who came before them, the people
followed

06:29.889 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the railway line north towards
the border,
but this morning, the path was
blocked. Young

06:40.066 --> 06:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men at the front of the crowd
demanded access.
It wasn't given. So they decided
to gain it

06:49.976 --> 06:51.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

06:51.811 --> 06:56.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Battering rams were created out
of what they
found along the way. When the
signposts didn't

06:56.616 --> 07:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work, they got hold of something
bigger. The
gate was forced open and the
crowd came face

07:05.225 --> 07:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to face with the police line.
With the stones
bouncing off their riot shields,
the police

07:14.601 --> 07:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decide to respond with tear gas.

07:17.604 --> 07:23.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One officer steps forward and
fires the first
canister straight into the
crowd. It falls

07:23.443 --> 07:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back, but the man in the blue
hooded top is
undeterred. The next canister
hits him in

07:29.949 --> 07:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the chest. The police followed
up the tear
gas with stun grenades. Now the
crowd can't

07:39.426 --> 07:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
move back quickly enough.

07:41.294 --> 07:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Behind the young men at the
front, there were
families and children, their
rucksacks packed

07:47.334 --> 07:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the journey north. Now
they're just trying
to escape the gas which is
stinging their

07:57.143 --> 08:06.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eyes and burning their throats.
So, it's back
to where they began this
morning, a transit

08:06.519 --> 08:10.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
camp meant for 2,000 people
which is now home
to 10,000.

08:10.623 --> 08:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Across Europe,
fire broke out
as crews began dismantling a
huge migrant

08:16.663 --> 08:22.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
camp in Calais, France.
Activists fought with
police at the site, where some
4,000 people

08:22.969 --> 08:24.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had been living.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, at the Supreme
Court, Justice Clarence Thomas
did something

08:29.008 --> 08:35.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had not done in 10 years of
oral arguments:
He spoke. He asked a string of
questions during

08:35.382 --> 08:40.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a case about gun rights. It was
the first
time he's participated from the
bench since

08:40.120 --> 08:42.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
February 22, 2006.

08:42.322 --> 08:47.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Across the city
of Washington,
at the White House, a solemn
ceremony today

08:47.494 --> 08:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to honor U.S. Navy SEAL Edward
Byers. He was
presented with the nation's
highest military

08:53.900 --> 08:56.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decoration.

08:56.603 --> 09:02.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been some 40 years since a
president
bestowed the Medal of Honor on a
living active-duty

09:02.642 --> 09:07.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
member of the U.S. Navy, and
only five other
SEALs have received one.

09:07.747 --> 09:12.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Today's ceremony is truly
unique: a rare opportunity

09:12.485 --> 09:19.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the American people to get a
glimpse of
a special breed of warrior that
so often serves

09:19.092 --> 09:20.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the shadows.

09:20.894 --> 09:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Edward Byers was
a senior chief
special warfare operator on the
elite SEAL

09:26.065 --> 09:33.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Team Six that rescued an
American hostage
in Eastern Afghanistan in
December 2012. Dr.

09:33.873 --> 09:39.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dilip Joseph had been working
for an aid organization
when the Taliban kidnapped him.

09:39.279 --> 09:43.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Our SEALs rushed
to the doorway,
which was covered by a layer of
blankets.

09:43.616 --> 09:50.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ed started ripping them down,
exposing himself
to enemy fire. A teammate, the
lead assaulter,

09:50.790 --> 09:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pushed in and was hit. Fully
aware of the
danger, Ed moved in next. An
enemy guard aimed

09:56.830 --> 09:59.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his rifle right at him. Ed
fired.

09:59.365 --> 10:06.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That first SEAL,
Petty Officer
1st Class Nicolas Checque, died
of his wounds,

10:06.606 --> 10:08.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but Byers saved Dr. Joseph.

10:08.675 --> 10:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Ed leapt across
the room and
threw himself on the hostage,
using his own

10:12.779 --> 10:18.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
body to shield him from the
bullets. Another
enemy fighter appeared, and with
his body,

10:18.384 --> 10:23.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ed kept shielding the hostage.
With his bare
hands, Ed pinned the fighter to
the wall and

10:23.223 --> 10:25.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
held him until his teammates
took action.

10:25.758 --> 10:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After today's
ceremony, however,
outside the White House, Byers
said the real

10:31.564 --> 10:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
credit goes to his comrades.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SR. CHIEF EDWARD BYERS, Medal of
Honor Recipient:
If it wasn't for that team, I
wouldn't be

10:35.335 --> 10:45.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
standing here today.
Specifically, for me,
my teammate, friend, and brother
Nic Checque,

10:45.278 --> 10:47.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the award is truly his.

10:47.046 --> 10:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Byers says,
he bears the
responsibility to live up to the
sacrifice

10:52.218 --> 10:54.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that Checque and others made.

10:54.087 --> 10:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SR. CHIEF EDWARD BYERS: I don't
know for sure
how this will change my life.
And I just plan

10:58.525 --> 11:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on taking it one step at a time.
I'm going
to continue doing my job in the
Navy, continue

11:05.698 --> 11:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being a SEAL, and doing the
thing I loved
ever since I was a child.

11:10.537 --> 11:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Byers joined the
Navy in 1998
and has served nine combat
tours.

11:16.476 --> 11:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And on Wall Street,
late selling
wiped out a month's worth of
gains. The Dow

11:21.614 --> 11:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average lost
123 points to
close at 16516. The Nasdaq fell
32 points,

11:29.255 --> 11:32.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the S&amp;P 500 slid nearly 16.

11:32.425 --> 11:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
Super Tuesday and the battles to
unseat the

11:37.297 --> 11:44.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidential front-runners; a
major election
victory for moderates in Iran;
hackers that

11:44.070 --> 11:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hold your data for ransom; and
much more.

11:50.910 --> 12:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: With the candidates
busy on the
trail today, it's time for
Politics Monday,

12:03.089 --> 12:07.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Amy Walter of The Cook
Political Report
joining us from Florida tonight,
and Tamara

12:07.594 --> 12:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keith of NPR, who is covering a
Hillary Clinton
event in Northern Virginia.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome to you both out there on
the road.

12:14.100 --> 12:18.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to start by reading in
full this Mitt
Romney tweet that he sent out
today, pretty

12:18.671 --> 12:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tough words against the likely
-- what is
increasingly looking like the
party nominee,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wrote: "It's a disqualifying
and disgusting
response by @realDonaldTrump" --
that his

12:28.748 --> 12:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
handle, of course -- "to the
KKK. His coddling
of repugnant bigotry is not in
the character

12:34.887 --> 12:36.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of America."

12:36.689 --> 12:39.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Mitt Romney has been
stepping up his
attacks on Donald Trump during
the last week

12:40.026 --> 12:44.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or so, but it feels like this is
another turning
point. But then, whenever we
approach a turning

12:44.864 --> 12:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point, Amy, we then pass it and
go somewhere
else. Is this different?

12:48.835 --> 12:52.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: It
feels like we're still where we
have always

12:52.138 --> 12:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been, Gwen, which is a lot of
people wringing
their hands, talking about how
much they dislike

12:57.010 --> 13:03.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump or disavow his
comments or statements,
and yet they don't rally behind
the alternative

13:03.783 --> 13:05.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Donald Trump.

13:05.551 --> 13:10.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Donald Trump continues to
benefit from
the fact that the field remains
fractured.

13:10.590 --> 13:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no consensus right now
about who the
candidate to take on Donald
Trump will be.

13:16.029 --> 13:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marco Rubio thinks it's him. Ted
Cruz thinks
it's him. And John Kasich still
thinks that

13:20.733 --> 13:24.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he can wait until March 15 and
Ohio, and it
will be him.

13:24.137 --> 13:28.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, Tam, I think
that Amy just
nailed it, which is that she
said that people

13:28.141 --> 13:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not rallying around the
alternative. Maybe
it's because there are so many
alternatives.

13:32.178 --> 13:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How would you characterize the
depth of Republican
worry about the state of affairs
right now?

13:36.549 --> 13:41.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well,
I mean, I think you can see the
depth of worry

13:41.721 --> 13:46.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in that Mitt Romney has come
back to the surface
and he's tweeting.

13:46.592 --> 13:52.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, there's even a
little Mitt
Romney buzz out there, which is
a sign of

13:52.699 --> 13:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the worry that's out there. You
also have
-- it's an interesting mix. You
have some

13:58.171 --> 14:03.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members of Congress -- or at
least one senator
saying he's not going to vote
for Donald Trump

14:03.543 --> 14:05.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no matter what.

14:05.411 --> 14:10.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's sort of a growing
chorus of that,
at the same time that Donald
Trump is gaining

14:10.650 --> 14:18.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some endorsements, including
from Senator
Sessions of Alabama and Chris
Christie of

14:18.458 --> 14:20.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New Jersey.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You were talking, of
course, referring
to the senator from Nebraska --
at least,

14:22.595 --> 14:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, she was -- who said that if
it was a
choice between Hillary Clinton
and Donald

14:26.799 --> 14:28.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump, he would vote for
neither.

14:28.601 --> 14:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does that leave a path at all
for Ted Cruz
or Marco Rubio?

14:33.239 --> 14:36.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Tuesday is going to
be very interesting
for both of these candidates.

14:36.342 --> 14:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, Ted Cruz has the most to
lose here.
He was banking his entire
strategy on the

14:42.315 --> 14:46.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South. He obviously came up
short in South
Carolina, very far short. He's
hoping for

14:46.686 --> 14:52.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a big win in Texas, but even
that is not enough.
He's also has to do -- he also
has to do well

14:52.225 --> 14:55.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a lot of these Southern
states that are
heavily evangelical.

14:55.328 --> 14:59.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But from the polling that I have
seen right
now, the problem for Ted Cruz is
the same

14:59.165 --> 15:05.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
problem he had in South
Carolina, which is
evangelicals remain divided,
Donald Trump

15:05.972 --> 15:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gaining somewhere around 33, 35
percent of
that vote. What this means is
Ted Cruz comes

15:10.643 --> 15:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of March 1, instead of with
a head of
steam, he's in deficit with
delegates.

15:15.548 --> 15:20.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio is in a different camp
here. And he
has a different strategy. March
1 isn't as

15:20.186 --> 15:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important to him. These are not
the states
that he needs to do as well in,
was never

15:24.624 --> 15:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expected to do as well in. He
needs to wrap
up some delegates, though. His
play is really

15:30.196 --> 15:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
March 15, once we start getting
into the winner-take-all
states, places like Florida here
and Ohio.

15:38.204 --> 15:43.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has to win those in order to
be relevant.
But, really, at the bottom line,
Gwen, we're

15:43.876 --> 15:49.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a place right now where
Donald Trump is
the presumptive nominee, unless
or until one

15:49.215 --> 15:55.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person can be the alternative,
or we get to
a place where the vote continues
to be divided,

15:55.655 --> 16:00.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where delegates continue to be
divided, and
we end up with no candidate
getting 50 percent

16:00.226 --> 16:01.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the vote.

16:01.994 --> 16:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is actually looking
like the only
or best-case scenario for people
who don't

16:06.165 --> 16:07.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want Donald Trump.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, it's really
interesting to
me to see that the endorsements
that Donald

16:10.036 --> 16:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has gotten recently, Jeff
Sessions,
very conservative, Mitt -- I
mean, Chris Christie,

16:16.042 --> 16:21.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not, that they would both be
gathering around
him. Is that just a -- is that a
floodgate

16:21.581 --> 16:22.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about to open?

16:22.782 --> 16:25.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, this is an
interesting
thing.

16:26.018 --> 16:32.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's not clear what the
endorsements for Donald
Trump actually mean. He's this
unconventional

16:32.992 --> 16:37.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate who, it would seem,
doesn't even
really need endorsements, but
then these endorsements

16:37.163 --> 16:45.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do lend a little legitimacy.
They lend some
credibility to this outsider
candidacy.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, I want to stick
with you
for a moment, because people
would think,

16:48.341 --> 16:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to hear us talk, that we're only
talking about
the Republicans.

16:51.043 --> 16:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're clearly at a Hillary
Clinton event.
And -- but if you listen to
Hillary Clinton

16:54.981 --> 17:01.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to Bernie Sanders, they also
are talking
about the Republicans.

17:01.053 --> 17:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, absolutely.

17:02.889 --> 17:05.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is doing it in
more of a veiled
way. You can almost say that
Hillary Clinton

17:05.191 --> 17:11.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is trying to take something of a
high road,
but she's talking about the need
for love

17:11.063 --> 17:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and kindness, and then sort of
showing distress
about the discourse on the
Republican side.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says she wants to take them
on.

17:21.440 --> 17:26.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders is also being
very critical
of Donald Trump especially. He
sent out a

17:26.746 --> 17:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tweet yesterday about the KKK
stuff, and it
was very critical. And,
interestingly, Hillary

17:33.219 --> 17:34.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton's account then retweeted
that.

17:35.021 --> 17:38.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Has that ever
happened before,
where Hillary Clinton endorsed
anything Bernie

17:38.457 --> 17:39.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sanders said?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

17:41.260 --> 17:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, you know,
they often talk
about their distinguished
opponent.

17:44.463 --> 17:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is definitely an
interesting situation
to have her campaign retweeting
his campaign.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Having a common
enemy is always
handy.

17:53.272 --> 17:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, which party, if we were
going to say
that -- last week, obviously,
Hillary Clinton

17:57.977 --> 18:02.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dealt a pretty big blow to
Bernie Sanders.
They're still fighting each
other, dealing

18:02.415 --> 18:07.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
daily kind of juvenile blows on
the Republican
side. Which party is having the
more consequential

18:07.920 --> 18:09.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
civil war at this point?

18:09.488 --> 18:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, it absolutely
is the Republicans.

18:11.857 --> 18:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Listen, I feel like this is a
party right
now -- I mean, I can almost hear
the tectonic

18:18.331 --> 18:24.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shift here. The Republican Party
now is on
the verge of absolutely
splitting apart. And

18:24.937 --> 18:29.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you asked about what the level
of worry is
among sort of Republican
establishment, as

18:29.709 --> 18:34.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they said on "Spinal Tap," this
goes to 11.
OK? It is off the charts.

18:34.146 --> 18:40.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we are going to see
a Republican
Party that looks, if Donald
Trump is the nominee,

18:40.252 --> 18:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that looks very different than a
Republican
Party we have seen before. I
don't doubt that

18:44.290 --> 18:50.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we will see a Republican
candidate running
as a third party. This is not
about -- I know

18:50.730 --> 18:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have talked about Michael
Bloomberg in
the past. I'm talking
specifically about a

18:53.866 --> 18:59.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
traditional Republican
establishment conservative
figure running as a third-party
candidate.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wouldn't be surprised about that
at all.

19:01.107 --> 19:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The civil war has been a big
part of the Republican
identity for some time. These
factions have

19:08.147 --> 19:12.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been fighting each other for
some time. The
only thing that has kept these
factions from

19:12.685 --> 19:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
splitting apart in the past has
been the fact
that Republicans are united in
their dislike

19:17.923 --> 19:19.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for President Obama.

19:19.692 --> 19:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now that the focus is
inward, instead
of outward, the civil war has --
is starting

19:24.163 --> 19:30.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take a serious toll. And I
really think
we're going to see in some way,
shape or form

19:30.202 --> 19:33.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a dissolution of the Republican
Party as it
currently stands.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wow, that's saying
something.
And it is interesting. We don't
hear President

19:36.575 --> 19:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama's name nearly as much
anymore. And it
used to be the common rallying
cry.

19:41.047 --> 19:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report, Tamara
Keith of NPR, thank you both.

19:51.090 --> 19:58.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report, Tamara
Keith of NPR, thank you both.

19:58.064 --> 20:03.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The results are in from Iran's
elections.
They show strong gains for
relatively moderate

20:03.569 --> 20:10.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allies of President Hassan
Rouhani and a setback
for more hard-line elements in
Iran's conservative

20:10.609 --> 20:12.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Islamic establishment.

20:12.445 --> 20:18.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's the first national
elections since last
summer's nuclear deal. There was
heavy turnout

20:18.317 --> 20:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Friday, as Iranians elected a
new Parliament
and the so-called Assembly of
Experts, a council

20:24.757 --> 20:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of senior clerics that is tasked
with selecting
the supreme leader.

20:29.195 --> 20:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man currently in that
office, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, praised the high
turnout and

20:34.767 --> 20:40.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advised the newly elected bodies
to guard
against Western influence. He
remains the

20:40.106 --> 20:42.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
decisive voice in Iran.

20:42.341 --> 20:47.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what does this all mean
inside Iran, and
for the u.s? We turn to Karim
Sadjadpour of

20:47.646 --> 20:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Karim, welcome back to the
program.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how do you read these
results?

20:54.553 --> 20:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR, Carnegie
Endowment For International
Peace: Judy, I think this was a
best-case

20:57.423 --> 20:59.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
outcome for President Rouhani.

20:59.625 --> 21:04.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As you know, many of the
moderates and reformist
candidates were disqualified.
They were prevented

21:04.463 --> 21:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from running. So, before the
elections, it
looked pretty bleak for Rouhani.
But they

21:10.136 --> 21:16.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
managed to come up with a list
-- what they
called the list of hope. And
that list swept

21:16.142 --> 21:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tehran. It did well in other
urban areas.

21:18.911 --> 21:28.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It didn't do as well in other --
in the provinces.
But I think that this doesn't
bring about

21:28.387 --> 21:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liberal reformists to the
Iranian Parliament,
but it's certainly a less
hostile, less intolerant

21:33.759 --> 21:35.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Parliament for President
Rouhani.

21:35.694 --> 21:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that's my
question, because,
as you said, so many moderates
were not even

21:39.999 --> 21:45.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allowed to run. So how much more
moderate
are these newly elected members?

21:45.838 --> 21:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Many of them
are unknown,
Judy.

21:49.108 --> 21:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke to a friend of mine who
has been involved
in Iranian politic for three
decades, and

21:53.245 --> 21:58.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he said, of the 30 candidates
who won Tehran,
he was only familiar with four
or five names.

21:58.817 --> 22:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among those 30 candidates, some
of them actually
self-identify as conservatives
as well.

22:03.889 --> 22:10.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think we should have sober
expectations
about the nature of these
reformist Parliamentarians

22:10.763 --> 22:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, frankly, the Iranian
Parliament's ability
to wield change. But there's a
great Persian

22:15.601 --> 22:20.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expression that when someone has
experienced
near death, they're content with
a fever.

22:20.873 --> 22:25.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that the Iranian
population over
the last decade has really
experienced incredibly

22:25.911 --> 22:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difficult times. And I think
that many people
went to vote, not because they
were hoping

22:30.716 --> 22:36.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for something. They had great
expectations
of a more liberal Parliament,
but they fear,

22:36.155 --> 22:41.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they didn't vote, it would
bring about
a much more intolerant,
hard-line Parliament.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Will anything
change, then?

22:44.363 --> 22:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: I -- I think
that, if you're
sitting at the White House or
you're sitting

22:48.901 --> 22:55.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the State Department, this
election is
not likely to change Iran's
policies in Syria,

22:55.975 --> 23:01.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran's objection to Israel,
Iran's animosity
towards the United States. And
it's not likely

23:01.880 --> 23:05.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to make Iran a tolerant
democratic place.

23:05.951 --> 23:12.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you live in Tehran, if
you learn in
Shiraz, this can moderately
improve your quality

23:12.958 --> 23:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of life. And the Expert Assembly
election
is important as well, because
they theoretically

23:19.298 --> 23:22.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have responsibility for choosing
the next
supreme leader.

23:22.801 --> 23:28.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Iran's current supreme
leader, Ali Khamenei,
is 76 years old. It could be
that, if he dies

23:28.540 --> 23:33.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the next six to eight years,
the Experts
Assembly could have a role
selecting his successor.

23:33.512 --> 23:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what should
we expect to
see tangibly there? Does this
mean the hard-liners

23:40.419 --> 23:42.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have somewhat less influence?

23:42.221 --> 23:47.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Well, the
supreme leader
and the Revolutionary Guards
remain pretty

23:47.359 --> 23:52.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
firmly entrenched. Iran remains
a police state,
in which, if you're a
journalist, you're an

23:52.865 --> 23:57.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
author, you're a civil society
activist, you
can be plucked off the street,
put in prison

23:57.269 --> 23:59.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
without reason, without
explanation.

23:59.338 --> 24:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's actually two U.S.
citizens, Siamak
Namazi, and his 80-year-old
father, Baquer

24:04.076 --> 24:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Namazi, that remain in prison in
Iran. So,
we certainly have to be sober
about our expectations.

24:11.083 --> 24:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think this, it just goes
to show that
President Rouhani's more
pragmatic agenda

24:18.357 --> 24:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is deeply popular in Iran. And I
think it
really increases the likelihood
that he will

24:24.029 --> 24:26.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be reelected come next summer.

24:26.932 --> 24:32.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To what extent,
Karim, was
this a referendum on the nuclear
deal with

24:32.237 --> 24:34.106 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the West?

24:34.139 --> 24:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: You know, I
think the nuclear
deal and greater cooperation
with the outside

24:39.845 --> 24:44.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world, greater integration with
the outside
world, is something which has
long been desired

24:44.183 --> 24:46.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the Iranian public.

24:46.885 --> 24:53.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a very young population.
They're really,
I would argue, post-ideological.
But, at the

24:53.926 --> 25:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end of the day, the power in
Iran -- or, I
should say, the power of
institutions in Iran

25:01.300 --> 25:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aren't derived from their
popular support.
They are derived from their
coercive capabilities.

25:07.639 --> 25:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the nuclear deal was
very popular,
and people would like to have
much more of

25:16.548 --> 25:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that type of detente with the
United States.
But as long as this current
supreme leader

25:22.054 --> 25:28.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remains in power, I think we
should be realistic
about the likelihood that this
rapprochement

25:28.827 --> 25:30.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the United States will
continue.

25:30.662 --> 25:35.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karim Sadjadpour,
interpreting
these election results for us,
we thank you.

25:35.667 --> 25:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Thank you,
Judy.

25:40.539 --> 25:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

25:50.716 --> 25:56.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
states push back
on transgender rights; the U.S.
role in the

25:56.522 --> 26:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight against Nigeria's Boko
Haram; and the
Oscars put the spotlight on
investigative

26:02.361 --> 26:03.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
journalism.

26:03.962 --> 26:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, a look at what's
become the latest
threat to our cyber-security.

26:08.634 --> 26:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem took on new urgency
recently when
a hospital in Los Angeles had
its entire computer

26:14.440 --> 26:19.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
network, including all its
digital medical
records, locked up by hackers.
They demanded

26:19.878 --> 26:25.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a ransom before they'd release
the computers.
It was the second such attack
this month.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
L.A.'s Health Department was hit
last week.

26:27.820 --> 26:33.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These types of computer attacks,
which usually
target individual computer
users, are on the

26:33.192 --> 26:34.960 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rise.

26:34.993 --> 26:37.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour"'s William
Brangham reported
on this threat last year, and
now he brings

26:37.729 --> 26:39.398 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us an update.

26:39.431 --> 26:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Inna Simone is
retired.
She's a mother and grandmother
from Russia

26:43.502 --> 26:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who now lives outside of Boston.
In the fall
of 2014, her home computer
started acting

26:49.007 --> 26:50.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strangely.

26:50.809 --> 26:54.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
INNA SIMONE, Retiree: My
computer was working
terribly. It was not working. I
mean, it was

26:54.980 --> 26:56.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so slow.

26:56.748 --> 26:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A few days
later, while
searching through her computer
files, Inna

26:58.684 --> 27:04.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw dozens of these messages --
they were
all the same. They read: "Your
files are encrypted.

27:04.323 --> 27:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To get the key to decrypt them,
you have to
pay $500."

27:08.894 --> 27:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her exact deadline, December 2
at 12:48 p.m.,
was just a few days away.

27:14.466 --> 27:19.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All her files were locked , tax
returns, financial
papers, letters, even the
precious photos

27:19.505 --> 27:22.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of her granddaughter Zoe. Inna
couldn't open
any of them.

27:22.841 --> 27:31.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INNA SIMONE: It says, "If you
won't pay, your
fine will double. If you won't
pay by then,

27:31.783 --> 27:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all your files will be deleted
and you will
lose them forever and never will
get back."

27:39.057 --> 27:42.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Inna Simone,
like thousands
of others, had been victimized
by what's known

27:42.995 --> 27:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a ransomware attack. Hackers
-- who law
enforcement believe come mainly
from Eastern

27:47.332 --> 27:52.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe or Russia -- manage to
implant malicious
software onto your computer,
usually when

27:52.404 --> 27:57.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you mistakenly open an infected
e-mail attachment,
or visit a compromised Web site.

27:57.242 --> 28:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That software then allows the
hackers to lock
up your files, or your entire
computer, until

28:02.314 --> 28:05.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you pay them a ransom to give it
back.

28:05.450 --> 28:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justin Cappos is a computer
security expert
at New York University.

28:08.220 --> 28:11.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUSTIN CAPPOS, New York
University: It will
actually lock you out of the
files, the data

28:11.290 --> 28:13.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on your computer.

28:13.091 --> 28:18.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you'd be able to use the
computer but
those files have been encrypted
by the attacker

28:18.797 --> 28:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a key that only they
possess. It's frustrating
because you know the data is
there. You know

28:23.902 --> 28:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the files are there. You know
your photos
and everything is there and
could be accessible

28:28.173 --> 28:33.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to you. But you have no way of
being able
to get at it because of this
encryption that

28:33.545 --> 28:35.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the attackers are using.

28:35.414 --> 28:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is
exactly what happened
at Hollywood Presbyterian
Hospital in Los

28:38.350 --> 28:43.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Angeles. According to officials,
about a month
ago, their computerized medical
records were

28:43.322 --> 28:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
locked up by one of these
malicious programs,
and a hacker demanded $17,000 in
ransom to

28:49.094 --> 28:50.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unlock them.

28:50.929 --> 28:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During this time, medical staff
were forced
to use paper and pen for their
record-keeping,

28:54.600 --> 28:59.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they say no patient files
were compromised.
The hospital decided to pay the
ransom. Their

28:59.504 --> 29:02.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
computers were unlocked, and the
FBI is now
investigating.

29:02.474 --> 29:07.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inna Simone was facing the same
dilemma, whether
or not to pay the ransom or not.
Computer

29:07.145 --> 29:11.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
technicians were no help. She
didn't want
to call the police. Her husband
at first said

29:11.450 --> 29:14.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't pay the ransom, but she
wanted those
files back.

29:14.920 --> 29:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In their ransom note, the
hackers wanted to
be paid in Bitcoin, the largely
untraceable

29:19.658 --> 29:24.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
digital currency, and have it
put into their
anonymous account. Inna had
never heard of

29:24.463 --> 29:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bitcoin, but the hackers, in one
of their
many touches of what you might
call customer

29:29.001 --> 29:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service, provided all sorts of
helpful facts
and links and how-to guides
about Bitcoin.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Alina Simone is Inna's daughter.

29:37.209 --> 29:40.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALINA SIMONE, Daughter of Inna
Simone: If
you see the ransom note, you can
see, oh,

29:40.312 --> 29:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they try to reassure you about
Bitcoin. We
have got screen shots or here is
a link to

29:45.717 --> 29:50.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some kind of a guide that talks
you through
the whole process, and here's a
list of providers

29:50.822 --> 29:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a little kind of Yelp-like
reviews next
to each one that kind of
explains their strength

29:55.460 --> 29:56.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and weaknesses.

29:56.361 --> 29:58.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's incredibly sophisticated.

29:58.063 --> 30:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After days of
debate, Inna
decided to pay. She sent a money
order to

30:02.367 --> 30:07.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Bitcoin seller, but it was
Thanksgiving,
and a huge snowstorm hit Boston,
which meant

30:07.506 --> 30:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the check only arrived the
afternoon before
her deadline.

30:11.043 --> 30:16.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In that delay, Bitcoin's
exchange rate had
changed, and now her money order
didn't cover

30:16.148 --> 30:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the full $500 ransom. It was
about $13 short.
Her last resort using a Bitcoin
ATM machine.

30:23.355 --> 30:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are hundreds of them in
the U.S., and
one was in Brooklyn, New York,
not far from

30:27.659 --> 30:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
her daughter Alina's apartment.

30:29.461 --> 30:35.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALINA SIMONE: It's very kind of
spooky looking
ATM. It has no buttons. It just
has a slot

30:35.734 --> 30:37.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that you feed your money into.

30:37.602 --> 30:41.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tuesday
afternoon, the full
ransom was sent to the hackers'
account. But

30:41.440 --> 30:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was two hours late. Inna
added one short
message to the criminals with
her payment.

30:46.511 --> 30:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INNA SIMONE: I wrote: "I wish
you all will
drop dead."

30:51.783 --> 30:56.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The FBI
doesn't have complete
data on how many of these
ransomware attacks

30:56.254 --> 30:58.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
occur every year, but they're
clearly on the
rise.

30:58.924 --> 31:03.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The anti-virus software firm
Symantec reports
that hundreds of thousands of
these attacks

31:03.428 --> 31:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are launched every month.
There's also a real
difference of opinion on whether
victims should

31:07.799 --> 31:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay. Security researchers say
paying ransom
only encourages criminals, but
the FBI says

31:12.971 --> 31:17.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of this ransomware is so
tough to crack
that paying a few hundred
dollars is sometimes

31:17.275 --> 31:19.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the only way to get your files
back.

31:19.344 --> 31:21.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Our information was held
hostage.

31:21.146 --> 31:25.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And it's not
just individuals
and hospitals who get hit.
Hackers have hit

31:25.217 --> 31:30.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several local police stations.
We have heard
of law firms and newsrooms being
targeted.

31:30.188 --> 31:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even the city of Detroit last
year had its
data held for an $800,000 ransom
by hackers.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The city didn't pay.

31:37.629 --> 31:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NYU computer scientist Justin
Cappos says,
generally speaking, hackers go
after smaller,

31:42.701 --> 31:46.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individual targets because
they're pretty
easy. Victims often
inadvertently download

31:46.238 --> 31:49.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the viruses themselves by
clicking on those
e-mail attachments.

31:49.374 --> 31:53.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Besides, he says, the risks of
getting caught
are low, and if you cast a wide
enough net,

31:53.979 --> 31:55.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you will get something.

31:55.781 --> 31:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN CAPPOS: When you go
fishing, you don't
try to catch every fish in the
ocean. You

31:58.717 --> 32:03.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only want to catch some. And if
you catch
enough of them, then it's been a
profitable

32:03.889 --> 32:05.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trip for you.

32:05.690 --> 32:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: When her mom
got hacked,
Alina Simone, who's a journalist
by day, did

32:09.127 --> 32:13.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some research into ransomware
for a piece
she wrote for The New York
Times. She says

32:13.398 --> 32:17.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's alarming how organized and
easy it is
to carry out these kinds of
attacks.

32:17.803 --> 32:24.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALINA SIMONE: There are people
making viruses,
selling viruses. There are
distributors whose

32:24.109 --> 32:28.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specialty is distributing
viruses. These perpetrators,
they don't have to know a line
of code. They

32:28.947 --> 32:34.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can just buy a virus and then
hire a distributor
and send it out.

32:34.252 --> 32:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Her mom's
story, however,
wasn't over. Inna had paid the
hackers her

32:38.757 --> 32:43.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$500, but rather than releasing
her files,
as promised, they sent her this
message. It

32:43.962 --> 32:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said: "You didn't pay in time
for decryption."

32:46.531 --> 32:51.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, she'd paid two hours
late. Now the
hackers doubled the ransom to
$1,000, gave

32:51.870 --> 32:55.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her another deadline, and said
if she missed
this one, they would delete
everything.

32:55.807 --> 33:02.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INNA SIMONE: If you won't pay by
then, your
files -- all your files are gone
forever.

33:02.247 --> 33:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Using a
message board the
hackers provided -- another one
of those customer-friendly

33:06.218 --> 33:11.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
touches -- Inna pleaded with the
people she'd
previously told to drop dead:
"We had a snowstorm.

33:11.957 --> 33:14.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a holiday. I am only two
hours' late."

33:14.726 --> 33:18.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did this feel strange that
you're trying to
communicate to a group of
criminals -- who

33:18.630 --> 33:23.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knows where they are in the
world -- saying,
you don't understand, the post
office, the

33:23.134 --> 33:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
snow, Thanksgiving, the long
weekend. I mean,
you must've felt...

33:27.239 --> 33:29.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INNA SIMONE: But what else? This
is the only
option. It's either this or
nothing.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You didn't
think it would
work.

33:32.043 --> 33:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INNA SIMONE: Absolutely not.

33:33.745 --> 33:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But, later
that day, the
hackers released her files in
full.

33:38.550 --> 33:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

33:48.260 --> 33:57.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to a battle
emerging in
some states over schools and
rights for transgender

33:57.602 --> 33:59.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
students.

33:59.371 --> 34:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Dakota's governor, Dennis
Daugaard,
must decide by tomorrow whether
he will sign

34:03.541 --> 34:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or veto a bill that would make
his state the
first in the country to restrict
transgender

34:09.047 --> 34:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students' access to school
restrooms and locker
rooms. If he doesn't act by
tomorrow, the

34:14.853 --> 34:16.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bill will become law.

34:16.254 --> 34:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s April Brown
reports for our
American Graduate team.

34:20.558 --> 34:25.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Transgender rights
advocates
in South Dakota gathered at the
state capitol

34:25.397 --> 34:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
building last week to draw
attention to a
bill they consider
discriminatory.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Freshman Nathan Leonard was
there.

34:31.503 --> 34:34.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN LEONARD, Student: It
directly affects
me, because I am a transgender
student, and

34:34.773 --> 34:36.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I already get made fun of
enough.

34:36.541 --> 34:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The bill would
require school
restrooms and locker rooms are
"used only

34:39.477 --> 34:44.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by students of the same
biological sex." It
would also allow students whose
gender identity

34:44.416 --> 34:49.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is different than their
biological sex "to
be provided with a reasonable
accommodation."

34:49.688 --> 34:53.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the bill's primary
sponsors, state
Representative Fred Deutsch,
says the goal

34:53.692 --> 34:55.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is to protect children.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DEUTSCH (R), South Dakota
State Representative:
The bill is not intended to hurt
or harm.

34:58.063 --> 35:04.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm protecting their hearts,
their eyes and
their minds. I don't want our
children to

35:04.903 --> 35:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be exposed to the anatomy of
other genders.

35:07.372 --> 35:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: But many in the
LGBT community
and their supporters believe the
bill would

35:11.943 --> 35:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not protect children, especially
transgender
students.

35:15.747 --> 35:19.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State Representative Paula Hawks
opposes the
bill and stood with protesters.

35:19.451 --> 35:25.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA HAWKS (D), South Dakota
State Representative:
It is an unfriendly message.
It's hostile.

35:25.223 --> 35:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's unacceptable in a state
where we're trying
to progress forward.

35:28.159 --> 35:32.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The battle comes as
a number
of cities have expanded
nondiscrimination

35:32.063 --> 35:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
laws for transgender people. But
there are
many other bills many consider
anti-transgender

35:37.635 --> 35:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pending in 16 states, including
Virginia,
Illinois, Indiana, and
Washington state. And

35:43.341 --> 35:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of them would restrict
students' access
to restrooms and sports
programs.

35:47.912 --> 35:51.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The South Dakota legislation is
also at odds
with guidance from the U.S.
Department of

35:51.950 --> 35:56.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Education. Federal officials
have previously
threatened to cut off funding to
districts

35:56.154 --> 36:00.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in California and Illinois that
didn't allow
transgender students to use
their preferred

36:00.859 --> 36:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bathrooms and changing areas.

36:02.727 --> 36:07.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, the Department of
Education guidance
is not legally binding. And if
Governor Dennis

36:07.766 --> 36:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Daugaard signs the bill, there
could be another
repercussion: lawsuits.

36:11.369 --> 36:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DEUTSCH: This is a values
issue. And
if we protect our children and
we get sued,

36:16.708 --> 36:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well, then that's the decision
we make.

36:18.810 --> 36:22.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
APRIL BROWN: The final
decision-maker, Governor
Daugaard, met with transgender
students and

36:22.614 --> 36:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their parents last week, which
he says put
a human face on the issue.

36:26.284 --> 36:31.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. DENNIS DAUGAARD (R), South
Dakota: I
heard their personal stories.
And so I saw

36:31.589 --> 36:36.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things through their eyes, in
that sense.
It's certainly of great concern
to many people.

36:36.661 --> 36:44.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, to the opponents of
the bill, it's
of great concern. And so I don't
treat it

36:44.335 --> 36:46.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lightly, by any means.

36:46.037 --> 36:49.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: LGBT advocates at
the capitol
were pleased the governor
listened.

36:49.207 --> 36:55.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Any time you're talking,
the door's
open for change. When there's no
discussion,

36:55.713 --> 36:57.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you're not going forward.

36:57.682 --> 37:01.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Governor Daugaard
has also spoken
to the bill's sponsors and is
reviewing testimony

37:01.186 --> 37:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and court documents before he
makes his final
decision.

37:03.822 --> 37:11.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
April Brown.

37:11.062 --> 37:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Over the weekend,
several hundred
hostages of the Nigerian
Islamist group Boko

37:25.877 --> 37:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Haram were freed. It happened
during a raid
by Nigerian and Cameroonian
forces along the

37:31.182 --> 37:33.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border between the two African
nations.

37:33.952 --> 37:39.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The raid comes as the U.S.
military has moved
to increase cooperation with
regional governments

37:39.624 --> 37:44.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fight the jihadist group.
Boko Haram pledged
allegiance to the Islamic State
group, or

37:44.863 --> 37:51.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS, last year. According to
Amnesty International,
the six-year uprising has killed
more than

37:51.503 --> 37:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20,000 people. Another 2.8
million have been
forced from their homes in
Nigeria, Cameroon,

37:56.975 --> 37:58.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Niger, and Chad.

37:59.010 --> 38:05.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boko Haram gained worldwide
infamy in 2014
after kidnapping more than 200
schoolgirls

38:05.850 --> 38:11.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the town of Chibok in
Northeastern Nigeria.
That sparked a global campaign
to free the

38:11.756 --> 38:17.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
girls, with the hashtag
#BringBackOurGirls
as a social media rallying cry.
The girls'

38:17.195 --> 38:23.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plight was a contributing factor
to then-President
Goodluck Jonathan's election
loss last year.

38:23.468 --> 38:28.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. has military personnel
operating
a new drone base in Cameroon to
provide intelligence.

38:28.973 --> 38:34.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is now discussion of
sending American
special forces near the front
lines of Nigeria's

38:34.279 --> 38:38.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fight against Boko Haram. They
would advise
the military in its operations.

38:38.750 --> 38:42.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by special
correspondent Nick
Schifrin. He's currently on
assignment for

38:42.787 --> 38:48.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us in Nairobi, Kenya, and he
reported in-depth
from Nigeria for the "NewsHour"
last year.

38:48.626 --> 38:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nick, it's good to talk to you
again.

38:50.728 --> 38:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, tell us what you know about
this new U.S.
engagement in Nigeria.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes, Gwen, good
evening.

38:56.534 --> 39:02.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a new recommendation by
the U.S. military's
top Africa Command that one to
three dozen

39:02.840 --> 39:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
special operations forces troops
be deployed
to Northeastern Nigeria. This is
what the

39:07.579 --> 39:10.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
military calls an
advise-and-assist mission.

39:10.648 --> 39:15.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are towards the front
lines, but not
really on the front lines,
advising the Nigerian

39:15.320 --> 39:20.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
military in their fight,
assisting that fight,
things like intelligence and
training those

39:20.692 --> 39:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troops. Now, this is just a
recommendation
right now. This will have to go
through the

39:23.995 --> 39:26.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
State Department and the
Pentagon and the
White House.

39:26.497 --> 39:32.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is what the military in
Africa wants.
And it's what one military
official describes

39:32.036 --> 39:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a national progression to a
real escalation
in what the U.S. has been doing
against Boko

39:37.342 --> 39:41.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Haram and helping the Nigerians.
The first
step in that is intelligence.
There's a new

39:41.679 --> 39:49.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drone base in nearby Northern
Cameroon. Predator
drones have been supplying the
Nigerian and

39:49.354 --> 39:54.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the countries all along the Lake
Chad Basin
with imagery, with intelligence,
so they can

39:54.559 --> 39:56.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go after Boko Haram.

39:56.327 --> 40:00.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's new in the last few
months. And just
in the last few years, the U.S.
has resumed

40:00.164 --> 40:06.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a training mission in
Northwestern Nigeria.
That is for Nigerian special
forces far from

40:06.437 --> 40:10.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the front line. That's a mission
the U.S.
has really been trying to resume
after it

40:10.842 --> 40:12.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ended about a year ago.

40:12.577 --> 40:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Gwen this is in addition to
real concerted
effort diplomatically to try and
help the

40:17.348 --> 40:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nigerians improve things like
the police.
So, this is a real escalation in
the U.S.

40:21.986 --> 40:24.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helping Nigeria and all the
countries fighting
Boko Haram.

40:24.455 --> 40:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It seems like one of
the big differences
between then and now is the
presence of a

40:29.060 --> 40:31.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
new Nigerian president,
Muhammadu Buhari.

40:31.329 --> 40:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes, it's an
extraordinary
difference, a real sea change of
a difference

40:35.900 --> 40:37.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when he was elected.

40:37.669 --> 40:40.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just to give you a sense, Gwen,
of how bad
the relationship between the
U.S. and Nigeria

40:40.938 --> 40:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was before his election, at one
point, the
top U.S. military official in
Africa refused

40:46.244 --> 40:51.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to shake the hand of the
Nigerian chief of
army staff. That's how bad that
relationship

40:51.516 --> 40:53.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was.

40:53.351 --> 40:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the U.S. deputies was
actually locked
out of a Nigerian base at one
point, a kind

40:56.354 --> 41:00.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of message by the Nigerians that
they were
upset. Since then, total sea
change. Muhammadu

41:01.025 --> 41:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Buhari has not only changed the
heads of the
military, so the actual
officials doing this

41:05.863 --> 41:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work, and that relationship has
improved between
the U.S.

41:08.733 --> 41:13.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's really said to all of
his deputies,
look, the U.S. is our ally. We
need to work

41:13.604 --> 41:15.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with them against Boko Haram.

41:15.306 --> 41:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
strength
of Boko Haram. How strong are
they and how

41:19.310 --> 41:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
extensive is their influence?

41:21.079 --> 41:24.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: At one point,
Boko Haram was
the deadliest terrorist group in
the world.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was by 2014, by the numbers
of people
killed.

41:27.652 --> 41:31.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's important, Gwen, to
note that that
was less about Boko Haram than
about the Nigerian

41:31.956 --> 41:37.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military. In some sense, Boko
Haram didn't
really have a foe on the
battlefield. Nigerian

41:37.328 --> 41:42.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soldiers were going out without
bullets, without
shoes, without the actual
material they needed

41:42.867 --> 41:44.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to fight Boko Haram.

41:44.669 --> 41:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Boko Haram was able to
take over land,
was able to kill so many people
because it

41:50.007 --> 41:56.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really wasn't encountering the
Nigerian military
or any of the militaries in the
region. Now

41:56.314 --> 42:00.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's not changed not only in
Nigeria. But
Chad, Niger, Cameroon, they have
all come

42:00.551 --> 42:04.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
together, with a little bit of
U.S. help,
to face Boko Haram.

42:04.288 --> 42:08.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's clear that, right now,
Boko Haram
is on the back foot. It cannot
seize any land

42:08.960 --> 42:13.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anymore, even as it still
launches suicide
attacks that are still deadly in
Nigeria.

42:13.564 --> 42:18.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally, Nick, for
many Americans,
the last thing they heard about
this question

42:18.269 --> 42:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Boko Haram's strength in
Nigeria has centered
around hostage-taking,
specifically about

42:24.175 --> 42:25.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those Chibok girls.

42:26.010 --> 42:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where does this stand now? We
keep hearing
that thousands of hostages have
been released,

42:30.114 --> 42:31.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but not so much about the girls.

42:32.016 --> 42:36.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes, this is
another example
of how Boko Haram is still
around, but weakened.

42:36.354 --> 42:40.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tens of thousand of people were
taken hostage
by Boko Haram at its peak.
Thousands of them

42:40.992 --> 42:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been released by the
Nigerian military,
by the Chadian military, who are
going into

42:45.596 --> 42:47.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
former Boko Haram strongholds.

42:47.565 --> 42:52.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the girls themselves are
still missing.
President Buhari says he is
willing to negotiate

42:52.537 --> 42:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Boko Haram to release those
girls. He's
willing to release Boko Haram
prisoners, but

42:57.675 --> 43:01.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he says that he hasn't found the
right Boko
Haram negotiators to do that.

43:01.946 --> 43:06.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, right now, those girls are
still missing.
And, Gwen, as you know, such a
tragic part

43:06.517 --> 43:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the story, some of those
girls or girls
in general being kidnapped are
now being used

43:10.988 --> 43:13.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as suicide bombers in some of
these attacks.

43:13.458 --> 43:17.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is a still a very big
effort by
the U.S. and Nigeria to find
those girls,

43:17.895 --> 43:20.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but so long after those
kidnappings, there's
still no sign of them.

43:21.032 --> 43:30.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Reporting for us
tonight, Nick
Schifrin. Thank you.

43:31.008 --> 43:38.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Thanks, Gwen.

43:38.115 --> 43:45.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From the very
opening of the
telecast last night, much of the
focus during

43:45.523 --> 43:50.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Academy Awards was on
Hollywood's problems
with diversity.

43:50.094 --> 43:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But near the end, a notable
upset also garnered
some attention. The movie
"Spotlight" won

43:55.700 --> 44:01.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for best picture. In part, it is
a reminder
about the state of investigative
journalism,

44:01.672 --> 44:06.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and raises the question whether
it would be
more difficult to mount a
similar investigation

44:06.878 --> 44:08.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these days.

44:08.312 --> 44:09.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has more.

44:09.413 --> 44:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MORGAN FREEMAN, Actor: The Oscar
goes to "Spotlight."

44:13.017 --> 44:20.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The winner was
something of
a surprise: "Spotlight," a film
about one

44:20.091 --> 44:26.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major hometown institution, The
Boston Globe,
taking on another, the Catholic
Church.

44:26.731 --> 44:28.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Director Tom McCarthy:

44:28.533 --> 44:30.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TOM MCCARTHY, Director,
"Spotlight": We made
this film for all the
journalists who have

44:30.334 --> 44:35.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and continue to hold the
powerful accountable
and for the survivors, whose
courage and will

44:35.439 --> 44:40.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to overcome is really an
inspiration to all.
We have to do to make sure this
never happens

again.

RACHEL MCADAMS, Actress: The
numbers clearly
indicate that there were senior
clergy involved.

44:44.282 --> 44:48.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The film recounts
how Globe
reporters and editors tracked
down cases of

44:48.119 --> 44:53.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sexual abuse of children by
priests, and the
cover-up by the church hierarchy
that allowed

44:53.691 --> 44:57.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guilty priests to stay in their
positions.

44:57.128 --> 45:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The paper's "Spotlight" team
tracked over
900 active and retired priests,
finding some

45:03.034 --> 45:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
250 had molested children over
several decades.

45:06.604 --> 45:11.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIEV SCHREIBER, Actor: We need
to focus on
the institution, not the
individual priests.

45:11.842 --> 45:16.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Practice and policy. Show me the
church manipulated
the system so that these guys
wouldn't have

45:16.414 --> 45:21.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to face charges. Show me they
put those same
priests back into parishes time
and time again.

45:21.152 --> 45:23.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Show me this was systemic, that
it came form
the top down.

45:23.955 --> 45:28.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Actor Liev
Schreiber®MD-BO /
played the Globe's editor,
Martin Baron.

45:28.159 --> 45:31.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIEV SCHREIBER: When Tom sent me
the script,
I called him immediately and I
said, this

45:31.429 --> 45:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is such an amazing piece and
it's so timely
and so important that we
remember what an

45:36.000 --> 45:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asset this is to an asset to our
society and
our culture and our democracy.

45:39.303 --> 45:44.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 2002, as the
original investigation
was still unfolding, the
"NewsHour" visited

45:44.909 --> 45:46.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Globe newsroom.

45:46.744 --> 45:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real Martin Baron spoke of
how the case
had snowballed from a focus on
just one priest.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTY BARON, Executive Editor,
The Washington
Post: I thought it was an
extraordinary story.

45:53.818 --> 46:01.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here was a priest who had been
accused by
130 people of having abused them
as minors.

46:01.859 --> 46:05.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was just an extraordinary
number in and
of itself.

46:05.329 --> 46:08.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Baron is now
editor of The
Washington Post.

46:08.065 --> 46:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we spoke to him this fall
as "Spotlight"
was being released, he said he
hoped the film

46:13.037 --> 46:17.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could also raise awareness of
the continuing
need for strong investigative
journalism

46:17.942 --> 46:22.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTY BARON: Well, we're a
profession that's
under tremendous pressure, a lot
of financial

46:22.647 --> 46:28.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pressure. So, clearly, it's
going to be more
difficult, given that there are
fewer resources

46:28.152 --> 46:31.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do it. This is very expensive
work to do.

46:31.155 --> 46:35.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet we have to commit
ourselves to doing
it. Somebody needs to hold
powerful institutions

46:36.027 --> 46:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and individuals accountable, and
we're the
ones who have that particular
role in our

46:41.999 --> 46:43.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
society.

46:43.901 --> 46:48.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Boston
Globe's "Spotlight"
unit won a Pulitzer Prize for
its coverage.

46:48.339 --> 46:53.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To add to Martin Baron's point
about economic
pressures, since 2003, newspaper
staffs have

46:53.911 --> 46:59.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
declined by 40 percent. In the
same period,
though, new models for
investigative journalism

46:59.283 --> 47:02.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are being tried, in some cases
with good success.

47:02.787 --> 47:07.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're joined now by Margaret
Sullivan, outgoing
public editor for The New York
Times. She

47:07.324 --> 47:12.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will soon be joining The
Washington Post as
its media columnist. And Steve
Engelberg,

47:12.096 --> 47:17.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the editor in chief of
ProPublica, a nonprofit
news organization that has won
numerous awards

47:18.002 --> 47:19.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for its investigative work.

47:19.503 --> 47:20.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, both, to you.

47:20.638 --> 47:22.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Margaret Sullivan, let me start
with you.

47:22.440 --> 47:26.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You wrote recently that -- quote
-- "The film
'Spotlight' is powerful and
moving, but it

47:26.711 --> 47:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raises troubling questions about
the state
of local investigative reporting
today and

47:32.116 --> 47:33.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
its future."

47:33.751 --> 47:36.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What -- you thought that even as
you were
watching the movie. What was
troubling?

47:36.687 --> 47:40.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET SULLIVAN, The New York
Times: Well,
it's very troubling to me,
because I'm a former

47:40.291 --> 47:45.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
editor of a regional newspaper,
and I watch
these issues carefully.

47:45.396 --> 47:51.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Staff numbers are way down. Many
papers have
to or have felt they have had to
dismantle

47:51.902 --> 47:56.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their investigative teams. And
the resources
just aren't there that were
there even 10

47:56.707 --> 47:58.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
years ago. It's really
troubling.

47:58.542 --> 48:04.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Steve
Engelberg, the economics
of the business are clearly one
issue. What

48:04.148 --> 48:07.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about leadership and audience
appetite? How
do they play in?

48:07.384 --> 48:10.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Editor in
Chief, ProPublica:
Well, it's very interesting,
because right

48:10.421 --> 48:16.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at this very minute, we have the
best investigative
reporting tools we have ever had
in the Internet.

48:16.227 --> 48:20.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's amazing what we can now
access in terms
of information. And people are
reading more.

48:20.965 --> 48:25.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem we have got is that
people aren't
willing to pay for it. And
that's a big problem.

48:25.736 --> 48:29.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Margaret says, it's a
particularly
acute problem outside the major
cities of

48:29.907 --> 48:34.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States, and even in
some of those
major cities, where newspapers
are at 50 percent

48:34.845 --> 48:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or less of their previous size.
That's the
problem. It's an economic
problem.

48:39.183 --> 48:42.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the perspective of the
craft, it's a
great time to be an
investigative reporter.

48:42.586 --> 48:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But flesh that
out a little
bit. So, it's really a
double-edged sword

48:45.923 --> 48:51.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of technology, right, about
digital technology
allows a certain kind of more
reporting and

48:51.662 --> 48:55.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more dissemination, but you're
saying the
economics make it harder.

48:55.065 --> 48:58.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN ENGELBERG: Exactly,
because people
feel on the Internet that
content ought to

48:58.302 --> 49:00.237 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be free.

49:00.271 --> 49:04.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so newspapers which made
money by charging
for subscription and ads find
their ad revenues

49:04.809 --> 49:09.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
severely pitched and
subscription revenues
evaporating. And in the face of
that, people

49:09.914 --> 49:14.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to go online and read this
wonderful
content for free. That is not a
model that

49:14.084 --> 49:15.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
works.

49:15.953 --> 49:19.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other side of it, though,
it is literally
amazing. I started in the
business when they

49:19.523 --> 49:23.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still had typewriters, believe
it or not,
and it's literally amazing these
days what

49:23.794 --> 49:29.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can access in terms of data,
in terms
of journal articles,
information, finding

49:29.133 --> 49:31.068 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

49:31.101 --> 49:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everything you want to do as an
investigative
reporter is just enhanced by the
current technology.

49:33.871 --> 49:38.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so,
Margaret Sullivan,
if I ask you, is "Spotlight"
possible today,

49:38.909 --> 49:42.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sounds like the answer is in
some cases yes,
but in a lot of cases no.

49:42.279 --> 49:47.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET SULLIVAN: I think it is
still possible
in most places.

49:47.651 --> 49:52.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that the will to do
this kind
of work is weakening somewhat,
and it has

49:52.623 --> 49:58.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be beefed up. "Spotlight" is
such an inspiring
movie, that I'm hopeful that it
will cause

49:58.562 --> 50:04.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
owners and editors and
publishers to realize
just how important this work is
and to fund

50:04.168 --> 50:05.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it and to get behind it.

50:05.936 --> 50:11.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell us, what
kind of stories
do you fear are being missed
even today?

50:11.842 --> 50:14.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET SULLIVAN: Well, it's
always hard
to know what's being missed...

50:14.778 --> 50:16.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Of course.

50:16.614 --> 50:18.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET SULLIVAN: ... because
you don't know
it until you read it in the
paper or hear

50:18.983 --> 50:20.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it or watch it.

50:20.784 --> 50:25.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the stories that are really
difficult
to do are the ones that are so
time-consuming.

50:25.656 --> 50:29.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you could tell from
"Spotlight" that people
were knocking on doors and they
were going

50:29.560 --> 50:33.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
over lists and they were
agonizing about how
to nail it down.

50:34.031 --> 50:38.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those kind of things are
very expensive
and they take time. But it is
the stories

50:38.469 --> 50:43.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about holding powerful people
and institutions
accountable that really, really
matter.

50:43.574 --> 50:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Steve Engelberg,
you were talking
about the new possibilities by
digital technology,

50:49.413 --> 50:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by new models. And you work at
one of those
new models for investigative
journalism. It's

50:55.185 --> 50:56.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a nonprofit model.

50:56.954 --> 51:00.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tell us about what that allows
you to do,
avoiding the advertising, for
example, but

51:00.524 --> 51:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also the challenges that you
face because
of it.

51:04.094 --> 51:06.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN ENGELBERG: Well, the
model doesn't
really change what you can do.

51:06.363 --> 51:10.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the old days, you had
advertiser who gave
a lot of money. And, of course,
you know,

51:10.901 --> 51:15.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they were investing in a
product, and you
could be aware of that or not as
you so chose.

51:15.406 --> 51:20.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Great newspapers always cut off
the business
side from the journalism side.
Today, we have

51:20.311 --> 51:25.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
donors. It's the same thing. We
have a wall
between the people who give and
foundations

51:25.816 --> 51:28.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and so on and the content
itself.

51:28.252 --> 51:32.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I did want to mention, by the
way, your question,
because I think we can go to
this. Pulitzer

51:32.256 --> 51:35.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prize a couple of years ago was
won by "The
Los Angeles Times" about a
little town called

51:35.759 --> 51:40.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bell, California, where the city
council voted
the city manager and the
leadership salaries

51:40.864 --> 51:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of over a million dollars a year
and 109 vacation
days each.

51:44.735 --> 51:48.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you asked the question, what
kind of stories
would missed because no
journalists are around?

51:48.439 --> 51:50.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a pretty basic story.

51:50.307 --> 51:55.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Margaret
Sullivan, what
about these new models that you
see happening

51:55.646 --> 52:00.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for investigative journalism?
Where are there
good things happening?

52:00.050 --> 52:04.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET SULLIVAN: Well, they
are springing
up over all the country.

52:04.088 --> 52:11.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ProPublica, of which Steve is
the chief editor,
is a real leader. But there are
many in different

52:11.195 --> 52:17.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communities. And there's a
question of whether
they can endure, whether they
can work with

52:17.668 --> 52:24.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their small staffs. The Texas
Tribune is a
great example of a local digital
startup that

52:24.875 --> 52:30.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does a lot of good work. So,
they're happening.
I guess it's just a matter of
whether they're

52:30.948 --> 52:32.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ultimately going to be
sustainable.

52:32.816 --> 52:37.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Steve
Engelberg, a last
brief word from you. Just
thinking about the

52:37.621 --> 52:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
movie last night and an Oscar
victory, does
that give you hope? What does
your gut tell

52:41.992 --> 52:43.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you about any difference it
might make?

52:43.994 --> 52:46.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN ENGELBERG: I think the
movie's going
to inspire more people.

52:46.830 --> 52:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have been talking on
journalism schools,

that movie find it very

example of what

the job that
they need to do in our society.

says don't

warns that

53:25.002 --> 53:30.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

he outlines some of the
statistics he says

53:30.074 --> 53:32.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we should really be paying
