GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:05.639 --> 00:07.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:07.574 --> 00:11.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: It's
a Super Tuesday sequel. Voters
in five states

00:11.712 --> 00:17.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
head to the polls, as candidates
count on
tonight's results to save or to
seal their

00:17.117 --> 00:18.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential ambitions.

00:18.986 --> 00:23.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Tuesday: As
Russia begins to withdraw forces
from Syria,

00:24.091 --> 00:29.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we look at the prospects for
peace talks as
that devastating civil war
enters its sixth

00:29.563 --> 00:31.498 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

00:31.598 --> 00:36.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And how elite
schools are boosting
student diversity by attracting
military veterans.

00:36.169 --> 00:41.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE LEADENHAM, U.S. Veteran:
We're capable
of more than what we have been
pigeonholed

00:41.475 --> 00:47.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into. So, I think it's important
to know that
we're not just these broken
people coming

00:47.948 --> 00:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back, incapable of succeeding
within society.

00:51.418 --> 00:59.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:59.626 --> 01:02.496 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:02.596 --> 01:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Five big states
come to the
fore on this Tuesday night, and
six presidential

01:12.839 --> 01:17.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates are waiting for their
judgment.
It could move front-runners
closer to wrapping

01:17.644 --> 01:20.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up the races, or give
challengers new life.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
We're going to win. I feel
terrific.

01:23.283 --> 01:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The message was
positive this
morning from John Kasich in
Westerville, Ohio.

01:28.689 --> 01:34.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The governor is aiming for a
home state win
that slows Republican
front-runner Donald

01:34.194 --> 01:36.029 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. JOHN KASICH: There were
probably missed
opportunities to get attention
early on, but

01:38.832 --> 01:45.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by continuing to run the race,
the positive
campaign is now starting to
shine through

01:45.205 --> 01:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like a beacon all over the
country.

01:47.341 --> 01:52.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ohio is one of
five states
going to the polls, along with
Florida, Missouri,

01:52.779 --> 02:00.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Illinois, and North Carolina. In
all, on the
Republican side, 358 delegates
are up for

02:00.921 --> 02:02.789 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grabs.

02:02.889 --> 02:06.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump started the day picking up
nine delegates
in caucuses held in the Northern
Mariana islands

02:06.960 --> 02:14.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Pacific, for a total of
469. Winning
big tonight could give him an
insurmountable

02:14.968 --> 02:22.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lead toward the 1,237 needed for
the nomination.
That would mean beating Kasich
in Ohio.

02:22.309 --> 02:27.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump sounded confident
today in a phone
interview with ABC's "Good
Morning America."

02:27.881 --> 02:29.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I think we're going to do well
in Ohio for

02:29.850 --> 02:34.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of those reasons. Your steel
industry
has died. Your coal industry has
died. I think

02:34.888 --> 02:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're going to do really well in
Ohio.

02:36.923 --> 02:43.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, Marco
Rubio is pinning
his remaining hopes on his home
state, Florida,

02:43.330 --> 02:49.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
although recent polls had him
flagging. And
Ted Cruz, with the most
first-place finishes

02:49.703 --> 02:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aside from Trump, has his eyes
on strong showings
in Illinois, Missouri and North
Carolina.

02:56.676 --> 03:02.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, Bernie
Sanders began
his day in Illinois. The Vermont
senator is

03:02.549 --> 03:07.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming off an upset win in
Michigan, and talked
of achieving similar results
tonight.

03:07.988 --> 03:11.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I think that, in the states that
are coming

03:11.291 --> 03:15.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down the pike, we have great
opportunities
to win many of them. So we're
feeling really

03:15.495 --> 03:17.297 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
good.

03:17.397 --> 03:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
was in North
Carolina, where she urged her
supporters to

03:20.567 --> 03:22.602 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
turn out.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
You know, somebody might say,
well, my candidate

03:24.504 --> 03:28.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is so far ahead, I don't need to
come out.
Everybody should come out.
There's so much

03:29.042 --> 03:30.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at stake in this election.

03:30.877 --> 03:36.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton is
already more than
halfway to the 2,383 legates
needed for the

03:36.249 --> 03:37.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Democratic nomination.

03:37.851 --> 03:41.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will hear from reporters in
several key
states after the news summary.

03:41.755 --> 03:46.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: The language
and violence in the presidential
campaign

03:46.593 --> 03:52.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drew criticism today from both
parties in
Washington. President Obama
spoke at an annual

03:52.332 --> 03:54.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
St. Patrick's Day luncheon.

03:54.668 --> 03:58.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without directly mentioning
Donald Trump,
he deplored what he called the
campaign's

03:59.039 --> 04:00.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vulgar and divisive rhetoric.

04:00.941 --> 04:04.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
While some maybe more to blame
than others

04:04.778 --> 04:13.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the current climate, all of
us are responsible
for reversing it, for it is a
cycle that is

04:13.453 --> 04:18.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not an accurate reflection of
America, and
it has to stop.

04:18.225 --> 04:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the Republican
side, Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
said he spoke

04:23.196 --> 04:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Trump by telephone about
attacks on protesters
at his rallies.

04:27.033 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
We had a good conversation, and
I mentioned

04:30.137 --> 04:34.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to him that I thought it would
be a good idea
for him, no matter who starts
these violent

04:34.941 --> 04:38.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
episodes, to condemn it and
discourage it.

04:38.278 --> 04:43.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Trump has rejected
criticism that
he is the one sowing division.
Instead, he

04:43.583 --> 04:45.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
says he's a uniter.

04:45.418 --> 04:50.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Obama
administration and
its Interior Department, in a
major policy

04:50.590 --> 04:55.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reversal, today banned oil
drilling in the
Atlantic Ocean. A plan floated a
year ago

04:55.662 --> 05:01.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have opened drilling lease
areas off
Virginia, the Carolinas and
Georgia. Today,

05:01.201 --> 05:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the department dropped the plan,
citing local
opposition, plus military and
commercial interests.

05:07.140 --> 05:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also today, the
administration
eased the trade embargo on Cuba
again, five

05:12.445 --> 05:17.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days before President Obama
travels to Havana.
The announcement ends the ban on
Cuban access

05:17.984 --> 05:23.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to international banking. It
also opens the
way for Cubans to play Major
League Baseball

05:23.223 --> 05:25.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to relax limits on travel to
Cuba.

05:25.892 --> 05:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hundreds of
migrants who crossed
into Macedonia from Greece
yesterday were

05:30.931 --> 05:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forcibly returned today. The
group of about
700 had bypassed a border fence
and forded

05:37.837 --> 05:42.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a river to gain entry, but they
were made
to walk back to Greece.

05:42.609 --> 05:47.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One Syrian woman said she had to
shelter her
children under plastic bags
overnight.

05:48.048 --> 05:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): They
told us walk,
keep walking, they will let us
in, and we

05:54.588 --> 05:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be done with all the rain
and the cold.
But they didn't let us through.
We got scared

05:59.226 --> 06:03.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for our children, and up there,
it's very
cold. We didn't have tents or
anything with

06:03.630 --> 06:05.465 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

06:05.565 --> 06:09.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Other refugees
said they were
beaten and stunned with Tasers
by Macedonian

06:09.169 --> 06:10.971 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces.

06:11.071 --> 06:15.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The U.S. military
now confirms
a top Islamic State commander
has died after

06:15.108 --> 06:21.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
being severely wounded in
Eastern Syria. Omar
al Shishani, an ethnic Chechen,
was targeted

06:21.214 --> 06:27.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a U.S. airstrike on March 4.
A news agency
affiliated with ISIS denied the
report of

06:27.254 --> 06:28.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his death.

06:29.055 --> 06:33.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Myanmar,
half-a-century
of military domination formally
ended, as

06:33.860 --> 06:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parliament elected Htin Kyaw to
be president.
He's a close ally of
pro-democracy leader

06:39.733 --> 06:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aung San Suu Kyi. Lawmakers
broke into thunderous
applause when the result was
announced. Suu

06:45.772 --> 06:51.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kyi says the new president will
act as her
proxy, because she is
constitutionally barred

06:51.478 --> 06:53.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the office.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, Washington,
D.C.'s subway system announced
an emergency

06:56.850 --> 07:02.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shutdown starting at midnight
tonight due
to safety concerns. Officials
ordered an inspection

07:02.789 --> 07:08.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all electrical components on
the tracks
after two fires in the last
year. The shutdown

07:08.528 --> 07:10.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
runs at least into early
Thursday morning.

07:11.031 --> 07:15.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The National
Football League
today backed an executive who's
acknowledged

07:15.368 --> 07:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a link between football and the
brain diseases
like CTE. Yesterday, the NFL's
top health

07:21.574 --> 07:25.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and safety official said
research -- quote
-- "certainly shows a
connection."

07:25.845 --> 07:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a spokesman said the
comments -- quote
-- "accurately reflect" the
league's view.

07:30.684 --> 07:35.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And on Wall Street,
the Dow Jones
industrial average gained 22
points to close

07:36.089 --> 07:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
above 17250. The Nasdaq fell 21
points, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped three.

07:44.030 --> 07:49.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the latest
from today's primaries with the
highest stakes;

07:49.369 --> 07:55.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia's withdrawal and the
Syrian peace process;
the mutual benefits of having
more veterans

07:55.108 --> 08:09.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on college campuses; and much
more.

08:09.622 --> 08:13.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Voters got their say in five key
states across
the country today.

08:13.193 --> 08:17.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Ohio Governor John Kasich,
today's home
state outcome could determine
whether his

08:17.931 --> 08:22.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican campaign continues.
And on the
Democratic side, Bernie Sanders
is angling

08:22.969 --> 08:24.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for an upset.

08:24.838 --> 08:29.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
John Yang is at Kasich
headquarters outside
of Cleveland, and he joins us
now with the

08:29.175 --> 08:31.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
latest.

08:31.211 --> 08:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John, in Ohio, we're talking
about 66 delegates
on the Republican side, 143
Democratic delegates

08:36.716 --> 08:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at stake. And yet it seems as if
the Angela
Rye that we have seen throughout
this campaign

08:41.888 --> 08:43.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is cutting across both parties.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's exactly right,
Gwen.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we're in the field
house at Baldwin
Wallace University, and in
another part of

08:50.897 --> 08:55.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the building, there is voting
going on. It's
a polling place. I talked to
some of the voters

08:55.301 --> 09:00.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there, and some of the
Democratic supporters
of Bernie Sanders are expressing
the same

09:00.340 --> 09:02.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sorts of things you hear at
Donald Trump rallies.

09:02.776 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They feel that the establishment
has failed
them. They aren't getting sort
of the attention

09:07.580 --> 09:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the benefits that they want
from the government.
It's sort of the flip side of
it. I talked,

09:12.118 --> 09:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for instance, to 29-year-old Joe
Dukonowski
(ph). He is a software engineer.
He told me

09:17.190 --> 09:22.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he makes about $90,000 a year,
but because
he owes almost as much or
actually a little

09:22.695 --> 09:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bit more in student loans, he
feels he can't
buy a house.

09:27.200 --> 09:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has health insurance, but the
deductible
is so high, he feels he can't
afford to get

09:32.439 --> 09:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sick and go to a doctor. He says
he's going
to be paying off those student
loans for so

09:36.976 --> 09:41.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long that once the loans are
paid off, he's
going to have to start saving
for retirement

09:42.081 --> 09:46.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then. He feels that the system
has not helped
him.

09:46.152 --> 09:52.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he feels he's too rich
for the Democrats
to worry about, too poor for the
Republicans

09:52.125 --> 09:55.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to worry about him. We heard
much the same
thing from Christine Hamlet
(ph), a young

09:55.929 --> 10:02.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman who went to college to be
a teacher.
Unable to find a teacher's job,
she's working

10:02.101 --> 10:07.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an insurance agent. She says
she wanted
to be a teacher, can't find a
job, and now

10:07.340 --> 10:09.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she's going to be paying for it
for the rest
of her life.

10:10.076 --> 10:14.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She voted for Bernie Sanders,
too, but she
was voting today because she
didn't think

10:14.314 --> 10:21.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was going to be able to vote
for him in
November because she thinks the
deck is stacked

10:21.721 --> 10:24.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against him and that Hillary
Clinton will
get the nomination -- Gwen.

10:24.791 --> 10:29.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Briefly, John, do
you see any
sign of a stop Trump movement on
the ground?

10:29.162 --> 10:32.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There is some of that
in some interesting
ways.

10:32.699 --> 10:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked -- one of the voters I
talked to
was a lifelong Democrat who took
a Republican

10:37.737 --> 10:42.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ballot today for the first time
in 42 years
of voting. He said he's a
Democrat, but he

10:43.042 --> 10:48.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to vote for John Kasich
to try to stop
Donald Trump. He said it's first
time he ever

10:48.147 --> 10:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked for a Democratic ballot. I
asked him
how it felt.

10:51.050 --> 10:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he felt his father
spinning in his
grave -- Gwen.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And you talked to
John Kasich
briefly today at the polling
place. Do you

10:57.524 --> 11:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a sense that this is do or
die, that
he thinks it's do or die for
him?

11:01.895 --> 11:06.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Oh, he knows that if
he doesn't
pull it out today, it's all over
for him.

11:06.432 --> 11:11.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He talked about the pride he
felt as a boy,
as a young man, as a man from a
small town

11:11.704 --> 11:15.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Pennsylvania voting for
himself today for
president.

11:15.341 --> 11:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also said that he is still
proud of the
fact that he ran this positive
campaign, the

11:19.679 --> 11:24.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bite you heard earlier. He knows
he missed
some opportunities for
attention, but he does

11:24.851 --> 11:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say that, if he goes on, he's
going to be
harsher and tougher on what he
calls the very

11:30.256 --> 11:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disturbing rhetoric of Donald
Trump on minorities
and on women -- Gwen.

11:34.794 --> 11:38.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: John Yang doing
great work out
there for us, we will talk to
you again.

11:38.998 --> 11:45.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Florida is a
make-or-break
moment for Senator Marco Rubio's
campaign.

11:45.238 --> 11:49.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is
expected to
continue her Southern sweep with
a win the

11:49.509 --> 11:51.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining us from Tallahassee is
Matt Dixon.
He's Florida bureau chief for
Politico.

11:54.781 --> 11:59.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Matt, first of all, the
Republicans. Why
does Donald Trump seem to be
doing so well

11:59.319 --> 12:01.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Florida?

12:01.287 --> 12:05.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT DIXON, Politico: Well, I
think the -- sort
of the feel that we have seen
nationally in

12:05.425 --> 12:09.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
previous early states is
absolutely showing
up here in Florida.

12:09.729 --> 12:14.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the -- the sort of best
numbers to
exemplify that going into
Election Day, about

12:15.001 --> 12:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1.1 million Republicans had
voted by mail
or early voting; 23 percent of
those, nearly

12:21.140 --> 12:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a quarter of that, had not voted
in the past
three elections or the past
three primaries.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, the electorate is expanding.

12:27.981 --> 12:32.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And folks who have not
historically voted
are voting in fairly large
numbers here. And

12:32.719 --> 12:38.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that speaks well for
Trump and certainly
to a lesser extent Senator Cruz.

12:38.224 --> 12:43.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Matt, what
do voters say to you about why
Donald Trump?

12:43.463 --> 12:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT DIXON: I feel the same sort
of sentiment
that we just heard from Ohio is
very much

12:52.472 --> 12:54.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
evident here as well.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's large pockets of the
state -- South
Florida, which is kind of a
stronghold for

12:58.044 --> 13:04.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Rubio, might have a bit
less of this,
but in large sort of northern
swathes of conservative

13:04.851 --> 13:09.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Florida, there's the same
sort of sentiment.
It's the anti-establishment
stuff really bubbling

13:09.455 --> 13:11.290 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
over.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The past few election cycles, we
have kind
of heard about it, this idea
that the establishment

13:14.927 --> 13:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or those who sort of run the
political class
are mad, but we hadn't seen it
sort of personified

13:20.566 --> 13:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the polls the way we are this
year.

13:23.569 --> 13:27.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in Florida, that's
certainly the case.
Donald Trump has a very large
lead. There's

13:27.874 --> 13:31.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been a few outliers that have
had him beating
Marco Rubio by just seven or
eight points.

13:31.778 --> 13:37.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those are outliers. He's had
some pretty
large leads in all recent polls,
and a lot

13:37.250 --> 13:39.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the things that we have been
hearing about
for a while now.

13:39.919 --> 13:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, conversely,
why home state
boy Marco Rubio not doing any
better than

13:45.091 --> 13:46.626 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he is?

13:46.726 --> 13:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT DIXON: Well, it's -- I
think he's kind
of gotten caught up in the wave.

13:50.463 --> 13:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To begin with, there was --
before Senator
Rubio got in, there were some
people who didn't

13:55.468 --> 13:59.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think this was his year. When
Jeb Bush was
running, there was a lot of
people who were

13:59.972 --> 14:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skeptical he was even going to
get in and
challenge him. And then, once he
did, he's,

14:03.576 --> 14:06.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think, topped a lot of
people's expectations.

14:06.446 --> 14:10.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just that he got caught
up, like
a lot of other folks, including
Governor Bush

14:10.349 --> 14:16.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did, in sort of this Trump
anti-establishment
wave. And he's got a few
positive signs here,

14:17.023 --> 14:21.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he needs a good showing. One
of the things
going into Election Day, the
Hispanic portion

14:21.494 --> 14:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the electorate here is voting
2 percent
-- 2 to 3 percent higher than it
has in the

14:30.636 --> 14:32.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Marco Rubio.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's not going to be enough,
more than
likely. And if the electorate is
doing what

14:35.908 --> 14:39.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it looks like it's going to do
in probably
a record turnout, he might
actually finish

14:39.679 --> 14:40.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
third place to Ted Cruz.

14:40.646 --> 14:41.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whoa.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT DIXON: He's going to have a
difficult
time certainly winning.

14:44.083 --> 14:47.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, right now, it's -- he's
going to be fighting
for third, because it's looking
to be record

14:47.153 --> 14:50.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turnout here in Florida, which
might not be
a great sign for him, because
it's a lot of

14:50.857 --> 14:52.625 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new voters.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just very
quickly -- and
we don't -- we're out of time --
but Hillary

14:54.827 --> 14:56.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton seems to be in pretty
comfortable
shape.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are going to have to
leave it there.

14:58.664 --> 15:02.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matt Dixon, reporting for us,
thanks very
much.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT DIXON: Thank you.

15:04.170 --> 15:08.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: For both the
Republican and the
Democratic candidates, the
stakes are especially

15:08.141 --> 15:10.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
high and uncertain in Illinois.

15:10.610 --> 15:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we turn to Amanda
Vinicky, statehouse
bureau chief for Illinois Public
Radio and

15:15.281 --> 15:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WUIS. She joins us from Chicago.

15:17.817 --> 15:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about 69 GOP
delegates up for
stake in Illinois tonight. But
there is so

15:22.455 --> 15:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much uncertainty about what's
happening there.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMANDA VINICKY, Illinois Public
Radio: Yes,
there is a lot of uncertainty.

15:27.093 --> 15:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you had early on Donald
Trump ahead in
the polls. Of course, we had
that big Chicago

15:32.899 --> 15:38.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rally. That wasn't necessarily
an area where
he was expected to do well when
he was here

15:38.304 --> 15:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Chicago on Friday of last
week. He was
walking really into a hotbed of
activism right

15:44.811 --> 15:48.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there, but that, of course,
doesn't seem to
bother his supporters any.

15:48.381 --> 15:53.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They love that he isn't
concerned about P.C.
And he did have a very
well-attended rally

15:53.352 --> 15:58.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 150 miles to the south of
Chicago in
Bloomington just days later. The
only problem

15:58.558 --> 16:04.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was that so many people
attended, apparently,
a local cemetery nearby became a
parking lot.

16:04.230 --> 16:09.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that, of course, got some
locals angry.
Nonetheless, we have seen Ted
Cruz rising

16:09.468 --> 16:14.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the polls here, and that's
largely expected
to be because down-state
Illinois really is

16:14.807 --> 16:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more that typical evangelist,
God fearing,
rural country. And it may be
that they're

16:19.979 --> 16:21.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
turning there.

16:21.914 --> 16:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, Illinois already has sort
of swept into
what Donald Trump is selling
with our current

16:27.320 --> 16:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governor, Bruce Rauner, who
campaigned that
he was a successful businessman
who couldn't

16:31.991 --> 16:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be bought and he self-funded his
own campaign.
But Illinois is in its ninth
month without

16:37.263 --> 16:39.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a budget, and that's really
hurting down-state.

16:39.498 --> 16:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that may be also what is
turning down-state
voters toward Cruz instead of
Donald Trump.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
Democratic
side, because we talked about
how Marco Rubio's

16:47.340 --> 16:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
home state is Florida. John
Kasich's home
state is Ohio.

16:51.577 --> 16:55.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And now we have Hillary
Clinton's home state
of Illinois, which people
forget, but it's

16:56.048 --> 16:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not -- this is not a slam dunk
for her.

16:57.950 --> 17:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA VINICKY: No. And it was
largely expected
to be. And early polls had that.
She is a

17:02.355 --> 17:09.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hometown girl, and she really
does have most
of the Illinois Democratic
leaders, that power

17:09.161 --> 17:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
base of the Chicago, Cook County
-- quote,
unquote -- "machine" behind her.

17:13.866 --> 17:18.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it would be huge for both
those leaders,
as well as, of course, for
Hillary Clinton

17:18.237 --> 17:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if she were to lose. She had her
husband,
Bill Clinton, working the polls
in Chicago

17:23.576 --> 17:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this morning. But also this
morning, Bernie
Sanders was at a very popular
Chicago restaurant,

17:28.547 --> 17:31.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and he's doing all he can to
drum up support.

17:31.450 --> 17:35.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Bernie Sanders, in
addition to
talking about trade a lot in
these Midwestern

17:35.688 --> 17:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states, Missouri as well, which
votes tonight,
has also been bringing attention
to her ties

17:41.761 --> 17:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the mayor of Chicago, who is
not as popular
as he once was, to put it
mildly.

17:46.299 --> 17:50.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMANDA VINICKY: To put it
mildly, you're right.
This gets back to what I said,
that kind of

17:50.603 --> 17:53.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hotbed of activism that Donald
Trump had walked
into in Chicago.

17:53.906 --> 18:00.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are still a lot of angry,
particularly
progressives and liberals, about
a video that

18:00.279 --> 18:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showed Chicago police shooting
16 times a
black teenager. And there is a
belief that

18:06.686 --> 18:12.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mayor Emanuel glossed over that,
and had that
come out before his mayoral
election, somebody

18:12.291 --> 18:16.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has been campaigning with
Bernie Sanders
-- that's County Commission Chuy
Garcia -- that,

18:16.963 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, we may have a different
mayor of Chicago
right now.

18:20.800 --> 18:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, Bernie Sanders is doing
all he can
to bring Chuy Garcia out on the
campaign trail

18:26.439 --> 18:29.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with him, and that has led to a
whole lot
of applause at these Chicago
rallies.

18:29.842 --> 18:34.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Amanda Vinicky of
Illinois Public
Radio and WUIS, thank you.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMANDA VINICKY: Thank you.

18:36.082 --> 18:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to North
Carolina,
where Donald Trump leads in the
polls by double

18:40.553 --> 18:45.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
digits. Despite controversy
surrounding his
campaign, he continues to
attract strong support.

18:45.992 --> 18:51.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked to one family with
differing politics
spanning three generations to
hear why they're

18:51.831 --> 18:53.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going all in for Trump.

18:53.632 --> 18:59.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GRACE TILLY, Donald Trump
Supporter: This
is my first time voting. Being
33, that's

18:59.271 --> 19:01.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of crazy, but it says a
lot.

19:01.540 --> 19:05.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FARRON TILLY, Donald Trump
Supporter: I'm
actually a registered Democrat,
but I'm voting

19:05.544 --> 19:07.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Trump this time.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETE TILLY, Donald Trump
Supporter: This is
my first time I have ever worked
on political

19:09.615 --> 19:14.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign. My family members are
joining me,
my son, my daughter-in-law, and
my grandchild.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been such an awesome
experience.

19:16.489 --> 19:21.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, father God, we just thank
you that you're
going to use Donald Trump for
your glory in

19:21.627 --> 19:23.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your kingdom, oh, father God.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Amen.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE TILLY: My biggest point is,
if you want
to be here, conform to the
country. If you

19:28.034 --> 19:34.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't want to be here, go home.
I was born
in Montreal, Canada. And when I
started school,

19:34.874 --> 19:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for us, we were told, look, you
either speak
English or you're not going to
pass your class.

19:40.012 --> 19:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in today's society, it's
like we cater
to the people, whatever language
they speak.

19:46.452 --> 19:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I came in the States, I joined
the military,
and then I even went and got
naturalized,

19:52.792 --> 19:55.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I'm very proud to say I'm an
American
citizen.

19:55.161 --> 19:59.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRACE TILLY: Hello. My name is
Grace. And
I'm a volunteer for Donald
Trump's presidential

19:59.632 --> 20:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign here in North Carolina.

20:01.667 --> 20:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fayetteville is a very big
military town with
Fort Bragg being right there. My
father-in-law

20:08.174 --> 20:15.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and my husband are both
veterans, and the
whole idea of the care of the
veterans being

20:15.347 --> 20:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
subpar is very true. My whole
family is supporting
Trump, down to my 11-year-old.

20:21.587 --> 20:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BOY: No other candidate stands
up for Americans
like Donald Trump.

20:25.391 --> 20:30.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRACE TILLY: It was both our
idea for him
to stay home from school today,
so that he

20:30.963 --> 20:33.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can see democracy in action.

20:33.365 --> 20:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Do we love North Carolina? Do we
love it?

20:37.269 --> 20:38.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

20:38.370 --> 20:40.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Beautiful.
Beautiful.

20:40.272 --> 20:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRACE TILLY: I definitely think,
with Trump's
business savvy, his mind, I
think that he's

20:45.478 --> 20:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be the best one that's
going to be
able to help us.

20:50.015 --> 20:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our family has been impacted in
a very big
way by the recession. We
definitely at times

20:58.757 --> 21:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are living paycheck to paycheck.
And my husband
is having hard time finding work
as well.

21:04.130 --> 21:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FARRON TILLY: It hurts my pride.
I'm a person
that is used to being able to
take care of

21:08.367 --> 21:13.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my family. One of my biggest
goals in life
is to give my children an easier
life than

21:13.772 --> 21:18.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my own, send them to college,
get them good
degrees.

21:18.177 --> 21:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right now, with what I'm
making and how
little I'm working, I don't know
if I'm going

21:23.015 --> 21:24.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be able to do that.

21:24.683 --> 21:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We built a massive
company.
Oh, no. Get out of here. Go home
to mom.

21:36.529 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE TILLY: All these protesters
and all this
stuff, and people saying he's
racist, and

21:43.435 --> 21:47.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then the Black Lives Matter, you
know what?
Red lives matter, because, when
you bleed,

21:47.706 --> 21:49.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we all bleed red.

21:49.675 --> 21:53.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MITT ROMNEY (R), Former
Presidential Candidate:
He cheers assaults on
protesters. This is

21:53.179 --> 21:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the very brand of anger that has
led other
nations into the abyss.

21:58.184 --> 22:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRACE TILLY: What Mitt Romney is
doing is
only solidifying our reasons why
we love Donald

22:07.359 --> 22:09.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump, why we're going to vote
for him.

22:09.328 --> 22:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE TILLY: Donald Trump is on
point when
he says this is for the people,
this is not

22:14.366 --> 22:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for him, that he represents the
people, and
without his people, he wouldn't
have nothing.

22:21.507 --> 22:33.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now we're ready for another
day of riding
and going out and helping Donald
Trump.

22:33.752 --> 22:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You can follow all
of today's
races on our live results page
and on our

22:39.558 --> 22:47.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
home page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

22:47.299 --> 22:58.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today marks five
years since
the armed uprising in Syria
began, before

22:59.044 --> 23:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it turned into a full-blown
civil war. And
this grim anniversary was marked
with significant

23:04.483 --> 23:06.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
diplomatic and military moves.

23:06.819 --> 23:11.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We start with some background
from chief foreign
affairs correspondent Margaret
Warner.

23:11.223 --> 23:16.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: A hero's
welcome awaited
the first Russian pilots to
return home from

23:16.295 --> 23:22.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their air campaign in Syria.
They flew out
of Syria hours after President
Vladimir Putin's

23:22.534 --> 23:27.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surprise announcement that the
main part of
Russia's several thousand forces
would withdraw.

23:27.973 --> 23:32.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): I believe that the
goal set out

23:32.211 --> 23:37.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Ministry of Defense and
the armed forces
has in large part been
fulfilled, and that's

23:37.283 --> 23:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why I ordered the minister of
defense to start
the pullout.

23:40.419 --> 23:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Moscow has said
its six months
of intensive bombing was aimed
at Islamic

23:45.858 --> 23:52.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
State forces. But, by all
accounts, the principal
targets were Western-backed and
other rebels

23:52.264 --> 23:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fighting the government of
Bashar al-Assad.

23:55.701 --> 24:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva today, site of talks
to resolve
the conflict politically,
opposition leaders

24:01.073 --> 24:02.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
welcomed the Russian decision.

24:02.975 --> 24:06.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SALIM AL-MUSLAT, High
Negotiations Committee:
If they are serious about
pulling out all

24:06.211 --> 24:13.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these -- this will be an end to
dictatorship.
It will be an end to crimes in
Syria, and

24:13.519 --> 24:16.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it will help us to put an end to
terrorism
there in Syria.

24:16.889 --> 24:22.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Syrian
officials, meanwhile,
insisted Putin's move was made
in full coordination

24:22.561 --> 24:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the Assad government.

24:24.463 --> 24:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Margaret
joins me now.

24:27.266 --> 24:31.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Margaret, U.S. officials
think this is
for real, this pullout, and do
they think

24:31.236 --> 24:32.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's significant?

24:32.871 --> 24:35.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Yes, they do,
Judy, surprisingly,
given all the distrust.

24:35.140 --> 24:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had no advanced private
notice from the
Russians about this, but there
was an Obama-Putin

24:39.845 --> 24:45.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phone call scheduled for 3:00 in
the afternoon
here. And they actually do think
it's for

24:45.250 --> 24:47.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
real.

24:47.152 --> 24:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they look at is how it
was ballyhooed
in Russia. They broke into the
dinnertime

24:50.389 --> 24:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television hour. He proclaimed
the troops
were coming home and victory.
And one of the

24:55.728 --> 25:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
headlines in Russia even said
"Mission Accomplished,"
which is, of course, perhaps
rueful.

25:01.400 --> 25:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, Russia had reached a
fork in the
road militarily, because their
theory had

25:06.739 --> 25:12.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been use airstrikes, and then
have Syrian
forces take ground. The Syrian
forces didn't

25:12.144 --> 25:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turn out to be quite competent
enough, so
Putin was facing a choice: Does
Russia put

25:15.748 --> 25:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in ground forces? Didn't want to
get into
that quagmire.

25:19.451 --> 25:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, number three, of
course, Putin -- on
the eve of the Syria peace
talks, Putin has

25:24.189 --> 25:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
achieved what he really wanted,
which was
to be seen as a major player in
the Middle

25:28.093 --> 25:33.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
East that has to be reckoned
with, number
two, and, two, to establish that
there wouldn't

25:33.265 --> 25:39.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be another leader anywhere in
his neighborhood
that would be removed by force
by Western-backed

25:39.104 --> 25:40.839 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces.

25:40.939 --> 25:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, why do the
sources you
have been -- I know you have
been talking

25:42.975 --> 25:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Americans and Russians. Why
do they think
he did this and why right now?

25:46.311 --> 25:52.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: They think he
did this right
now because of the talks
beginning right now,

25:52.484 --> 25:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that they wanted to send a
message to
Assad that, look, we have come
in, we have

25:56.889 --> 25:58.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
helped you.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As one official said, they're
trying to let
Assad know, you have got a
check, but it's

26:01.059 --> 26:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not a blank check. There's a
number in it.
And you have to get realistic at
the talks.

26:05.431 --> 26:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the foreign minister of
Syria just said
last week, oh, a red line for
us, there's

26:09.268 --> 26:14.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no discussion of any change in
government
or that Assad might go. And they
were just

26:14.139 --> 26:18.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying, whoa, boy, we're not
going to be watching
your back that way.

26:18.610 --> 26:23.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that was the number
one thing.
There is no love loss between
Putin and Assad.

26:23.782 --> 26:29.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, one of his top officials
has been
quoted as calling him a bastard
and a butcher,

26:29.221 --> 26:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so there was -- not that Putin
acts for sentimental
reasons.

26:32.291 --> 26:38.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But -- and then, finally, as I
said, he's
been recognized, Putin -- they
think Putin

26:38.363 --> 26:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is ready to do this because he's
been recognized
as a world power and that he
will be now more

26:44.136 --> 26:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
interested in cooperating.

26:46.071 --> 26:49.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I was asking
because people
would say, well, if they're
pulling out, why

26:49.575 --> 26:53.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did they go in, in the first
place if they
thought Assad was a butcher and
such a bad

26:53.345 --> 26:55.180 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
actor?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, because
it was preserving
Russian interests. In other
words, there's

26:57.583 --> 27:01.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the naval base on the
Mediterranean. They
have now been able to also build
an air base.

27:01.720 --> 27:05.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're keeping those, by the
way, and they're
keeping troops and planes at
both.

27:05.724 --> 27:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the U.S. is going to be
monitoring that
closely. And so they prevented a
leader from

27:11.597 --> 27:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being deposed. And I think that
was the number
one reason.

27:14.700 --> 27:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two other quick
things, Margaret.
Effect on the peace talks?

27:19.071 --> 27:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Peace talks,
Judy, they're
not wildly optimistic.

27:22.207 --> 27:27.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One official said to me, it
opens the door
more to some kind of agreement.
But you have

27:27.846 --> 27:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got all those players, as we all
know, the
U.S. and the Europeans and the
Russians and

27:31.617 --> 27:35.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Iranians and the opposition
in the Gulf
states.

27:35.153 --> 27:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a real -- as somebody
said to me,
if it were easy, we wouldn't be
here five

27:39.625 --> 27:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years from the start of the
conflict.

27:41.593 --> 27:45.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just very
quickly, finally,
situation on the ground, where
does this leave

27:45.264 --> 27:47.065 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

27:47.165 --> 27:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Basically,
Assad is in a
stronger position. The question
is, can his

27:49.067 --> 27:53.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
forces keep and hold the
territory that the
Russians have cleared open for
them?

27:53.705 --> 27:58.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They believe the opposition was
badly pounded
by the Russians, so some groups
are intact.

27:58.744 --> 28:04.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some are actually in worse
shape. And ISIL,
they -- the U.S. intelligence
believes, has

28:04.349 --> 28:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been slightly weakened, has lost
a little
more territory, but that wasn't
said with

28:09.121 --> 28:10.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
huge confidence.

28:10.856 --> 28:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we are really still on a
stalemate on
the ground, and then just hoping
that all

28:14.393 --> 28:17.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the sides are so tired that they
might be
ready to deal.

28:18.063 --> 28:22.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Margaret Warner,
some terrific
reporting. Thank you.

28:23.068 --> 28:29.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Thanks.

28:29.408 --> 28:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now: offering higher
education
to those who have served.

28:39.151 --> 28:43.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many Americans join the military
right out
of high school. And once they
return, some

28:43.488 --> 28:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleges are now giving them a
chance to learn
at the country's top-tier
schools.

28:49.227 --> 28:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Jackie
Judd reports
for our weekly education series,
Making the

28:54.433 --> 28:56.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Grade.

28:56.368 --> 29:02.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: This was the
classroom that taught
Nicole Leadenham the lessons of
war during

29:02.241 --> 29:04.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deployments in Iraq and
Afghanistan.

29:04.476 --> 29:08.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE LEADENHAM, U.S. Veteran:
I left for
basic training 10 hours after I
graduated

29:08.947 --> 29:12.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
high school. So that was going
to be what
I was going to do.

29:12.484 --> 29:18.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Today, this is the
34-year old's
classroom, Vassar College in New
York's Hudson

29:18.890 --> 29:20.659 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Valley.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE LEADENHAM: I think that
this is the
time that I was meant to be
here, at this

29:23.795 --> 29:29.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stage in my life. I can really
take advantage
of the academics and, you know,
learning.

29:29.835 --> 29:35.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Leadenham, a junior
and one of
30 post-9/11 vets at Vassar, is
here because

29:35.807 --> 29:41.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president Catharine Hill wanted
to somehow
close the education gap between
young people

29:41.813 --> 29:47.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who go off to elite campuses
like this one
and those who enlist and go off
to fight the

29:48.053 --> 29:50.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wars.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHARINE BOND HILL, President,
Vassar College:
More of the young men and women
who are enlisting

29:52.758 --> 30:00.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are coming from lower
socioeconomic backgrounds.
And it just seems to me that
part of the reward

30:00.298 --> 30:04.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the return for doing that is
that they
get access to education when
they come back.

30:04.102 --> 30:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Did you feel that
this grateful
nation notion, was it words and
not action?

30:12.678 --> 30:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHARINE BOND HILL: I think the
evidence
absolutely suggested that it was
words and

30:17.416 --> 30:19.184 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not action.

30:19.284 --> 30:23.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: The Veterans
Administration says
more than one million vets are
using G.I.

30:23.321 --> 30:30.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefits. Most attend public or
for-profit
schools. The number at top-tier
colleges and

30:30.195 --> 30:34.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
universities is so small, it is
not even known.

30:34.232 --> 30:41.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A few years back, Vassar
invested in a campaign
to attract veterans to apply.
None did, even

30:42.040 --> 30:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though their education would
have been fully
paid for. So, the college turned
to the Posse

30:47.979 --> 30:52.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Foundation, which is expert at
reaching nontraditional
students.

30:52.584 --> 30:59.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For 25 years, it's been sending
groups, or
posses, of students to elite
colleges, students

30:59.825 --> 31:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with academic and leadership
potential who
don't fit the mold.

31:04.129 --> 31:07.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Founder Debbie Bial thought the
same model
would work for veterans.

31:07.899 --> 31:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE BIAL, Founder, Posse
Foundation: Posse
is about helping the top
colleges and universities

31:13.438 --> 31:19.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think about how to build a
diverse student
body, how to get as rich a
dialogue going

31:19.945 --> 31:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on campus as they possibly can,
how to create
community and build bridges
across the various

31:26.051 --> 31:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communities on campus. It made
sense to us
to include a piece of our
population that

31:33.525 --> 31:35.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
served the country.

31:35.393 --> 31:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SMITH, U.S. Veteran: I
think it's
going to allow for the
trajectory of my life

31:36.995 --> 31:39.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be more vertical, by virtue
of being here.

31:39.631 --> 31:44.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Posse veteran
Michael Smith,
who grew up on Chicago's South
Side, is a

31:44.369 --> 31:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sophomore at Wesleyan University
in Middletown,
Connecticut. That school joined
the program

31:50.142 --> 31:52.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two years ago.

31:52.110 --> 31:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SMITH: By virtue of the
educational
experience I'm getting, by
virtue of the skills

31:55.247 --> 31:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm developing, and by virtue of
the resources
that are -- that I just wouldn't
have had

31:59.584 --> 32:01.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
access to.

32:01.486 --> 32:04.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Before arriving on
campus, the
veterans go through a kind of
boot camp in

32:04.322 --> 32:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York City. It is four weeks
of preparing
for rigorous academics, learning
how to craft

32:10.562 --> 32:16.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a college term paper, and
team-building, so
the veterans know that, once
they get here,

32:16.334 --> 32:19.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have a circle of support if
they need
it.

32:19.638 --> 32:24.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are still hurdles.
Leadenham needed
to brush up on some old,
forgotten skills.

32:24.409 --> 32:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE LEADENHAM: I had problems
with knowing
how to study. It's a very
tangible skill that

32:29.981 --> 32:35.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't have anymore, and I
couldn't even
remember how I had done it
before. So, I had

32:35.187 --> 32:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gone to my professors' office
hours, stuff
like that, being like, how can I
better absorb

32:39.925 --> 32:41.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the material?

32:41.726 --> 32:46.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Another Vassar vet,
Eduardo De
La Torre, lives off campus with
his young

32:46.731 --> 32:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family. As the leader of a
first-responder
medical unit in Iraq, he
frequently faced

32:53.238 --> 32:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life-and-death situations. With
that past
experience and his current
family obligations,

33:00.078 --> 33:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he admits that mixing with other
younger students
can be awkward.

33:03.982 --> 33:06.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EDUARDO DE LA TORRE, U.S.
Veteran: They're
like, yes, we're going to do a
study group

33:07.052 --> 33:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. I will text you later.
And the next
thing you know, you're getting a
text at midnight:

33:10.222 --> 33:14.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Hey, we're going to go meet up
at the retreat
to go study for like an hour
over this."

33:14.659 --> 33:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's been difficult building
relationships
with the students.

33:18.930 --> 33:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Wesleyan sophomore
Bryan Stascavage
found himself in the middle of a
full-throated

33:25.971 --> 33:29.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
culture clash on the very
liberal campus.

33:29.441 --> 33:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stascavage, an Iraq War veteran
and a conservative,
was vilified after writing a
column for the

33:35.580 --> 33:39.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college newspaper critical of
Black Lives
Matter.

33:39.317 --> 33:42.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STASCAVAGE, U.S. Veteran:
The veterans
that live here at the house with
me looked

33:42.354 --> 33:44.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at me wide-eyed like, what did
you do, what
did you write?

33:44.823 --> 33:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I knew that the articles
that I were writing
were not the prevailing opinion
on campus.

33:50.929 --> 33:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I knew that it was only a
matter of time
when, I like to say that I
connect with a

33:54.866 --> 33:56.701 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beehive.

33:56.801 --> 33:58.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ROTH, President,
Wesleyan University:
Unlike a fighting unit, where
you really need

33:58.670 --> 34:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cohesion and you all have to
point in the
same direction, at a university,
you can afford

34:02.874 --> 34:08.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dissent and controversy, as long
as you learn
to listen while that's going on.

34:08.146 --> 34:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Though difficult in
the moment,
Wesleyan president Michael Roth
says the episode

34:13.385 --> 34:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ultimately was good for the
community.

34:15.754 --> 34:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL ROTH: That's what you
want, because,
if you're learning to listen,
you're learning

34:19.090 --> 34:19.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to learn.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACKIE JUDD: It became a
teachable moment.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL ROTH: It became a very
teachable moment.

34:23.261 --> 34:26.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN STASCAVAGE: I don't want
to be in an
environment where everybody
thinks the same

34:26.431 --> 34:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as me, because you just don't
learn that way.

34:28.867 --> 34:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDUARDO DE LA TORRE: I think the
military
is stereotypically seen as
something very

34:33.705 --> 34:38.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative, and being in a
very liberal
campus, you can feel shut off,
and you can

34:38.843 --> 34:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel like my voice isn't going
to be accepted
here, and it's not going to be
heard.

34:43.848 --> 34:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Still, many of the
younger, more
traditional students clearly
appreciate being

34:48.153 --> 34:52.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exposed to the experience and

their ex-military classmates.

MAGGIE KENNEDY, Vassar College:
I think it's
great because it gives a lot of
different

34:55.427 --> 34:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perspectives, especially at a
liberal school,
where a lot of people maybe not
pro-military,

34:58.363 --> 35:00.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
per se.

35:00.265 --> 35:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANIV YAFFE, Vassar College:
It's easy to
in a class criticize American
foreign policy,

35:04.035 --> 35:08.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example. You know, we're so
distant from
things like Iraq and
Afghanistan, but when

35:08.840 --> 35:12.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have a soldier who has been
there, it
really changes the conversation.

35:13.044 --> 35:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDUARDO DE LA TORRE: A student
came up to
me and they said, "I really
appreciate you

35:17.515 --> 35:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about that, because your
service reminded
me of my grandfather, and he was
a World War

35:24.389 --> 35:28.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
II vet, and it was really hard
for him to
talk about anything. And it just
made me really

35:28.593 --> 35:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appreciate your service and what
you did for
me."

35:31.896 --> 35:33.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a meaningful gesture.

35:33.765 --> 35:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: A thousand veterans
applied to
Posse for the 30 slots in the
next freshman

35:38.803 --> 35:47.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
class, which, along with
Wesleyan and Vassar,
will include Dartmouth College
in New Hampshire.

35:47.212 --> 35:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Posse's Debbie Bial expects
that, in five
years, about a dozen private
liberal arts

35:51.716 --> 35:57.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleges will be a part of the
program, giving
other vets opportunities they
never would

35:57.222 --> 36:03.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have imagined, while also
bringing their hard-won
perspective to campuses
previously shut off

36:04.062 --> 36:09.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to military culture. The
veterans also say
the program has something to
teach the entire

36:09.934 --> 36:11.736 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE LEADENHAM: We're capable
of more than
what we have been pigeonholed
into. So, I

36:15.774 --> 36:22.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think it's important to know
that we're not
just these broken people coming
back, incapable

36:22.280 --> 36:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of succeeding within society.

36:24.449 --> 36:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: A Vassar education
has given
Leadenham the confidence to plan
for a future

36:30.188 --> 36:36.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that includes helping other
veterans find
their own way back from the war.

36:36.194 --> 36:48.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is

JUDY WOODRUFF: March Madness has
arrived,
and, once again, the University
of North Carolina

36:59.617 --> 37:01.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is very much in the hunt for a
national title.

37:01.853 --> 37:07.358 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
A new book has a
behind-the-scenes look at
the school's unique history
under a coaching

37:07.459 --> 37:12.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legend, and two rivals who
became legends
in their own right.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

37:14.265 --> 37:18.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Three
universities within 25
miles of one another and a rich
basketball

37:18.937 --> 37:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history of rivalries, great
victories and
bitter defeats and lasting
friendships.

37:23.675 --> 37:27.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three men are at the heart of
the tale, Dean
Smith, the Hall of Fame coach of
the University

37:28.012 --> 37:34.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of North Carolina for 36
seasons, who died
last year, Jim Valvano, the
fun-loving, wise-cracking

37:34.853 --> 37:40.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coach who led North Carolina
State to a surprise
national championship in 1983,
and died of

37:40.558 --> 37:46.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cancer 10 years later, and Mike
Krzyzewski,
coach at Duke since 1980, winner
of five national

37:47.031 --> 37:50.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
championships, with the most
recent coming
just last year.

37:50.635 --> 37:53.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their story is told in the new
book "The Legends
Club."

37:53.438 --> 37:55.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Author John Feinstein joins me
now.

37:55.974 --> 37:56.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, John.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why these three? What did they
mean to you?

37:58.810 --> 38:02.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN, Author, "The
Legends Club":
well, I cut my teeth as a
reporter covering

38:02.213 --> 38:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for them for The Washington Post
in the 1980s.

38:04.716 --> 38:09.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were all there in the
Research Triangle
at the same time. Dean Smith had
been there

38:09.454 --> 38:14.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
since the early '60s, was
already an iconic
figure when Mike Krzyzewski and
Jim Valvano

38:14.325 --> 38:18.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arrived within nine days of each
other at
Duke and N.C. State.

38:18.630 --> 38:23.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I got to know them all very
well. I spent
hours and hours late at night
with Valvano,

38:23.334 --> 38:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Krzyzewski, not as much
with Dean because
he was more of an introvert, but
probably

38:27.305 --> 38:30.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spent more time with him through
the years
than anybody in the media.

38:30.241 --> 38:36.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as their relationships
evolved, it came
to me much, much later that
there was a remarkable

38:36.814 --> 38:38.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
story to be told.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, this is
partly your personal
story, right, of becoming -- or
starting as

38:41.586 --> 38:46.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a young student, journalism
student at Duke
up to today.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: Correct.

38:47.859 --> 38:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But for those who
don't know
the role of basketball, the role
of these

38:51.095 --> 38:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guys in the state of North
Carolina, what
is it?

38:54.032 --> 38:57.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: Well, you have
to understand
that, until the mid-1990s, there
were no professional

38:57.502 --> 38:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sports teams in North Carolina.

38:59.604 --> 39:03.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACC basketball was king. It
still is, to a
large degree, even though there
are three

39:03.775 --> 39:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
professional sports teams in the
state now.
And there were great coaches
going way back

39:07.946 --> 39:13.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Everett Case at N.C. State,
Vic Bubas at
Duke, Frank McGuire at North
Carolina. Dean

39:13.151 --> 39:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Smith succeeded Frank McGuire
and built a
dynasty that went on for the 36
years he was

39:18.957 --> 39:20.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a story of
friendship,
but it didn't always -- it
certainly didn't

39:22.293 --> 39:22.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
start that way.

39:22.927 --> 39:24.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: No.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's all these
jealousies,
rivalry, anger, charges of
double standards.

39:28.066 --> 39:32.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's a lot of -- and
everything hinges,
of course, on who -- who's
winning.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: Yes.

39:34.072 --> 39:37.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The irony is that when
Krzyzewski first came
into the league, he resented
Dean Smith because

39:37.976 --> 39:44.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dean was the bar. And he did say
there was
a double standard for Dean with
referees,

39:44.282 --> 39:48.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Dean's team with referees.
There was one
game where he refused to shake
hands at the

39:48.152 --> 39:51.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end of the game because he
didn't think the
game was over, that there should
still be

39:51.422 --> 39:53.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time left on the clock.

39:53.291 --> 39:56.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that upset Dean that he
behaved that way.
And at one point, Krzyzewski
even said to

39:56.995 --> 40:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his assistant coaches: "If I
ever start to
act like him, don't ask any
questions. Just

40:01.099 --> 40:02.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get a gun and shoot me."

40:02.967 --> 40:09.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, years later, he became
Dean. He became
the standard. He became the bar
everybody

40:09.140 --> 40:12.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was trying to jump over, and he
became the
guy about whom they said there
were double

40:13.077 --> 40:15.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
standards and the refs gave Duke
all the calls.

40:15.546 --> 40:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's when he began to
understand Dean
and respect him more as a
result.

40:19.584 --> 40:22.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. I mean, they
all ended
up in a kind of pantheon,
especially the two

40:22.687 --> 40:27.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dean Smith and Krzyzewski, but
they all flirted
with or felt failure at
different times.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: Absolutely.

40:29.160 --> 40:34.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you go back the Dean in the
1960s. In
his fourth season, he was hung
in effigy after

40:34.299 --> 40:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a loss at Wake Forest. And Billy
Cunningham,
who became...

40:36.367 --> 40:37.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:37.769 --> 40:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, that tells
you right
there the role of...

40:38.803 --> 40:39.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:40.038 --> 40:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: Basketball, yes.
And this
was on campus.

40:41.272 --> 40:42.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: This was the
students doing
it to him.

40:44.842 --> 40:45.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes.
JOHN FEINSTEIN: And Billy
Cunningham, who
later became a Hall of Fame
player, was the

40:46.010 --> 40:47.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one who pulled the effigy down.

40:47.879 --> 40:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Krzyzewski was 38-47 after
three years
at Duke, and there was a night
in Atlanta

40:53.451 --> 40:58.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when they lost 109-66 to
Virginia in their
last game of the season, when
Tom Butters,

40:58.756 --> 41:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the athletic director who had
hired him, was
literally pushed up against a
wall in a hotel,

41:03.728 --> 41:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with boosters demanding that he
fire this
guy.

41:06.397 --> 41:10.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seven years later, he said he
got letters
from those same people when
Krzyzewski was

41:10.201 --> 41:13.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offered the Celtics job, saying,
pay him anything,
but keep him.

41:13.771 --> 41:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There is part of
me that loves
college basketball and college
sports generally,

41:19.377 --> 41:21.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but wants to push back at you
here.

41:21.379 --> 41:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we have talked about this
on the program,
it's the rising role of the
coaches, so much

41:25.183 --> 41:30.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emphasis on the coaches. They
become the most
powerful person in the state in
some cases,

41:30.888 --> 41:32.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right, at these universities.

41:32.790 --> 41:38.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here you are. I want to say,
John, are
you sort of raising them even
higher by focusing

41:38.763 --> 41:40.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on these three?

41:40.598 --> 41:43.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: It's a good
question, but
I think these are three who did
it right.

41:43.601 --> 41:49.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't apologize at all for
saying that
they are good men, in addition
to being great

41:49.307 --> 41:50.742 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coaches.

41:50.842 --> 41:51.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're saying
it's beyond the
winning with these three?

41:52.009 --> 41:53.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: Absolutely.

41:53.911 --> 41:56.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dean Smith helped desegregate
restaurants
in Chapel Hill in the 1950s,
when he was still

41:56.981 --> 42:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an assistant coach, before he
was a star,
before he had power. He went
into a restaurant

42:01.886 --> 42:06.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a black member of his
church and basically
dared the management not to
serve them.

42:06.691 --> 42:11.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jim Valvano, when he was dying,
started the
V Foundation, helped by
Krzyzewski, who was

42:11.396 --> 42:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his hospital room almost
every day the
last two months of his life. And
the V Foundation

42:16.667 --> 42:21.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has raised more than $150
million for cancer
research. Krzyzewski will tell
you, that was

42:21.372 --> 42:23.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his greatest coaching job.

42:23.274 --> 42:28.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Krzyzewski has raised millions
and millions
of dollars for charity in North
Carolina and

42:28.146 --> 42:32.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Durham. He started the Emily
K Foundation,
named after his mother, which
sends kids with

42:32.750 --> 42:36.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no money to college. And they
have had something
like 100 college graduates in
the last few

42:37.054 --> 42:38.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

42:38.890 --> 42:42.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they all went beyond the
basketball court.
They're all great coaches, but I
find them

42:42.360 --> 42:47.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all to be admirable men, and
that's why I
don't have any trouble saying,
yes, I knew

42:47.298 --> 42:50.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these guys, I spent time with
these guys,
and I learned from these guys.

42:50.768 --> 42:54.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're writing as
a fan in
an age where there is so much
criticism in

42:54.939 --> 42:57.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college sports. What do you want
people to
take from this story?

42:57.875 --> 43:01.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: Well, I don't
want anybody
to think that I'm saying that
there aren't

43:01.579 --> 43:06.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any problems with big-time
college athletics,
that -- that we're rife with
them right now.

43:06.417 --> 43:10.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I'm trying to say is,
this was a
unique, perfect storm. You had
two of the

43:10.621 --> 43:14.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
four coaches who were on
coaching's Mount
Rushmore, Krzyzewski and Dean
Smith, along

43:14.625 --> 43:16.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with John Wooden and Bob Knight.

43:16.561 --> 43:20.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you had this third
coach, Valvano,
who has this unique niche
because he won this

43:21.032 --> 43:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amazing national title in 1983,
because, frankly,
of the way he died, the famous
speech -- you

43:26.804 --> 43:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can look it up -- the ESPYs
speech, when he
won the award for courage and
spoke for 11

43:31.409 --> 43:34.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minutes, when -- and literally
passed out
when he was finished, that
everybody still

43:35.046 --> 43:36.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
looks at to this day.

43:36.914 --> 43:38.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM VALVANO, North Carolina
State Basketball
Coach: And I got one last thing.
I have said

43:38.850 --> 43:43.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it before, and I'm going to say
it again.
Cancer can take away all my
physical abilities.

43:43.788 --> 43:48.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It cannot touch my mind. It
cannot touch my
heart. And it cannot touch my
soul.

43:48.292 --> 43:52.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: I guess the
message of the
book is that these were three
special people,

43:52.363 --> 43:59.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the way their relationships
evolved, from
the hostility of the 1980s to
genuine love

43:59.737 --> 44:05.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the end of first Jim's life
and then at
the end of Dean's life between
them and Mike

44:05.243 --> 44:09.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Krzyzewski, I think, is unique
in the pantheon,
as you said, of college
athletics.

44:09.947 --> 44:12.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right. The
book is "The
Legends Club."

44:12.717 --> 44:13.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Feinstein, thanks so much.

44:13.885 --> 44:15.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN FEINSTEIN: Thanks for
having me, Jeff.

44:15.553 --> 44:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will be back in
just a moment.

44:17.588 --> 44:22.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take this time to
hear from your
local PBS station. It's a chance
to offer

44:22.426 --> 44:28.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps keep
programs like
ours on the air.

44:28.266 --> 44:30.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

44:30.635 --> 44:50.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That brings us to
the "NewsHour"
Shares this evening, something
that caught

44:50.588 --> 44:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our eye that we thought you
would like too.

44:55.326 --> 45:07.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator and
star of the
blockbuster musical "Hamilton,"
scored a White

45:07.605 --> 45:17.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
House first yesterday,
performing a freestyle
rap with the president.

45:17.682 --> 45:25.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miranda joined the rest of the
"Hamilton"
cast in meeting with and
performing for high

45:25.323 --> 45:32.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school students yesterday at the
White House.
But it was the three-man
performance in the

45:32.597 --> 45:38.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rose Garden, steps from the Oval
Office, that
went viral.

45:39.036 --> 45:41.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Drop the beat.

45:41.839 --> 45:47.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA,
Actor/Writer: He's throwing
up some words. I'm getting to
say some freestyling

45:47.845 --> 45:49.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that you never heard.

45:49.680 --> 45:54.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Constitution. The POTUS. I'm
freestyling.
You know this. Obamacare. OK,
I'm looking

45:54.385 --> 46:11.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up because it was hopeless
before you enacted
that system. The Federalist
Papers, Hamilton

46:12.003 --> 46:19.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrote the other 51 and greater.
And Sunny
and Both is canine, is insane,
asinine. Oh,

46:19.276 --> 46:22.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my gosh, I'm freestyling down
the line.

46:22.179 --> 46:34.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NASA, I want to see if we can
get over to
Mars and rap more bars. I spit
bars, and leave

46:34.725 --> 46:52.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a carbon footprint up on it, and
lower my
emissions. And this is Lin-Man
freestyling.

46:52.710 --> 47:08.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Congress is the
transmission. I hope that
Congress works to our agenda.
Innovation's

47:08.859 --> 47:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important. You really got to
center yourself
and create something.

47:20.538 --> 47:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need a new justice for the
Supreme Court.
In short, oh, my gosh, this is
my book report.

47:47.198 --> 47:56.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, immigrants, we get the job
done. This
so fun. POTUS is holding up the
signs. I'm

47:56.907 --> 47:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not done. It's the Oval Office.

47:59.844 --> 48:27.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe I'm
there. It's
so much more intimidating than
if it was square.

48:27.338 --> 48:45.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Opportunity knocks, and I can't
stop. I'm
here with the president and my
pops.

48:45.222 --> 48:50.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And, yo, the mic drops.

48:50.594 --> 48:56.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Yo, the mic drops.

48:57.034 --> 48:58.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:58.469 --> 49:25.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: I'm a crazy
"Hamilton" fan, so
that

49:25.596 --> 49:32.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is fun for me.

49:32.770 --> 50:14.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I can't wait to
see it.

50:14.345 --> 51:18.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Oh, got to.

51:18.943 --> 52:19.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:20.037 --> 53:29.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
On Wednesday: how the
presidential campaign
shapes up after today's voting.

53:29.239 --> 53:29.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:30.040 --> 53:30.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:31.008 --> 53:32.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yo, the mic drops.

53:32.910 --> 53:37.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"

53:37.281 --> 53:58.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
