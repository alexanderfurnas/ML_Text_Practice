JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: how
a little-known program designed
to attract foreign investment

00:04.300 --> 00:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is increasingly under the
microscope, for economic
reasons and political ones.

00:11.300 --> 00:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of investors apply
and participate annually, and
one real estate business in

00:16.600 --> 00:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particular has put it back in
the spotlight in recent months:
the family of Jared Kushner,

00:20.600 --> 00:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president's son-in-law.

00:22.733 --> 00:27.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our economics reporter,
Paul Solman, has covered
the controversies around
the program before.

00:28.266 --> 00:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here's his latest update.

00:29.466 --> 00:31.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
series Making Sense.

00:31.800 --> 00:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The soaring real
estate market in Jersey City,
New Jersey, due south of Wall

00:38.866 --> 00:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Street, a city becoming famous
for its many murals and its
wave of emigres from Manhattan

00:44.533 --> 00:47.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Brooklyn fleeing
sky-high rents.

00:47.966 --> 00:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One neighborhood that's on the
rise, Journal Square, named
after the 150-year Journal News.

00:54.733 --> 00:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of its latter-day
reporters, Terrence McDonald.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TERRENCE MCDONALD, The
Jersey Journal: This was
our old headquarters.

00:59.333 --> 01:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jared Kushner's
company bought that and
bought the office building
next door and bought

01:05.333 --> 01:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this whole vacant
lot right here.

01:07.333 --> 01:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Jared Kushner
is, of course, President
Trump's son-in-law.

01:10.066 --> 01:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what are they
going to build?

01:12.100 --> 01:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: The plan
is to build two towers on this
vacant lot and one tower across

01:15.266 --> 01:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the street, 72 stories,
mostly residential and also
commercial retail on the bottom.

01:22.233 --> 01:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, you may have
heard about this development
last month, when Jared Kushner's

01:24.233 --> 01:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sister pitched it to
investors in China.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: CNN found out about this
event because of this ad.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was actually posted
in the elevator of our
building here in Beijing.

01:33.800 --> 01:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, reporters
went, including CNN's Matt
Rivers, and most were promptly

01:38.700 --> 01:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shown the door, which only
provoked more coverage.

01:42.533 --> 01:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why the selective secrecy?

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For one thing, Nicole Kushner
Meyer may have thought twice
about the optics or my-optics

01:51.966 --> 01:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of trading on her family
connection to the president,
though Kushner companies later

01:54.900 --> 01:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said Meyer -- quote
-- "apologizes if that
mention of her brother
was in any way interpreted

02:01.266 --> 02:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as an attempt to lure
investors" -- unquote.

02:04.566 --> 02:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But also iffy, the investment
itself, criticized for selling
U.S. citizenship for cash, the

02:11.533 --> 02:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
embattled EB-5 visa program, in
which foreigners who ante up a
million dollars to create 10

02:18.266 --> 02:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. jobs are granted permanent
residency, and eventual U.S.
citizenship, for themselves

02:24.633 --> 02:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and for all immediate
family members under age 21.

02:29.133 --> 02:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the Kushners, who declined
to comment for this story,
have used EB-5 investments

02:35.566 --> 02:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before, also here
in Jersey City.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JARED KUSHNER, Senior
Presidential Adviser:
As a company, we have
done a lot of projects,

02:40.200 --> 02:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but I have actually never
done a groundbreaking before.

02:42.700 --> 02:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Fifty
million dollars of Chinese
cash for visas helped
build Trump Bay Street,

02:49.166 --> 02:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president licensing his name
to his son-in-law's company, the
financing at below-market rates.

02:55.233 --> 02:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: This
is one of the newer luxury
high-rises here in Jersey City.

02:58.866 --> 03:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The highest price I saw
was on the 48th floor.

03:01.466 --> 03:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a 50-story building.

03:03.233 --> 03:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was about $5,000 a month
for a two-bedroom/two-bathroom
apartment.

03:07.533 --> 03:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Luxury apartments,
just a few minutes by
subway from Manhattan.

03:11.566 --> 03:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, hey, Congress decided,
during a recession in 1990,
that a million dollars to create

03:18.200 --> 03:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
10 jobs is a good deal
for the U.S. economy, no
matter what the project.

03:22.733 --> 03:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It turns out, however, that the
investors in Kushner's project
only had to put up $500,000,

03:30.300 --> 03:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
half-price tickets to
citizenship for themselves
and their entire families,
thanks to a clause

03:37.266 --> 03:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that takes 50 percent off if you
create the jobs in a -- quote
-- "high-unemployment area"

03:42.833 --> 03:43.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
- - unquote.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But wait a minute.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The unemployment rate around
Trump Bay Street was very low.

03:49.033 --> 03:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NORMAN ODER, Journalist:
There is an essential
dodge here going on.

03:51.566 --> 03:53.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's something
really fake going on.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Journalist Norman
Oder was the first to report on
the loophole that the Kushners,

03:57.433 --> 04:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pretty much all urban
developers who use the
EB-5 program, exploit.

04:01.733 --> 04:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NORMAN ODER: EB-5 investments
are supposed to be a million
dollars unless it's in a rural

04:06.400 --> 04:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
area or an area of
high unemployment.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's called a targeted
employment area.

04:11.233 --> 04:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Then it's $500,000.

04:13.033 --> 04:14.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Guess what?

04:14.500 --> 04:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every project is finagled
into a high-unemployment area.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So
how do you do that?

04:19.333 --> 04:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NORMAN ODER: You have to
connect census tracts.

04:21.333 --> 04:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, let's walk
you through the process that
played out here in Jersey City.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: We're
about one mile away
from Trump Bay Street.

04:28.433 --> 04:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But we're
still in the EB-5 district.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: Yes, we are.

04:32.866 --> 04:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: EB-5 visa
investors can pay half-price
if they're investing in
an area with a jobless

04:38.033 --> 04:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rate one-and-a-half times
the national average.

04:41.433 --> 04:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I can see that we're
gradually getting into
dicier territory here.

04:48.466 --> 04:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: We're about
two miles away from Trump Bay
Street now in an area of the

04:51.900 --> 04:55.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
city that has struggled
with violence and with
crime and with poverty.

04:55.700 --> 05:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In 2014, when the
Kushners and their partners
were pitching Chinese visa

05:02.366 --> 05:06.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
seekers, the national
unemployment rate was
just over 6 percent.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So now we're how far
away from downtown?

05:10.600 --> 05:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: We're about
three, a little more than
three miles away from Trump Bay

05:13.666 --> 05:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Street now, on Ocean Avenue.

05:15.333 --> 05:20.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And we're
in a substantially
worse neighborhood now.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: Yes, yes,
businesses that are closed.

05:23.866 --> 05:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this area does struggle
with violence even more than
the neighborhood we were just

05:28.333 --> 05:30.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

05:30.866 --> 05:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We're walking
the so-called targeted
employment area the
developers created, with

05:33.833 --> 05:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an average jobless rate
of more than 9 percent.

05:37.166 --> 05:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: The
unemployment rate where
Trump Bay Street is,
about four miles away,

05:42.033 --> 05:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is so low that they have to
include a huge swathe of the
inner city and lower half of

05:48.533 --> 05:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the city to make the rate work.

05:52.066 --> 05:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The only
requirement, the employment
area has to be made up
of neighborhoods that

05:56.533 --> 05:58.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
border each other.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TERRENCE MCDONALD:
So, we're about at the
end of the line here.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's Bayonne on the other
side of the train tracks.

06:01.766 --> 06:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: About five miles
and a whole lot of shoe leather
south of Trump Bay Street,

06:08.666 --> 06:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a gerrymandered, but legal
district made up of 16 different
census tracts, with an overall

06:13.666 --> 06:18.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
unemployment rate of
9.8 percent, when the
national average was 6.

06:20.200 --> 06:24.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The claim is that Trump
Bay Street created
more than 1,280 jobs.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But did it actually help the
poor parts of town that made
its financing attractive?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, you work in construction.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Absolutely.

06:32.233 --> 06:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Did you try
to get a job downtown?

06:34.600 --> 06:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Several of us tried
to get a job downtown.

06:37.633 --> 06:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they're not hiring us.

06:39.600 --> 06:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know no one at all
who has no type of job from
downtown at Trump Towers or who

06:43.800 --> 06:46.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
informed anyone
else about the jobs.

06:46.366 --> 06:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRENCE MCDONALD: Do you
think that the construction
of these luxury high-rises
downtown has benefited

06:50.033 --> 06:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this area of the city at all?

06:51.366 --> 06:52.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: No.

06:52.366 --> 06:53.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look around.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People -- a lot of people
need help around here.

06:55.566 --> 06:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Any of
the contractors you
know work downtown?

06:56.400 --> 06:57.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: No.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: You either?

06:59.400 --> 07:01.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: No.

07:01.533 --> 07:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What do you think
of the idea, though, of you
being included in this area

07:04.800 --> 07:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that then allows them
to get the foreign money
to build the towers?

07:10.933 --> 07:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I don't
think that's fair.

07:13.533 --> 07:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN FULOP, Mayor of
Jersey City, New Jersey:
The intention of the EB-5
program are to subsidize

07:16.000 --> 07:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
areas in a city or community
that are lower-income,
in needs of jobs, and
don't have development.

07:19.633 --> 07:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Not to subsidize
areas that don't need it, says
Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop.

07:24.066 --> 07:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN FULOP: The media scrutiny
on this stuff has brought a
lot of that to light, and there

07:28.233 --> 07:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will probably be policy changes
in Washington as a result of it.

07:31.033 --> 07:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, there's
been legislation to try
to reform EB-5 for years.

07:35.233 --> 07:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN FULOP: I think now you're
in a unique moment in time
where there's more scrutiny

The day after the story broke
about Nicole Kushner Meyer's
efforts in China, he withdrew

07:51.733 --> 07:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his support for a usually
standard 30-year tax abatement
and $30 million municipal bond

07:58.766 --> 08:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the Kushners and their
partners had applied for to
build one Journal Square.

08:03.100 --> 08:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, where's the mayor right now?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STEVEN FULOP: We're
not giving the subsidy.

08:06.866 --> 08:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have clearly said that,
and they say they can't
move forward without it.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we will see where
it goes from here.

08:12.433 --> 08:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Where it's gone
is that, just yesterday, the
Kushner consortium withdrew

08:16.433 --> 08:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its tax break request.

08:18.733 --> 08:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to the private company
helping raise $150 million
in EB-5 money, 6,600 new jobs

08:26.533 --> 08:28.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are now on hold.

08:28.500 --> 08:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they would be in a
prospering part of town with
just a 4 percent jobless rate.

08:34.266 --> 08:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The poorer neighborhoods
to the south?

08:36.833 --> 08:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their job was to boost the
average unemployment rate high
enough to qualify investors for

08:42.733 --> 08:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the half-price visas.
