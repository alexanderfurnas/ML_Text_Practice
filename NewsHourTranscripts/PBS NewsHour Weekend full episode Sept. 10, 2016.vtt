SIGNIFICANT PART OF THIS DEAL?

01:51.745 --> 01:53.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THIS DEAL IS A BIG

01:53.847 --> 01:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISK, BUT IT'S PROBABLY A RISK

01:55.882 --> 01:56.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORTH TAKING.

01:56.483 --> 01:58.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU MAY REMEMBER, ALISON, THAT

01:58.018 --> 01:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS ANOTHER CEASE-FIRE

01:59.686 --> 02:01.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL THAT WAS SIGNED IN FEBRUARY

02:01.922 --> 02:05.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN MUNICH, AND THE PROBLEM WITH

02:05.492 --> 02:08.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS THAT IT ALLOWED ASSAD,

02:08.929 --> 02:11.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT ASSAD OF SYRIA, TO

02:11.565 --> 02:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUE TO JOIN IN THE THE

02:13.033 --> 02:17.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOMBING OF AL-NUSRA AND, OF

02:17.504 --> 02:20.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURSE, OF ISLAMIC STATE SITES,

02:20.774 --> 02:22.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN WHILE THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO

02:22.209 --> 02:26.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE HUMANITARIAN ACCESS, AND A

02:26.613 --> 02:28.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CEASE-FIRE ELSEWHERE AND A

02:28.382 --> 02:30.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CEASE-FIRE AGAINST ANY OF THE

02:30.851 --> 02:31.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION GROUPS.

02:31.785 --> 02:34.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT ASSAD USED

02:34.087 --> 02:37.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EXCUSE OF BOMBING AL-NUSRA

02:37.057 --> 02:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO ALSO BOMB OPPOSITION FORCES

02:39.459 --> 02:41.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAVE BEEN FIGHTING HIM AND

02:41.395 --> 02:43.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE AMERICANS HAVE BACKED.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THE THE QUESTION WAS IS

02:44.398 --> 02:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE A WAY FOR THE UNITED

02:46.233 --> 02:49.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES AND FOR RUSSIA TO JOINTLY

02:49.703 --> 02:54.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE PART IN TARGETING AL-NUSRA

02:54.041 --> 02:56.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ISLAMIC STATE FORCES, AND

02:56.910 --> 02:59.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEEP ASSAD'S FORCES OUT OF THE

02:59.846 --> 03:00.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AIR?

03:00.514 --> 03:01.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: FOR A DEAL AS

03:01.148 --> 03:02.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLEX AS THAT TO CAN COME

03:02.249 --> 03:03.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER, WHERE YOU HAVE TWO,

03:03.884 --> 03:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESTRANGED POWERHOUSES AGREEING

03:06.319 --> 03:08.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WORK TOGETHER MILITARILY,

03:08.355 --> 03:09.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT HAS TO

03:09.056 --> 03:09.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE CHANGED.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT CHANGED?

03:11.258 --> 03:16.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, FOR THE OBAMA

03:16.530 --> 03:17.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION, WHAT CHANGED WAS

03:17.764 --> 03:19.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ENTRY OF THE RUSSIANS INTO

03:19.132 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAR.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU REMEMBER IT WAS A YEAR AGO

03:21.835 --> 03:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA AT THE

03:23.236 --> 03:24.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHITE HOUSE SAID THAT THE

03:24.805 --> 03:26.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS WOULD REGRET THIS DAY,

03:26.273 --> 03:27.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY WOULD GET COMPLETELY

03:27.674 --> 03:29.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOGGED DOWN IN HAD WAR.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, IN FACT, AS IT TURNED OUT,

03:31.912 --> 03:34.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RUSSIANS HAVE DONE A PRETTY

03:34.014 --> 03:36.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOOD JOB OF SHORING UP ASSAD.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD THE THE RUSSIANS NOT

03:38.585 --> 03:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENTERED, IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

03:40.053 --> 03:41.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ASSAD'S GOVERNMENT WOULD

03:41.455 --> 03:43.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE COLLAPSED BY NOW.

03:43.156 --> 03:44.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO SUDDENLY HAD BECAME A BATTLE

03:44.891 --> 03:46.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN WHICH TWO BIG SUPERPOWERS TO

03:46.927 --> 03:49.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME TO SOME AGREEMENT.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTRAL PROBLEM WITH IT, ALISON,

03:51.598 --> 03:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER

03:52.933 --> 03:54.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAYERS HERE-- THE IRANIANS,

03:54.868 --> 03:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT OPPOSITION GROUPS, THE

03:56.636 --> 03:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAUDIS-- THAT IF THEY'RE NOT ALL

03:59.739 --> 04:01.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUYING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, TO

04:01.541 --> 04:03.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH THEY WERE NOT A PARTY

04:03.110 --> 04:05.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGOTIATING, THIS WHOLE THING

04:05.312 --> 04:06.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD FRACTURE APART.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: SECRETARY KERRY

04:08.381 --> 04:10.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID THIS IS NOT BASED ON TRUST.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS BASED ON COMPLIANCE AND

04:11.651 --> 04:13.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERSIGHT.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO IS GOING TO BE MONITORING

04:14.454 --> 04:15.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS?

04:15.122 --> 04:15.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO IS GOING TO BE PROVIDING

04:15.922 --> 04:17.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COMPLIANCE AND OVERSIGHT?

04:17.724 --> 04:20.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE OVERSIGHT IS EASY

04:20.627 --> 04:21.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EVERYBODY IT SEE.

04:21.528 --> 04:22.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED NATIONS WILL SEE IT.

04:22.662 --> 04:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S. HAS GOT ENORMOUS

04:26.032 --> 04:28.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSETS-- SATELLITES, DRONES,

04:28.001 --> 04:29.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER THINGS-- TO SEE WHAT'S

04:29.369 --> 04:29.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING ON.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE QUESTION IS, IF ASSAD

04:32.405 --> 04:36.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIOLATES AGREEMENTS, WILL THE

04:36.743 --> 04:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS REALLY REIGN HIM IN.

04:39.212 --> 04:42.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY DON'T, WOULD OR COULD

04:42.249 --> 04:43.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES THREATEN

04:43.884 --> 04:44.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY ACTION.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE MANY IN THE OBAMA

04:46.286 --> 04:47.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION THAT BELIEVE

13:12.558 --> 13:14.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU KNOW, THE MILITARY

13:14.193 --> 13:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
