00:37.504 --> 00:38.839

00:38.839 --> 00:39.940
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.108
HILLARY CLINTON MADE IT OFFICIAL

00:41.108 --> 00:42.342
TODAY, SHE'S RUNNING FOR

00:42.342 --> 00:43.377
PRESIDENT.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.778

00:44.778 --> 00:45.946

00:47.014 --> 00:48.048
IT FEATURED PEOPLE FROM

00:48.048 --> 00:49.082
TRADITIONALLY DEMOCRAT-LEANING

00:49.082 --> 00:50.217
GROUPS, INCLUDING HISPANICS,

00:50.217 --> 00:51.184
AFRICAN AMERICANS, WOMEN, AND

00:52.452 --> 00:53.854

00:55.522 --> 00:56.823
>> I'M GETTING READY FOR

00:56.823 --> 00:58.525
SOMETHING TOO.

00:58.525 --> 00:59.793
I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.395
AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT THEIR WAY

01:01.395 --> 01:04.331
BACK FROM TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES

01:04.331 --> 01:05.933
BUT THE DECK IS STILL STACKED IN

01:05.933 --> 01:08.468
FAVOR OF THOSE AT THE TOP.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.037
EVERYDAY AMERICANS NEED A

01:10.037 --> 01:11.438
CHAMPION AND I WANT TO BE THAT

01:11.438 --> 01:12.940
CHAMPION.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.641
SO YOU CAN DO MORE THAN JUST GET

01:14.641 --> 01:16.243
BY.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.945
YOU CAN GET AHEAD AND STAY

01:17.945 --> 01:19.212

01:19.212 --> 01:20.847
BECAUSE WHEN FAMILIES ARE

01:20.847 --> 01:21.848

01:28.755 --> 01:30.290
RELEASED HIS OWN VIDEO.

01:30.290 --> 01:31.491
IN IT, HE TIED CLINTON TO WHAT

01:31.491 --> 01:32.926
HE CALLED THE "FAILED POLICIES"

01:32.926 --> 01:34.494
OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS.

01:34.494 --> 01:36.063
>> WE MUST TO DO BETTER THAN THE

01:36.063 --> 01:37.597
OBAMA-CLINTON FOREIGN POLICY

01:37.597 --> 01:39.166
THAT HAS DAMAGED RELATIONSHIPS

01:39.166 --> 01:40.767
WITH OUR ALLIES AND EMBOLDENED

01:40.767 --> 01:42.336
OUR ENEMIES.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.770
BETTER THAN THEIR FAILED BIG-

01:43.770 --> 01:45.038
GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT GROW

01:45.038 --> 01:47.174
OUR DEBT AND STAND IN THE WAY OF

01:47.174 --> 01:48.208
REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND

01:48.208 --> 01:49.142
PROSPERITY.

01:49.142 --> 01:50.310
>> Sreenivasan: WE'LL HAVE MORE

01:50.310 --> 01:51.511
IN A MOMENT.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.046
PRESIDENT OBAMA RETURNED HOME

01:53.046 --> 01:54.781
EARLY TODAY FOLLOWING THE SUMMIT

01:54.781 --> 01:55.983
OF THE AMERICAS IN PANAMA, WHERE

01:55.983 --> 01:57.784
HE HAD A HISTORIC MEETING WITH

01:57.784 --> 01:59.419
CUBAN LEADER RAUL CASTRO.

01:59.419 --> 02:00.921
APPEARING ON THE SUNDAY MORNING

02:00.921 --> 02:02.356
TALKS SHOWS, SECRETARY OF STATE

02:02.356 --> 02:03.957
JOHN KERRY SAID THE DECADES-OLD

02:03.957 --> 02:05.492
AMERICAN EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA

02:05.492 --> 02:06.860
HAD FAILED TO PROMPT REFORMS IN

02:06.860 --> 02:08.195
THAT COUNTRY.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.463
HE PREDICTED ENGAGEMENT WOULD

02:09.463 --> 02:11.064
LEAD TO CHANGE THERE.

02:11.064 --> 02:12.699
>> THE BELIEF IS VERY POWERFUL

02:12.699 --> 02:14.401
THAT BY BEGINNING TO ENGAGE, BY

02:14.401 --> 02:15.902
BEGINNING TO HAVE GREATER

02:15.902 --> 02:17.537
TRAVEL, GREATER ABILITY TO MOVE,

02:17.537 --> 02:19.006
GREATER ABILITY TO VISIT, IDEAS

02:19.006 --> 02:21.208
AND OPPORTUNITIES WILL GROW THAT

02:21.208 --> 02:22.876
THE CUBAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES WILL

02:22.876 --> 02:24.611
HAVE A GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:24.611 --> 02:25.712
EXPRESSION AND FOR EXCHANGE OF

02:25.712 --> 02:27.981
VIEWS.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.916
AND THAT IS WHAT WILL PROMOTE A

02:29.916 --> 02:31.551
TRANSFORMATION OVER A PERIOD OF

02:31.551 --> 02:33.587
TIME.

02:33.587 --> 02:34.855
>> Sreenivasan: BUT NEW JERSEY

02:34.855 --> 02:36.723
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ROBERT

02:36.723 --> 02:38.091
MENENDEZ, A CUBAN-AMERICAN,

02:38.091 --> 02:39.259
CRITICIZED THE GET-TOGETHER

02:39.259 --> 02:40.894
SAYING THE CUBAN REGIME

02:40.894 --> 02:42.162
CONTINUES TO ARREST HUNDREDS OF

02:42.162 --> 02:44.097
POLITICAL DISSIDENTS.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.333
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS A

02:46.333 --> 02:48.135
MISGUIDED CALCULATION THAT IF

02:48.135 --> 02:49.369
YOU OPEN YOUR HANDS TO DICTATORS

02:49.369 --> 02:50.971
THEY WILL UNCLENCH THEIR FISTS.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.706
>> Sreenivasan: THE ISLAMIC

02:52.706 --> 02:54.207
EXTREMIST GROUP KNOWN AS ISIS

02:54.207 --> 02:55.675
HAS POSTED VIDEO SHOWING WHAT IT

02:55.675 --> 02:56.910
CLAIMS ARE ITS FIGHTERS

02:56.910 --> 02:58.645
DESTROYING YET ANOTHER ANCIENT

02:58.645 --> 03:00.847
SITE IN IRAQ.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.549
THE VIDEO SHOWS ISIS MEMBERS

03:02.549 --> 03:04.184
ENTERING BUILDINGS IN THE

03:04.184 --> 03:05.952
ANCIENT CITY OF NIMRUD, USING

03:05.952 --> 03:07.654
SLEDGEHAMMERS AND SAWS TO

03:07.654 --> 03:09.256
DESTROY ASSYRIAN ARTIFACTS.

03:09.256 --> 03:11.558
THE CITY WAS FOUNDED MORE THAN

03:11.558 --> 03:13.894
3,000 YEARS AGO, IN THE 13TH

03:13.894 --> 03:15.162
CENTURY B.C.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.164
(EXPLOSION)

03:17.164 --> 03:18.698
ISIS HAS DESTROYED SEVERAL

03:18.698 --> 03:20.367
ANCIENT HISTORICAL SITES,

03:20.367 --> 03:22.335
ATTACKING WHAT IT CLAIMS ARE

03:22.335 --> 03:23.870
DEPICTIONS OF "FALSE IDOLS"

03:23.870 --> 03:25.405
POPE FRANCIS HAS MADE SEVERAL

03:25.405 --> 03:26.840
RECENT COMMENTS DENOUNCING

03:26.840 --> 03:28.542
ISIS'S ATTACKS ON CHRISTIANITY.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.343
AND TODAY, IN COMMENTS THAT

03:30.343 --> 03:32.012
COULD AFFECT VATICAN RELATIONS

03:32.012 --> 03:33.380
WITH THE WIDER MUSLIM WORLD, THE

03:33.380 --> 03:35.649
POPE SAID THE MASSACRE OF

03:35.649 --> 03:37.350
ARMENIANS 100 YEARS AGO AMOUNTED

03:37.350 --> 03:41.254
TO GENOCIDE.

03:41.254 --> 03:42.622
>> (translated): IT IS

03:42.622 --> 03:44.124
NECESSARY, AND INDEED A DUTY, TO

03:44.124 --> 03:45.692
HONOR THEIR MEMORY, FOR WHENEVER

03:45.692 --> 03:46.960
MEMORY FADES, IT MEANS THAT EVIL

03:46.960 --> 03:48.128
ALLOWS WOUNDS TO FESTER.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.663
>> Sreenivasan: AS MANY AS A

03:49.663 --> 03:51.465
MILLION AND A HALF ARMENIANS

03:51.465 --> 03:52.566
WERE KILLED DURING WORLD WAR ONE

03:52.566 --> 03:53.834
IN WHAT IS NOW TURKEY.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.802
TURKEY TODAY CONDEMNED THE

03:55.802 --> 03:57.237
POPE'S REMARKS, CALLING THEM

03:57.237 --> 03:59.206
"FAR FROM HISTORICAL REALITY."

03:59.206 --> 04:00.607
A WASHINGTON POST REPORTER,

04:00.607 --> 04:02.309
JASON REZAIAN, WHO HAS BEEN

04:02.309 --> 04:03.643
DETAINED IN IRAN FOR MORE THAN

04:03.643 --> 04:04.911
EIGHT MONTHS, IS NOW FACING

04:04.911 --> 04:06.113
CHARGES OF ESPIONAGE AND ACTING

04:06.113 --> 04:08.682
AGAINST NATIONAL SECURITY AND

04:08.682 --> 04:10.050
WILL BE TRIED IN IRAN'S

04:10.050 --> 04:11.218
REVOLUTIONARY COURT.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.086
THIS FROM THE SEMI-OFFICIAL FARS

04:13.086 --> 04:14.254
NEWS AGENCY.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.856
THE FARS REPORT SAYS REZAIAN

04:15.856 --> 04:17.657
OBTAINED ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL

04:17.657 --> 04:19.259
INFORMATION FROM IRAN AND SOLD

04:19.259 --> 04:20.560
IT TO UNNAMED AMERICANS.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.062
REZAIAN HOLDS DUAL AMERICAN AND

04:22.062 --> 04:23.363
IRANIAN CITIZENSHIP.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.065
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS CALLED

04:25.065 --> 04:26.399
FOR HIS RELEASE.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.034
THE GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA IS

04:28.034 --> 04:29.836
PREPARING TO STOP WELFARE

04:29.836 --> 04:31.705
BENEFITS TO FAMILIES THAT DO NOT

04:31.705 --> 04:33.240
VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.674
PRIME MINISTER TONY ABBOTT SAYS

04:34.674 --> 04:36.810
HIS SO-CALLED "NO JAB, NO PAY"

04:36.810 --> 04:38.578
PLAN IS MEANT TO PROTECT PUBLIC

04:38.578 --> 04:40.180
HEALTH.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.548
ITS ESTIMATED THAT 39,000

04:41.548 --> 04:43.250
CHILDREN IN THAT COUNTRY OF

04:43.250 --> 04:44.818
NEARLY 23 MILLION ARE

04:44.818 --> 04:46.186
UNVACCINATED.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.221
PARENTS CAN CURRENTLY CLAIM

04:48.221 --> 04:50.524
MEDICAL OR RELIGIOUS EXEMPTIONS.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.992
AND AMAZON HAS FILED SUIT IN AN

04:51.992 --> 04:53.527
EFFORT TO BLOCK FAKE REVIEWS ON

04:53.527 --> 04:55.195
ITS WEBSITE.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.830
AMAZON SAYS THE COMPANIES IT'S

04:56.830 --> 04:57.998
GOING AFTER ARE FABRICATING AS

04:57.998 --> 04:59.199
MANY FIVE-STAR REVIEWS AS THEIR

04:59.199 --> 05:00.967
CUSTOMERS ARE WILLING TO PAY

05:00.967 --> 05:02.469
FOR.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.337
AMAZON SAYS THE BOGUS REVIEWS

05:04.337 --> 05:06.273
ARE BEING QUOTE "SLOW DRIPPED"

05:06.273 --> 05:07.908
ONTO ITS WEBSITE TO MAKE THEM

05:07.908 --> 05:15.815
MORE DIFFICULT TO DETECT.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.751
FOR MORE ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S

05:17.751 --> 05:19.286
RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY, WE ARE

05:19.286 --> 05:20.420
JOINED NOW FROM WASHINGTON BY

05:20.420 --> 05:22.355
ONE OF THE NATION'S TOP

05:22.355 --> 05:23.723
POLITICAL REPORTERS.

05:23.723 --> 05:24.891
DAN BALZ, THE CHIEF

05:24.891 --> 05:25.725
CORRESPONDENT OF THE WASHINGTON

05:25.725 --> 05:29.563
POST.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.264
SO WHAT IS THE VISION THAT

05:31.264 --> 05:32.866
HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO LAY

05:32.866 --> 05:33.300
OUT?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.668
>> BASED ON EVERYTHING WE

05:34.668 --> 05:36.469
KNOW ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON'S

05:36.469 --> 05:38.405
LIFE AND LIFE STORY, SHE'S

05:38.405 --> 05:39.940
GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT

05:39.940 --> 05:41.641
MIDDLE CLASS, MIDDLE CLASS

05:41.641 --> 05:44.077
INCOME SECURITY, ECONOMIC

05:44.077 --> 05:47.314
MOBILITY, INCOME INEQUALITY

05:47.314 --> 05:49.616
BUT NOT IN A HARD-EDGED WAY.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.384
WE KNOW THAT THAT WAS THE

05:51.384 --> 05:52.919
FOCUS CERTAINLY OF THE EIGHT

05:52.919 --> 05:54.087
CLINTON YEARS WHEN HER

05:54.087 --> 05:55.288
HUSBAND WAS PRESIDENT.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.389
EVERYTHING SHE SAID IN THE

05:56.389 --> 05:57.757
RUN-UP OVER THE LAST 18

05:57.757 --> 05:59.125
MONTHS AS SHE HAS GOTTEN

05:59.125 --> 06:00.460
READY TO BECOME A FORMAL

06:00.460 --> 06:01.528
CANDIDATE POINTS IN THAT

06:01.528 --> 06:02.429
DIRECTION.

06:02.429 --> 06:03.263
SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF

06:03.263 --> 06:04.231
IT.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.465
AND I THINK THE SECRETARY IS

06:05.465 --> 06:07.467
SHE HAS ALWAYS HAD A MORE

06:07.467 --> 06:08.435
MUSCULAR FOREIGN POLICY THAN

06:08.435 --> 06:09.603
SOME OTHERS IN THE

06:09.603 --> 06:10.470
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

06:10.470 --> 06:11.771
I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE

06:11.771 --> 06:13.006
QUESTIONS GIVEN ALL OF THE

06:13.006 --> 06:13.940
TURMOIL IN THE MIDDLE EAST

06:13.940 --> 06:16.009
AND ELSEWHERE, HOW SHE WILL

06:16.009 --> 06:16.643
ADDRESS THAT.

06:16.643 --> 06:17.777
>> IS THERE A DIFFERENCE NOW,

06:17.777 --> 06:19.212
I GUESS EIGHT YEARS LATER

06:19.212 --> 06:20.547
THAN THE HILL RAE THAT WAS

06:20.547 --> 06:22.015
RUNNING AGAINST BARACK OBAMA

06:22.015 --> 06:23.216
AND PERHAPS A DIFFERENT

06:23.216 --> 06:24.718
STRATEGY WHERE AT THAT TIME

06:24.718 --> 06:25.885
MAYBE SHE HAD DIFFERENT

06:25.885 --> 06:27.387
GOALS IN MIND OF

06:27.387 --> 06:29.222
ESTABLISHING HER CREDIBILITY

06:29.222 --> 06:30.957
VERSUS NOW, SHE'S KIND OF

06:30.957 --> 06:31.625
GOT THAT.

06:31.625 --> 06:32.726
SHE WAS HIS SECRETARY OF

06:32.726 --> 06:33.393
STATE.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.694
>> WHEN SHE RAN EIGHT YEARS

06:34.694 --> 06:35.762
AGO, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

06:35.762 --> 06:37.397
ONE OF HER ADVISORS

06:37.397 --> 06:38.898
SUGGESTED WAS SHE NEEDED TO

06:38.898 --> 06:40.433
PROJECT KIND OF A MARGARET

06:40.433 --> 06:41.301
THATCHER IMAGE.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.336
YOU KNOW, THE IRON LADY

06:43.336 --> 06:45.305
IMAGE FROM THATCHER'S DAYS

06:45.305 --> 06:46.206
AS PRIME MINISTER IN

06:46.206 --> 06:46.640
BRITAIN.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.074
I DON'T THINK SHE'S IN THAT

06:48.074 --> 06:48.608
POSITION TODAY.

06:48.608 --> 06:49.643
SHE HAS BEEN SECRETARY OF

06:49.643 --> 06:50.944
STATE, AS YOU SAY.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.178
AND I THINK THAT AT THIS

06:52.178 --> 06:54.014
POINT, EVERYTHING SUGGESTS

06:54.014 --> 06:56.216
THAT WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO OR

DIFFERENT KIND OF

06:59.819 --> 07:00.954
PERSONALITY AND PERSONA ON

07:00.954 --> 07:02.389
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

07:02.389 --> 07:05.292
WARMER, FRIENDLIER,

07:05.292 --> 07:06.626
MORE-- CLOSER TO THE GROUND.

07:06.626 --> 07:08.862
HER FIRST TRIP TO IOWA WHICH

07:08.862 --> 07:10.196
WILL TAKE PLACE IN A COUPLE

07:10.196 --> 07:12.232

07:12.232 --> 07:14.567
ALMOST ENTIRELY SMALL EVENTS,

07:14.567 --> 07:16.236
INTIMATE GATHERINGS, NOT BIG

07:16.236 --> 07:17.837
RALLIES, NO PRESUMPTIVENESS

07:17.837 --> 07:19.072
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT

07:19.072 --> 07:20.840
THIS IS NOT A KIND OF A

07:20.840 --> 07:21.875
PRIVILEGED MARCH THROUGH A

07:21.875 --> 07:22.742
CORONATION.

07:22.742 --> 07:23.743
BUT SOMETHING IN WHICH SHE'S

07:23.743 --> 07:25.945
GOING TO GET HER HANDS DIRTY

07:25.945 --> 07:27.047
TRYING TO CONNECT WITH

07:27.047 --> 07:28.748
VOTERS.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.083

07:30.884 --> 07:31.818
NECESSARILY CONNECT WITH THE

07:31.818 --> 07:32.585
VOTERS LAST TIME.

07:32.585 --> 07:33.486
>> NO, ABSOLUTELY.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.188
I HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF

07:35.188 --> 07:36.356
IOWA A HALF A DOZEN TIMES

07:36.356 --> 07:37.557
OVER THE LAST YEAR AND

07:37.557 --> 07:38.858
TALKED TO PEOPLE INCLUDING

07:38.858 --> 07:39.693
DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISTS.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.894
AND THEY REMEMBER THAT

07:40.894 --> 07:42.062
CAMPAIGN WITH VERY MIXED

07:42.062 --> 07:42.562
VIEWS.

07:42.562 --> 07:43.997
THE SENSE THAT BOTH

07:43.997 --> 07:46.633
SECRETARY CLINTON AND IN

07:46.633 --> 07:48.101
FACT A LOT OF THE SENIOR

07:48.101 --> 07:49.202
STAFF FROM THE NATIONAL

07:49.202 --> 07:51.571
CAMPAIGN AROUND HER DIDN'T

07:51.571 --> 07:53.373
PAY PROPER ATTENTION, DID

07:53.373 --> 07:55.075
NOT CAMPAIGN IN THE WAY

07:55.075 --> 07:56.376
IOWANS LIKE.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.777
IOWANS EXPECT A LOT OF

07:57.777 --> 07:59.045
HANDS-ON CAMPAIGNING AND

07:59.045 --> 08:00.080
SHE DIDN'T DO THAT VERY

08:00.080 --> 08:00.814
WELL.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.815
SHE DID TO THE LIKE THE

08:01.815 --> 08:03.083
CAUCUS PROCESS WHICH IS A

08:03.083 --> 08:04.784
BIT OF AN ARCANE PROCESS.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.252
SHE CAME AWAY WITH THAT WITH

08:06.252 --> 08:07.620
A BAD TASTE IN HER MOUTH.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.823
I THINK SHE WANTS TO ERASE A

08:09.823 --> 08:11.257
LOT OF THOSE FEELINGS THAT

08:11.257 --> 08:13.126
SHE HAS A DISDAIN FOR IOWA

08:13.126 --> 08:15.095
OR IOWANS ARE THE IOWA

08:15.095 --> 08:15.495
PROCESS.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.096
>> Sreenivasan: SO THIS

08:16.096 --> 08:17.797

08:17.797 --> 08:18.998
TOMORROW WE'RE EXPECTING

08:18.998 --> 08:21.468
MARCO RUBIO TO ANNOUNCE HIS

08:21.468 --> 08:22.602
INTENTION FOR THE CANDIDACY.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.003
SHE HAS ALREADY BEEN GETTING

08:24.003 --> 08:25.171
CRITIQUES FROM REPUBLICANS

08:25.171 --> 08:26.539
AND CONSERVATIVES BEFORE SHE

08:26.539 --> 08:27.273
EVEN LAUNCHES.

08:27.273 --> 08:28.908
AND AT THE SAME TIME SHE'S

08:28.908 --> 08:30.043
ALSO TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF

08:30.043 --> 08:31.745
HEAT OR LACK OF SUPPORT FROM

08:31.745 --> 08:32.746
PROGRESSIVES WHO THINK,

08:32.746 --> 08:34.013
PERHAPS, SHE'S NOT LEFT

08:34.013 --> 08:34.514
ENOUGH.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.149
>> I THINK IT WILL BE VERY

08:36.149 --> 08:37.550
DIFFICULT FOR HER EVER TO

08:37.550 --> 08:39.119
QUITE SATISFY THE

08:39.119 --> 08:41.154
PROGRESSIVES IN THE PARTY.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.956
SHE'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

08:42.956 --> 08:43.957
GO AS FAR AS THEY WOULD

08:43.957 --> 08:44.824
LIKE.

08:44.824 --> 08:45.959
SHE WILL TIP SOMEWHERE IN

08:45.959 --> 08:46.926
THEIR DIRECTION.

08:46.926 --> 08:48.261
I THINK SHE IS SOMEWHAT TO

08:48.261 --> 08:50.063
THE LEFT OF HER HUSBAND IN

08:50.063 --> 08:51.431
THEIR VIEWS ON ECONOMIC

08:51.431 --> 08:52.332
POLICY ISSUES.

08:52.332 --> 08:55.301
BUT SHE WILL ALSO VERY MUCH

08:55.301 --> 08:57.003
BE THE TARGET AS YOU SUGGEST

08:57.003 --> 08:58.471
OF ALL THE REPUBLICAN

08:58.471 --> 08:58.972
CANDIDATES.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.040
THEY WILL TIE HER TO THE

09:01.040 --> 09:02.075
CRITICISMS THEY'VE BEEN

09:02.075 --> 09:03.977
MAKING ALREADY OF PRESIDENT

09:03.977 --> 09:05.311
OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY.

09:05.311 --> 09:06.746
THEY WILL TALK ABOUT THINGS

09:06.746 --> 09:08.181
SHE HAS OR HASN'T DONE AS

09:08.181 --> 09:09.149
SECRETARY OF STATE.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.184
THEY WILL TRY TO HOLD THAT

09:11.184 --> 09:12.952
RECORD UP TO GREAT SCRUTINY.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.354
SHE'S GOING TO GET A TON OF

09:14.354 --> 09:15.288
CRITICISM.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.689
SHE STANDS VERY, YOU KNOW,

09:16.689 --> 09:17.690
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE

09:17.690 --> 09:19.592
POLITICAL LANDSCAPE AS IN

MAY BE WAYS A DOMINANT

09:21.094 --> 09:21.528

09:21.528 --> 09:23.396

09:23.396 --> 09:24.831
FROM ALL SIDES AND WITHIN

09:24.831 --> 09:26.599

09:26.599 --> 09:27.867
ABLE TO SATISFY EVERYBODY.

09:27.867 --> 09:29.502
AND AMONG THE REPUBLICANS,

09:29.502 --> 09:31.971
THEY WILL TEE OFF ON HER AS

09:31.971 --> 09:33.006
THEY'VE ALREADY INDICATED

09:33.006 --> 09:34.541
THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO.

BECOMING INFECTED WITH H.I.V.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.116
REDUCE NEW H.I.V. INFECTIONS,

16:26.786 --> 16:28.721
DRUG IN THE LAST YEAR.

16:31.457 --> 16:32.792
THERE ARE SOME SIDE EFFECTS, AS

BUT SOME QUESTION THE NUMBERS.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.186
AND BLOOMBERG REPORTER KEN

19:47.186 --> 19:48.354
HOFFMAN, WHO JUST RETURNED FROM

19:48.354 --> 19:49.655
CHINA, SAYS HE HAS PLENTY OF

19:49.655 --> 19:51.424
ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT THE

19:51.424 --> 19:54.160
ECONOMY THERE IS IN GREATER

19:54.160 --> 19:55.594
TROUBLE THAN CAN BE SEEN BY THE

19:55.594 --> 19:56.829
NUMBERS.

19:56.829 --> 19:57.963
HE JOINS US NOW.

19:57.963 --> 19:58.964
SO YOU FOCUS ON METALS, MINING.

19:58.964 --> 19:59.732
WHEN YOU WENT THROUGH THE

19:59.732 --> 20:00.599
COUNTRYSIDE, WHAT DID YOU SEE?

20:00.599 --> 20:01.434
>> SO THE NEW GOVERNMENT

20:01.434 --> 20:02.535
CAME IN ABOUT FOUR YEARS

20:02.535 --> 20:03.502
AGO.

20:03.502 --> 20:04.703
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO THEY HAD

20:04.703 --> 20:07.106
A MEETING CALLED THE THIRD

20:07.106 --> 20:08.707
PLENUM WHERE THEY DECIDE THE

20:08.707 --> 20:09.675
COUNTRY'S FUTURE OVER THE

20:09.675 --> 20:10.409
NEXT TEN YEARS.

20:10.409 --> 20:11.644
WHAT PEOPLE WERE TELL ME IS

20:11.644 --> 20:12.745
THIS IS A COMPLETELY

20:12.745 --> 20:13.546
DIFFERENT CHINA.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.647
THEY ARE REALLY GOING TO

20:14.647 --> 20:15.848
CHANGE EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT

20:15.848 --> 20:17.116
CHINA DOES.

20:17.116 --> 20:18.584
AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME

20:18.584 --> 20:20.119
I WITNESSED THAT CHANGE,

20:20.119 --> 20:21.387
WHICH IS INSTEAD OF, YOU

20:21.387 --> 20:22.755
KNOW, CHINA CONSUMES ABOUT

20:22.755 --> 20:24.457
HALF OF THE WORLD'S METAL

20:24.457 --> 20:26.559
AND MINING, CEMENT, I THINK

20:26.559 --> 20:28.527
IT'S EVERY 12 DAYS THEY

20:28.527 --> 20:30.296
CONSUME AN ENTIRE YEAR'S WORTH

20:30.296 --> 20:31.397
OF U.S. CEMENT DEMAND.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.698
NOW YOU ARE SEEING THE COUNTRY

20:32.698 --> 20:33.899
SAYING ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.301
YOU HAVE HEARD THE UNDER THE

20:35.301 --> 20:36.268
DOME DOCUMENTARY ABOUT

20:36.268 --> 20:36.936
POLLUTION.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.137
AND THEY'RE REALLY LEANING

20:38.137 --> 20:39.905
TOWARD SORT OF UPGRADING THE

20:39.905 --> 20:41.507
ECONOMY WITH-- AND IT'S

20:41.507 --> 20:42.875
GOING TO HAVE BIG

20:42.875 --> 20:44.043
IMPLICATIONS TO THE WORLD.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.077
>> Sreenivasan: SO YOU SAW

20:45.077 --> 20:46.846
WHAT, BASICALLY THAT THE

20:46.846 --> 20:49.215
THRUST ON MANUFACTURING HAS

20:49.215 --> 20:49.815
SLOWED?

20:49.815 --> 20:51.517
>> FIRST OF ALL THE THRUST

20:51.517 --> 20:52.451
ON REAL ESTATE HAS SLOWED.

20:52.451 --> 20:53.752
ONE OF THE THINGS PEOPLE

20:53.752 --> 20:54.854
SAID WAS THE LOCALITIES

20:54.854 --> 20:56.689
REALLY WERE PUSHING THIS BIG

20:56.689 --> 20:57.556
GROWTH ENGINE.

20:57.556 --> 20:58.991
THE LOCALITY, IF YOU PUT ALL

20:58.991 --> 21:00.459
THE PLANING TO, PLAN TO

21:00.459 --> 21:02.561
BUILD HOMES FOR 3.4 BILLION

21:02.561 --> 21:04.063
PEOPLE, THEY ONLY HAVE 1.2

21:04.063 --> 21:05.498
BILLION PEOPLE SO, THERE WAS

21:05.498 --> 21:06.599
MASSIVE OVERGROWTH.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.167
AND WHAT I SAW WAS A LOT OF

21:08.167 --> 21:09.702
EMPTY BUILDINGS, A LOT OF

21:09.702 --> 21:11.737
TAXI DRIVERS SORT OF SAYING

21:11.737 --> 21:13.072
THROUGH AN INTERPRETER, HEY,

21:13.072 --> 21:14.406
MY AUNT LOST MONEY IN THIS

21:14.406 --> 21:15.875
OR MY UNCLE LOST MONEY IN

21:15.875 --> 21:16.609
THAT PLACE.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.743
IT'S ALL SORT OF JUST

21:17.743 --> 21:18.878
STOPPED.

21:18.878 --> 21:19.879
>> Sreenivasan: SO GIVEN ALL

21:19.879 --> 21:21.313
THIS, WHY DO YOU SEE SUCH A

21:21.313 --> 21:22.748
BURST OF ENERGY IN THE

21:22.748 --> 21:23.582
CHINESE STOCK MARKET.

21:23.582 --> 21:24.950
>> THAT MAKES ALL THE SENSE.

21:24.950 --> 21:25.918
BECAUSE OF INSTEAD OF

21:25.918 --> 21:26.886
INVESTING IN REAL ESTATE,

21:26.886 --> 21:28.354
THE CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE

21:28.354 --> 21:29.288
TURNED ALL THEIR INCOME TO

21:29.288 --> 21:30.222
THE STOCK MARKET.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.957
YOU HAVE SEEN AN INCREDIBLE

21:31.957 --> 21:32.958
AMOUNT OF MONEY LEAVE THE

21:32.958 --> 21:34.226
REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY AND GO

21:34.226 --> 21:35.561
INTO THE STOCK MARKET AND

21:35.561 --> 21:36.695
THE STOCK MARKET HAS DOUBLED

21:36.695 --> 21:38.030
OVER THE LAST YEAR OR SO.

21:38.030 --> 21:38.898
>> WHAT ARE THE RIPPLE

21:38.898 --> 21:40.566
AFFECTS IF THE CHINESE

21:40.566 --> 21:42.535
ECONOMY SLOWS SIGNIFICANTLY

21:42.535 --> 21:44.170
MORE THAN WHAT WE ARE

21:44.170 --> 21:45.237
PREDICTS OR WHAT THE WORLD

21:45.237 --> 21:46.472
MARKETS ARE PREDICTING.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.473
>> THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT

21:47.473 --> 21:48.407
SON I A TIGHTROPE.

21:48.407 --> 21:49.408
WHAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING

21:49.408 --> 21:51.010
TO DO IS CHANGE THE ECONOMY,

21:51.010 --> 21:52.044
UPGRADE THE ECONOMY, GO

21:52.044 --> 21:53.512
HIGHER VALUE ADDED.

21:53.512 --> 21:54.680
AND THE QUESTION IS CAN THEY

21:54.680 --> 21:55.281
DO IT?

21:55.281 --> 21:56.649
I REALLY HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT

21:56.649 --> 21:57.483
FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.651
THEY'RE BEING VERY, VERY

21:58.651 --> 21:59.418
BRAVE.

21:59.418 --> 22:00.686
THERE IS A LOT OF ENTRENCHED

22:00.686 --> 22:02.621
INTEREST AGAINST THAT.

22:02.621 --> 22:03.389
REALLY GOING AFTER THE

22:03.389 --> 22:04.423
GROWTH ENGINE OF THE COUNTRY

22:04.423 --> 22:06.859
FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS.

22:06.859 --> 22:07.626
THEY'RE CHANGING THAT NOW.

22:07.626 --> 22:08.928
AN WHETHER THEY CAN SUCCEED

22:08.928 --> 22:11.063
OR NOT WILL MEAN A LOT FOR

22:11.063 --> 22:12.464
NOT ONLY CHINA AND THEIR

22:12.464 --> 22:13.232
PEOPLE BUT THE WORLD

22:13.232 --> 22:14.433
