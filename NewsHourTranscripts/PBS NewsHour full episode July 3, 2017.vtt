JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.366 --> 00:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.500 --> 00:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: As
the Republican plan to reform
health care struggles to find

00:11.300 --> 00:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its course, we explore
where it stands and what's
at stake for patients.

00:18.600 --> 00:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our new "PBS
NewsHour"/NPR/Marist
poll finds most Americans
believe civility is getting

00:24.666 --> 00:26.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
worse.

00:26.700 --> 00:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tamara Keith and Stu Rothenberg
take a look at that and the
week ahead on Politics Monday.

00:33.233 --> 00:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, fixing club foot in
India -- how a nonsurgical
treatment for the common
birth defect is giving

00:38.700 --> 00:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mobility back to sufferers
in developing countries.

00:42.066 --> 00:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That
treatment was developed
by an orthopedic surgeon
named Ignacio Ponseti

00:48.500 --> 00:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
half-a-world away here in
Iowa, and half-a-century ago.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:00.566 --> 01:03.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.400 --> 01:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Spending fights
in states across the country
are heating up over this long

01:13.100 --> 01:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Fourth of July holiday
period, and none hotter
than in New Jersey.

01:17.533 --> 01:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was day three of a
state government shutdown
with Republican Governor
Chris Christie and

01:23.933 --> 01:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic lawmakers at
odds over the annual budget.

01:26.600 --> 01:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Christie was being criticized
Sunday for using the governor's
official residence at one of

01:33.033 --> 01:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New Jersey's public beaches that
are now closed to the public.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY BRITT, New Jersey
Resident: He has a place to go.

01:37.666 --> 01:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So as long as he can go and his
family can have a good holiday,
I guess that's more important

01:45.133 --> 01:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than the people of New Jersey.

01:47.433 --> 01:49.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's very sad.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christie
dismissed the criticism
today in a phone call
to a morning TV show.

01:55.533 --> 01:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Asked about people being upset,
he said, "Well, I'm sorry
they're not the governor."

01:59.066 --> 02:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Maine's state
government is also partially
shut down over a budget fight.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And lawmakers in Illinois are
back in session, trying to
resolve a budget standoff that's

02:09.866 --> 02:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now in its third year.

02:12.033 --> 02:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump shows no signs
of backing off his public
feud with the news media.

02:16.566 --> 02:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tweeted criticism today
of the media, claiming
that news organizations
are not covering his

02:22.433 --> 02:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
administration's successes.

02:24.366 --> 02:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president drew new criticism
on Sunday after he tweeted
mock video of him tackling

02:30.433 --> 02:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a man with a CNN
logo over his face.

02:34.866 --> 02:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China's President Xi Jinping
warned President Trump today
that U.S.-China relations are

02:41.466 --> 02:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
being harmed by a series
of problems initiated
by the United States.

02:46.933 --> 02:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They include a new U.S. arms
deal with Taiwan and American
sanctions against a Chinese bank

02:51.366 --> 02:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for its dealings
with North Korea.

02:53.733 --> 02:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chinese state TV gave Beijing's
assessment of the call.

02:57.433 --> 03:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
Xi Jinping stressed
to Mr. President Trump
that since our meeting

03:02.066 --> 03:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the Mar-a-Lago resort,
U.S.-China relations
achieved important results.

03:06.933 --> 03:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, the
relationship between
both countries has been
impacted by some negative

03:11.233 --> 03:13.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
factors.

03:13.233 --> 03:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We hope the U.S. can act
earnestly in accordance with
the one-China principle.

03:16.100 --> 03:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The phone call
also came hours after the
destroyer USS Stethem, seen here

03:23.066 --> 03:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last summer, again sailed
near a disputed island
in the South China Sea.

03:29.033 --> 03:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqi army units in Mosul
closed in today on the last
sliver of the city still held

03:34.100 --> 03:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by a few hundred
Islamic State fighters.

03:36.400 --> 03:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government troops were
backed by heavy airstrikes
by the U.S. coalition.

03:41.300 --> 03:46.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ISIS fought back with
female suicide bombers
in Mosul and elsewhere.

03:47.700 --> 03:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They killed at least 15
people in the last 24 hours.

03:51.233 --> 03:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One of bombers was
just 15 years old.

03:54.833 --> 03:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Germany, 18 people were
killed when a bus full of senior
citizens crashed this morning.

04:01.833 --> 04:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police say the bus rear-ended
a semi-truck in Bavaria,
and then burst into flames.

04:07.033 --> 04:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly 200 emergency workers
joined the response and tried to
recover bodies from the charred

04:11.500 --> 04:13.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wreckage.

04:13.566 --> 04:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Authorities say the heat from
the fire was so intense, only
the bus' twisted frame was

04:18.166 --> 04:20.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
left.

04:20.166 --> 04:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, automakers
posted another poor showing
for June, with sales numbers

04:25.500 --> 04:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tumbling for the
sixth straight month.

04:27.633 --> 04:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fiat Chrysler fell more than
7 percent, while Ford and GM
were down roughly 5 percent.

04:33.600 --> 04:38.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, Korean
automaker Hyundai posted
a 19 percent loss.

04:38.533 --> 04:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Analysts say a downturn
was expected after last
year's record sales numbers.

04:45.466 --> 04:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street cut short its
trading day, ahead of the Fourth
of July, but banks and energy

04:50.200 --> 04:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
companies made the most of it.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They led the Dow Jones
industrial average
higher, adding 129
points to close at 21479.

04:59.666 --> 05:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 30 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 gained five.

05:06.666 --> 05:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on the eve of the Fourth
of July, there's new evidence
that Americans need to brush

05:09.700 --> 05:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up on their history.

05:12.333 --> 05:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a "NewsHour"/NPR/Marist
poll, only 77 percent
correctly said the United
States won independence

05:19.500 --> 05:21.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Britain.

05:21.466 --> 05:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rest were unsure or named
another country, including
Russia and Afghanistan.

05:27.566 --> 05:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even fewer, only 69 percent,
knew that the American colonies
declared their independence

05:32.266 --> 05:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the year 1776.

05:33.733 --> 05:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Got to work on that.

05:37.233 --> 05:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the March of Dimes president
on replacing Obamacare;

05:44.200 --> 05:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a new report highlighting
the broad reach of the opioid
epidemic; are Americans less

05:48.733 --> 05:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
civil since President
Trump took office?

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - a "NewsHour" poll
offers clues; and much more.

06:06.166 --> 06:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Republicans in Congress
struggle to reach agreement on
a plan to replace the Affordable

06:10.700 --> 06:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Care Act, we have heard from a
variety of interested parties
in recent weeks and months.

06:17.933 --> 06:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have included
hospitals, the pharmaceutical
industry, advocates for
the homeless and those

06:22.733 --> 06:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with disabilities, as
well as lawmakers from
both political parties.

06:25.566 --> 06:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we turn to the
March of Dimes and its
president, Stacey Stewart.

06:30.266 --> 06:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a nonprofit that focuses
on the health needs of mothers
and babies, especially with

06:37.033 --> 06:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regard to preventing
premature birth, birth
defects and infant mortality.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stacey Stewart, thank you
very much for being here.

06:44.166 --> 06:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what is your main concern
with the Senate version of
this health care reform plan?

06:48.666 --> 06:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STACEY STEWART, President,
March of Dimes: Well, the March
of Dimes, as you mentioned,

06:51.166 --> 06:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what we care about is
the health of pregnant
women and their babies.

06:54.700 --> 06:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our main concern with the
Senate bill, as it's proposed,
is that it would put at

06:59.033 --> 07:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
risk the health of many of
those women and their babies.

07:02.733 --> 07:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid today covers about half
of all pregnancies in the United
States and there are about 30

07:07.266 --> 07:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
million children that
are covered by Medicaid.

07:09.833 --> 07:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Under what the Senate
has proposed, about
6.5 million low-income
women of child-bearing

07:13.966 --> 07:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
age would lose their
coverage under Medicaid.

07:17.433 --> 07:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we think that that puts
at risk those women in terms
of them being able to access

07:22.166 --> 07:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prenatal care and all the
things they need to do to have
a healthy baby, have a healthy

07:25.366 --> 07:27.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pregnancy.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, about half
of pregnant women in this
country depend on government

07:31.133 --> 07:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help in order to have
a healthy pregnancy?

07:32.833 --> 07:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STACEY STEWART: Right.

07:35.366 --> 07:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what Medicaid covers
is -- it generally covers
a lot of low-income
women who are pregnant

07:37.833 --> 07:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and making sure they have the
help they need in prenatal
care and also in delivering the

07:43.600 --> 07:45.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
baby.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what it also covers, and
what a lot of people don't
understand, is that, if a baby

07:47.766 --> 07:51.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is born too soon, born
premature, if a baby
is born with low birth
weight or a baby has

07:51.966 --> 07:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defects, Medicaid also covers
many of those babies as well.

07:55.366 --> 07:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it ends up covering a lot
of the babies and providing
the support that many women

07:59.433 --> 08:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and families need to
make sure they can have
a healthy pregnancy and
have the support that

08:02.900 --> 08:04.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
babies need if there
are complications.

08:04.966 --> 08:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think there
hasn't been a great deal of
talk about prevention, but you

08:08.933 --> 08:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
were telling us that
prevention is a very -
- is a big part of this.

08:12.400 --> 08:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STACEY STEWART: Well, I think
one of the big conversations
that is going on right now is,

08:15.733 --> 08:17.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how do we stabilize
the health market?

08:17.833 --> 08:22.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think -- how do
we stabilize Medicaid
and I think stabilize
health care in general?

08:22.033 --> 08:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think one of the
conversations we really
need to have as a country
is, how do we begin

08:26.033 --> 08:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do even more, to put more
of the emphasis on prevention
and care earlier on, vs. having

08:32.633 --> 08:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a system that really is
funding a lot of chronic
disease and illness?

08:34.666 --> 08:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, one of the reasons we focus
so much on maternity coverage
and prenatal care is because

08:39.366 --> 08:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that's what happens to
enable those women to
have healthy babies.

08:43.233 --> 08:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they get the help they
need, and certainly even before
they get pregnant, if they are

08:47.066 --> 08:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
healthy before they even get
pregnant, that is going to be
what creates the best outcome

08:51.733 --> 08:52.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for that baby.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so healthy women
equals healthy babies.

08:55.900 --> 09:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The more and more we
can put more emphasis
on early prevention
efforts and fund a system

09:00.600 --> 09:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that actually focuses on that,
we think will improve health
outcomes, reduce cost, reduce

09:06.766 --> 09:08.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
premiums, which is what
I think everybody wants.

09:08.866 --> 09:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Isn't it
the case, though, Stacey
Stewart, that, under
traditional Medicaid,

09:14.633 --> 09:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states are required to cover
pregnancy, to cover prenatal
care, to cover babies?

09:20.633 --> 09:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, even if Medicaid is scaled
back, which looks like would
be the case under the Senate

09:27.133 --> 09:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan, the Republican plan, they
would still be required to cover
women in these circumstances,

09:30.933 --> 09:33.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wouldn't they?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STACEY STEWART: Well,
the problem is, is
that with reductions as
they're proposed, we're

09:35.833 --> 09:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not exactly sure if -- how much
of the need would be covered.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's always a question.

09:41.533 --> 09:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with women coming off of
Medicaid coverage as a result
of the pullback of the expansion

09:45.966 --> 09:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Medicaid, I think there is
a real concern that we have.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, of course, the
concern isn't just in
the Medicaid market.

09:51.333 --> 09:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The concern is also
in the private market.

09:53.400 --> 09:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, what a lot of people
don't realize is, before
the Affordable Care
Act, private health

10:00.266 --> 10:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care plans didn't necessarily
include maternity coverage
as a requirement, as
did employer-based

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plans or Medicaid.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we have got to look
at the totality of the health
care system in making sure that

10:08.700 --> 10:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all women, irrespective of
them being in a private plan or
Medicaid, have access to those

10:13.133 --> 10:15.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
resources they need.

10:15.166 --> 10:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we believe that much
of the support that women
need could be at risk.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what our
primary concern is.

10:20.366 --> 10:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you answer
the argument from conservatives
that, look, something has

10:24.533 --> 10:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got to be done, that Medicaid
has grown at a rate that's
just out of control, cannot

10:29.133 --> 10:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be sustained, and unless some
methods are found to scale
that back, Medicaid is not

10:35.600 --> 10:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be there in the long
term for people who need it?

10:37.633 --> 10:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STACEY STEWART: Well,
we share that concern.

10:39.666 --> 10:44.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Obviously, the costs of
Medicaid are exorbitant
and they're growing.

10:44.266 --> 10:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But let's look at what's really
going on in the Medicaid market.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got a lot of low-income
women, many women of color.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what we see are health
outcomes not improving.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the big concerns that
we have at the March of Dimes
is we just -- the government

10:59.133 --> 11:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just issued some statistics
showing that pre-term
birth rates have now
increased for the second

11:06.033 --> 11:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time in the past two years,
after some decline over
the past seven years.

11:11.400 --> 11:14.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Health outcomes are not
improving for pregnant
mothers and babies.

11:14.866 --> 11:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's actually going down.

11:17.166 --> 11:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, one of the things that
we can do to control the costs
of Medicaid and health care

11:21.266 --> 11:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in general, again, is to focus
on what all early interventions
can be put in place, what

11:28.266 --> 11:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prevention methods could be
put in place to educate and
inform and provide the support

11:33.766 --> 11:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the health care coverage
that women need, so that both
kind of health outcomes can be

11:36.300 --> 11:38.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
avoided.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we can avoid those health
outcomes, then we can avoid the
cost in the system, and then

11:40.833 --> 11:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can keep those costs under
control, so that we have a
much more manageable system

11:44.233 --> 11:46.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over time.

11:46.333 --> 11:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have heard
on occasion from Republicans
the argument, why should men,

11:52.166 --> 11:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially single men, be
required to buy - - to have
coverage that includes maternity

11:57.433 --> 11:59.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and birth costs?

11:59.533 --> 12:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STACEY STEWART: Well, that
argument just goes against
what insurance is all about.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We all buy insurance
for things we -- that
may never happen to us.

12:05.833 --> 12:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all buy insurance for a lot
of things, including health
insurance for health outcomes

12:10.000 --> 12:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we may never suffer from.

12:12.466 --> 12:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that women
are responsible for
child-bearing does not mean
that they're responsible

12:18.833 --> 12:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for creating the baby in the
first place by themselves.

12:20.400 --> 12:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It takes men and women
together to create babies.

12:25.033 --> 12:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we believe it's very
important that the insurance
market cover those things that

12:31.900 --> 12:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are risks that each one of us
individually may not experience,
but they are risks and

12:38.266 --> 12:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are costs that are in
the system that are important
to make sure get covered.

12:43.433 --> 12:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think it's really important
to say, look, when we buy
insurance, we buy it for a lot

12:45.466 --> 12:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of things that we personally may
not experience or be impacted
by, but that's the point of

12:52.266 --> 12:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having insurance and that's the
point of having a larger pool
of risk included in insurance,

12:54.666 --> 12:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that it reduces the cost
for everyone to participate.

12:56.866 --> 13:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stacey Stewart,
the president of the March
of Dimes, and the debate goes

13:00.900 --> 13:01.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

13:03.833 --> 13:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STACEY STEWART: Thank
you so much, Judy.

13:10.766 --> 13:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: A new study
by one of the nation's biggest
health insurance companies

13:18.000 --> 13:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provides a startling
look at the toll that
prescription opioids are
taking on its policy-holders.

13:24.066 --> 13:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The insurance
giant Blue Cross Blue Shield
analyzed medical records

13:29.766 --> 13:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for 30 million of its customers.

13:31.766 --> 13:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it found some
striking results.

13:33.966 --> 13:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2015, roughly 20 percent of
their customers, one in five,
filled at least one prescription

13:39.700 --> 13:41.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for opioid painkillers.

13:41.800 --> 13:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost half of those patients
were prescribed high doses of
those drugs, which are more

13:45.566 --> 13:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
likely to cause dependence.

13:47.633 --> 13:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, indeed, between 2010 and
2016, the rate of abuse or
addiction to those painkillers

13:54.200 --> 13:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot up dramatically by almost
500 percent, this while the
rate of medically assisted

14:00.466 --> 14:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treatment, considered the
most successful way to curb
those addictions, grew by just

14:04.533 --> 14:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
65 percent in the
same time frame.

14:07.533 --> 14:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report also detailed
differences in opioid
abuse between men and
women and among different

14:11.866 --> 14:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
parts of the country.

14:13.366 --> 14:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For more on this, I'm joined
now by Dr. Trent Haywood.

14:16.266 --> 14:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the chief medical
officer for the Blue Cross
Blue Shield Association.

14:20.466 --> 14:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

14:22.600 --> 14:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a very, very interesting
set of data that you have
produced from your patients'

14:28.066 --> 14:30.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
records.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have said one in five have
had a prescription for these
painkillers, obviously, most of

14:32.900 --> 14:36.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them for very legitimate
pain-suppression needs.

14:36.666 --> 14:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have also discovered
here that the rate of
addiction has shot up.

14:41.233 --> 14:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why do you think that
has been happening?

14:42.833 --> 14:44.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD, Chief Medical
Officer, Blue Cross Blue Shield
Association: Well, one of

14:46.933 --> 14:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the things, the reason
why we wanted to focus
on this particular
issue is just what you

14:48.933 --> 14:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just alluded to, the escalation
in the opioid addiction from
physicians prescribing these

14:53.900 --> 14:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particular opioids.

14:55.933 --> 15:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Starting in the '90s, we really
went aggressive as physicians
making sure that we address

15:00.633 --> 15:02.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pain.

15:02.733 --> 15:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unfortunately, it was found out
later, as we are starting to see
unfold now, we underestimated

15:05.800 --> 15:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the risk related to that
particular high doses
of prescribing those
particular opioids.

15:12.233 --> 15:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now we are suffering
the consequences of that.

15:14.266 --> 15:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Some of this
data that you guys have put
together, it is not necessarily

15:17.000 --> 15:18.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new news.

15:18.933 --> 15:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why hasn't the message seemingly
gotten out to the medical
community just how serious

15:22.933 --> 15:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these drugs really are?

15:24.133 --> 15:26.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

15:26.266 --> 15:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD: Well, one of
the things that we know when
it comes to medicine and the

15:28.366 --> 15:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
practice of medicine is that it
really requires a substantial
amount of time for it to change.

15:32.933 --> 15:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're headed into the
independence holiday,
and so people are
moving off to make sure

15:36.733 --> 15:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they enjoy times with
their friends and family, but
as this report highlights, all

15:40.933 --> 15:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of us won't necessarily be
independent this particular
day, because whether it be your

15:45.400 --> 15:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family, whether it be your
neighbor's family or whether it
be someone down the block, we're

15:49.233 --> 15:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all struggling with this
issue of opioid addiction.

15:52.700 --> 15:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over two million Americans
each year are suffering
from this opioid addiction.

15:57.100 --> 16:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what is key about that
particular aspect is that it's
not one specific demographic.

16:01.766 --> 16:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
treatments, the best-known
treatments for these
addictions have barely

16:07.500 --> 16:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kept up with the pace.

16:08.700 --> 16:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why do you think that is?

16:09.700 --> 16:11.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

16:11.733 --> 16:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD: We're talking
about someone moving from what
would normally would be an

16:13.333 --> 16:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
acute situation to
a chronic condition.

16:16.333 --> 16:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this opioid addiction
is a chronic condition and
we need to treat it that way.

16:23.366 --> 16:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We need to make certain
these people are not
only in treatment, but
they have the necessary

16:25.233 --> 16:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
support for the chronic
condition that they have.

16:27.566 --> 16:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: If I am a
policy holder of Blue Cross
Blue Shield and I recognize

16:32.033 --> 16:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I have a substance problem,
and I come and I try to get
treatment for that, will

16:36.433 --> 16:38.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
my policy cover that
addiction treatment?

16:38.933 --> 16:39.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRENT HAYWOOD: Yes.

16:41.933 --> 16:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, one of the reasons why we're
highlighting this is because
you -- actually make certain

16:45.233 --> 16:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that you follow up at
your local plan level
to get that treatment.

16:48.800 --> 16:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is something that
is actually covered in
most members' policies.

16:53.266 --> 16:55.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so you absolutely
should be following up
to get that treatment.

16:55.666 --> 16:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things I was also struck by
in your report is the gender

16:59.300 --> 17:01.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
differences.

17:01.433 --> 17:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed that younger -- when
the genders are younger, when
men and women are younger,

17:04.600 --> 17:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
men seem to be more vulnerable.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But as we age, women
seem to become more
vulnerable to addiction.

17:09.933 --> 17:11.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you have a sense
of why that is?

17:11.200 --> 17:13.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD: One of the
reasons why we think women are
being impacted as we get into an

17:15.766 --> 17:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
older age group is the fact that
they're appropriately following
up with their physicians.

17:20.466 --> 17:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you think about it, the
more that you are following
up, the more likely that you're

17:23.666 --> 17:25.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to be
prescribed an opioid.

17:25.733 --> 17:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we're seeing women are
actually at an accelerated
pace the more that we get into

17:30.333 --> 17:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the older age groups.

17:32.433 --> 17:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that's the correlation
that you're seeing, why women
would necessarily be higher,

17:35.966 --> 17:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they are more
predisposed to actually
getting that prescribed opioid.

17:38.900 --> 17:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At the very
moment we're talking, the
Senate is debating a health care

17:42.433 --> 17:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bill that could eliminate
hundreds of billions of
dollars from Medicaid.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid itself pays for
much of addiction treatment
around the country.

17:50.966 --> 17:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you share concern of many
that, if this bill were to
become law, that this -- those

17:57.433 --> 18:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cuts to Medicaid
could only worsen an
already awful epidemic?

18:00.333 --> 18:02.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

18:02.366 --> 18:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD: From every
indication, this particular
issue is not partisan at all.

18:05.500 --> 18:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, whether you're on the
right or on the left, what we
have understood is, as relates

18:09.400 --> 18:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the opioid epidemic, both
sides of the aisle are eager
to be able to address that

18:14.233 --> 18:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particular concern.

18:16.366 --> 18:20.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, while there may
be broader implications
as it relates to health
care reform, on this

18:20.166 --> 18:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
particular topic, I think we
all stand together as Americans.

18:22.766 --> 18:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All
right, Dr. Trent Haywood,
chief medical officer of
Blue Cross Blue Shield,

18:27.200 --> 18:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you so much.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

18:29.200 --> 18:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRENT HAYWOOD: Thank you.

18:33.133 --> 18:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Coming up on
the "NewsHour": bringing hope
to children with a treatable

18:45.400 --> 18:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
birth defect in India; how
one undocumented family in
Wisconsin has chosen to come out

18:52.333 --> 18:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the shadows; and from
our "NewsHour" bookshelf, a
retelling of a Greek tragedy.

18:59.433 --> 19:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first, we examine the
results from our latest "PBS
NewsHour"/NPR/Marist poll, the

19:06.366 --> 19:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president's continued attacks
against the media, and the
battle over health care on

19:10.200 --> 19:12.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Capitol Hill.

19:12.300 --> 19:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's time for Politics Monday
with Tamara Keith of NPR and
Stu Rothenberg, senior editor

19:17.566 --> 19:19.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Inside Elections.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And welcome to you both on this
day before the Fourth of July.

19:22.266 --> 19:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thank you for wearing
red, white and blue.

19:24.233 --> 19:26.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:26.200 --> 19:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tam, the
White House is saying they
fully respect that some version

19:29.800 --> 19:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a reform plan that the
Republicans like is going to
pass the Senate, going to pass

19:35.400 --> 19:36.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What does your
reporting tell you?

19:38.700 --> 19:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It's possible, though,
at the moment, Mitch McConnell

19:40.833 --> 19:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has described the effort to
find a health care bill that
50 Republicans can support

19:47.433 --> 19:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the Senate as like
working with a Rubik's Cube.

19:50.633 --> 19:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, you move one piece,
and then some other piece
moves out of the way.

19:57.033 --> 19:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a very delicate negotiation
that's happening right now.

19:59.233 --> 20:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not clear that
they will get there.

20:01.266 --> 20:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the Medicaid tests
that were just discussed in
the last segment are a hangup.

20:05.666 --> 20:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are other hangups for
more conservative Republicans.

20:09.700 --> 20:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they are highly motivated
to get to a win, and so you
can't discount the motivation

20:16.500 --> 20:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that exists to find a way.

20:18.533 --> 20:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu, I think I
have you asked this question
before, so what is the calculus?

20:21.533 --> 20:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if you're a Senate
Republican, what
are you thinking?

20:23.733 --> 20:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Inside
Elections: Yes, I think the
choice is not passing anything,

20:27.566 --> 20:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or passing something
that's going to be broadly
unpopular, but is going
to find a lot of support

20:33.966 --> 20:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from within Republican
and conservative circles.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the choice.

20:37.300 --> 20:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for most Republicans,
I think for most
Republicans strategists,
campaign strategists,

20:40.633 --> 20:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
passing something is
a strong imperative.

20:43.133 --> 20:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's , you have to do
something for the base,
even if you risk alienating
the larger electorate.

20:49.233 --> 20:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For individual members, that
has different equations.

20:51.533 --> 20:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For somebody like Lisa Murkowski
in Alaska, Susan Collins,
Rand Paul, Rob Portman, they

20:58.000 --> 21:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have their own considerations,
ideological or state-based.

21:00.566 --> 21:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it
still looks, Tam, like
it's really hard to square
the circle or circle

21:04.633 --> 21:06.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the square.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, at this
point, it does look that
way, but you know what?

21:09.266 --> 21:12.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It kind of looked that
way in the House, too.

21:12.300 --> 21:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It looked like it was
a dead bill, so we were
calling it a zombie bill.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then next thing you
knew, boom, they passed it.

21:19.700 --> 21:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They came up with a compromise
that didn't seem to materially
change anything, and yet

21:26.166 --> 21:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it passed, and they were able
to move it over to the Senate.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so, you know, don't
declare this thing dead.

21:31.466 --> 21:33.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It could be back.

21:33.066 --> 21:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So maybe,
Stu, where there's a
will, there's a way.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And where
there's a Mitch McConnell,
there's always a possibility.

21:37.033 --> 21:39.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:39.000 --> 21:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, so
let's talk about something
else, and that is, Tam, back to

21:40.800 --> 21:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the president's tweets.

21:42.900 --> 21:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's tweeted I guess a couple
of times about health care,
but he's tweeted a number of

21:46.700 --> 21:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
times about the news media.

21:49.600 --> 21:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week, it was the
cable show hosts Mika
Brzezinski, Joe Scarborough.

21:54.133 --> 21:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But yesterday there was this new
tweet where it was sort of an
edited video of the president

22:01.066 --> 22:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pummeling a man on the
ground, we're showing it
here, with CNN over his face.

22:07.766 --> 22:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do we interpret this?

22:10.366 --> 22:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: There are
many ways to interpret it,
but, you know, President
Trump, as a candidate

22:15.766 --> 22:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and now as a president,
to use the wrestling
analogy, he wanted a heel.

22:21.233 --> 22:22.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He needs a heel.

22:22.233 --> 22:24.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He needs a foe.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, he has
decided that the media is
going to be his foe, his
heel in this wrestling

22:30.933 --> 22:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
match that is his presidency.

22:33.366 --> 22:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, I mean, that image,
that video is a pretty perfect
description of the way he

22:39.566 --> 22:41.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is approaching this.

22:41.600 --> 22:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Having that fight, having
that feud really excites
some people who support him.

22:48.466 --> 22:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there are others who
are turned off by it and, you
know, we could go down the road

22:54.166 --> 22:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the dangers of having
a video that looks
like it is encouraging
violence against members

22:59.366 --> 23:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the media, but it works
for -- this is the same Donald
Trump who ran for president

23:04.066 --> 23:05.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and won.

23:05.566 --> 23:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does
it advance his cause now?

23:07.666 --> 23:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes,
first of all, I think Tam
is exactly right on this.

23:09.466 --> 23:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would just add two things.

23:11.333 --> 23:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One is, it advances his
cause by mobilizing and
motivating his base.

23:17.566 --> 23:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They love it when he
attacks the media.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They really think it's exciting
and they agree with him.

23:22.600 --> 23:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure we will talk
about how the media is not
held in the highest regard.

23:26.766 --> 23:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Second of all, he enjoys it.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all -- look, let's
remember, Judy, he did that
in that wrestling show.

23:33.566 --> 23:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He actually did that.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's his ego.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He wants to be the
center of attention.

23:38.166 --> 23:41.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He wants to be the
focus of everything.

23:41.566 --> 23:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think he just has a
lot of fun when he does that.

23:44.933 --> 23:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for Donald Trump, it's
more fun to do that than to
actually get into the weeds in

23:49.900 --> 23:51.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public policy.

23:51.900 --> 23:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And I was talking
to Republican consultant today
who was like, yes, it's a

23:55.533 --> 23:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
distraction, but maybe it's a
welcome distraction, because if
the people are talking about his

23:59.600 --> 24:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tweets and talking about
WrestleMania, then they aren't
talking about Medicaid cuts.

24:04.033 --> 24:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, of course,
there's been the role of a
free press in a democracy, one

24:07.433 --> 24:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the pillars of our form of
government in this country.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we can -- we could talk
about that another time.

24:12.433 --> 24:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do want to raise in our
last few minutes this new CNN
-- I'm sorry -- I had CNN on

24:19.000 --> 24:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the brain from the video -- the
new poll that the "NewsHour"
and NPR did in conjunction

24:24.900 --> 24:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Marist, where, one of
the things we looked at, Stu,
exactly what you mentioned, high

24:28.900 --> 24:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
distrust of the news media.

24:31.400 --> 24:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than two-thirds of
Americans, they were asked,
what do you think about
trust in institutions?

24:35.200 --> 24:37.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And here it is.

24:37.200 --> 24:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thirty-seven percent, a good
deal or a great amount of trust
in the Trump administration,

24:43.566 --> 24:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
30 percent, even less, trust in
the news -- in the media, and
20, about on same par as trust

24:49.300 --> 24:51.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Congress.

24:51.333 --> 24:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you go on to see trust in
the intelligence community,
twice that much, 60 percent, and

24:55.100 --> 24:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the courts, 60 percent.

24:57.200 --> 25:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the bottom line here,
Stu, is that the media may
be a good whipping boy.

25:04.166 --> 25:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes, and I
think the public sees the media
as a political institution,

25:06.366 --> 25:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
just as they see
the White House, the
president and Congress.

25:09.633 --> 25:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, right now, nobody
trusts politicians or
people covering politicians.

25:15.366 --> 25:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a horrible trend.

25:17.933 --> 25:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I look back at the Gallup
numbers in the early
1970s, and those of us
in the media are regarded

25:24.633 --> 25:26.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much worse than
we were back then.

25:26.766 --> 25:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's been occurring over
the last couple of decades.

25:29.600 --> 25:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Republican
Senator Ben Sasse over the
weekend said something that goes

25:33.800 --> 25:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in conjunction with the tweets
and fits with these numbers too.

25:36.666 --> 25:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he was concerned
that the president was
trying to weaponize distrust.

25:40.900 --> 25:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then here's the quote:
"We are at risk of getting to
a place where we don't have

25:45.300 --> 25:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a shared set of public facts.

25:47.533 --> 25:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The republic will not work if
we don't have shared facts."

25:50.966 --> 25:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These numbers are part of a
very long trend of institutions
losing trust from the American

25:57.900 --> 25:58.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

25:58.900 --> 26:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that puts America at risk.

26:01.033 --> 26:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
in the last 30 seconds, I want
to show our audience and you

26:03.600 --> 26:06.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this -- the other
question in the poll.

26:06.100 --> 26:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since President Trump
was elected, has the
overall tone and level
of civility in Washington

26:10.633 --> 26:11.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gotten worse?

26:11.866 --> 26:13.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Seventy percent.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Stayed the same, 20 improved, 6.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Stu, I guess no surprise here.

26:17.566 --> 26:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: No.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some people actually see
what they want to see.

26:20.233 --> 26:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Strong Republican -- 17
percent said that it improved.

26:23.366 --> 26:27.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And white evangelicals,
10 percent had --
they said improved.

26:27.566 --> 26:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But the overall sample
is very clear and, in
fact, very correct.

26:31.666 --> 26:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Things have deteriorated.

26:32.666 --> 26:33.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're coarser.

26:33.666 --> 26:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're more vulgar.

26:35.633 --> 26:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a time of better tone.

26:38.100 --> 26:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we are
glad to promote civility
here at the "NewsHour."

26:41.633 --> 26:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Stu Rothenberg, Tamara
Keith, thank you both.

26:43.366 --> 26:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

26:44.400 --> 26:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Thanks, Judy.

26:47.033 --> 26:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
can find more about these
findings from our joint
"PBS NewsHour"/NPR/Marist

26:51.800 --> 26:53.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poll.

26:53.033 --> 26:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

27:02.500 --> 27:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next: bringing help to
developing countries for a
widely untreated birth defect.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fred de Sam Lazaro has a
report from India's commercial
capital, Mumbai, on a condition

27:17.733 --> 27:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called club foot.

27:19.233 --> 27:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its part of his ongoing
series Agents for Change.

27:22.233 --> 27:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It
only sounds painful.

27:27.000 --> 27:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This wailing 5-year-old
is receiving the very
same treatment, a full
leg plaster cast, as

27:33.066 --> 27:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this young, perfectly
happy infant.

27:37.533 --> 27:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The therapy here in Mumbai's
Wadia Charitable Hospital will
save these children from a life

27:42.066 --> 27:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of pain and social isolation
that comes from club foot.

27:46.233 --> 27:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a common birth defect
that, in wealthy countries, is
usually corrected early in life.

27:53.700 --> 27:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the developing
world, it remains largely
untreated and becomes a
disability, says orthopedist

27:57.400 --> 27:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dr. ®MDNMlaric Aroojis.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
®MDNMLARIC AROOJIS,
Orthopedist: It is
probably the second or
third important cause

28:02.666 --> 28:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of physical disability in
India, after road traffic
accidents and trauma.

28:06.266 --> 28:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's more of a cosmetic
problem initially.

28:09.200 --> 28:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as they grow older and
they can find that they can no
longer play with their friends,

28:13.033 --> 28:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's when it starts
sinking in that this is a
functional problem as well.

28:16.366 --> 28:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Club foot
is congenital birth defect in
which a foot, in some cases

28:20.600 --> 28:23.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
both feet, grow inward.

28:23.233 --> 28:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Patients learn to walk
on the side of the foot.

28:26.166 --> 28:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twenty-six-year-old Madhu
Varma says it's painful for
sustained periods, but like most

28:32.333 --> 28:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sufferers, she's
learned to adapt.

28:34.433 --> 28:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What she could not deal with
was the sight of her daughter,
Madhuri, when she too was

28:39.033 --> 28:40.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
born with club foot.

28:40.666 --> 28:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MADHU VARMA, Mother
(through translator):
It was really difficult.

28:43.733 --> 28:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I cried for days when
I saw my child's foot.

28:46.600 --> 28:47.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I could not eat.

28:47.966 --> 28:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was just sick with worry.

28:49.866 --> 28:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they told me that, with
plaster, they could treat it.

28:52.833 --> 28:54.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

28:54.533 --> 28:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
®MDNMLARIC AROOJIS:
So this is the daughter
and this is the mother.

28:55.933 --> 28:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the daughter's foot
is fully corrected.

28:58.333 --> 29:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
That correction once
required extensive
surgery, Dr. Aroojis says.

29:04.566 --> 29:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now treatment in most cases
is a series of casts over
several weeks:, less invasive,

29:08.966 --> 29:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
less expensive and less painful.

29:10.700 --> 29:12.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:12.166 --> 29:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
®MDNMLARIC AROOJIS:
It's such a supple method.

29:13.333 --> 29:15.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't force the
foot in any way at all.

29:15.466 --> 29:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, as you can see, that every
time we move the foot just
as much as the child allows.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a procedure which is
done without any anesthetic.

29:21.966 --> 29:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Once corrected, patients
like 5-year-old Nishant
wear a brace attached

29:26.833 --> 29:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to an outward-facing
pair of shoes.

29:29.633 --> 29:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a few months, as in
this case, it's only needed
at night and nap time.

29:34.133 --> 29:37.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nishant shows no sign
of an abnormal gait.

29:37.366 --> 29:42.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His parents, struggling
slum dwellers, spent
hundreds of dollars at
ill-equipped and poorly

29:43.500 --> 29:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
informed private clinics
with little success.

29:45.500 --> 29:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KETAN DHEPE, Father (through
translator): We had never
heard of club foot until he was

29:49.966 --> 29:52.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
born.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We felt terrible, but when
we brought him to Mumbai, two
or three people told me that

29:54.633 --> 29:56.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Wadia Hospital has
the best treatment.

29:56.800 --> 30:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That
treatment was developed
by an orthopedic surgeon
named Ignacio Ponseti

30:03.166 --> 30:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
half-a-world away here in
Iowa and half-a-century ago.

30:06.733 --> 30:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would take decades before the
Ponseti method became standard
practice for treating club

30:12.200 --> 30:13.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
foot.

30:13.433 --> 30:15.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why do you suppose it
took as long as it did?

30:15.800 --> 30:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHESCA COLLOREDO-MANSFELD,
Business Consultant: One is that
the kinds of people that were

30:19.566 --> 30:24.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
treating club foot, at
least in the U.S., were
orthopedic surgeons.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think they became
surgeons for a reason.

30:26.433 --> 30:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They like doing surgery.

30:27.733 --> 30:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this was introducing
a nonsurgical technique.

30:30.933 --> 30:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think there was
some resistance to that.

30:32.933 --> 30:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Chesca
Colloredo-Mansfeld, a business
consultant, lived in Iowa city,

30:37.700 --> 30:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where Ponseti, a Spanish
immigrant, was a local legend.

30:41.000 --> 30:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHESCA COLLOREDO-MANSFELD: Dr.
Ponseti's dying wish -- he was
in his 90s at that time -- was

30:45.600 --> 30:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to try to get his treatment
out to the rest of the world.

30:48.300 --> 30:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Colloredo-Mansfeld started
one of several nonprofit
efforts to fulfill

30:52.866 --> 30:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Ponseti's wish to take the
nonsurgical approach, finally
standard in the U.S., to

30:58.633 --> 31:01.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
developing countries.

31:01.333 --> 31:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She co-founded a charity
in 2010 called Miracle
Feet, supported mostly by
high net worth individuals

31:06.333 --> 31:08.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and foundations.

31:08.400 --> 31:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's taken the Ponseti method
and message to clinics in 19
countries so far, with some

31:15.000 --> 31:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
23,000 patients, including
those in Mumbai, providing
training and supplies at low or

31:20.133 --> 31:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no cost, including braces
patients will use after their
cast treatments are done.

31:26.600 --> 31:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In India, casting is done by
surgeons, but in countries
where they aren't available,

31:31.366 --> 31:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
non-physicians are trained.

31:33.500 --> 31:37.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Another key role is that
of clinic assistants,
paid by Miracle Feet.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHESCA COLLOREDO-MANSFELD: They
work to educate that family
during the bracing phase to make

31:40.800 --> 31:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure that the children wear the
brace at night and complete the
treatment over the next four

31:45.366 --> 31:47.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

31:47.433 --> 31:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the correction itself only
takes two to three months,
but the follow-up period of

31:50.433 --> 31:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maintaining that correction
is absolutely critical.

31:53.033 --> 31:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Veteran orthopedic surgeon
Rujuta Mehta says parents
of club foot patients,

31:59.633 --> 32:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once terrified at the prospect
and cost of surgery, are
elated when they discover it's

32:03.366 --> 32:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no longer needed.

32:04.366 --> 32:06.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:06.366 --> 32:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUJUTA MEHTA, Orthopedic
Surgeon: The acceptability,
therefore, of Ponseti is huge.

32:08.766 --> 32:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Its much simpler, less
intimidating and it's cheaper?

32:12.233 --> 32:13.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:13.233 --> 32:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUJUTA MEHTA: Yes, absolutely.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, it's cheaper.

32:15.933 --> 32:18.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this is the kind of
thing you can apply in
a public health program.

32:18.033 --> 32:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The number
of children being treated has
tripled over the past decade

32:20.466 --> 32:22.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or so.

32:22.433 --> 32:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet five out of six club
foot patients go untreated in
developing countries like India,

32:28.466 --> 32:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still enduring an easily
correctable condition for
the rest of their lives.

32:31.366 --> 32:33.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So the challenge is to
get the word out early?

32:33.400 --> 32:35.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:35.466 --> 32:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUJUTA MEHTA: Absolutely, and
the more awareness there, the
earlier they come, the easier to

32:38.633 --> 32:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
treat, the better the
deformity correction.

32:41.066 --> 32:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A
deformity that is correctable
even in adulthood, as
Madhu Varma discovered

32:47.233 --> 32:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when getting her
daughter treated.

32:51.133 --> 32:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She became the oldest patient
this clinic has ever treated.

32:54.433 --> 32:56.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:56.533 --> 32:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MDNMLARIC AROOJIS: There's
a very good possibility that,
just with serial castings

32:58.633 --> 33:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the Ponseti method, we
should be able to get a
full correction in her.

33:01.766 --> 33:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She had a
wedding to attend, she told the
doctors, where she and daughter

33:06.233 --> 33:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Madhuri would be able to dance.

33:08.500 --> 33:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam Lazaro in Mumbai.

33:12.033 --> 33:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that
is something to celebrate.

33:15.333 --> 33:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fred's reporting is a
partnership with the
Under-Told Stories
Project at the University

33:19.766 --> 33:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of St. Thomas in Minnesota.

33:33.933 --> 33:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the wake of the 2016
election, many undocumented
immigrants across this
country have become

33:40.266 --> 33:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anxious and fearful of increased
immigration enforcement.

33:43.466 --> 33:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, the story about one
family in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
where the children are American

33:49.633 --> 33:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
citizens, but the
parents are not.

33:51.666 --> 33:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Milwaukee
Public Television,
Portia Young reports.

33:55.533 --> 34:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: Every
morning, Lola Flores gets
her children ready for
school, and her husband,

34:04.033 --> 34:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jose, plays with their
youngest daughter
before leaving for work.

34:07.533 --> 34:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for Jose and Lola, ever
since the new presidential
administration took over, each

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
morning has become the start of
another day of living in fear,
fear that they may be separated

34:18.966 --> 34:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from their four children,
who are American citizens, by
U.S. Immigration and Customs

34:22.466 --> 34:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Enforcement agents,
due to increased
immigration enforcement.

34:25.933 --> 34:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LOLA FLORES, Undocumented
Immigrant: The more
important thing for my
family is that we stay

34:31.533 --> 34:32.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
together.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't imagine a
separation with my littlest.

34:34.433 --> 34:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We live with fear every
day, and it's not easy.

34:38.466 --> 34:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE FLORES, Undocumented
Immigrant (through translator):
If I get deported, I don't know

34:42.366 --> 34:44.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what will happen
with my children.

34:44.366 --> 34:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: Their 15-year
old daughter, Leslie, is
equally frightened her parents

34:48.500 --> 34:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be arrested by
Immigration Customs
Enforcement agents, or ICE.

34:52.133 --> 34:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLIE FLORES, Daughter: I
am worried that there's been
rumors that there's been raids.

34:59.200 --> 35:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm scared that, what
if they go to the store
and they get taken by ICE?

35:06.100 --> 35:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: The Flores family
says it is not just the risk
of deportation that scares

35:12.600 --> 35:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many of the families, but also
the negative attitude that
anti-immigrant supporters have

35:16.733 --> 35:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taken against undocumented
immigrants since President
Trump took office.

35:20.833 --> 35:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSE FLORES (through
translator): A person
came to me and said:
"Nice truck and nice

35:30.333 --> 35:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
family, but get the hell
out of this country."

35:38.333 --> 35:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My son then turned around
to look at me and said:
"What happened, daddy?

35:41.833 --> 35:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why is this person
telling us this?"

35:44.166 --> 35:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I told my son: "It's nothing.

35:46.433 --> 35:47.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't worry."

35:47.900 --> 35:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then the man said:
"Get out of this country.

35:49.833 --> 35:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not your country.

35:51.433 --> 35:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a new president now
and his name is Donald Trump."

35:55.300 --> 36:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this hurts me and breaks my
heart, not for me, but because
of the experience my little

36:02.866 --> 36:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
boy went through.

36:04.633 --> 36:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: Jose and Lola have
lived in the U.S. for 20 years.

36:11.633 --> 36:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the ongoing violence among
cartels, going back to Mexico,
their country of origin, they

36:14.733 --> 36:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, would be very
difficult, if not deadly.

36:17.033 --> 36:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSE FLORES (through
translator): I cannot go
back to a country like this.

36:21.533 --> 36:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN WESTRATE, Republican
Leader: I don't know anyone
who wishes to take Mr. Flores

36:28.600 --> 36:32.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and his wife and deport
them, make their four
children parentless here
in the United States.

36:34.166 --> 36:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: Brian Westrate,
chairman of the Wisconsin 3rd
District Republican Party,

36:37.200 --> 36:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says the current laws for
legalization should be changed.

36:40.433 --> 36:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN WESTRATE: We need to
work together, and by we, the
American people, but through

36:47.300 --> 36:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our representatives, because,
again, they are the only
ones that can write law.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are the only ones
who can change law.

36:51.800 --> 36:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We need to work together
to come up with a
pathway to legalization.

36:55.433 --> 36:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: Others believe
more security is needed.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEANNA ALEXANDER, Milwaukee
County Supervisor: We
would be much better
off if we could welcome

37:02.266 --> 37:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as many immigrants who would
love to come here and to
support that American dream for

37:06.533 --> 37:08.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

37:08.533 --> 37:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: As a former member
of the Army National Guard,
Milwaukee County Supervisor

37:10.966 --> 37:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deanna Alexander has been
on the front lines of
the U.S.-Mexico border.

37:15.333 --> 37:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's her experiences there
that have her calling for
increased law enforcement and

37:19.866 --> 37:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tougher security.

37:22.400 --> 37:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEANNA ALEXANDER: Living
in a world with terrorism
and drug smuggling and
people who would do

37:29.766 --> 37:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans harm on purpose And
by choice or through their
own negligence, we have to be

37:36.733 --> 37:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conscientious of what that
means, and be careful of who
we allow to come in our door.

37:42.933 --> 37:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: Immigration
attorney Cain Oulahan,
who is giving legal advice
to the Flores family,

37:46.933 --> 37:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says a pathway to legalization
for undocumented immigrants
such as the Flores is not easy

37:51.533 --> 37:53.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to obtain.

37:53.533 --> 37:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAIN OULAHAN, Immigration
Attorney: You can only really
get it if you have, For example,

37:55.633 --> 37:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a family member who is a
permanent resident or U.S.
citizen to apply for you.

37:59.366 --> 38:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you don't have that, it
is very difficult and oftentimes
impossible to get legal status

38:05.100 --> 38:07.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under our current laws.

38:07.100 --> 38:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: Under the current
immigration laws, the only
current solution for the Lola

38:10.033 --> 38:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Jose to start a process
for legal status would be
through their children.

38:14.433 --> 38:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for a U.S. citizen child
to petition for a parent, the
child must be at least 21 years

38:19.900 --> 38:21.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of age.

38:21.966 --> 38:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLIE FLORES: Well, it feels
good to know that there's a
point in my life that I can

38:24.833 --> 38:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help them like they
have helped me.

38:28.833 --> 38:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's hard to know that.

38:31.266 --> 38:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm 15 right now, and that's
until you are 21, I believe.

38:34.866 --> 38:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it's a long to be waiting.

38:36.700 --> 38:41.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we are going to try
our best to do that.

38:41.066 --> 38:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: Last summer,
the Flores family tracked down
their governor, Republican Scott

38:45.500 --> 38:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Walker, at a presidential
campaign event in
Iowa to confront him
about Deferred Action

38:50.333 --> 38:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Parents of Americans
and Lawful Permanent
Residents, known as DAPA,
created under President

38:55.966 --> 38:57.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Obama.

38:57.166 --> 38:57.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LESLIE FLORES: Why
are you blocking DAPA?

38:57.966 --> 38:59.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

38:59.333 --> 39:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT WALKER (R),
Wisconsin: I'm the governor.

39:01.033 --> 39:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I don't have anything
to do with it right
now, but thanks, though.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLIE FLORES: I went that
time because I have seen, heard
and read about his politics

39:09.900 --> 39:10.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and his views.

39:10.933 --> 39:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I don't agree with that.

39:12.700 --> 39:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, well, that time,
I went because of my
family and my friends.

39:16.833 --> 39:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I told him, why do you
want to deport my family?

39:21.333 --> 39:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why are you against DAPA?

39:24.166 --> 39:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LESLIE FLORES:
Answer my question.

39:25.833 --> 39:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why are you trying to
break my family apart?

39:26.833 --> 39:28.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

39:28.366 --> 39:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT WALKER: I want to spend 30
seconds answering you question.

39:32.166 --> 39:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
For us, we are a nation of laws.

39:35.533 --> 39:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, unfortunately, the
president last year,
after saying 22 times
before last year that

39:37.533 --> 39:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he couldn't make the law
himself, said he wasn't the
emperor, he's the president of

39:39.633 --> 39:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States, and he said
he couldn't change the law,
he decided to change the law,

39:43.966 --> 39:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even though the courts have
now said he can't do that.

39:47.766 --> 39:52.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
My point is you have
got to follow the law,
follow the process.

39:54.366 --> 39:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I completely sympathize
with the situation you
are all in and others.

PORTIA YOUNG: GOP Party district
Chair Brian Westrate says
the Republicans must find a

40:01.300 --> 40:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way to incorporate immigrants.

40:03.333 --> 40:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIAN WESTRATE: And speaking
for the Republican Party, there
is a great deal of compassion

40:06.000 --> 40:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and acknowledgement that
our society is largely
better off with people
like the Flores family

40:11.766 --> 40:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in it than without it.

40:13.566 --> 40:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the same time, we have to
find a pathway to legalization.

40:18.000 --> 40:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The solution cannot simply
be to just continue to let
them exist in the shadows.

40:22.500 --> 40:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: Milwaukee County
Supervisor Deanna Alexander
says her own parents were

40:27.433 --> 40:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigrants, so she understands
people wanting to come to
the U.S. for a better life.

40:31.900 --> 40:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEANNA ALEXANDER: But I also
understand that we have some
major problems, and it may not

40:36.300 --> 40:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be just at our southern border.

40:38.333 --> 40:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have some major problems with
people who want to break our
laws or do our society great

40:44.966 --> 40:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
harm that will come to
this country with any
opportunity they have.

40:49.833 --> 40:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: The message
Jose Flores would like to get
across: Immigrants are not bad

40:55.433 --> 40:57.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

40:57.500 --> 41:00.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSE FLORES (through
translator): We all
came here to work, and
I have behaved correctly

41:00.833 --> 41:02.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country.

41:02.866 --> 41:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I contribute to this country
and I try to do everything
the right way and stay out of

41:06.933 --> 41:08.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trouble.

41:08.966 --> 41:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just don't have a Social
Security or a working
permit, but that is all.

41:12.666 --> 41:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neither I nor my family are
criminals, and there are many
like me who are not criminals.

41:20.100 --> 41:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PORTIA YOUNG: It's a
message the Flores family
hopes will resonate with
lawmakers and around

41:23.733 --> 41:25.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

41:25.266 --> 41:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For "PBS NewsHour," I'm Portia
Young in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: a new
take on a literary classic.

41:42.833 --> 41:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has the
newest addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

41:45.666 --> 41:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A king
sacrifices his own daughter
to appease the gods.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His wife takes revenge
by killing her husband.

41:52.700 --> 41:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The story of King Agamemnon,
Queen Clytemnestra and
their children, set
against the backdrop

41:59.300 --> 42:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the Trojan War, is
quite literally the
stuff of Greek tragedy.

42:01.966 --> 42:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now comes a new telling in
"House of Names," a novel by
one of today's leading writers,

42:07.733 --> 42:09.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Colm Toibin.

42:09.766 --> 42:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His acclaimed books include
"The Master," "Nora Webster,"
and "Brooklyn," which was

42:13.500 --> 42:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
made into a film in 2015.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

42:17.333 --> 42:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COLM TOIBIN, Author, "House
of Names": Thank you.

42:18.766 --> 42:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what is
this, a retelling, a rethinking?

42:19.633 --> 42:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you doing here?

42:20.900 --> 42:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COLM TOIBIN: Yes, it's a
retelling of the story.

42:22.933 --> 42:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is the great
story of war within a
family, of a family at war.

42:28.666 --> 42:30.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's an intimate war.

42:30.666 --> 42:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, as, for example, the war
in Syria is going on, if you
want some version of that as to

42:36.333 --> 42:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a sort of myth, a sense of
how -- what it looks like when
this happens intimately, rather

42:42.966 --> 42:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than, say, one country at war
with another, then I thought,
this is the great story, this

42:47.766 --> 42:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is the myth of origin
of all civil wars.

42:49.866 --> 42:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But it is, as
you say, at heart, a family
drama, a family tragedy.

42:56.466 --> 43:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does it feel -- I have read
others of your books that are
set in an Ireland that you

43:02.800 --> 43:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know or that you might have
lived -- that you have lived in.

43:04.566 --> 43:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Did it feel like these
characters were as alive
as you as those, others?

43:10.366 --> 43:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLM TOIBIN: Yes.

43:12.466 --> 43:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once you start working with
a family, you're working with
two sorts of feeling, which is

43:15.600 --> 43:17.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
elemental love.

43:17.333 --> 43:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But if that goes wrong,
you get rage and hatred
on a new sort of level.

43:24.066 --> 43:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I suppose I was
attempting to use a
contemporary novelist system.

43:27.233 --> 43:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it is set in ancient
Greece, but, psychologically,
trying to establish, why

43:31.833 --> 43:33.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
would a woman
murder her husband?

43:33.866 --> 43:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's not a psychopath.

43:35.300 --> 43:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she's got very good
reasons to murder her husband.

43:36.900 --> 43:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

43:38.333 --> 43:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COLM TOIBIN: I mean, he's
behaved atrociously toward her.

43:40.366 --> 43:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But much harder for one
to imagine how would a
son murder his own mother.

43:47.100 --> 43:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I was -- yes, I became
absolutely involved, as though I
knew them, as though I could see

43:53.533 --> 43:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything they did, working
in detail all the time with
each of them and their motives

44:00.000 --> 44:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and their shifting motives
and the rage they felt.

44:01.566 --> 44:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they were also eating
together in the evening.

44:03.800 --> 44:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, when Orestes comes
home, his mother, like any
mother, says, oh, my God, I hope

44:07.500 --> 44:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your bedroom is OK for you.

44:09.133 --> 44:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, the little
details of everyday life.

44:11.266 --> 44:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLM TOIBIN: Yes.

44:13.300 --> 44:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And his sisters hugging him,
but actually what they all
have in mind is, where are the

44:16.733 --> 44:17.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weapons?

44:17.833 --> 44:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are they
eventually going to do?

44:19.900 --> 44:24.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You told
this in alternating
voices, but especially
the voice, the woman's

44:26.333 --> 44:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voice, Clytemnestra, in a
first person, right, I, I, I?

44:31.166 --> 44:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLM TOIBIN: Yes.

44:33.200 --> 44:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a late play by Euripides
called "Iphigenia in Aulis,"
which tells the story from her

44:38.033 --> 44:39.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
point of view.

44:39.300 --> 44:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was lured to the camp.

44:42.200 --> 44:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her husband said there
was going to be a wedding.

44:44.200 --> 44:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, in fact, they were going
to sacrifice her daughter.

44:47.500 --> 44:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that I wanted to open it
with her, with her voice saying,
I have been acquainted with

44:53.233 --> 44:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the smell of death.

44:54.200 --> 44:55.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:55.633 --> 44:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's
literally the opening line.

44:56.800 --> 44:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COLM TOIBIN: Yes,
that's the opening line.

44:58.866 --> 45:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's meant to be -- it's
meant to describe how she took a
lover, so she could get someone

45:00.433 --> 45:02.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to help her.

45:02.400 --> 45:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she planned everything down
-- so this is a novel, also,
besides about family, it's

45:05.966 --> 45:08.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about power.

45:08.466 --> 45:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so anyone who is
ever seeking power should
read this book, because
it gives you a look

45:13.400 --> 45:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into how much planning you have
to do for that single moment.

45:15.366 --> 45:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you get one thing wrong,
everything goes wrong.

45:18.566 --> 45:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so she plans to kill
her husband when he returns
victorious from the Trojan War.

45:22.900 --> 45:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From the
beginning in ancient times to
now, these stories are about the

45:27.900 --> 45:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cycle of violence, right?

45:30.033 --> 45:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know that in the plays
and in Greek times, they're
looking back at, how did it

45:34.566 --> 45:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all begin, right?

45:35.900 --> 45:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What led to one
death after another?

45:37.900 --> 45:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it also raises the question
of how does it ever end, right?

45:40.833 --> 45:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLM TOIBIN: Yes.

45:43.233 --> 45:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That with any civil
war -- for example, the
troubles in Northern
Ireland or what's happening

45:45.966 --> 45:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Syria -- it begins
with one killing.

45:49.200 --> 45:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it's impossible to put
the genie back in the bottle.

45:51.800 --> 45:54.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's retaliation
after retaliation.

45:54.033 --> 45:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the violence within a
civil war or violence with a
gang feud is always a spiral.

46:01.866 --> 46:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's one and then it's five.

46:03.866 --> 46:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it's something
atrocious occurs further.

46:07.266 --> 46:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So to that extent, we're still
living in that idea of violence
not as a single act, but

46:12.166 --> 46:14.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as a cycle.

46:14.266 --> 46:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You also have
in this, as in others of your
works, questions of morality,

46:18.900 --> 46:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
questions of religion.

46:20.733 --> 46:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have Queen Clytemnestra
saying that the gods
have gone, right?

46:24.033 --> 46:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we're living in a new age.

46:26.033 --> 46:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COLM TOIBIN: It's very
hard to put the gods into
a contemporary novel.

46:28.666 --> 46:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I had early on in the book
I had Clytemnestra as different
from the others, because she

46:32.700 --> 46:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doesn't pray to the gods
or appeal to the gods.

46:35.766 --> 46:37.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She has will.

46:37.033 --> 46:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She makes the decisions.

46:39.033 --> 46:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what I wanted to do was move
it away from the godly into
the idea of it's people who

46:44.000 --> 46:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cause this, not the gods.

46:46.033 --> 46:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These killings are done by
people who decide to do them as
people, rather than having this

46:51.566 --> 46:53.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
almighty power.

46:53.633 --> 46:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just ask you one
general question about writing,
because I saw where you said

46:55.800 --> 47:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
once that a novel really begins
for you in a sentence, that
a sentence somehow -- and

47:02.366 --> 47:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this is the quote I
saw -- contains the
full weight of a novel.

47:05.233 --> 47:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's an interesting idea.

47:06.233 --> 47:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLM TOIBIN: Yes.

47:07.500 --> 47:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have something on
one side of your head.

47:10.100 --> 47:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't know if --
I'm not a brain surgeon,
but one side of your head
might store information

47:14.633 --> 47:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or an idea or a
memory or something.

47:17.266 --> 47:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that moves of its
own accord into rhythm.

47:20.733 --> 47:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you get a line, that
line, I have been acquainted
with the smell of death.

47:25.400 --> 47:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And once you get that,
you can then work.

47:29.600 --> 47:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Until you get it, you can't.

47:31.500 --> 47:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so you wait for it.

47:33.000 --> 47:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But once it's there, there's no
point in waiting for it again.

47:35.033 --> 47:36.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You must work.

47:36.033 --> 47:37.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:37.500 --> 47:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then the work comes of
actually writing the book.

47:39.433 --> 47:40.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

47:40.433 --> 47:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLM TOIBIN: Yes.

47:41.433 --> 47:42.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

47:42.966 --> 47:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
new novel is "House of Names."

47:44.166 --> 47:44.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Colm Toibin, thank
you very much.

47:44.833 --> 47:45.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks, Jeff.

47:45.633 --> 47:49.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

47:49.700 --> 47:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
now a story about the
founding of our nation.

47:59.266 --> 48:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A distant ancestor of Rohulamin
Quander was enslaved at George
Washington's Mount Vernon

48:05.166 --> 48:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
estate in Virginia.

48:07.233 --> 48:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quander is now a tour guide
there, where he offers a unique
perspective on the contributions

48:13.133 --> 48:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of African-Americans to
our country's history.

48:15.266 --> 48:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This story was filmed, edited
and produced by middle and
high school students who are

48:21.600 --> 48:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of the "NewsHour"'s
Student Reporting Labs program.

48:23.666 --> 48:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROHULAMIN QUANDER, Family
Historian: The past always
has an impact on the future.

48:29.966 --> 48:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Those who do not know
their past are kind of
destined to repeat it.

48:33.900 --> 48:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have that program every year.

48:35.633 --> 48:37.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have been coming
here all my life.

48:37.833 --> 48:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I remember when I was
like about 12 years old.

48:40.433 --> 48:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I didn't fully understand
or appreciate the family's
longstanding connection.

48:45.300 --> 48:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to go up to the
exhibit, Lives Bound Together:
Slavery at George Washington's

48:48.700 --> 48:50.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mount Vernon.

48:50.733 --> 48:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am a licensed tour guide
in the District of Columbia,
and I come and I bring groups

48:54.266 --> 48:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all over the metropolitan
Washington, D.C.,
including to George
Washington's Mount Vernon,

49:01.166 --> 49:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which the Quander family
has a longstanding
historical connection with.

49:04.633 --> 49:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN SCHOELWER, Co-Curator,
Mount Vernon: Nancy Carter
was a young girl, really, who

49:11.700 --> 49:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was 11 years old in 1799
when George Washington
made provisions in his
will to free his slaves.

49:17.300 --> 49:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her mother, Suckey Bay was her
name, was an enslaved woman who
lived on one of Washington's

49:23.166 --> 49:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
five farms and was a field hand.

49:25.700 --> 49:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So when Washington
freed his slaves, then
Nancy Carter was free.

49:30.700 --> 49:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She later married Charles
Quander, who was a member
of the Quander family.

49:38.166 --> 49:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there are many
descendants that come
down from that and are
part of the large Quander

49:43.866 --> 49:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family, which, as you
know, is one of the
oldest, if not the oldest,
documented African-American

49:47.866 --> 49:49.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
family in the country.

49:49.833 --> 49:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROHULAMIN QUANDER: The
family history goes back
into Maryland in the 1600s.

49:55.700 --> 49:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We hear about the Hamiltons and
the Madisons and the Jeffersons.

50:01.233 --> 50:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, do we hear about the
enslaved people who made sure
the crops were in, who made

50:06.233 --> 50:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
sure the fishing was
proper, who made sure
the distillery was run?

50:08.666 --> 50:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were the ones who were
the backbone, so that George
Washington could go off and

50:14.533 --> 50:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
become the father of our nation.

50:16.666 --> 50:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN SCHOELWER: You
really can't understand
George Washington's life
without understanding

50:21.566 --> 50:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the lives of the people whose
lives were intertwined with his,
whose work supported his estate.

50:29.033 --> 50:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROHULAMIN QUANDER: I
try to instill into
everyone the importance of
understanding where we as

50:34.066 --> 50:36.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Americans came from.

50:36.133 --> 50:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I often say this is not a
black history tour; this is
an American history tour.

50:42.433 --> 50:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I think, for me, it's
really -- it gives me a sense
of history to share with

50:44.600 --> 50:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my kids, and it's also really
neat to be able to participate
in this tour with Mr. Quander,

50:49.066 --> 50:53.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as he has relatives and
his ancestry line is
here at Mount Vernon.

50:53.666 --> 50:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN SCHOELWER: It's also, I
think, important to honor the
lives and the contributions of

51:00.733 --> 51:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the people who were enslaved
here and elsewhere whose stories
have not been told, have perhaps

51:05.033 --> 51:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not been remembered, have
not been appreciated.

51:07.766 --> 51:12.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ROHULAMIN QUANDER: We
are a bridge from the
past to the present.

51:14.700 --> 51:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have a responsibility
of upholding the Quander
name and lifting others as we

51:19.466 --> 51:21.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
climb.

51:21.533 --> 51:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's important for
people to understand that
we have earned our rights.

51:24.300 --> 51:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have built, literally
physically built Mount Vernon,
built the United States Capitol,

51:30.733 --> 51:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
built the White House, along
with other people, of course.

51:32.766 --> 51:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we need people in the
African-American diaspora to
understand that we have always

51:37.666 --> 51:42.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been a part of what
constitutes America.

51:44.733 --> 51:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later tonight
on PBS, "POV" presents a film
about young Syrians who joined

51:57.866 --> 52:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the anti-government resistance.

52:00.100 --> 52:04.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"The War Show" follows
a tight-knit group of
Syrian idealists as
they protest against

52:06.566 --> 52:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the regime of Bashar al-Assad
and depicts the country's
descent into civil war.

52:11.766 --> 52:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"The War Show" airs tonight
on most PBS stations.

52:15.233 --> 52:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" all of next
week, an in-depth look inside
Vladimir Putin's Russia.

52:21.633 --> 52:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: In Russia today,
resurgent nationalism.

52:24.800 --> 52:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: It's not artificial.

52:28.333 --> 52:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Built by
and around one man.

52:32.066 --> 52:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Russians told pollsters
that suddenly they felt
like a superpower again.

52:36.366 --> 52:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: But for
Putin's opponents.

52:38.333 --> 52:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: People who have tried
to leave the Putin family
voluntarily have not fared very

52:42.600 --> 52:44.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

52:44.666 --> 52:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: A rare look inside
Putin's Russia all next
week on the "PBS NewsHour."

52:51.100 --> 52:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
the "NewsHour" for tonight.

52:54.900 --> 52:59.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On Tuesday, just in time
for tomorrow's Fourth
of July celebrations,
our ScienceScope team

53:01.866 --> 53:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reveals a breakthrough in beer
making, a secret ingredient
that is all the buzz.

53:06.800 --> 53:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:08.266 --> 53:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again
right here tomorrow evening.

53:10.333 --> 53:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
