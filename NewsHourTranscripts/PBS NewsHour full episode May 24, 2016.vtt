JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:08.108 --> 00:12.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
The chief of security for the
TSA is fired

00:12.379 --> 00:19.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amid outrage over record-long
lines at airports
and generous bonus checks. But
will the shakeup

00:19.419 --> 00:21.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
solve the problem?

00:21.255 --> 00:24.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Tuesday:
As campaigns pivot to the
general election,

00:24.691 --> 00:28.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's all about the dollar signs
-- how candidates
are getting the financial
support they need

00:28.862 --> 00:30.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the next phase.

00:30.631 --> 00:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And months after
a standoff
at an Oregon wildlife refuge
became national

00:36.203 --> 00:42.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news, opposing sides of the
federal land dispute
are coming together to try a
different approach.

00:42.609 --> 00:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN NICHOLS, Rancher: We can sit
down and
talk. You still don't agree on
everything.

00:47.848 --> 00:52.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a given. That's people.
But you respect
one another to listen.

00:52.352 --> 00:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.355 --> 00:59.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.626 --> 01:11.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Democratic
presidential
hopefuls worked California
today, heading

01:12.005 --> 01:18.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toward their final primary
showdown on June
7. Bernie Sanders is aiming for
an upset,

01:18.378 --> 01:23.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and he says he will keep
pressing his case
even if it means what he calls a
messy process

01:24.017 --> 01:25.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leading up to the convention.

01:25.919 --> 01:31.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Anaheim today, Sanders touted
his support
among the nation's youth and
said it's a message

01:31.625 --> 01:33.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to party leaders.

01:33.560 --> 01:38.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
We are winning the overwhelming
majority of

01:38.198 --> 01:44.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young people. What should that
tell us? What
does it tell us? It tells us --
it tells us

01:44.504 --> 01:50.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it should tell the country
and certainly
the leadership of the Democratic
Party that

01:50.944 --> 01:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our ideas, our vision is the
future of America.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:57.718 --> 02:02.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Sanders camp
also asked
today for a re-canvass of last
week's Kentucky

02:02.723 --> 02:08.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary results. Hillary Clinton
finished
just over 1,900 votes ahead in
Kentucky.

02:08.996 --> 02:14.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She, too, campaigned in
California today,
in the Los Angeles area, and
again trained

02:14.835 --> 02:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her fire on Republican Donald
Trump.

02:16.937 --> 02:20.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Now he says he wants to roll
back the financial

02:20.874 --> 02:30.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulations that we have imposed
on Wall Street
to let them run wild again.
Well, I will tell

02:30.350 --> 02:33.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you what. You and I together,
we're not going
to let him bankrupt America.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:35.756 --> 02:40.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This was primary
voting day
for the Republicans in
Washington state. But

02:40.293 --> 02:45.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, the de facto nominee,
turned his attention
to holding fund-raisers,
starting in New Mexico.

02:45.632 --> 02:48.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will explore his campaign
funding later
in this program.

02:48.869 --> 02:52.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news,
President Obama made a show of
support for

02:52.372 --> 02:58.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dissidents in Vietnam after
formally ending
a U.S. arms embargo. It came on
his second

02:58.311 --> 03:00.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
day in Hanoi.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
There are still areas of
significant concern

03:02.849 --> 03:04.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in terms of freedom of speech.

03:04.651 --> 03:08.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was a
telling moment,
the president meeting with human
rights activists

03:08.321 --> 03:11.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and criticizing repression, but
with some
chairs unfilled.

03:11.391 --> 03:18.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: I should note that
there were
several other activists who were
invited who

03:18.565 --> 03:24.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were prevented from coming for
various reasons.
And I think it's an indication
of the fact

03:24.104 --> 03:29.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, although there has been
some modest
progress, there are still folks
who find it

03:29.976 --> 03:34.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very difficult to assemble and
organize peacefully.

03:34.714 --> 03:40.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In a later
speech, Mr. Obama
argued greater freedom would
benefit the communist

03:40.253 --> 03:45.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state. He balanced that with
another show
of solidarity with Vietnam
against China's

03:45.158 --> 03:47.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aggressive moves in the South
China Sea.

03:47.694 --> 03:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Nations are
sovereign, and no
matter how large or small a
nation may be,

03:52.766 --> 03:58.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its sovereignty should be
respected, and its
territory shouldn't be violated.
Big nations

03:58.638 --> 04:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shouldn't bully smaller ones.

04:00.540 --> 04:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Beijing had
issued a relatively
mild statement on Monday. But,
today, its

04:04.945 --> 04:09.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Foreign Ministry essentially
warned Washington
to back off in diplomatic
language.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUA CHUNYING, Spokeswoman,
Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (through
translator): We

04:11.718 --> 04:16.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe the countries outside
the region should
respect the efforts by regional
countries

04:16.523 --> 04:21.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in safeguarding peace and
stability. They
shouldn't threaten other
countries' sovereignty.

04:21.461 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: From Hanoi,
the president
flew to Ho Chi Minh City, the
former Saigon,

04:26.266 --> 04:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where thousands welcomed him and
his push
for greater economic ties and
trade. The president

04:32.339 --> 04:35.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spends a final day in Vietnam
tomorrow, then
heads to Japan.

04:35.375 --> 04:40.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mystery swirled
again today
around the fate of an EgyptAir
plane that

04:40.113 --> 04:46.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crashed last week, killing all
66 people on
board. An Egyptian forensics
expert said the

04:46.553 --> 04:53.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
small size of human remains
found so far points
to an explosion. But the head of
Egypt's forensic

04:53.326 --> 04:58.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agency called that report
baseless. The aircraft's
black boxes have yet to be
found.

04:58.665 --> 05:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kurdish-led
forces in Syria
have launched a new offensive
near the Islamic

05:03.103 --> 05:07.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State group's de facto capital.
Fighting was
reported in villages near the
city of Raqqa.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It could be a prelude to an
assault on the
city itself.

05:10.343 --> 05:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Greece,
officials began
moving migrants today from a
makeshift refugee

05:15.348 --> 05:21.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camp near the northern border
with Macedonia.
Police managed to get about
1,500 people to

05:21.354 --> 05:27.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leave the squalid Idomeni site
and move to
other, better organized
facilities. They piled

05:27.594 --> 05:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into buses, and bulldozers
removed what was
left of their tent shelters.

05:32.365 --> 05:37.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separately, the International
Organization
for Migration reported fewer
migrants are

05:37.270 --> 05:42.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dying as they try to reach
Europe. That's
largely because Turkey has
curbed the overall

05:42.976 --> 05:44.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
flow.

05:44.878 --> 05:48.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And back in this country, the
Justice Department
announced late today that it is
seeking the

05:48.615 --> 05:54.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
death penalty for the killings
at a church
in Charleston, South Carolina.
Dylann Roof

05:54.321 --> 06:02.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is accused of gunning down nine
black parishioners
last June. He faces 33 federal
charges, including

06:02.262 --> 06:04.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hate crimes and firearms
offenses.

06:04.798 --> 06:09.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Comedian Bill
Cosby will
stand trial for allegedly
drugging and sexually

06:09.202 --> 06:14.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assaulting a woman in 2004. A
judge in Norristown,
Pennsylvania, issued that ruling
today. Cosby

06:14.507 --> 06:18.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
left the hearing without
commenting, but the
prosecutor said statements to
police back

06:18.245 --> 06:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in 2005 established probable
cause.

06:21.081 --> 06:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN R. STEELE, Montgomery
County, Pennsylvania,
District Attorney: A preliminary
hearing is

06:25.185 --> 06:29.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a situation where we only have
to show that
a crime is committed and the
defendant is

06:29.222 --> 06:35.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
connected to the crime. We did
that through
the victim's statement and the
defendant's

06:35.795 --> 06:39.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
admissions to much of the crime.

06:39.099 --> 06:44.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A defense
lawyer said Cosby's
rights have been violated, and
he will appeal

06:44.504 --> 06:48.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ruling. More than 50 women
have claimed
he assaulted them over the
years, but this

06:48.775 --> 06:50.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the only criminal case so
far.

06:51.011 --> 06:56.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's word that
Kenneth Starr
is out as president of Baylor
University in

06:56.716 --> 07:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas. He was the independent
counsel who
investigated President Clinton
back in the

07:02.355 --> 07:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1990s. Several broadcast and
online outlets
reported today that Starr has
been fired over

07:07.994 --> 07:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his handling of allegations of
rape leveled
against male athletes at the
school. Baylor

07:13.733 --> 07:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
labeled the report rumors.

07:15.502 --> 07:20.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the first
time, more
than 40 major health groups are
recommending

07:20.340 --> 07:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weight loss surgery as a routine
option for
treating diabetes. The new
guidelines include

07:25.145 --> 07:30.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
patients who are only mildly
obese. Some 26
million Americans have diabetes.

07:30.517 --> 07:35.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The smoking rate
among American
adults has fallen by the most in
more than

07:35.422 --> 07:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 years. The Centers for
Disease Control
and Prevention says 15 percent
of adults classified

07:41.127 --> 07:47.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves as smokers in 2015.
That is down
from 17 percent the year before.
It's not

07:47.567 --> 07:50.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
clear if the rise of
e-cigarettes played any
role.

07:50.637 --> 07:55.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Monsanto today
rejected
a takeover bid by German
chemical giant Bayer.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was valued at $62 billion.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street had its biggest
day since
March. The Dow Jones industrial
average gained

08:01.848 --> 08:08.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
213 points to close at 17706.
The Nasdaq rose
95 points and the S&amp;P 500 added
28.

08:08.988 --> 08:14.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
a shakeup at the TSA, will it
help cut down

08:14.394 --> 08:20.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long airport lines?; Congress at
odds over
Zika-prevention funding with
mosquito season

08:20.867 --> 08:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fast approaching; a tax on sugar
drinks to
pay for preschool; and much
more.

08:29.642 --> 08:39.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If you have
traveled on
a plane recently, you have
likely seen something

08:39.586 --> 08:45.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different at the airport,
extremely long lines.
It's a problem roiling the
government, airlines

08:45.291 --> 08:46.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and the public.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: One on the right, one on
the left,
please.

08:49.462 --> 08:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At airports
across the country,
frustration is boiling over as
security wait

08:54.234 --> 08:55.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
times soar.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

because of,
you know, standing in line.

goes on here,
and every checkpoint is like
this.

09:02.075 --> 09:06.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now the
Transportation Security
Administration has sacked Kelly
Hoggan, the

09:06.746 --> 09:12.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man in charge of day-to-day
security operations.
He's had a checkered three-year
tenure. In

09:12.318 --> 09:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2015, a Homeland Security report
found TSA
employees failed to find banned
items in more

09:18.124 --> 09:21.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than 95 percent of covert tests.

09:21.461 --> 09:26.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there've been allegations
that Hoggan
played a role in punishing
whistle-blowers.

09:26.232 --> 09:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there's $90,000 in bonuses
he received
between 2013 and 2014. That
issue riled the

09:32.705 --> 09:37.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chair of the House Oversight
Committee at
a recent hearing with TSA head
Peter Neffenger.

09:37.410 --> 09:41.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), Utah:
Those bonuses
were given to somebody who
oversees a part

09:41.681 --> 09:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the operation that was in
total failure.

09:44.017 --> 09:48.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Dissatisfaction with Hoggan
came to a head last week, when
hundreds of

09:48.555 --> 09:52.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
passengers missed flights at
Chicago's O'Hare
Airport after waiting for hours.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAHM EMANUEL (D), Mayor of
Chicago: We have
a situation that is totally not
tolerable

09:56.729 --> 10:01.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the flying public because
the people responsible
were not doing the jobs that
they needed to

10:01.568 --> 10:04.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do in funding, but also staffing
positions.

10:04.304 --> 10:09.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The TSA's
Neffenger says
his agency has struggled with
budget cuts

10:09.909 --> 10:15.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a time when more people are
flying. Another
concern? Relatively few people
signed up for

10:15.515 --> 10:21.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TSA's expedited pre-check
procedure. Congress
has voted an additional $34
million to hire

10:21.955 --> 10:26.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nearly 800 more screeners, but
Neffenger says
that's not enough.

10:26.159 --> 10:32.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the union for TSA one
called for an
additional 6,000 personnel.
Meanwhile, with

10:32.632 --> 10:37.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
summer about to begin, the
number of airline
passengers is expected to reach
all-time highs.

10:37.904 --> 10:42.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We break down the problem now
with Bart Jansen,
transportation reporter for USA
Today.

10:42.175 --> 10:46.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I flew out of O'Hare last week,
not once,
but twice. What was going on?
And these were

10:46.513 --> 10:48.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lines that I have never seen
anything this
long.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BART JANSEN, USA Today: They
were having among
the worst experience in the
whole country

10:51.751 --> 10:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last week. They had waits that
stretched to
two, three hours.

10:56.155 --> 11:01.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is why they started to
throw these
extra staffers and canine teams
at that problem.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so,
what is at
the core of the staffing issue?
What happened

11:04.964 --> 11:06.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and what is going to fix it?

11:06.266 --> 11:09.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BART JANSEN: Well, there is a
confluence of
three elements.

11:09.068 --> 11:14.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is that overall staffing for
screeners
is down something like 5,800
screeners since

11:14.774 --> 11:22.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a peak in 2011. So, they have
about 42,500,
but it's much fewer than they
used to. That

11:22.115 --> 11:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I.G. report that found that they
weren't catching
much last summer has prompted
them to check

11:27.253 --> 11:31.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bags more thoroughly, so they're
taking a
closer look at you as you go
through the lines.

11:31.824 --> 11:36.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to redo that
undercover investigation
this summer to see if they're
catching more.

11:36.696 --> 11:42.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neffenger says they are catching
more. And
we are also seeing more
travelers than ever

11:42.936 --> 11:48.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before. The Airlines for America
expects 231
million travelers this summer
between June

11:48.508 --> 11:50.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
1 and August 31.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But what's the
ripple effect
on the traveler? When we saw and
heard those

11:53.246 --> 11:56.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people say how many flights that
they have
missed, cumulatively, this has
got to be a

11:57.016 --> 11:59.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of business concerns for the
airlines,
too.

11:59.619 --> 12:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BART JANSEN: Yes, the concerns
-- it's a headache
for the airlines, because
anybody who misses

12:03.489 --> 12:09.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a flight, trying to rebook them,
the flights
are going almost 90 percent
full. It's difficult.

12:09.362 --> 12:14.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American Airlines said that
during a single
week in mid-March, they had
6,800 travelers

12:14.767 --> 12:19.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
miss their flights because of
the security
screening. So, that's why
Airlines for Americas

12:19.739 --> 12:24.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organized a hashtag and Web site
called I
Hate the Wait for people to
register just

12:25.011 --> 12:28.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try to get more public
acknowledgment of
the problem.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes, speaking
of registering,
we were talking off camera about
Global Entry.

12:30.416 --> 12:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I signed up a few years ago. I
was going through
the TSA pre-check lines. How
many other people

12:34.587 --> 12:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are joining me in this, and how
does that
factor into it?

12:37.323 --> 12:42.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BART JANSEN: Overall, there are
somewhere
a little above 10 million people
in expedited

12:42.095 --> 12:45.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
screening programs so far.

12:45.064 --> 12:50.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About 2.5 million of them are
specifically
pre-check, which is the TSA
program. If you're

12:50.269 --> 12:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Global Entry through Customs
and Border
Protection, that gives you the
added value

12:54.540 --> 12:58.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of, when you're coming back from
overseas,
you get to go through the
customs lines faster,

12:58.344 --> 13:00.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skip the long lines from the
airlines.

13:00.179 --> 13:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they're trying to recruit
more people
into these programs, but so far
they're falling

13:04.751 --> 13:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well below. At 10 million total
members, they're
falling far below their goal of
25 million

13:10.023 --> 13:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in these expedited programs.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And have these
pain points
at the airports increased the
amount of applications?

13:14.861 --> 13:16.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BART JANSEN: Yes.

13:16.629 --> 13:21.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were getting 2,000 to 3,000
applicants
a day at this time last year.
Now they are

13:21.768 --> 13:28.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up to above 10,000 a day last
week. Neffenger
told us this morning that they
got 15,000

13:28.074 --> 13:29.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people in one day.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, you met
with Neffenger
this morning before the news
about Hoggan

13:32.078 --> 13:33.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came out. What was the mood
there?

13:33.880 --> 13:38.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BART JANSEN: Well, yes, we set
up a -- we
had an editorial board arranged
with him before

13:38.384 --> 13:40.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this news broke.

13:40.119 --> 13:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was very forthright, saying
that -- he
didn't say that Hoggan had done
something

13:44.490 --> 13:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrong. He just said he wanted a
change of
strategy. He wants to try to
make the lines

13:48.361 --> 13:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more efficient, rather than just
going faster
for people. They don't want to
sacrifice security

13:53.933 --> 13:55.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for moving the lines.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nevertheless, they think they
can move the
lines more efficiently and get
people through

13:58.971 --> 14:00.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
faster.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Almost every
travel agent
I speak with says it's going to
get worse

14:02.608 --> 14:04.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through the summer.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BART JANSEN: Yes, the secretary
of homeland
security, Jeh Johnson, has
warned that, even

14:07.647 --> 14:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they add the screeners that
was mentioned
in your report, that lines are
still expected

14:14.220 --> 14:15.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be long. You should plan
ahead.

14:16.022 --> 14:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they are going to try to
avoid the two-
and three-hour waits that you
have seen in

14:19.358 --> 14:20.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the last few weeks.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Bart Jansen of
USA Today, thanks so much.

14:23.096 --> 14:30.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BART JANSEN: Thanks for having
me.

14:30.837 --> 14:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to Capitol
Hill and Washington's
efforts to combat the Zika
virus.

14:38.010 --> 14:44.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in February, the White
House put together
a $1.9 billion proposal aimed at
mosquito

14:44.083 --> 14:51.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control, education about Zika,
plus boosting
research into the virus and a
possible vaccine.

14:51.591 --> 14:57.063 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
Last week, the
Republican-controlled Senate
moved a compromise measure for
less than two-thirds

14:57.096 --> 15:01.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that amount over the next year,
$1.1 billion.

15:01.567 --> 15:09.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the also-GOP-controlled
House signed off
on a bill for $622 million over
six months.

15:09.542 --> 15:14.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now from opposite
sides of this
funding divide are
Representative Rosa DeLauro,

15:14.747 --> 15:21.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Democrat from Connecticut, and
Representative
Bob Gibbs, Republican from Ohio.

15:21.387 --> 15:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman Gibbs, let me begin
with you.

15:25.825 --> 15:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration, as we said,
asking for
$1.9 billion. The amount you
favor is about

15:31.564 --> 15:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a third that much. Why not give
the administration
what it's asking for?

15:36.202 --> 15:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. BOB GIBBS (R), Ohio: Well,
what the administration
did, that's just ongoing through
the next

15:39.472 --> 15:41.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- at least the next two
mosquito seasons.

15:41.474 --> 15:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our bill, at $600 million-plus,
goes to the
end of this fiscal year,
September 30, and

15:46.879 --> 15:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now we're in the appropriation
process, and
we will look at that, what we
need to do past

15:52.718 --> 15:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
September 30 of this year going
into the next
fiscal year and the next
mosquito season next

15:57.023 --> 15:58.758 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summer.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we will be appropriating
more money, I'm
sure, but it's going to go
through regular

16:00.660 --> 16:05.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
order and the regular
appropriation process.
So, we're on board to make sure
to appropriate

16:05.531 --> 16:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the money as needed to get
through to the
end of this fiscal year.

16:08.167 --> 16:12.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Congresswoman
DeLauro,
it sounds like this is a down
payment on this

16:12.405 --> 16:14.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem. Is that going to be
enough?

16:14.473 --> 16:20.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. ROSA DELAURO (D),
Connecticut: Listen,
no, the fact is, is the Zika
virus is a public

16:20.446 --> 16:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health emergency. It is a
crisis.

16:23.916 --> 16:30.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is going to -- the mosquitoes
that carry
the virus will hit the mainland
United States

16:30.723 --> 16:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within the next few weeks. We
are putting
American women at risk, pregnant
women who

16:36.796 --> 16:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are fearful that their babies
will be born
with birth defects.

16:42.168 --> 16:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have a medical community
that is telling
women that maybe they shouldn't
get pregnant.

16:48.307 --> 16:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is not message to the
American people.
The fact of the matter is, is
that the $622

16:54.247 --> 16:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million is a third of what's
been asked for.

16:57.917 --> 17:04.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, in this body, when we
deal with
appropriations for defense or
going to war,

17:04.657 --> 17:09.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my Republican colleagues will
say, let us
get the word from the generals,
from those

17:09.729 --> 17:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are in the field, the
experts. They can
tell us how much money they
need. And they

17:15.735 --> 17:17.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can tell us how many troops we
need.

17:17.503 --> 17:18.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we do have experts in this
war on the
mosquitoes. We have the Centers
for Disease

17:18.671 --> 17:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Control. We have the National
Institutes of
Health.

17:20.506 --> 17:23.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

17:23.109 --> 17:31.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. ROSA DELAURO: We have the
scientific
community, all of whom said, we
need $1.9

17:31.617 --> 17:36.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
billion. And they have
documented every cent
of that as to where it is going.
We need to

17:36.956 --> 17:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
listen to these generals in the
field on this
war on the mosquitoes and keep
the American

17:42.461 --> 17:44.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public safe and American women
safe.

17:44.797 --> 17:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Gibbs, it's not
just Democrats who are saying
that this is

17:49.802 --> 17:55.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not enough money. One of your
fellow Republicans
in the Senate, Marco Rubio of
Florida, said

17:55.441 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today that this is not enough
money, the $622
million.

17:59.879 --> 18:06.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He went on to say that he fears
that the opportunity
to get ahead of this crisis is
slipping away.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you say to him?

18:07.987 --> 18:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. BOB GIBBS: Well, I think
we're going
through the appropriation
process, and if

18:09.889 --> 18:13.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not enough money, we will
make -- we
will do the appropriation bills
here in the

18:13.092 --> 18:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next few weeks, and we will
appropriate more
money when we go through and do
our due diligence.

18:17.897 --> 18:23.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But another issue that I need on
talk about
is my bill, 897, deals with how
we control

18:23.269 --> 18:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mosquitoes or kill the larvae in
mosquitoes
here before they hatch. And
that's a bill

18:28.107 --> 18:32.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had on the floor today, passed
with strong
bipartisan support. And it gives
our states

18:32.878 --> 18:38.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and our local communities the
resources, the
ability not to have that
additional red tape

18:38.084 --> 18:43.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and bureaucracy and don't waste
resources
to do their control efforts, to
start doing

18:43.956 --> 18:47.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the preventative programs at
onset, at the
beginning of the mosquito
season.

18:47.193 --> 18:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's really important. And
a lot of
people on the other side of the
aisle are

18:50.396 --> 18:54.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not supportive of this. And it's
really something
that needs to be done, so our
local communities,

18:54.867 --> 18:59.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our mosquito control districts
have every
tool in the toolbox to start the
preventative

18:59.572 --> 19:06.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
programs to stop the mosquitoes
from growing
in population and possibly
reaching epidemic

19:06.912 --> 19:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proportions of the Zika virus or
even the
West Nile virus.

19:10.049 --> 19:14.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
Congresswoman DeLauro,
my understanding is, this would
-- this legislation

19:14.320 --> 19:19.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that the congressman is
referring to would
loosen the restrictions on the
use of pesticides.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that at least a partial step
in the right
direction?

19:22.028 --> 19:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. ROSA DELAURO: Let me make
two -- a quick
point to you.

19:26.132 --> 19:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We running out of time. And it
was Anthony
Fauci at the NIH, at the Center
for Infectious

19:31.804 --> 19:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Diseases, who said that if we
wait for the
appropriations process, we are
not going to

19:36.909 --> 19:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to do what we need to do
to get ahead
of this virus.

19:39.945 --> 19:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the bill that my colleague
has introduced,
let me be clear, with all due
respect to my

19:44.450 --> 19:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleague, it is a phony. It is
a sham. It
is nothing but trying to weaken
the environmental

19:51.290 --> 19:58.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulations. It exempts, a broad
exemption,
of toxic pesticides from the
Clean Water Act.

19:58.631 --> 20:03.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This bill was introduced two or
three years
ago, has nothing to do with
Zika. Our states

20:03.269 --> 20:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and our municipalities today
have the authority
in which to be able to control
the mosquito

20:09.208 --> 20:13.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
population and to -- and to deal
with it.

20:13.345 --> 20:21.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This will only pollute our
rivers and contaminate
our water. This bill that was
passed today

20:21.720 --> 20:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has nothing seriously to do with
controlling
the Zika virus. It's been
rebranded.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Gibbs, what about
that?

20:28.928 --> 20:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. BOB GIBBS: Well, even the
American Mosquito
Control Association has said
that we have

20:33.332 --> 20:39.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had communities that are slow to
get the preventative
mosquito control programs up and
going because

20:39.205 --> 20:42.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this court case that created
this problem
a few years ago.

20:42.374 --> 20:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will just -- and the EPA
has full control
over the current -- under
current law, the

20:48.447 --> 20:53.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FIFRA, to regulate these
pesticides. And if
they -- and if -- these
pesticides have -- restrictions

20:53.319 --> 20:57.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have to be applied by a
certified applicator,
who go through rigorous testing
and certification

20:58.023 --> 21:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the EPA, and the EPA can step
in. They
have to keep all kinds of
records.

21:02.161 --> 21:08.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we saw -- we have testimony
from mosquito
control entities throughout the
country that

21:08.467 --> 21:13.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that they have added the
cost to the
paperwork. And it also opens
them up to litigation,

21:13.239 --> 21:17.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and if they are in violation of
the paperwork
under the Clean Water Act, they
can have fines

21:17.243 --> 21:18.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up to $37,000 a day.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Congress...

21:20.679 --> 21:24.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. ROSA DELAURO: Really,
again, very, very,
very quickly, we are -- what's
happened is

21:24.483 --> 21:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the emergency preparedness
money has
been taken away from localities
because the

21:29.855 --> 21:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CDC has had to shift money,
because this Congress,
this Republican Congress, will
not appropriate

21:35.394 --> 21:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the $1.9 billion, which makes it
slow for
them to deal with surveillance.

21:41.700 --> 21:47.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact is, is that, under
emergency circumstances,
our states and our
municipalities have the

21:47.139 --> 21:53.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
authority to deal with
controlling the mosquito
population. This bill will do
nothing to address

21:53.579 --> 21:54.880 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that issue.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Gibbs, I want to
come back to the...

21:56.916 --> 21:58.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. BOB GIBBS: When it reaches
epidemic proportions,
then they can do emergency
measures, and they

21:58.684 --> 22:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't have to get any permits.
And that's
why they need to start a
preventative program

22:02.821 --> 22:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like they normally would.

22:03.222 --> 22:04.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

22:04.957 --> 22:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Gibbs, I want to
ask you -- what this says,
though, to women

22:07.726 --> 22:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who live in areas that may be
affected by
this mosquito carrying the Zika
virus.

22:13.365 --> 22:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you say to women who are
worried,
who are concerned that the
mosquitoes are

22:18.704 --> 22:20.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coming with the warmer weather?

22:20.306 --> 22:22.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. BOB GIBBS: Well, it's
obvious that we
have got to do everything we
can.

22:22.508 --> 22:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the money that we
voted last week
in the House to put -- start the
process moving

22:28.147 --> 22:31.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward, and I'm sure we will
appropriate
more money as soon as we learn
it's necessary.

22:31.817 --> 22:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't want to create just a
slush fund
out there with no
accountability. So, we're

22:35.554 --> 22:37.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doing our due diligence.

22:37.356 --> 22:42.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's request goes
out, has no time
frame. It just goes on. And so
we have got

22:42.761 --> 22:46.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this set until September 30. And
before September
30, we can appropriate more
money. So, it

22:47.032 --> 22:52.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gets the ball rolling, and my
bill gets the
ball rolling so that our locals
can start

22:52.638 --> 22:54.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their preventative mosquito
control programs.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 15 seconds.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. ROSA DELAURO: What we are
saying to women,
we're saying to women that you
are at risk,

22:58.978 --> 23:03.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without trying to deal with this
with the
immediacy that the scientific
community has

23:03.515 --> 23:08.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
told us about. This is
immediate. It's now
in a few weeks. That means this
summer.

23:08.787 --> 23:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women are going to be afraid to
go out on
their patio. They're going to be
afraid to

23:11.957 --> 23:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to a barbecue. They're going
to be afraid
to take their kids to little
league because

23:15.961 --> 23:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it can put their ability to have
children,
or, if they're carrying
children, they would

23:21.100 --> 23:27.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be in jeopardy. This puts
American women at
risk, and this Congress is doing
nothing but

23:27.473 --> 23:29.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stalling.

23:29.275 --> 23:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This Republican Congress has
said no five
times to $1.9 billion, which is
well-documented.

23:33.679 --> 23:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's better documented than the
war in Iraq
was.

23:37.850 --> 23:40.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are going to
have to leave
it there.

23:40.319 --> 23:44.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Congresswoman DeLauro,
Congressman Gibbs,
we thank you both very much.

23:44.623 --> 23:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REP. ROSA DELAURO: Thank you.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REP. BOB GIBBS: Thank you.

23:50.929 --> 23:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

But first: The city of
Philadelphia is considering
a new, but controversial way of
funding early

24:17.122 --> 24:19.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's my report, part of our

In Philadelphia, buying soda has
bubbled into
a political controversy. To make
pre-kindergarten

24:30.703 --> 24:36.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
available to all 3- and
4-year-olds, Philadelphia's
mayor has proposed a soda tax
that requires

24:36.575 --> 24:42.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beverage distributors to pay 3
cents for every
ounce of sugary drink sold in
the city.

to help lift

is now.

24:47.853 --> 24:52.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The mayor
hopes to raise
$95 million every year with the
new tax. But

24:53.025 --> 24:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unlike campaigns in other
cities, Philadelphia's
soda tax is not being promoted
as a health

24:58.464 --> 25:00.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

JIM KENNEY (D), Mayor of
Philadelphia: The
ancillary benefit to this will
be healthy

25:02.101 --> 25:08.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
choices, but it's not the
purpose. The purpose
of imposing this
3-cents-an-ounce sugar-sweetened

25:08.273 --> 25:14.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beverage tax is to allow people
to get their
kids educated and move them out
of poverty

25:14.213 --> 25:16.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into taxpaying citizens.

25:16.081 --> 25:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mayor Jim
Kenney argues
beverage companies make big
money from sugary

25:20.452 --> 25:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drinks sold in low-income

JIM KENNEY: Unless a child is
reading at grade
level by third grade, the odds
are by seventh

25:29.395 --> 25:32.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and eighth grade, they will be
acting up because
they can't read. Ninth and 10th
grade, they're

25:32.564 --> 25:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dropping out because they're
embarrassed they
can't read.

25:34.733 --> 25:38.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But the
high-calorie tax
has become a highly charged

opposition is
funded by the American Beverage
Association,

25:57.623 --> 25:59.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sugary drinks.

25:59.491 --> 26:01.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANY VINAS, Grocery Store Owner:
They're going
to tax the big company. They're
going to pass

26:01.260 --> 26:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it onto us, and who is going to
be paying?
The consumer. At the very end,
whoever buys

26:05.464 --> 26:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it to consume, that's who is
going to pay.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN EADS, Parent: You like
this juice? All
right, get it.

26:09.935 --> 26:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Kevin Eads and
his family
shop at Vinas' store every day.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN EADS: I drink soda and
juice all day.
I love it.

26:15.841 --> 26:19.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Eads says if
the cost is
passed on to the consumer, he
will have trouble

26:19.978 --> 26:22.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paying for the sugar-based juice
his children
drink.

26:22.981 --> 26:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN EADS: It's not really
going to be fair
on them, because I'm going to be
-- I'm not

26:26.285 --> 26:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have the money to buy
it. I barely
have enough to get what I'm
getting. I'm going

26:32.491 --> 26:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have to choose between either
getting food
or getting juice, you know, and
that's not

26:38.230 --> 26:39.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right.

26:39.998 --> 26:44.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANY VINAS: How can you tell a
3-year-old
kid drink water, drink diet
soda, when they

26:44.470 --> 26:48.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know that those sweet drinks is
what they
want? They're going to say no,
no, no. And

26:48.974 --> 26:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the parent will have to buy it.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARLA HURLEY, Parent: Fold it if
you need
to.

26:52.411 --> 26:55.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Carla Hurley
and her husband,
Cameron, who grew up in North
Philadelphia,

26:55.681 --> 26:57.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
support the soda tax.

26:57.516 --> 27:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HURLEY: It really makes
sense to me
that, OK, sugary drinks, it's
not something

27:01.320 --> 27:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we need. It's something
that we want.

27:03.121 --> 27:06.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Their
4-year-old son, Chance,
would qualify for the free
pre-kindergarten

27:06.792 --> 27:10.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the tax would provide.
Currently, the Hurleys
pay $1,000 a month.

27:10.395 --> 27:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HURLEY: My job pretty much
pays for
child care, but, at this point,
developmentally,

27:17.536 --> 27:20.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they would benefit more from
going than from
staying home with me.

27:20.272 --> 27:25.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAMERON HURLEY, Parent: The
money that she
brings in, the net, is really
close per pay

27:25.611 --> 27:28.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the money that goes out for
day care. It's
really close.

27:28.413 --> 27:32.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The couple has
moved in
with Carla's mother until they
can afford

27:32.417 --> 27:34.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to buy a House.

27:34.253 --> 27:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLA HURLEY: That's a mortgage
payment for
us, so that would be amazing to
at least take

27:38.924 --> 27:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of that burden off us from
paying for
two kids for child care. It
would be great.

27:44.563 --> 27:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The mayor says
the soda
tax would expand high-quality
preschools,

27:48.967 --> 27:52.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the Parent Infant Center in
West Philadelphia,
where the wait-list is
substantial.

27:52.738 --> 27:55.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEB GREEN, Executive Director,
Parent Infant
Center: This is part of an
advocacy effort

27:55.240 --> 27:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get the children to deliver
messages to
members of City Council to
understand the

27:58.944 --> 28:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
importance of the sugar tax
right now.

28:00.879 --> 28:04.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Executive
director Deb Green
shows drawings the students
created in support

28:04.816 --> 28:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the tax, describing what they
liked most
about pre-kindergarten.

28:08.086 --> 28:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEB GREEN: This one says,
"Because the playground
is so much fun to play on." This
child loves

28:13.659 --> 28:15.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the blocks.

28:15.761 --> 28:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The center
serves both low-income
families who receive state
subsidies and full-paying

28:19.598 --> 28:21.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
families.

28:21.466 --> 28:23.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DEB GREEN: I think we're
learning the importance
of children being in classrooms
with children

28:23.602 --> 28:27.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of other races. When they learn
it at 3, 4,
and 5, they no longer have bias,
stereotypes,

28:27.806 --> 28:29.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prejudice.

28:29.541 --> 28:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Currently, 150
families
are waiting for full-pay slots
and 70 families

28:33.946 --> 28:36.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are waiting for subsidized
slots.

28:36.882 --> 28:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Store owner Vinas supports
funding pre-kindergarten,
but says the city should find
another way

28:42.154 --> 28:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pay for it. Vinas worries the
added cost,
which he says could double the
price of some

28:47.759 --> 28:52.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beverages, will drive his
customers outside
the city to buy tax-free soda.

28:52.464 --> 28:57.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANY VINAS: Most of the people,
they're going
to just drive away, and drive 10
minutes,

28:57.469 --> 29:00.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and do the whole shopping at
another supermarket
out of the county of
Philadelphia.

29:00.305 --> 29:05.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM KENNEY: We're not taxing
thirst. It's
kind of comical, their argument
that this

29:05.477 --> 29:10.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
product is so critical to your
life and your
happiness, that you're going to
go and stock

29:10.549 --> 29:12.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up your whole car with it. It's
just -- it's
kind of laughable.

29:12.784 --> 29:15.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID DAY, Day's Beverages: When
the next
trailer comes in, make sure it's
all orange.

29:15.354 --> 29:19.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But David Day
of Day's Beverages
an independent soft drink
company on the border

29:19.691 --> 29:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Philadelphia, believes the
tax has bigger
implications than any losses he
may incur.

29:24.896 --> 29:27.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For him, it's an issue of
fairness.

29:27.199 --> 29:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID DAY: Many products have
sugar. Cakes,
all your candy bars have sugar.
Your cereal

29:33.772 --> 29:40.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has sugar. If you're going to do
it, let's
do everything that has sugar
will be taxed,

29:40.345 --> 29:44.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proportionately. Let's be fair.
You just cannot
pick on soft drinks.

29:44.116 --> 29:51.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The City
Council is expected
to vote on the mayor's proposal
soon.

29:51.690 --> 30:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
the race for
the White House and zero in for
a moment on

30:03.969 --> 30:05.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the money chase.

30:05.737 --> 30:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of Donald Trump's main
pitches to GOP
primary voters was that, by
funding his own

30:11.476 --> 30:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign, he wasn't beholden to
big donors.
But, tonight, the presumptive
Republican nominee

30:16.815 --> 30:21.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
holds his first official
fund-raiser in Albuquerque,
New Mexico.

30:21.586 --> 30:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here to discuss the shift and
what Trump's
goals are for the rest of the
campaign is

30:26.391 --> 30:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matea Gold. She covers money in
politics for
The Washington Post.

30:30.929 --> 30:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matea, welcome back to the
program.

30:33.432 --> 30:38.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as we just said, Donald
Trump holding
his first fund-raiser tonight,
well behind

30:38.804 --> 30:43.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other candidates, certainly
well behind
Hillary Clinton. How much of a
difference

30:43.442 --> 30:45.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
does that make?

30:45.277 --> 30:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD, The Washington Post:
Well, Trump
has set a very ambitious goal
for his joint

30:48.814 --> 30:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fund-raising operation with the
Republican
National Committee.

30:52.350 --> 30:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's $1 billion by Election
Day, which comes
out to about $250 million a
month for the

30:59.124 --> 31:04.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next five months. So, he has a
lot of work
to do. He doesn't have a formal
fund-raising

31:04.830 --> 31:10.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
structure. So, unlike Hillary
Clinton, who
has a very robust national
network of donors,

31:10.969 --> 31:15.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is just now in the process of
identifying
fund-raisers throughout the
country, bringing

31:15.907 --> 31:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people on board to help bring in
the big dollars
to really finance that fall
get-out-the-vote

31:20.412 --> 31:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effort that will be so critical.

31:22.247 --> 31:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, again, as we
have said,
Matea, Donald Trump has been
saying for months

31:28.754 --> 31:34.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that big donors are bad in
politics. He has
been critical of other
candidates and their

31:34.493 --> 31:35.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big donors.

31:35.660 --> 31:38.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does his campaign explain
the shift now?

31:38.930 --> 31:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, they are, I
think, struggling
to try to frame how this pivot
is really working.

31:46.204 --> 31:51.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the one hand, Trump and his
top aides are
maintaining that he's still
really just raising

31:51.343 --> 31:55.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money for the party, when, in
fact, the joint
fund-raising agreement that he
has with the

31:55.480 --> 32:01.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RNC does divert a substantial
amount of money
directly into his campaign. The
first $5,400

32:01.486 --> 32:07.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of any donation that a
contributor makes goes
directly to Trump for President.

32:07.626 --> 32:11.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's trying to maintain,
though, that
the bulk of this money will go
to finance

32:11.563 --> 32:17.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the party's get-out-the-vote
effort and also
that, even if donors do give
small amounts

32:17.602 --> 32:22.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of money, he is worth $10
billion, and he
cannot be bought by wealthy
contributors,

32:22.674 --> 32:25.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way he maintained other
politicians can.

32:25.610 --> 32:29.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, do we know
how much he's
really going to need? You said
they're saying

32:29.648 --> 32:34.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$1 billion, but he has certainly
got by on
a lot less than that during the
primary season.

32:34.286 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He got so much news coverage, he
didn't need
the kind of traditional TV
advertising other

32:39.524 --> 32:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates do. So, what do the
people you
talk to think he's going to
need?

32:43.795 --> 32:49.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, I think most
veteran party
fund-raisers privately agree $1
billion is

32:49.568 --> 32:52.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
incredibly ambitious and
difficult to pull
off.

32:52.204 --> 32:56.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you point out, he might
not need that
much. We haven't seen him need
to put the

32:56.875 --> 33:01.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of millions of dollars into
television
advertising that the other
candidates have

33:01.646 --> 33:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to do. He will, however,
need a really
robust on-the-ground field
effort to identify

33:08.920 --> 33:11.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters and turn them out to the
polls.

33:11.056 --> 33:13.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something the party's
going to take
the lead on, but that's
something they need

33:13.992 --> 33:15.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
substantial resources to
finance.

33:15.994 --> 33:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, we also
know, Matea, there
have been a number of stories
about big Republican

33:21.099 --> 33:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- wealthy Republican donors
either being
reluctant or just saying flat
out they're

33:26.004 --> 33:30.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unwilling to give Donald Trump
money. Where
does that stand? I know you did
some reporting

33:30.375 --> 33:32.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on that today.

33:32.177 --> 33:37.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, what's really
remarkable
is, we're seeing a coalescing of
the top donor

33:37.415 --> 33:41.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and fund-raising class in the
party coming
around Trump.

33:41.152 --> 33:46.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People who were ardent backers
of Jeb Bush,
for example, who was really
pounded by Trump

33:46.358 --> 33:52.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the primaries, major backers
of Wisconsin
Governor Scott Walker and other
candidates

33:52.397 --> 33:57.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have really come to the
conclusion that between
the choice of Trump and likely
Democratic

33:57.369 --> 34:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
front-runner Hillary Clinton in
the fall,
they're going to put their
investment with

34:01.339 --> 34:03.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

34:03.108 --> 34:05.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so I think it's been
incredibly striking
to see how many of them have
signed up to

34:05.477 --> 34:07.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
help on this effort.

34:07.312 --> 34:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, do you think,
between now
and Election Day, we are going
to see a steady

34:11.950 --> 34:17.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stream of fund-raisers that
Donald Trump is
going to have to be taking part
in?

34:17.088 --> 34:21.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, it remains to
be seen how
many he will be willing to take
part in. He's

34:21.092 --> 34:26.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
doing one tonight in
Albuquerque, and another
really high-dollar event in Los
Angeles later

34:26.197 --> 34:30.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this week that is set to bring
in as much
as $5 million.

34:30.402 --> 34:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, at this time four
years ago,
Governor Romney was doing 50
events over the

34:36.241 --> 34:40.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
summer. That's a big chunk of
your schedule
to take out for fund-raisers,
not something

34:40.779 --> 34:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Donald Trump necessarily
has interest
in doing. But I think a lot of
fund-raisers

34:44.649 --> 34:47.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are telling him he's going to
have to step
up to the plate.

34:47.519 --> 34:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matea Gold,
watching this every
day for The Washington Post, we
thank you.

34:54.125 --> 35:00.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATEA GOLD: My pleasure.

35:00.732 --> 35:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A small
community in Southeast
Oregon was thrown into the
national spotlight

35:07.973 --> 35:12.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier this year when several
dozen armed
occupiers took control of the
Malheur National

35:12.911 --> 35:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wildlife Refuge, leading to a
month-long standoff
with law enforcement.

35:17.349 --> 35:22.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were protesting federal
government control
of local lands, a longstanding
grievance in

35:22.520 --> 35:26.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the American West. But some
local residents
say they were surprised the
conflict took

35:26.424 --> 35:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place there, because they have
been working
together to resolve land
management disputes.

35:31.763 --> 35:33.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
reports.

35:34.032 --> 35:39.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The Malheur National
Wildlife Refuge
has reopened to the public, but
the headquarters

35:39.871 --> 35:41.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
complex remains closed, for now.

35:41.906 --> 35:45.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHAD KARGES, Malheur National
Wildlife Refuge:
Once the repairs are done, and
we're back

35:45.210 --> 35:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the buildings and operational
again in
full, then we will open up the
headquarters.

35:47.912 --> 35:53.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Refuge manager Chad
Karges says
that while cleanup efforts from
the occupation

35:53.351 --> 35:59.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are ongoing, everyone's
attention is now refocused
on the most important visitors
here, birds.

36:00.025 --> 36:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHAD KARGES: Malheur Refuge is
about migratory
birds, and so this basin is one
of the most

36:06.898 --> 36:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important spring migratory
stopover points
for migratory birds in the
Western U.S. The

36:12.303 --> 36:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basin serves as kind of like an
international
airport. It's a hub.

36:16.107 --> 36:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: More than 320 species
are found
here, including sandhill cranes,
Ross's geese,

36:21.613 --> 36:27.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
long-billed curlews, and
red-winged blackbirds.
But the birds don't just hang
out on the refuge.

36:27.452 --> 36:29.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They land wherever they want.

36:29.187 --> 36:34.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at this time of year, that's
often on
local private ranchland wet with
spring runoff.

36:34.459 --> 36:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's wonderful habitat for birds
and for cows.
Cows outnumber people by 14 to
one in Harney

36:43.401 --> 36:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
County. There's a long, proud
tradition of
ranching here, and cattle and
haying are the

36:48.173 --> 36:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
main drivers of the local
economy.

36:51.476 --> 36:55.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cows and birds seem to get along
quite well
on private ranches, and many in
the community

36:55.580 --> 37:02.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appreciate the tourism dollars
that birders
bring in. But it's when those
cattle have

37:02.687 --> 37:08.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to graze on public,
government-owned land,
which makes up 75 percent of the
county, that

37:08.326 --> 37:12.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conflicts between ranchers, and
environmental
groups, and the federal
government become

37:12.664 --> 37:14.499 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
evident.

37:14.532 --> 37:19.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, about 10 years ago, refuge
manager Karges
and a small group in this
community decided

37:19.537 --> 37:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try a fairly novel approach
to resolving
those conflicts, face-to-face
conversations.

37:25.276 --> 37:31.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those conversations have led
to this,
the High Desert Partnership, a
nonprofit that

37:31.683 --> 37:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was formed with one goal,
collaboration.

37:33.618 --> 37:39.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Can you add to the
committee, or does
it need to be a standing
committee?

37:39.157 --> 37:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I would just recommend that
it is a standing
group.

37:41.726 --> 37:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Participants at this
recent meeting,
held at the historic Hotel
Diamond, included

37:46.798 --> 37:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ranchers, federal and local
government employees,
scientists, and conservation
advocates, a

37:51.903 --> 38:00.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
diverse group you might not
expect would share
so many laughs.

38:00.311 --> 38:02.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brenda Smith is the group's
director.

38:02.213 --> 38:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDA SMITH, Director, High
Desert Partnership:
We wanted to go beyond
litigation when land

38:05.817 --> 38:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues were being challenged, I
guess. If
we could bring people together,
maybe those

38:14.792 --> 38:18.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things wouldn't happen, and that
is where
we have seen our success.

38:18.129 --> 38:23.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The group has made
progress in other
areas, too, like reducing the
number of invasive

38:23.234 --> 38:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carp that are hurting the
ecosystem in Malheur
Lake on the refuge, and
improving flood irrigation

38:28.740 --> 38:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
systems on private ranches that
benefit both
cattle and the birds.

38:32.877 --> 38:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how to manage cattle on
federal lands,
especially on the refuge, is an
issue they

38:37.849 --> 38:41.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are still sorting out.

38:41.519 --> 38:45.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dan Nichols is a local rancher
and an elected
county commissioner. He's a firm
believer

38:45.823 --> 38:49.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the partnership, but he says
it's not always
easy to find common ground, when
ranchers

38:49.894 --> 38:51.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feel their way of life is
threatened.

38:51.796 --> 38:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN NICHOLS, Rancher: There
needs to be some
change in the way the federal
lands are managed.

38:56.601 --> 39:03.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The West is continuously
bombarded by threats
of monuments, national parks,
further restrictions

39:03.775 --> 39:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on grazing. The lockup of
millions of acres
over a succession of time is
causing a demise,

39:12.850 --> 39:14.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a certain degree, in the
rural communities.

39:14.819 --> 39:19.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Nichols says working
through those
tough issues has been a lot
easier with the

39:19.190 --> 39:20.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
partnership in place.

39:20.858 --> 39:25.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN NICHOLS: We can sit down and
talk. You
still don't agree on everything.
That's a

39:25.730 --> 39:32.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given. That's people. But you
respect one
another to listen, and to look
at the world

39:32.437 --> 39:39.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through their lens a little bit.
And others
are starting to see, because
they have been

39:39.510 --> 39:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here enough, that cattle aren't
all bad.

39:42.880 --> 39:47.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Malheur is one of a
small number
of federal wildlife refuges
around the country

39:47.151 --> 39:51.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that allow limited grazing and
haying, largely
to help control plant growth and
invasive

39:51.990 --> 39:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
species during times of year
when cattle won't
impact the birds too much.

39:55.893 --> 40:00.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when a long-term plan was
being developed
for the refuge, some hoped to
get cattle off

40:00.064 --> 40:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the land entirely.

40:01.866 --> 40:04.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB SALLINGER, Portland Audubon
Society: We
think public lands need to be
managed for

40:04.202 --> 40:09.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their ecological value. That
needs to be the
top priority. And, too often,
those ecological

40:09.741 --> 40:13.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
values have been sacrificed for
cattle grazing.

40:13.244 --> 40:18.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Bob Sallinger is the
conservation
director at the Portland Audubon
Society.

40:18.216 --> 40:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says cattle cause a number of
ecological
problems, including trampling
vegetation and

40:23.354 --> 40:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nests, but after many, many
discussions with
the group, he decided he could
live with some

40:28.293 --> 40:30.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cattle on the refuge.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB SALLINGER: As we talked, we
recognized
that we did have some common
ground on some

40:32.764 --> 40:38.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the biggest issues,
particularly carp and
flood irrigation, that we could
agree to move

40:38.469 --> 40:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward on those issues, and
also that there
needed to be better science in
terms of understanding

40:43.841 --> 40:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the role that cattle are playing
in this ecosystem.

40:46.344 --> 40:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In fact, better
science has become
the shared goal of the various
high desert

40:53.151 --> 40:56.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
partners. And they have put
their trust in
this group.

40:56.587 --> 41:00.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Esther Lev, Dustin Johnson, and
Jess Wenick
are scientists with different
backgrounds,

41:00.758 --> 41:05.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the three are collaborating
on projects
around the refuge aimed at
understanding how

41:05.063 --> 41:10.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vegetation responds over time to
different
management tools, like flooding
and grazing,

41:10.068 --> 41:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but what they aren't doing, they
say, is taking
sides.

41:13.171 --> 41:16.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ESTHER LEV, The Wetlands
Conservancy: We're
not trying to dispute this or
agree to this.

41:16.574 --> 41:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really trying to say, what
goes on here?
What is the ideal plant
communities that we

41:22.146 --> 41:25.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want and water regimes that are
going to give
the birds the habitat they need?

41:25.883 --> 41:28.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUSTIN JOHNSON, Oregon State
University Extension
Service: We're really only two
years really

41:28.086 --> 41:32.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the sampling which is being
done. We're
just now beginning to understand
some of these

41:32.490 --> 41:34.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
changes that we're seeing when
we do certain
things.

41:34.525 --> 41:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESS WENICK, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service:
The beautiful thing that I see
in this collaborative

41:38.396 --> 41:44.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effort is the value of the
shared science,
because, too often, politics
removes some

41:44.969 --> 41:49.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the tools from the toolbox
that you are
able to use on a site like this
to meet your

41:49.340 --> 41:51.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
objectives.

41:51.209 --> 41:54.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The data from their
experiments
will ultimately help refuge
managers determine

41:54.212 --> 41:58.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how many cattle are allowed to
graze from
year to year. But not everyone
in the larger

41:58.616 --> 42:00.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community is supportive of the
High Desert
Partnership.

42:00.785 --> 42:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIN MAUPIN, Rancher: So, just
hold it and
be careful. She will be butt it.

42:05.089 --> 42:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Erin Maupin and her
husband, Jeff,
own a 1,700-acre ranch and 350
cattle. They,

42:10.461 --> 42:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like so many ranchers in this
area, need much
more land than they own to feed
those cattle.

42:15.166 --> 42:19.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they say they feel under
constant threat
that their government permits to
graze on

42:19.637 --> 42:23.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public lands will be taken away
to preserve
habitat for wildlife.

42:23.941 --> 42:28.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maupin says she participated in
early High
Desert Partnership meetings, but
stopped going

42:28.613 --> 42:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after she felt like her views
weren't getting
traction.

42:31.349 --> 42:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIN MAUPIN: I thought, if we
could just get
the truth out there, that we're
not here raping

42:37.188 --> 42:41.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and pillaging the land, that
environmental
groups would recognize our
grazing rights.

42:41.859 --> 42:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if people would listen
to us more
in the collaboration, instead of
we're the

42:47.965 --> 42:53.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only ones that have anything to
give, and
so we're constantly giving, and
giving, and

42:53.271 --> 42:55.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
giving.

42:55.173 --> 42:57.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: But those who are
committed to the
collaborative process say the
recent occupation

42:57.875 --> 43:00.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has strengthened their cause.

Partnership director Brenda
Smith:

43:02.246 --> 43:06.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDA SMITH: I think it might
actually encourage
people that, yes, this is
something that's

43:07.018 --> 43:09.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important, and that we really
need to work
hard at it.

43:09.053 --> 43:13.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The group recently
received a $6
million grant from a state
agency for wetlands

43:13.357 --> 43:17.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
habitat projects on and off the
refuge, and
they are now collaborating about
how to spend

43:17.995 --> 43:19.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that money.

43:19.297 --> 43:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat

43:37.682 --> 43:44.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Lab Girl" by geobiologist Hope
Jahren is
both an investigation of the
thrilling lives

43:44.088 --> 43:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of plants and a deeply personal
memoir.

43:47.825 --> 43:48.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has that.

43:48.960 --> 43:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Hope Jahren,
welcome to you.

43:51.028 --> 43:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN, Author, "Lab Girl":
Thank you.

43:52.763 --> 43:56.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, part memoir,
part science.
What were you after, or are they
both the

43:56.634 --> 43:57.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
same to you?

43:57.435 --> 43:59.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes.

43:59.237 --> 44:03.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I wanted to write a book.
And in my
field, that's what you do. You
get your degree,

44:04.008 --> 44:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you write a lot of papers,
and you get
a broad view of the field, and
you write a

44:07.578 --> 44:08.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
textbook, which changes the
way...

44:08.746 --> 44:10.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, for other
scientists.

44:10.381 --> 44:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes, which changes
the way it's
taught, and the field goes
forward.

44:13.251 --> 44:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I sat down to do that, I
couldn't keep
my own story out of it. When I
really tried

44:17.855 --> 44:22.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to explain what we had
accomplished, I needed
to talk about how we
accomplished it. And

44:22.593 --> 44:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then I needed to talk about all
the late nights
and special people and strange
experiences

44:28.399 --> 44:30.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that went into that.

44:30.167 --> 44:33.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I couldn't keep the two
separate. So now you
have got a book where it's all
entwined.

44:33.204 --> 44:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, it begins for
your first
discovering or at least seeing
science in

44:37.775 --> 44:38.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your father's lab.

44:38.676 --> 44:39.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes.

44:39.944 --> 44:41.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He taught science
at community
college, right?

44:41.212 --> 44:41.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What did you see?

44:43.681 --> 44:47.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: My very earliest
memories as
a small child were in the
laboratory, what

44:47.685 --> 44:53.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it smelled like, what the cement
felt like,
the hard angles of it, the shiny
objects,

44:53.157 --> 44:58.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the interesting things, and
how they could
all be used for something. And
they were toys,

44:58.629 --> 45:00.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but they weren't toys. They were
serious things.

45:00.665 --> 45:03.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you even
write, "There's
nothing in the world more
perfect than a slide

45:03.834 --> 45:04.368 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rule."

45:04.402 --> 45:05.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes. Yes.

45:05.403 --> 45:07.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's a serious
thing. Right?

45:07.238 --> 45:10.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes, exactly. It's
a beautiful
thing that we don't use anymore,
unfortunately.

45:10.708 --> 45:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we broke things, and then we
fixed them.
You could have fund breaking
them. You could

45:14.712 --> 45:17.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have fun fixing them. There was
nowhere better.

45:17.181 --> 45:22.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's the natural
world, though,
the world of plant life, that
ultimately grabbed

45:22.520 --> 45:22.987 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

45:23.020 --> 45:23.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes.

45:23.554 --> 45:25.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why?

45:25.323 --> 45:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: Oh, it's the
biggest question
there is. What does it mean to
be alive on

45:27.658 --> 45:29.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the planet?

45:29.460 --> 45:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And answering that for you and
me is one thing,
but answering it for an organism
that is so

45:33.731 --> 45:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terribly different than we are
and so terribly
much more successful and
long-lived and spectacular,

45:40.204 --> 45:45.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we can't even interview,
the way you
can ask me a question. I have to
pull it out

45:45.142 --> 45:49.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of its environment and put it in
the lab and
try to grow it and control it
and get -- and

45:49.380 --> 45:53.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work so hard to just get a
small, small window
into something so different.

45:53.184 --> 45:56.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, I was
thinking, because
so much of your book is about
moving through

45:56.053 --> 45:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world and seeing green,
right?

45:57.755 --> 45:59.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes, yes, yes.

45:59.523 --> 46:03.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Seeing colors
around us. And
yet, most of us -- maybe I
should speak for

46:03.160 --> 46:04.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
myself -- we don't see it every
day.

46:04.929 --> 46:06.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes. Yes.

46:06.063 --> 46:07.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's right there,
but we don't
see it.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: But you used to.
You got away
from that.

46:09.400 --> 46:13.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one -- another thing I
say in the
book is that everybody has a
tree they remember

46:13.537 --> 46:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from being a child. It's very
common I meet
somebody who remembers looking
carefully at

46:18.776 --> 46:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a tree, and being near it, and
what it meant
to them, et cetera.

46:22.346 --> 46:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think one of the only
interesting things
about me is that I never lost
that. I never

46:26.717 --> 46:28.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moved away from it.

46:28.552 --> 46:30.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the
interesting things
about the way you write the
book, going back

46:30.621 --> 46:35.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and forth between yourself and
the plant world,
is the similarities, but also,
as you were

46:35.960 --> 46:38.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying just before, the great
differences
between us, right?

46:38.462 --> 46:39.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes, yes. It's
juxtaposed.

46:39.730 --> 46:41.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:41.532 --> 46:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: I talk a little bit
about how
a plant establishes itself, and
the struggles

46:45.002 --> 46:46.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it undergoes.

46:46.937 --> 46:51.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I talk a little bit about
how I established
myself, and the good parts and
the bad parts

46:51.542 --> 46:58.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the tough parts. And then I
let the reader
say to themselves, did I see any
similar threads?

46:58.215 --> 47:00.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Did I see any differences?

47:00.518 --> 47:04.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's turned out to be a
wonderful thing.
To see people read it has been
wonderful.

47:04.488 --> 47:09.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Some of the tough
parts, personal
parts about your struggles with
depression,

47:09.393 --> 47:10.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bipolar disorder.

47:10.127 --> 47:11.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes. Yes.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You had to work
hard to keep
this under management, right?

47:13.197 --> 47:14.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes.

47:14.331 --> 47:16.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But it affected
your life tremendously.

47:16.467 --> 47:18.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes, yes.

47:18.369 --> 47:23.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spent 10 years being very sick
and hiding
it. I spent 10 years doing the
very hard work

47:23.541 --> 47:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of getting well. And I had not
seen that written
in a book the way it had been a
real thing

47:33.484 --> 47:37.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for me for very important parts
of my life.

47:37.988 --> 47:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I thought, maybe I can do
this. Maybe
I can make a book that tackles
this in a way

47:43.761 --> 47:45.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it hasn't been done before, and
I did my best.

47:45.730 --> 47:51.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then, of
course, for all
the wonder of scientific
discovery and research,

47:51.035 --> 47:54.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's the nuts and bolts of,
you know, actually
booing a worker, right?

47:54.271 --> 47:56.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Absolutely.

47:56.073 --> 47:59.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Of having to get
funding, of
having to get positions to teach
and do your

47:59.343 --> 48:00.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
research.

48:00.211 --> 48:01.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: Absolutely. It's
work.

48:01.912 --> 48:08.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's hard work that
doesn't usually
pay off. It's hard, and it might
not come

48:08.085 --> 48:13.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to anything, and the only
salvation you have
is the joy you get from the
moment, to the

48:13.758 --> 48:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
joy that you get from watching
the samples
accumulate right next to you.

48:18.362 --> 48:19.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's called "Lab
Girl."

48:19.663 --> 48:21.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOPE JAHREN: Yes.

48:21.499 --> 48:24.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You are a woman
in science.
Right? You write about this, all
the discussion

48:24.602 --> 48:31.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about why there aren't more
women. Is it sexism
at an individual level, at a
cultural level?

48:31.776 --> 48:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you see going on?

48:33.644 --> 48:38.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: Well, I think being
a scientist
is a position of respect and
power and access,

48:38.983 --> 48:44.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's a privileged position
in society.
And I think there are
fundamental mechanisms

48:44.155 --> 48:50.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that keep men and women from
achieving the
same level of power and access
and privilege

48:50.327 --> 48:52.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in society.

48:52.196 --> 48:58.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think these things
apply to science,
in the same way that they apply
in who's in

48:59.003 --> 49:02.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress and who is running the
world in many
other ways.

49:02.373 --> 49:05.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But give me an
example. Where
does it happen? Because, you
know, this discussion

49:05.743 --> 49:12.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is always, what happens to young
girls who
start out interested and somehow
don't make

49:12.183 --> 49:14.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same progress, or don't
achieve the same
positions?

49:14.418 --> 49:19.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: One thing that was
very important
to me was that I felt
comfortable in the lab

49:19.123 --> 49:21.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from being very, very small.

49:21.392 --> 49:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I knew that that's where I
belonged, and I
could fix things and move
things. And no matter

49:26.530 --> 49:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how many classrooms I went into
where I was
the only girl in the physics
class or whatever,

49:31.602 --> 49:35.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I never questioned the fact that
I didn't
belong there. I knew that as
well as I knew

49:35.439 --> 49:39.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my own name, that this was the
place I was
comfortable, and this is the
place where I

49:39.810 --> 49:41.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
could do things.

49:41.145 --> 49:44.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is "Lab
Girl."

49:44.114 --> 49:49.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hope Jahren, thank you so much.

49:49.587 --> 49:53.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOPE JAHREN: You're welcome.

49:53.224 --> 49:59.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, a
special public
media investigation casts new
scrutiny on

49:59.463 --> 50:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the disaster recovery system.

50:01.899 --> 50:04.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the subject of tonight's
"Frontline"
called "The Business of
Disaster." It looks

50:04.969 --> 50:10.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at how billions of dollars were
spent after
Superstorm Sandy, including the
profits insurers

50:10.074 --> 50:15.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make through the National Flood
Insurance
Program, and through special
housing aid Congress

50:15.613 --> 50:17.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gives to local governments.

50:17.481 --> 50:20.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The project was done in
conjunction with NPR,
which is also airing its report
on "All Things

50:20.885 --> 50:22.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Considered" today.

50:22.753 --> 50:26.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here's an excerpt from
"Frontline" about one
of the housing programs in New
York with NPR

50:26.090 --> 50:27.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reporter Laura Sullivan.

50:27.758 --> 50:30.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN, National Public
Radio: The
job of rebuilding these homes in
New York

50:30.895 --> 50:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
City, it's the responsibility of
a special
housing program called Build It
Back.

50:35.299 --> 50:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: We have created a
powerful program.

50:38.068 --> 50:41.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: The program got
$1.7 billion
from Washington.

50:41.872 --> 50:46.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: And we have secured
federal aid
money. The name of the program
is NYC Build

50:47.011 --> 50:52.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It Back, and it's here to make
your home safer,
our community stronger.

50:52.249 --> 50:56.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: One family that
was told they'd
be among the first to be helped
by Build It

50:56.220 --> 51:01.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Back was Diane and Nick
Camerada, a couple
the president had comforted.

51:01.292 --> 51:03.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE CAMERADA, Flood Victim:
Don't forget
about us.

51:03.093 --> 51:08.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
That's my point. That's why I
came here.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:10.467 --> 51:14.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: But three years
later, they
were still living with a fish
tank filled

51:14.071 --> 51:15.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Sandy storm water.

51:15.506 --> 51:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DIANE CAMERADA: This is our fish
tank.

51:16.907 --> 51:20.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: Is this the
water from the
tidal surge?

51:20.411 --> 51:21.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE CAMERADA: Yes.

51:21.378 --> 51:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: This is tidal
surge water?

51:23.347 --> 51:26.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE CAMERADA: Tidal surge,
plus the fish
tank water. I mean, everything
must have intermingled,

51:26.317 --> 51:31.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the water actually went
up to the
top step before my second floor.

51:31.455 --> 51:36.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: The water came
all the way
out here? This whole floor was
underwater?

51:36.093 --> 51:37.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIANE CAMERADA: Underwater.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: This used to be
your entryway?

51:39.129 --> 51:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Cameradas were still waiting
to get their
first floor fixed up and their
house elevated.

51:43.200 --> 51:45.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE CAMERADA: Television, our
couch, our
living area.

51:45.536 --> 51:49.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: Like many
homeowners, they
gambled and didn't have flood
insurance. They

51:49.707 --> 51:51.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were now counting on help from
Build It Back.

51:51.608 --> 51:55.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE CAMERADA: Do you know I
had to itemize
every single thing that I lost?

51:55.479 --> 51:58.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: Diane showed me
what that
process has been like.

51:58.248 --> 52:02.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE CAMERADA: I know I filled
this same
application out three times.

52:02.653 --> 52:05.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: No, this same
application,
this pile?

52:05.222 --> 52:06.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE CAMERADA: Yes.

52:06.423 --> 52:08.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: How do you keep
all of this
straight?

52:08.993 --> 52:12.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE CAMERADA: I have no choice
but to keep
it straight. I have to know
where everything

52:12.463 --> 52:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is so when somebody says, oh,
you didn't fill
this out, or you didn't fill
that out, here

52:16.734 --> 52:20.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is, I filled it out. I filled
it out three,
four times.

52:20.037 --> 52:24.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA SULLIVAN: It wasn't just
lost paperwork.
It was also hard to get a
straight answer.

52:24.742 --> 52:28.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE CAMERADA: You would talk
to one person
and then if you would talk to
another person,

52:28.746 --> 52:32.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you would get a totally
different story. So
who do you believe?

52:32.383 --> 52:36.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
