JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. GWEN IFILL: And

00:04.338 --> 00:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm Gwen Ifill. JUDY WOODRUFF:
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.442 --> 00:13.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chicago's mayor fires the city's
police superintendent, amidst

00:13.113 --> 00:17.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protests and calls for change
after video of an officer

00:17.351 --> 00:20.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killing a black teen. GWEN
IFILL: Also ahead this Tuesday:

00:20.654 --> 00:25.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ramping up the fight. The U.S.
expands use of special forces in

00:25.192 --> 00:29.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iraq and Syria to combat ISIS.
JUDY WOODRUFF: And our special

00:29.930 --> 00:33.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look at Nigeria's pain and
promise continues: how an

00:34.001 --> 00:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economic boom leaves much of the
country in poverty. FELIX MORKA,

00:38.005 --> 00:41.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Activist: There's no potable
water. There's no access to

00:41.174 --> 00:44.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care, primary health
care. The schools are completely

00:44.177 --> 00:48.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
private. There's no official
presence in Makoko. GWEN IFILL:

00:48.615 --> 00:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour." (BREAK) GWEN

01:00.260 --> 01:05.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: World leaders left Paris
today, and negotiators got down

01:08.001 --> 01:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the hard work of finishing a
landmark climate change accord.

01:11.605 --> 01:15.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama was among those
departing after a final call to

01:15.642 --> 01:17.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
action. BARACK OBAMA, President
of the United States: I am

01:17.644 --> 01:19.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
convinced that we are going to
get big things done here. GWEN

01:19.646 --> 01:22.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: At an afternoon news
conference, the president

01:22.215 --> 01:26.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sounded optimistic about the
summit's chances. BARACK OBAMA:

01:26.153 --> 01:29.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you had said to people as
recently as two years ago that

01:29.623 --> 01:35.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we'd have 180 countries showing
up in Paris with pretty

01:35.095 --> 01:40.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ambitious targets for carbon
reduction, most people would

01:40.567 --> 01:42.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have said, you're crazy, that's
a pipe dream. And yet here we

01:43.003 --> 01:45.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are. That's already happened.
GWEN IFILL: Even so, climate

01:45.806 --> 01:49.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scientists warn it will take
much larger reductions to stop

01:49.943 --> 01:53.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Earth's warming trend.
Another sticking point is

01:53.580 --> 01:58.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
finding the money to help poor
nations adapt. Today, Mr. Obama,

01:58.585 --> 02:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a native of Hawaii who lived for
a time in Indonesia, met with

02:02.656 --> 02:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaders of Pacific island
nations whose very existence is

02:06.460 --> 02:09.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threatened by rising sea levels.
BARACK OBAMA: As weather

02:09.363 --> 02:14.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
patterns change, we might deal
with tens of millions of climate

02:14.167 --> 02:19.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugees from the Asian Pacific
region, and as I mentioned to my

02:21.942 --> 02:26.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
friends around the table, I am
an island boy. I grew up on an

02:26.913 --> 02:32.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
island, and understand both the
beauty, but also the fragility

02:32.652 --> 02:35.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of island ecosystems. GWEN
IFILL: Meanwhile, African

02:35.455 --> 02:38.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leaders talked to French
President Francois Hollande

02:38.258 --> 02:41.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about threats their countries
face, ranging from the spreading

02:41.862 --> 02:45.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sahara Desert to dwindling water
supplies. AKINWUMI ADESINA,

02:45.165 --> 02:47.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President, African Development
Bank: Africa, the least emitter

02:47.534 --> 02:52.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of greenhouse gases in the
world, now suffers the most from

02:52.305 --> 02:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
climate change. Others pollute.
Africa pays, and pays dearly.

02:59.146 --> 03:02.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lake Chad is almost gone, and
the sand dunes are encroaching

03:02.916 --> 03:05.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Sahel. GWEN IFILL: Hollande
announced today that France will

03:05.919 --> 03:09.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
send more than $8 billion to
Africa for development of

03:09.523 --> 03:13.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
renewable energy and electrical
access. But the Paris meeting's

03:13.760 --> 03:17.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
success will ultimately be
judged by how far a final deal

03:18.031 --> 03:22.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goes and how effective it can be
without mandatory enforcement.

03:22.069 --> 03:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama acknowledged as
much at his news conference.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: What we seek is an
agreement where progress paves

03:28.975 --> 03:32.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way for countries to update
their emissions targets on a

03:32.212 --> 03:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regular basis and each nation
has the confidence that other

03:35.715 --> 03:39.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nations are meeting their
commitments. GWEN IFILL: Still,

03:39.286 --> 03:42.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the president flew back to
Washington, House Republicans

03:42.489 --> 03:46.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called for action to reject his
Clean Power Plan. House Speaker

03:46.693 --> 03:48.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paul Ryan: REP. PAUL RYAN
(R-WI), Speaker of the House: I

03:48.695 --> 03:50.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't think we're out of step
with public opinion wanting

03:50.697 --> 03:52.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
jobs, wanting economic growth,
weighing the costs and the

03:52.732 --> 03:55.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
benefits. And I think when you
weigh the cost and the benefits

03:55.535 --> 03:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against these so-called legally
binding obligations, they don't

03:58.772 --> 04:01.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
add up. GWEN IFILL: The House
votes on a Republican energy

04:01.641 --> 04:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill later this week. The White
House has already threatened a

04:04.945 --> 04:08.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
veto. And this evening, House
Republicans did push through

04:08.882 --> 04:13.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resolutions opposing EPA limits
on carbon dioxide emissions from

04:13.186 --> 04:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
power plants. JUDY WOODRUFF: In
the day's other news, Chicago

04:16.223 --> 04:19.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired police
Superintendent Garry McCarthy

04:20.026 --> 04:23.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today over the killing of a
black teenager. Video released

04:23.897 --> 04:28.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last week showed Laquan McDonald
being shot 16 times by a white

04:28.802 --> 04:33.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer in October of 2014.
Today, the mayor said the police

04:33.673 --> 04:36.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
department needs -- quote --
"fresh eyes and new leadership."

04:36.843 --> 04:39.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAHM EMANUEL (D), Mayor of
Chicago: Any case of excessive

04:39.513 --> 04:44.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
force or abuse of authority
undermines the entire force and

04:44.551 --> 04:48.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the trust we must build with
every community in the city.

04:48.421 --> 04:51.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Police officers are only as
effective as if they are trusted

04:51.925 --> 04:55.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by all Chicagoans, whoever they
are and wherever they live in

04:55.695 --> 04:58.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the city. JUDY WOODRUFF:
Meanwhile, Jason Van Dyke, the

04:58.765 --> 05:01.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officer involved in the
shooting, has been charged with

05:01.601 --> 05:05.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first-degree murder. And late
today, the Illinois state

05:05.071 --> 05:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attorney general called for a
federal civil rights

05:07.874 --> 05:11.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigation of the Chicago
police. We will examine what led

05:11.945 --> 05:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to today's firing later in the
program. GWEN IFILL: A federal

05:15.348 --> 05:19.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trial has been delayed again for
Dylann Roof, accused of killing

05:19.486 --> 05:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nine black church members in
Charleston, South Carolina. A

05:22.856 --> 05:26.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judge postponed it for the third
time today, giving the defense

05:26.259 --> 05:30.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more time to review thousands of
pages of evidence. Roof faces

05:30.530 --> 05:35.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
federal charges of hate crimes
and firearms violations. A trial

05:35.035 --> 05:38.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on murder charges, in state
court, is set for next July.

05:38.405 --> 05:41.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More bloodshed in
the Middle East today. The

05:41.441 --> 05:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israeli military says troops
shot and killed two more

05:44.711 --> 05:48.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Palestinians in attempted
stabbings. Both attacks happened

05:48.715 --> 05:52.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the West Bank, but hours
apart. The army didn't say how

05:52.752 --> 05:57.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
close the attackers, a man and a
woman, got to their targets.

05:57.457 --> 06:01.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Since mid-September, 19 Israelis
and at least 100 Palestinians

06:01.995 --> 06:05.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have died in the ongoing
violence. GWEN IFILL: The number

06:05.298 --> 06:09.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of refugees fleeing to Europe by
sea fell last month for the

06:09.436 --> 06:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first time this year. The U.N.
Refugee Agency says the number

06:13.240 --> 06:18.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was roughly 140,000, down from
220,000 in October. It cited

06:18.845 --> 06:22.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turbulent seas and Turkish
action against smugglers. But

06:22.616 --> 06:26.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thousands have arrived on Greek
islands this week alone, many of

06:26.453 --> 06:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them among the most vulnerable.
SARAH CROWE, Spokesperson,

06:28.555 --> 06:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNICEF: The numbers of women and
children continue to climb,

06:31.725 --> 06:35.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which is for us, quite honestly,
something of a surprise, and we

06:35.228 --> 06:39.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can only assume that this is a
sense of the desperation that

06:39.232 --> 06:43.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
families are going through. When
you take your whole family with

06:43.169 --> 06:46.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you, it means you don't have
schools for your children, you

06:46.573 --> 06:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't have proper shelter, you
have no sense of what lies

06:50.910 --> 06:54.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ahead. GWEN IFILL: The U.N.
estimates more than one million

06:54.347 --> 06:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
migrants and refugees will enter
Europe this year. JUDY WOODRUFF:

06:57.951 --> 07:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Investigators in Indonesia say
they have determined why an

07:01.321 --> 07:06.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AirAsia jetliner crashed last
December, killing all 162 on

07:06.793 --> 07:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
board. They said today that a
recurring problem with the

07:11.464 --> 07:15.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rudder control system, and
miscommunication among the crew,

07:15.802 --> 07:19.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brought the plane down. Search
teams had to recover the

07:19.205 --> 07:23.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wreckage from the Java Sea after
the crash. They also found the

07:23.176 --> 07:27.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
black box flight recorders that
helped explain what happened.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, there's word the number

07:29.783 --> 07:33.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Americans with newly
diagnosed diabetes is falling

07:33.453 --> 07:36.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after decades of rising. The
Centers for Disease Control and

07:36.823 --> 07:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Prevention reports cases fell by
about one-fifth from 2008 to

07:41.294 --> 07:46.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2014 to 1.4 million. Experts say
they're not sure what's causing

07:46.433 --> 07:49.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the drop, but better eating
habits could be a factor. JUDY

07:49.636 --> 07:52.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Ceremonies in
Montgomery, Alabama, today

07:52.505 --> 07:56.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
marked a seminal moment in the
civil rights movement. It was 60

07:56.309 --> 07:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years ago that Rosa Parks
refused to give up her seat on a

08:00.013 --> 08:04.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
segregated bus and triggered a
boycott. The commemorations

08:04.150 --> 08:07.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
focused on the Baptist church
where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

08:07.721 --> 08:11.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
led the boycott. Democratic
presidential candidate Hillary

08:11.324 --> 08:15.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton was among the speakers,
along with Alabama Congresswoman

08:15.528 --> 08:18.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Terri Sewell. REP. TERRI SEWELL
(D), Alabama: We're here not

08:18.264 --> 08:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
only to celebrate 60 years, but
to know that in order for us to

08:22.035 --> 08:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get 60 years further down the
way, we must do our part. We

08:27.006 --> 08:32.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
must do our part. You know, the
price of freedom is never free.

08:32.612 --> 08:37.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has been paid for by the
blood and tears of so many, and

08:37.150 --> 08:41.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all of us know that we get to
stand because Rosa refused to

08:41.354 --> 08:47.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sit. JUDY WOODRUFF: Rosa Parks
died in 2005, at the age of 92.

GWEN IFILL: Facebook chief
executive Mark Zuckerberg

08:50.130 --> 08:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
announced the birth of a
daughter today and a huge new

08:53.166 --> 08:56.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charity. Zuckerberg said he and
his wife, Priscilla Chan, will

08:56.936 --> 09:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
give away nearly all of their
Facebook stock, valued at $45

09:00.540 --> 09:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
billion. They will focus on
fighting disease, improving

09:04.077 --> 09:08.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education and reducing poverty.
JUDY WOODRUFF: In economic news,

09:08.181 --> 09:13.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. auto sales hit a 14-year
high last month, thanks to major

09:13.119 --> 09:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
holiday discounts. That data,
plus better economic indicators

09:17.424 --> 09:21.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Europe and Japan, went down
well on Wall Street. The Dow

09:21.294 --> 09:27.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jones industrial average gained
168 points to close at 17888.

09:27.867 --> 09:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 47 points. And
the S&amp;P 500 added 22. GWEN

09:32.872 --> 09:36.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: And starting today, menus
at chain restaurants in New York

09:36.810 --> 09:41.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
City will carry a warning about
salt. A salt shaker emblem will

09:41.147 --> 09:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
note menu items that have more
than 2,300 milligrams of sodium.

09:45.718 --> 09:49.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the daily limit many
nutritionists recommend, about

09:49.189 --> 09:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one teaspoon of salt. It's the
first such rule in the country.

09:53.460 --> 09:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
boosting special forces in Iraq

09:57.197 --> 10:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Syria; the birth of Africa's
largest economy; Chicago's

10:01.534 --> 10:06.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police chief fired; and much
more. JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S.

10:15.982 --> 10:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strategy against the Islamic
State, also known as ISIS or

10:20.253 --> 10:24.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIL, came in for some direct
questions today before the House

10:24.757 --> 10:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Armed Services Committee, as the
U.S. announced that more forces

10:29.395 --> 10:34.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be heading to Iraq to fight
the extremist group. Pentagon

10:34.934 --> 10:38.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaders came to the hearing with
a response to calls to do more

10:38.938 --> 10:40.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against the Islamic State.
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense

10:40.940 --> 10:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary: In full coordination
with the government of Iraq,

10:42.942 --> 10:47.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're deploying a specialized
expeditionary targeting force to

10:47.280 --> 10:50.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
assist Iraqi and Kurdish
Peshmerga forces. JUDY WOODRUFF:

10:50.550 --> 10:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Defense Secretary Ash Carter
said the force will be larger

10:53.786 --> 10:58.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than 50, and be authorized to
take direct action, including

10:58.358 --> 11:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
combat. ASHTON CARTER: These
special operators will, over

11:01.194 --> 11:06.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, be able to conduct raids,
free hostages, gather

11:06.232 --> 11:11.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intelligence and capture ISIL
leaders. This force will also be

11:11.137 --> 11:13.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a position to conduct
unilateral operations in Syria.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. already
has 3,500 U.S. troops in Iraq,

11:15.708 --> 11:17.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supporting that country's
military, and a few dozen

11:17.710 --> 11:19.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
special operations troops are
assigned to support local

11:19.712 --> 11:21.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fighters in Syria against ISIL.
Carter said today the U.S. is --

11:21.714 --> 11:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quote -- "at war," and the force
he announced is a new way of

11:23.716 --> 11:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
achieving the objective. ASHTON
CARTER: We're actually eager to

11:25.718 --> 11:29.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do more, because that will
accelerate the defeat of ISIL.

11:29.389 --> 11:34.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it hinges upon us finding
the capable local forces that we

11:47.640 --> 11:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can enable in this way. JUDY
WOODRUFF: A number of

11:49.909 --> 11:53.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans have called for
sending in far more troops, but,

11:53.780 --> 11:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Paris today, President Obama
again rejected that idea. BARACK

11:57.884 --> 11:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBAMA, President of the United
States: For some reason, too

11:59.886 --> 12:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
often in Washington, American
leadership is defined by whether

12:01.888 --> 12:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or not we're sending troops
somewhere. Where we strengthen

12:03.890 --> 12:08.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our relationships and influence
the most is when we are helping

12:16.002 --> 12:20.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to organize the world around a
particular problem. JUDY

12:20.139 --> 12:23.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Back at the hearing,
the country's top military

12:23.176 --> 12:27.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer, Marine General Joseph
Dunford, acknowledged ISIL has

12:27.580 --> 12:31.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not been contained, but he said
stepped-up airstrikes are

12:31.951 --> 12:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cutting into the militants' oil
revenues. Even so, Ohio

12:34.854 --> 12:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican Michael Turner
challenged Secretary Carter on

12:40.393 --> 12:42.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
claims of progress. REP. MICHAEL
TURNER (R), Ohio: Are we

12:42.395 --> 12:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
winning, Mr. Secretary? ASHTON
CARTER: We will win. REP.

12:45.164 --> 12:48.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL TURNER: Are we winning
now? ASHTON CARTER: We are going

12:48.134 --> 12:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to win. REP. MICHAEL TURNER:
Well, Mr. Secretary, I admit,

12:50.303 --> 12:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you know, most of us, on both
sides of the aisle, do not have

12:53.306 --> 12:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confidence that you have a
strategy, and you do not have a

12:55.642 --> 12:58.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strategy based on an accurate
assessment. I think your

12:58.845 --> 13:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presentation here today shows a
disconnect between what -- all

13:03.216 --> 13:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the information that we're
receiving, and really what's

13:06.019 --> 13:09.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being placed into the United
States' effort. JUDY WOODRUFF:

13:09.689 --> 13:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meanwhile in Iraq, Shiite Muslim
militias warned they will attack

13:14.060 --> 13:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any new American force that
deploys there. For more, we turn

13:18.998 --> 13:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the chairman of the Housed
Armed Services Committee,

13:21.634 --> 13:25.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican Mac Thornberry of
Texas. I spoke with him just a

13:25.238 --> 13:29.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
short time ago. Welcome,
Chairman Mac Thornberry. Let me

13:29.842 --> 13:33.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
begin by just asking, what is
your understanding now of these

13:33.279 --> 13:36.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
additional steps the Obama
administration is going to be

13:36.916 --> 13:39.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taking in the fight against
ISIS? REP. MAC THORNBERRY (R),

13:39.485 --> 13:42.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Texas: Well, obviously, the
Obama administration is trying

13:42.255 --> 13:47.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to respond to Paris and other
terrorist attacks, so they label

13:47.427 --> 13:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these eight adaptations, because
they don't want to admit what

13:51.497 --> 13:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they have been doing so far is
not working, so these are

13:54.600 --> 13:58.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adaptations, slight changes to
what they have been doing and

13:58.838 --> 14:03.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they hope it's more successful.
You know, my fear is that it is

14:03.042 --> 14:06.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too much of a gradual approach
that is not really going to

14:06.512 --> 14:11.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change the conditions on the
ground or the ideological battle

14:11.284 --> 14:14.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in which ISIS is excelling. JUDY
WOODRUFF: Well, Secretary Carter

14:14.320 --> 14:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called it, I believe, a -- quote
-- "specialized expeditionary

14:18.558 --> 14:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
targeting force." And we're
hearing reporting that it could

14:21.794 --> 14:26.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be as many as 200 troops or
more. Why do you think that's --

14:26.132 --> 14:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could be inadequate? REP.
MAC THORNBERRY: Well, I do think

14:28.735 --> 14:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're taking just step-by-step
sort of approach. So, people

14:32.805 --> 14:37.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been calling for some time
about putting some of our folks

14:37.210 --> 14:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the ground to help make
airstrikes more effective, and

14:41.314 --> 14:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that sounds like what the
secretary talked about today,

14:44.717 --> 14:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
although he did say that they
could carry out raids and so

14:48.321 --> 14:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forth. But -- and if it is 200
people, then it is a small

14:53.326 --> 14:58.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fraction of what we once had,
for example, in just Iraq. So

14:58.698 --> 15:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's the reason I think a
number of us are concerned that

15:01.701 --> 15:05.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president is responding to
events, rather than trying to

15:05.972 --> 15:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
figure out how to actually
degrade and destroy ISIS, and

15:09.809 --> 15:12.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then putting the resources
behind that. JUDY WOODRUFF:

15:12.545 --> 15:15.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, you have talked about the
need for the president to put a

15:15.381 --> 15:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
four-star general in charge of
this somewhere in the region.

15:20.086 --> 15:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are you saying that there's a
number of troops who should be

15:24.056 --> 15:26.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the ground that the
administration hasn't agreed to

15:26.492 --> 15:29.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yet? REP. MAC THORNBERRY: No, I
don't get caught up in numbers.

15:29.996 --> 15:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What I get caught up in is a
strategy to actually succeed.

15:35.535 --> 15:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And my biggest fear is that what
we have seen and what we have

15:40.072 --> 15:43.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seen so far is that there's been
micromanagement from the White

15:43.743 --> 15:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House. You heard that testimony
today. There are 3,500 U.S.

15:47.713 --> 15:53.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
troops in Iraq. If they want to
add 100, they have got to go all

15:53.486 --> 15:58.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way to the president to get
his approval to add 25 or 100.

15:59.025 --> 16:02.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's that micromanagement
from the White House that is one

16:02.261 --> 16:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the constraints on our
efforts. And so that's the

16:04.897 --> 16:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reason I say there needs to be a
four-star in the region in

16:08.534 --> 16:13.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charge, and he needs to have the
authority to be successful,

16:13.439 --> 16:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rather than run and ask mother
may I for every additional 25

16:17.844 --> 16:20.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
troops that he thinks he needs.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of

16:20.646 --> 16:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iraq, Prime Minister Abadi said
late today that he doesn't

16:24.217 --> 16:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believe there should be any more
foreign troops in his country.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how do you reconcile that?
You're saying if the U.S.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believes it should send more
troops, it should. What about

16:34.961 --> 16:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the will of these sovereign
countries and their own leaders?

16:37.830 --> 16:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. MAC THORNBERRY: Well,
unfortunately, Iraq has become

16:41.200 --> 16:46.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more and more a proxy for Iran.
And so the country that is

16:46.606 --> 16:49.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
putting lots of troops on the
ground, as well as directing the

16:49.742 --> 16:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shiite militias, is their
neighbor Iran. And that

16:53.579 --> 16:58.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certainly makes things more
complicated. So, if we -- that's

16:58.050 --> 17:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the reason, for example, the
bill that Congress passed and

17:02.121 --> 17:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now the president has signed
would allow the president to

17:06.225 --> 17:10.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
provide arms directly to the
Kurds, directly to the Sunni

17:10.296 --> 17:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tribes, rather than go through
the Baghdad government, because

17:13.499 --> 17:17.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iran is increasingly calling the
shots there. JUDY WOODRUFF: As

17:17.103 --> 17:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you know, the administration,
Chairman Mac Thornberry, you

17:19.839 --> 17:22.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know the administration is
saying that this needs to be

17:22.074 --> 17:25.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
done in coordination with the
countries in the region. Are you

17:26.012 --> 17:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying that the U.S. should be
calling the shots, no matter

17:29.715 --> 17:34.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what the countries in the region
want? REP. MAC THORNBERRY: Oh,

17:34.153 --> 17:37.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of course not. But I also think
it is absolutely, as the former

17:37.723 --> 17:41.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama undersecretary of defense
for intelligence wrote about a

17:41.494 --> 17:44.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week ago, that the countries in
the region are not going to step

17:44.997 --> 17:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forward unless the U.S. takes a
decisive leadership role. So

17:49.802 --> 17:52.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's a chicken and the egg. We
can't do it without them, and

17:52.672 --> 17:55.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're not going to do it
unless they know we're

17:55.041 --> 17:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
committed, and they know that
we're going to stay with the

17:58.010 --> 18:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mission. See, part of the
problem is the countries in the

18:00.446 --> 18:04.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
region remember that we
abandoned Iraq in 2011 and that

18:04.784 --> 18:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has contributed been -- that has
contributed to this mess. So

18:08.921 --> 18:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they -- we have to earn their
trust back. And that's going to

18:11.958 --> 18:15.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take some time and effort. JUDY
WOODRUFF: But, in the end, who's

18:15.428 --> 18:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
calling the shots? REP. MAC
THORNBERRY: Well, there is no

18:17.897 --> 18:22.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
substitute for U.S. leadership.
Now, we need to do it with a

18:22.501 --> 18:26.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coalition. There needs to be
Muslims on the ground to help

18:26.572 --> 18:30.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
carry this out. But nobody can
take the place of the United

18:30.142 --> 18:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States. And that's the reason
that I believe a four-star on

18:35.047 --> 18:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ground in charge, empowered
to call the shots is really

18:40.019 --> 18:42.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
needed to help focus these
efforts. JUDY WOODRUFF: And do

18:42.755 --> 18:45.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you have any sense the
administration is prepared to do

18:45.057 --> 18:48.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that? REP. MAC THORNBERRY: I
don't know. They -- they make

18:48.327 --> 18:51.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good noises about the authority
of the guy that they have

18:51.897 --> 18:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
currently in Kuwait, and he's a
good guy. I don't take anything

18:57.036 --> 19:01.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away from him. What I worry
about, again, is the White House

19:01.907 --> 19:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aides micromanaging everything
that goes on there. We cannot

19:06.245 --> 19:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a successful military
operation run from the basement

19:09.648 --> 19:12.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the White House. JUDY
WOODRUFF: The chairman of the

19:12.084 --> 19:15.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House Armed Services Committee,
Congressman Mac Thornberry, we

19:15.488 --> 19:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thank you. REP. MAC THORNBERRY:
Thanks for having me. JUDY

19:17.656 --> 19:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And a note: We expect
to hear the Obama

19:20.726 --> 19:25.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration's perspective
later this week. GWEN IFILL: We

19:33.706 --> 19:37.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
return now to our continuing
series this week, "Nigeria: Pain

19:37.676 --> 19:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Promise." Tonight, special
correspondent Nick Schifrin

19:41.047 --> 19:44.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looks at the country's massive
economic surge, new

19:44.216 --> 19:47.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
millionaires, growing
inequality, and those fighting

19:47.186 --> 19:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to provide new opportunities for
all Nigerians. NICK SCHIFRIN: In

19:52.525 --> 19:56.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Africa today, for the young, the
hip, the rich, there's no better

19:56.929 --> 19:59.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place than Lagos. TOLA ADEAGBO,
Designer: Nigeria's just the

19:59.532 --> 20:02.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place to be right now in the
developing world. NICK SCHIFRIN:

Tola Adeagbo designs handbags
for Florian London.

20:05.171 --> 20:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Increasingly, her market is in
Lagos. This is the world's

20:08.040 --> 20:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fastest growing mega-city. TOLA
ADEAGBO: Any international

20:10.576 --> 20:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business, don't be shy of
Africa. There's no Boko Haram

20:13.646 --> 20:16.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anywhere, especially not in
Lagos. NICK SCHIFRIN: This is a

20:16.148 --> 20:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nation of superlatives, Africa's
largest population, richest

20:19.051 --> 20:22.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country, and fastest growing
economy. ANURAG SHAH, Porsche

20:22.088 --> 20:25.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dealer: I'm very sure that this
will be the main hub in Africa

20:25.291 --> 20:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it comes to the luxury
goods in near future. NICK

20:27.660 --> 20:29.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCHIFRIN: Straight from Germany?
ANURAG SHAH: Straight from

20:29.662 --> 20:31.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Germany. NICK SCHIFRIN: Anurag
Shah sells Porsches that cost

20:31.664 --> 20:35.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
600 times the average Nigerian's
annual salary. The ultra-rich

20:35.968 --> 20:38.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are growing at a higher
percentage here than in the U.S.

20:38.838 --> 20:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANURAG SHAH: You have luxury
yachts, you have luxury

20:42.241 --> 20:44.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aircraft, you have luxury
wristwatches. Every luxury

20:44.376 --> 20:47.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business in Nigeria currently is
booming. NICK SCHIFRIN: It's not

20:50.583 --> 20:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
only the rich. Between now and
2030, the middle class will grow

20:54.620 --> 20:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by a factor of eight. Their
spending power has made Nigeria

20:58.157 --> 21:05.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world's largest consumer of
Guinness beer. MAN: This is what

21:05.097 --> 21:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I drink. This is Guinness.
That's what I like. MAN: In

21:07.099 --> 21:09.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lagos here, you can see many,
many things. This is where you

21:09.101 --> 21:11.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can get what you want. I love
Lagos very well. NICK SCHIFRIN:

21:11.103 --> 21:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Half the country is under 30.
Smart young Nigerians have more

21:14.840 --> 21:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
money, and they are starting
their own businesses. TONY

21:17.376 --> 21:20.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELUMELU, Businessman: These guys
are entering the job market. So,

21:20.112 --> 21:22.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if you don't cater for these
guys, there's going to be

21:23.015 --> 21:24.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
insecurity for everyone
everywhere in the world. NICK

21:25.017 --> 21:28.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCHIFRIN: Tony Elumelu is one of
Africa's richest men. He is

21:28.888 --> 21:32.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trying to build the middle class
by investing $100 million of his

21:32.391 --> 21:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$700 million net worth in 10,000
young entrepreneurs. TONY

21:36.929 --> 21:42.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELUMELU: The right, sustainable
way to intervene in Africa for

21:42.434 --> 21:46.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economic development, for
inclusive development is to

21:46.572 --> 21:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
invest. ISAZODUWA AGBONENI,
Entrepreneur: When I started

21:51.010 --> 21:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
initially, I did a free wash, so
people were actually attracted

21:54.480 --> 21:57.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the place. NICK SCHIFRIN:
Isazoduwa Agboneni is one of

21:57.116 --> 22:01.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Elumelu's first entrepreneurs.
She calls herself Neni, as in

22:01.120 --> 22:04.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the founder and lead mechanic of
Neni's Auto Care. ISAZODUWA

22:04.356 --> 22:07.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AGBONENI: I was amongst the best
five in class. I was like, wow,

22:07.860 --> 22:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if I can do well among the guys,
so let me give it a try. NICK

22:12.198 --> 22:15.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCHIFRIN: Neni's invested
$50,000 of her own money. Tony

22:15.801 --> 22:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Elumelu's money bought an engine
lift and will convert this hole

22:19.138 --> 22:22.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into a proper mechanic's pit. It
will make her team faster, and

22:22.741 --> 22:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allow her to hire more people.
ISAZODUWA AGBONENI: Doing this

22:24.843 --> 22:28.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
type of thing is going to help
the unemployment rate in Lagos.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TITUS IGWE, Entrepreneur: My
name is Titus Igwe. TOBIAS IGWE,

22:31.717 --> 22:35.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Entrepreneur: My name is Tobias
Igwe. We are the Igwe twins.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Titus and Tobias
Igwe are also Elumelu

22:38.324 --> 22:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entrepreneurs. Five years ago,
the twins were mopping floors

22:42.394 --> 22:45.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when their father died suddenly.
They taught themselves how to

22:45.331 --> 22:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cook. TOBIAS IGWE: It was a
means of survival. We're doing

22:48.100 --> 22:50.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it because we want to survive,
because there was hunger. Hunger

22:50.669 --> 22:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is imminent. And there's no way
help will come. NICK SCHIFRIN:

22:53.305 --> 22:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, they run Speedmeals
mobile kitchen. Within a year,

22:56.375 --> 23:00.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they hope to cook and cater for
1,000 people a day. MAN: The

23:00.346 --> 23:04.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most important the part of the
part that we love the most, some

23:04.350 --> 23:09.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mouths are hungry. We get to
feed them. NICK SCHIFRIN: On

23:09.321 --> 23:12.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this day, they give away
packaged lunches to prospective

23:12.324 --> 23:15.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clients. And they feed about 100
churchgoers. They are always

23:15.995 --> 23:20.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
smiling and always dreaming.
Elumelu's $10,000 rented this

23:20.332 --> 23:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new office space. MAN: We re
going to have computers in all

23:23.502 --> 23:26.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rooms. MAN: We're going to
the moon with this place. That's

23:26.272 --> 23:28.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exactly what it means. NICK
SCHIFRIN: The twins use their

23:28.707 --> 23:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rags-to-riches story to motivate
and mentor younger

23:31.977 --> 23:34.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entrepreneurs. TOBIAS IGWE: We
intend to use the story to

23:34.647 --> 23:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
encourage and inspire the next
generation. If the twins can

23:37.149 --> 23:40.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually make it in this harsh
economy, in these same bad

23:40.319 --> 23:44.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conditions I find myself, who am
I? What is then my excuse? NICK

23:44.423 --> 23:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCHIFRIN: And that's when the
mentees sound like the mentor.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY ELUMELU: Because your
success is not only success for

23:49.428 --> 23:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you and your family. It's
success for Africa. TOBIAS IGWE:

23:51.997 --> 23:55.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is the only way African
can grow, when young businesses

23:55.768 --> 23:58.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and entrepreneurs begin to
support other entrepreneurs.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then the growth can be a chain
reaction. TONY ELUMELU: If you

24:01.407 --> 24:04.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
succeed in employing 100 people,
1,000 people, you're playing

24:04.443 --> 24:09.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your own part. The fewer level
of poverty, abject poverty, we

24:09.148 --> 24:12.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have, the better for everyone.
NICK SCHIFRIN: But that poverty

24:12.785 --> 24:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is still everywhere. And the
wealth gap here is among the

24:15.354 --> 24:20.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world's largest. In elite
neighborhoods, tuk-tuk taxis

24:20.092 --> 24:22.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weave between mansions, and
share the road with luxury

24:22.895 --> 24:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mercedes SUVs. The rich build
houses that literally look down

24:27.733 --> 24:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the poor, who are getting
poorer. In 1980, the poverty

24:31.403 --> 24:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rate was 27 percent. By 2010, it
was 69 percent, even though the

24:36.675 --> 24:40.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country's wealth has increased
dramatically. Nigeria may be

24:40.245 --> 24:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Africa's richest country, but
here in Lagos alone, there are

24:43.315 --> 24:46.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 100 slums, including
this one. This is known as

24:46.151 --> 24:49.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Makoko, where the houses are
literally built on stilts on the

24:49.888 --> 24:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
water. Across the country, more
than 100 million people don't

24:53.325 --> 24:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have toilets. And only 2 percent
have running water. FELIX MORKA,

24:56.862 --> 25:00.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Activist: So, the people live
below the poverty line, because

25:00.566 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- not because they are less
citizens of this country, not

25:03.936 --> 25:06.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they are less deserving,
but because the government is

25:06.772 --> 25:10.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
failing to provide those
services. NICK SCHIFRIN: Felix

25:10.642 --> 25:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Morka is a community organizer
for Makoko's 200,000 residents.

25:14.613 --> 25:18.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The water here is filthy and
smells of sewage. And yet young

25:18.517 --> 25:21.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
residents learn to swim before
they can walk. FELIX MORKA: When

25:21.854 --> 25:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the government that is supposed
to provide those services is not

25:25.257 --> 25:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
providing those services, then
obviously what you have is a lot

25:28.660 --> 25:31.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of deprivations. There's no
potable water. There's no access

25:31.563 --> 25:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to health care, primary health
care. The schools are completely

25:35.134 --> 25:39.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
private. There's no official
presence in Makoko. NICK

25:39.271 --> 25:41.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCHIFRIN: Morka accuses the
government of rallying around

25:41.673 --> 25:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rich and penalizing the
poor. Three years ago,

25:45.310 --> 25:48.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government-paid thugs tried to
drown Makoko, so it could be

25:48.514 --> 25:51.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
replaced with a fancy boat club.
FELIX MORKA: You see a lot of

25:51.283 --> 25:55.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wood stumps sticking out of
water. This used to be the

25:55.087 --> 26:01.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foundation of a house, one of
the houses that was sliced down

26:01.527 --> 26:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the demolition squad. It was
simply an unleashing of violence

26:06.131 --> 26:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the community. NICK SCHIFRIN:
While the government targeted

26:10.369 --> 26:13.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Makoko, it endorsed what
developers hope becomes Lagos'

26:13.672 --> 26:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Africa's premier address.
DAVID FRAME, South Energyx

26:16.442 --> 26:20.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Limited: Nigeria and
specifically Lagos today is

26:20.479 --> 26:23.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where China was three to four
decades ago. NICK SCHIFRIN:

26:23.715 --> 26:27.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Frame has lived in Nigeria
for 30 years. He hopes Eko

26:27.486 --> 26:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Atlantic City is his legacy.
DAVID FRAME: Eko Atlantic City

26:30.722 --> 26:34.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be that catalyst to
establish Lagos as that

26:35.027 --> 26:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
financial hub for the entire
continent of Africa. NARRATOR:

26:38.363 --> 26:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the heart of this iconic
city, rises the new financial

26:42.000 --> 26:45.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hub of Lagos. DAVID FRAME: Slick
promotional videos envision a

26:45.471 --> 26:48.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city of the future, four square
miles, nearly the same size as

26:48.740 --> 26:52.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Midtown Manhattan, all built on
land reclaimed from the Atlantic

26:52.511 --> 26:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ocean with 140 million tons of
sand. Eko Atlantic is Africa's

26:58.050 --> 27:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
largest construction project.
NICK SCHIFRIN: In 10 years, what

27:01.420 --> 27:04.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is all this going to be? DAVID
FRAME: All the water that you

27:04.790 --> 27:09.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see, from here to the shore,
will be reclaimed. So, this will

27:09.394 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be part of Eko Atlantic. NICK
SCHIFRIN: This is building for

27:12.097 --> 27:16.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rich on the world's poorest
continent; 400,000 people will

27:16.401 --> 27:19.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
live and work here. They have
already sold nearly every plot

27:19.638 --> 27:22.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without any government money.
DAVID FRAME: And our model is,

27:22.641 --> 27:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
live in Eko Atlantic, work in
Eko Atlantic, and enjoy the

27:26.912 --> 27:29.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facilitates in Eko Atlantic.
NICK SCHIFRIN: The most

27:29.615 --> 27:32.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important part of Eko Atlantic,
in fact, the only reason it can

27:32.384 --> 27:36.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exist, are these rocks. They're
called the Great Wall of Lagos.

27:36.522 --> 27:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is what prevents the
Atlantic Ocean from coming in

27:40.225 --> 27:44.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and reclaiming the land. The
wall will be 5.5-miles-long, and

27:44.663 --> 27:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weigh 4.5 million tons. It will
keep Eko Atlantic dry, and keep

27:50.469 --> 27:54.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lagos safe from erosion. DAVID
FRAME: Whatever the ocean can

27:54.573 --> 27:59.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
throw at us, and including the
projected rises in sea level, to

27:59.444 --> 28:03.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the end of the century, this
wall will protect Eko Atlantic.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Eko Atlantic's
chief developer is Gilbert

28:06.318 --> 28:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chagoury. He and his family are
the embodiment of Nigeria's

28:09.488 --> 28:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well-heeled and well-connected.
He holds an honorary

28:12.624 --> 28:15.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ambassadorship. And he donated
more than a million dollars to

28:15.827 --> 28:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Clinton Foundation. Two
years ago, Clinton and Nigeria's

28:19.398 --> 28:22.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
most senior politicians
christened the new city. BILL

28:22.568 --> 28:24.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON, Former President of the
United States: They have

28:24.570 --> 28:27.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reclaimed five million square
meters of land from the sea.

28:27.906 --> 28:32.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is something, I'm telling
you, there will be countless

28:32.544 --> 28:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
numbers of people coming here to
study. NICK SCHIFRIN: The

28:37.282 --> 28:40.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
construction is not without
controversy. Before Eko Atlantic

28:40.552 --> 28:43.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be built, the government
evicted residents who used to

28:43.522 --> 28:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
live on the beach. Frame says
the neighborhood is better for

28:46.658 --> 28:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. DAVID FRAME: The police
would attribute a lot of the

28:49.361 --> 28:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crime that was going on in the
area to people living in those

28:54.499 --> 28:59.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
camps. So, it was very necessary
to move them out. NICK SCHIFRIN:

28:59.905 --> 29:02.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But Morka, and those who
advocate for the poor, believe

29:02.975 --> 29:06.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nigeria's priority should be
building equity, not new cities.

29:06.545 --> 29:10.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FELIX MORKA: Your need effective
balance. You must ensure that

29:10.716 --> 29:14.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whatever policy that drives Eko
Atlantic City drives even

29:14.152 --> 29:16.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
further for the millions of
people who are left behind.

29:16.688 --> 29:20.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Unless that is done, it becomes
a very skewed development policy

29:20.626 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that advances the interests of a
few, to the detriment of the

29:23.929 --> 29:27.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
majority. NICK SCHIFRIN: In 35
years, there will be more

29:27.199 --> 29:31.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nigerians than Americans. For so
many here, there's so much

29:31.203 --> 29:35.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
promise and so much pain.
Building the economy and

29:35.641 --> 29:40.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bridging the wealth gap could
change the city, the country,

29:40.345 --> 29:44.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the continent. Nick

Nigeria. JUDY WOODRUFF: Tune in
tomorrow night for the next

29:47.486 --> 29:51.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story in our "Nigeria: Pain and
Promise" series about the

29:51.323 --> 29:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nation's crippling corruption.
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us. Coming

30:07.539 --> 30:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up on the "NewsHour": how an
author and Marine explains war

30:11.476 --> 30:16.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to those he loves; and what is a
cow's carbon footprint, how

30:16.481 --> 30:20.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cattle are impacting climate
change. Now we return to

30:20.786 --> 30:24.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chicago, where Mayor Rahm
Emanuel fired his longtime

30:24.356 --> 30:27.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police superintendent, Garry
McCarthy, earlier today. The

30:27.993 --> 30:32.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
move comes exactly a week after
the city released this dash-cam

30:32.130 --> 30:35.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
video showing officer Jason Van
Dyke fatally shooting

30:35.967 --> 30:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
17-year-old Laquan McDonald. He
fired at the teen 16 times. Only

30:41.873 --> 30:44.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now, more than one year after
the shooting, has Van Dyke been

30:44.976 --> 30:48.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charged with first-degree
murder. The video sparked

30:48.180 --> 30:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outrage and protests across the
city and calls for a shakeup

30:51.783 --> 30:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
within the police department.
Before the mayor's announcement

30:54.820 --> 30:57.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this morning, The Chicago
Sun-Times called on its front

30:57.689 --> 31:02.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
page for McCarthy's ouster.
Paris Schutz of WTTW Chicago has

31:02.527 --> 31:05.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been covering the fallout and he
attended today's press

31:05.230 --> 31:09.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conference. Welcome, Paris. So,
I have to ask you the first

31:09.501 --> 31:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obvious question. What did Garry
McCarthy know, and when did he

31:13.371 --> 31:17.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know it? PARIS SCHUTZ, WTTW:
Well, Garry McCarthy had seen

31:17.909 --> 31:20.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the video before the rest of the
public had seen the video. It's

31:20.645 --> 31:26.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questionable what he knows
overall about the case. The

31:26.485 --> 31:31.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reason for his firing was
because public outcry had gotten

31:31.189 --> 31:35.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so heated, not only from
protesters, but from, as you

31:35.894 --> 31:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said, The Sun-Times and from
African-American aldermen who

31:39.664 --> 31:42.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were about to take a vote of no
confidence in McCarthy. Now,

31:42.901 --> 31:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
McCarthy says his hands were
tied, that he had removed Van

31:46.371 --> 31:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dyke once he had seen this
video, but because of union

31:49.541 --> 31:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contracts with the Fraternal
Order of Police, he couldn't

31:52.711 --> 31:57.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually fire McCarthy from his
job. But, today, McCarthy is the

31:57.249 --> 31:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fall person, and he's out of his
job. GWEN IFILL: So, as far as

31:59.851 --> 32:01.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we know, there wasn't
necessarily wrongdoing, but it

32:01.853 --> 32:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was the optics of the situation.
I mean, just this morning, Garry

32:05.290 --> 32:07.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
McCarthy was on morning
television in Chicago. He seemed

32:07.692 --> 32:11.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be secure in his job. PARIS
SCHUTZ: He was. And even last

32:11.563 --> 32:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
night, I had asked the mayor's
office whether they are going to

32:14.166 --> 32:16.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
announce the firing of McCarthy,
and they said, no, they are

32:16.835 --> 32:20.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to announce the creation
of a new task force. But there

32:20.539 --> 32:22.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were so many questions about not
just the shooting, but the

32:22.541 --> 32:24.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aftermath, why the initial
narrative from that crime scene

32:24.543 --> 32:26.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said that McDonald had been
lunging at police officers and

32:26.545 --> 32:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threatening them, while they
clearly weren't doing that, if

32:28.547 --> 32:30.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you look at the video, and why,
overall, there seems to be this

32:30.549 --> 32:32.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
culture of protecting cops and
not disciplining them. McCarthy

32:32.551 --> 32:34.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had also protected the job of
another cop, Dante Servin, who

32:34.553 --> 32:36.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while he was off duty had shot
an innocent woman. And the

32:36.555 --> 32:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state's attorney, Anita Alvarez,
the Cook County's state

32:46.298 --> 32:51.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attorney, had brought
manslaughter charges against

32:53.805 --> 32:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that cop. The judge acquitted
the cop and said you should have

32:58.944 --> 33:02.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
brought murder charges. McCarthy
defended that job -- and kept

33:02.547 --> 33:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that cop on the job for several
years. So, it's -- this has been

33:06.785 --> 33:09.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fomenting for a long time, and
the McDonald case was sort of

33:09.588 --> 33:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the final straw for many people
in the community. GWEN IFILL:

33:13.058 --> 33:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, there are also questions
about the mayor's political

33:15.794 --> 33:20.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
livelihood at this point. Are
those questions still alive

33:20.732 --> 33:24.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tonight? PARIS SCHUTZ: I think
he's done an effective job

33:24.970 --> 33:28.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tampering down the calls for his
resignation, but clearly this

33:28.840 --> 33:32.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
isn't going to be enough. Now,
there is a lot of anger at the

33:32.777 --> 33:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mayor, because he -- the city
was aware that this video

33:36.514 --> 33:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
existed months and months and
months ago. They settled with

33:39.551 --> 33:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the McDonald family in February
for $5 million because they saw

33:43.655 --> 33:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how bad the video was. But the
mayor's administration fought

33:47.626 --> 33:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back dozens of freedom of
information requests from

33:50.729 --> 33:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reporters and the public to get
that video out. They said it was

33:54.699 --> 33:57.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because there was an ongoing
federal investigation, state

33:57.769 --> 34:00.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigation into this officer,
and releasing that video would

34:01.006 --> 34:05.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compromise those investigations.
But a lot of protesters and

34:05.510 --> 34:08.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
onlookers believed that the
mayor was trying to save his

34:08.780 --> 34:12.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political future. He was in the
midst of a very heated runoff

34:12.050 --> 34:15.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, so there's a lot of
anger at him still, too. GWEN

IFILL: And briefly, also, Paris,
this task force that was formed,

34:18.957 --> 34:21.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're bringing in the former
Massachusetts governor, Chicago

34:21.293 --> 34:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
native Deval Patrick, to run it.
Does anybody have any confidence

34:24.329 --> 34:27.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this task force? PARIS
SCHUTZ: I think the initial

34:28.033 --> 34:32.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reaction to this task force was
incredulity, that this was all

34:32.771 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the mayor was going to do to
respond to this. Remember, the

34:35.307 --> 34:39.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mayor hasn't said anything
public about this case since the

34:39.144 --> 34:43.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
video surfaced a week ago. I
think what most people want,

34:43.181 --> 34:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lawyers, editorial boards, is an
independent federal

34:46.184 --> 34:49.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigation into the police
department. Why is it that so

34:49.921 --> 34:53.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
few officers are disciplined?
Only 3 percent of officers that

34:53.992 --> 34:57.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have complaints against them end
up getting disciplined. And I

34:57.562 --> 35:00.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't think at this point the
public really trusts the

35:00.632 --> 35:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
independence of oversight until
it comes from someone like the

35:05.503 --> 35:08.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feds. GWEN IFILL: Paris Schutz

35:36.034 --> 35:40.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. steps ups its military role
in Iraq and Syria, we hear from

35:40.672 --> 35:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Phil Klay, who served as a
Marine in Iraq and is the author

35:46.077 --> 35:49.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of "Redeployment," a collection
of short stories. It won the

35:49.681 --> 35:53.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Book Award for Fiction
in 2014. PHIL KLAY, Author,

35:53.284 --> 35:56.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Redeployment": In January 2007,
I arrived at a base on the banks

35:56.521 --> 36:00.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Lake Habbaniyah in Iraq's
Anbar province. At the time,

36:00.091 --> 36:03.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anbar was the lost province, the
heart of the Sunni insurgency.

36:03.895 --> 36:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a tremendously violent
place. In one of those early

36:07.365 --> 36:09.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
months, I set up a video
teleconference call between some

36:09.968 --> 36:13.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soldiers and their families back
home. These soldiers were at the

36:13.238 --> 36:16.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
end of a 16-month deployment. It
was only supposed to have been

36:16.975 --> 36:20.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
12 months, but they'd been
extended, so a year to the day

36:20.145 --> 36:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after they arrived, they were
still patrolling the banks of

36:22.414 --> 36:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lake Habbaniyah. And it was on
one of those patrols that they

36:25.116 --> 36:29.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lost two soldiers to an IED.
They recovered the bodies,

36:29.821 --> 36:32.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mourned their dead, and kept
patrolling through a desert that

36:32.190 --> 36:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seemed full of violence and
devoid of hope. Before they got

36:36.027 --> 36:39.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on air, a discussion broke out
about what exactly they should

36:39.564 --> 36:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tell their families. They
couldn't tell the truth about

36:42.133 --> 36:45.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how they felt. Their families
were worried enough. Instead,

36:45.303 --> 36:48.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they'd tell them proud,
uplifting things. "We can tell

36:48.540 --> 36:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them the truth when we get
home," one of the soldiers said.

36:51.276 --> 36:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was quiet a moment, and then
another asked, "Will we even

36:55.113 --> 36:59.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tell them the truth then?" Not
long after, that unit returned

36:59.217 --> 37:01.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
home and another took their
place doing the same mission,

37:01.986 --> 37:05.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
patrolling the same banks of
same Lake Habbaniyah, except

37:05.690 --> 37:09.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they didn't come into Anbar, the
lost province. They came into

37:09.928 --> 37:12.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Anbar awakening, right in
the middle of the surge. Instead

37:13.031 --> 37:16.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of 16 months of a seemingly
endless grind of pointless

37:16.067 --> 37:19.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence, they spent seven
months watching insurgent

37:19.304 --> 37:22.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks plummet, markets open
up, and local police forces

37:22.774 --> 37:26.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
swell. When they came home, they
probably knew exactly what to

37:26.344 --> 37:31.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tell their families: We're
winning. Well, it didn't last.

37:31.649 --> 37:34.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We Americans tried to wash our
hands of Iraq, pulling out, not

37:34.385 --> 37:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interfering after the 2010
elections, only to watch the

37:37.388 --> 37:39.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unraveling of the fragile
stability that had been

37:39.924 --> 37:43.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
achieved. Operation Iraqi
Freedom may have ended, but

37:43.394 --> 37:46.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Operation Inherent Resolve, our
current military effort

37:46.164 --> 37:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overseas, continues on. I wonder
what the situation looks like to

37:50.468 --> 37:53.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
troops in Iraq right now. I
wonder what they're telling

37:53.404 --> 37:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their families. And I wonder,
what do I say to my family now?

37:58.276 --> 38:03.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What, when my son is old enough,
do I tell him about my war? I

38:03.581 --> 38:07.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
volunteered, after all. All of
us did. That's how we wage war

38:07.819 --> 38:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now. A fraction serves, and a
majority decides in hindsight

38:12.123 --> 38:15.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which politician to blame it on.
Most of us joined with the hope

38:15.627 --> 38:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of making a positive difference
in the world. Few of us, I

38:18.429 --> 38:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think, got exactly what we asked
for. Whatever we were thinking,

38:22.300 --> 38:25.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of joining the military is
about risking yourself for a

38:25.236 --> 38:28.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
higher purpose. You don't get to
decide the broad course of

38:28.406 --> 38:33.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
history, only your role within
it. I wish I could evade

38:33.144 --> 38:36.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
responsibility for all that's
gone wrong in Iraq and only

38:36.181 --> 38:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think about the sacrifices of
those I served with, the heroic

38:39.817 --> 38:43.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
efforts, the courage of the
Iraqis I met, the lives of both

38:43.087 --> 38:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iraqis and Americans saved by
the medical staff at my base. I

38:47.192 --> 38:50.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wish I could only think about my
deployment and how it ended,

38:50.562 --> 38:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
full of hope. But I can't. I'm
an American citizen,

38:54.799 --> 38:57.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
responsible, just like every
other citizen, for every part of

38:57.569 --> 39:01.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the war, not just how I felt
about the end of my part. In a

39:01.472 --> 39:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
democracy, everyone shares
responsibility. Troops don't

39:04.909 --> 39:09.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issue themselves orders. War is
paid for by our tax dollars and

39:09.647 --> 39:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ordered by politicians we as a
people need to hold accountable.

39:13.351 --> 39:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I guess this is what I will
tell my son. I will tell him

39:18.723 --> 39:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's my job now and until I die
to be an informed citizen. I

39:23.194 --> 39:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will tell him about joining
institutions, government or

39:25.997 --> 39:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
otherwise, that are working for
a better world. I will tell him

39:29.133 --> 39:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about failure. And I will tell
him about the necessity of

39:33.638 --> 39:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attempting to change the world
and the necessity of facing the

39:37.208 --> 39:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consequences when you try. JUDY

39:55.493 --> 39:58.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

your support, which helps keep

agree on a plan to reduce

40:11.509 --> 40:14.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turns out one culprit can be
found in our food supply. The

United Nations says 14 percent
of manmade greenhouse gas

40:19.150 --> 40:22.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emissions come from raising
livestock, including the fuel

40:22.687 --> 40:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and fertilizer it takes to grow
feed and the waste animals

40:26.324 --> 40:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
create themselves. But not all
carbon footprints are created

40:29.994 --> 40:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
equal. Eight percent of all

40:52.583 --> 40:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Feedlot, where they're serving
up hay and corn to 4,000 hungry

40:57.121 --> 41:00.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cattle. JOAN RUSKAMP, J&amp;S
Feedlot: There's an exact amount

41:00.525 --> 41:04.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of pounds that each pen will
receive. Younger cattle that are

41:04.228 --> 41:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
growing have more hay and less
corn. Cattle that are finishing

41:08.966 --> 41:11.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and putting on more muscle are
getting more corn and less hay.

41:11.436 --> 41:14.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GRANT GERLOCK: In only six
months' time, they can pile on

41:14.706 --> 41:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around 1,000 pounds of meat.
Joan Ruskamp says the secret is

41:19.510 --> 41:21.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their stomach. JOAN RUSKAMP: So
they're eating all these things

41:21.846 --> 41:24.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't want to eat and they're
giving me a great burger, a

41:24.515 --> 41:27.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
great steak, a great roast to
eat in the end. GRANT GERLOCK:

41:27.085 --> 41:30.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the same cow stomach that
turns corn into meat also has a

41:30.521 --> 41:34.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
troubling side effect. As they
eat corn or grass, cattle

41:34.058 --> 41:37.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regurgitate methane, a
greenhouse gas many times more

41:37.729 --> 41:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
powerful than carbon dioxide. In
fact, when it comes to global

41:41.966 --> 41:45.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
greenhouse gas emissions, cattle
are one of the worst offenders.

41:45.636 --> 41:47.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
THOMAS HERTEL, Purdue
University: If you look globally

41:47.638 --> 41:50.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you just compare every
sector, I'm talking electric

41:50.375 --> 41:55.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
utilities, steel, automobiles,
beef, globally, beef is at the

41:55.246 --> 41:59.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
top, OK, the highest emissions
per dollar of output, higher

41:59.250 --> 42:01.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than electric utilities
globally. GRANT GERLOCK: The

42:01.419 --> 42:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cattle industry is trying to get
a grip on how to reduce that

42:04.455 --> 42:08.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
footprint. Kim Stackhouse-Lawson
is the sustainability director

42:08.326 --> 42:10.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the National Cattlemen's
Beef Association. KIM

42:10.795 --> 42:12.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STACKHOUSE-LAWSON, National
Cattlemen's Beef Association:

42:12.797 --> 42:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seventy percent of beef's carbon
footprint actually happens on

42:14.799 --> 42:18.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ranch at the cow/calf level.
GRANT GERLOCK: Stackhouse-Lawson

42:18.169 --> 42:21.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
says, in a way, the U.S.
actually has a head-start over

42:21.339 --> 42:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rest of the world when it
comes to controlling the carbon

42:24.442 --> 42:28.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
footprint of cattle, and that's
because U.S. feedlots are the

42:28.079 --> 42:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most efficient at turning pounds
of feed into pounds of beef. KIM

42:32.383 --> 42:34.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STACKHOUSE-LAWSON: Cattle have
gotten bigger. That's from

42:34.952 --> 42:38.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
genetic improvements, so we have
been very focused on maximizing

42:38.856 --> 42:43.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resource use. GRANT GERLOCK: Go
back 50 years to 1965. At that

42:43.361 --> 42:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, a steer went to slaughter
weighing right about 1,000

42:46.297 --> 42:50.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pounds. Today, with better beef
genetics and nutrition, that

42:50.034 --> 42:55.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same animal weighs over 1,300
pounds. With fewer cattle, the

42:55.173 --> 42:59.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. still produces 30 percent
more beef. If the rest of the

42:59.444 --> 43:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world was as efficient as the
United States, it would go a

43:02.313 --> 43:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
long way in cutting global
emissions from beef. But not

43:06.317 --> 43:10.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
every country can grow feed like
the Midwest. And some believe

43:10.121 --> 43:13.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the current system relies too
much on fields of coy and

43:13.090 --> 43:18.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
soybeans that add to the
environmental cost.. They want

43:18.429 --> 43:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to move beef away from feedlots
and row crops. DEL FICKE,

43:21.999 --> 43:25.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Rancher: We're rewriting
history. We want to change the

43:25.369 --> 43:30.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way things are done. And we want
to do it with a group of cattle

43:30.975 --> 43:35.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that fit with our nature
situation and for a lot of other

43:35.446 --> 43:39.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people's. Come on. Let's go,
girls. GRANT GERLOCK: Del Ficke

43:39.784 --> 43:42.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
raises cattle in Southeastern
Nebraska. They never go to a

43:42.954 --> 43:46.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feedlot. Instead, they start and
finish their lives feeding on

43:46.557 --> 43:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pasture designed to grow on
grass, not grain. DEL FICKE:

43:50.261 --> 43:54.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're engineered to do
everything on forage like cows

43:54.131 --> 43:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were intended. GRANT GERLOCK:
The switch to grass-fed beef was

43:57.201 --> 44:00.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a huge change for Ficke. Until a
couple years ago, he farmed

44:00.605 --> 44:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
7,000 acres of corn and soybeans
and fed cattle in a conventional

44:04.742 --> 44:10.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feedlot. Now he's down to around
500 acres, nearly all grass. DEL

44:10.248 --> 44:15.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FICKE: You can have more cows,
more pounds and do it in a way

44:15.586 --> 44:18.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that is better for the
environment if you use the right

44:18.890 --> 44:22.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
genetics. GRANT GERLOCK: Ficke
says keeping cattle on grass

44:22.827 --> 44:25.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
takes crops like corn and
soybeans out of the picture,

44:25.763 --> 44:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
along with the fuel and
fertilizer needed to grow them.

44:28.699 --> 44:32.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That cuts carbon emissions.
Also, planting prairie where

44:32.637 --> 44:36.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crops used to be pulls excess
carbon out of the air and stores

44:36.507 --> 44:41.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it in the soil. DEL FICKE: This
was all cropland. And this would

44:41.245 --> 44:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be highly erodible land. GRANT
GERLOCK: Its true grass-fed

44:46.050 --> 44:49.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cattle do a lot to save carbon.
But strictly in terms of

44:49.387 --> 44:52.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
greenhouse emissions, they're
still at a disadvantage. Kim

44:53.024 --> 44:56.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stackhouse-Lawson says it's
because of efficiency. At the

44:56.460 --> 44:59.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feedlot, she says a calf is
ready for slaughter by the time

44:59.430 --> 45:01.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's 18 months old. KIM
STACKHOUSE-LAWSON: If we were

45:01.432 --> 45:05.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grass-finishing an animal, they
might be anywhere from you know

45:05.937 --> 45:09.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2 to 2.5 years old before they
reach the same finished end

45:09.140 --> 45:11.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point. GRANT GERLOCK: Since
grass-fed cattle have more time

45:11.909 --> 45:15.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before slaughter, they typically
have a larger footprint. But

45:15.346 --> 45:18.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stackhouse-Lawson says, at the
same time, keeping cattle on

45:18.783 --> 45:22.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pasture provides benefits for
wildlife habitat and water. KIM

45:22.853 --> 45:25.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STACKHOUSE-LAWSON: A
grass-finish system might have a

45:25.256 --> 45:29.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
smaller water footprint,
because, oftentimes, irrigation

45:29.126 --> 45:33.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is used to water crops. So, it's
a tradeoff, and it's about

45:33.564 --> 45:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
balancing those tradeoffs. GRANT
GERLOCK: There are different

45:36.100 --> 45:38.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ways to meet the growing
appetite for beef in the U.S.

45:38.803 --> 45:42.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and abroad, and they each have
something to offer. Feedlots are

45:42.640 --> 45:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
efficient. JOAN RUSKAMP: The
whole reason I'm here doing this

45:45.409 --> 45:48.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is to feed people. GRANT

cow. GRANT GERLOCK: But that's

45:51.515 --> 45:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the challenge for the beef
