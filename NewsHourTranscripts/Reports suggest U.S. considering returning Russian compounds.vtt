JUDY WOODRUFF: As we
reported earlier, Russian
President Vladimir Putin
seemed to hint today

00:05.366 --> 00:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Russian involvement
in hacking during last
year's presidential
campaign, not by government

00:12.066 --> 00:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agents, but by what he
called patriotically-minded
individuals.

00:14.833 --> 00:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meantime, the fallout
from the Trump campaign's
alleged contacts with
Russia, and the ongoing

00:21.600 --> 00:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tensions between Washington
and Moscow, continue
on several fronts.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has more.

00:27.300 --> 00:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Late last
year, in response to the
Russian campaign meddling,
the Obama administration

00:33.033 --> 00:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expelled 35 suspected Russian
intelligence operatives from
the United States, and seized

00:38.200 --> 00:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two long-held Russian diplomatic
compounds, one on the Eastern
Shore of Maryland, the

00:42.866 --> 00:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other on the North
Shore of Long Island.

00:45.166 --> 00:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today, the Washington
Post reports that the
Trump White House is now
considering returning

00:49.866 --> 00:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those properties, which
are widely considered
intelligence-gathering hubs.

00:56.866 --> 00:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's more, Politico reports
that alleged Russian spies
have been turning up in odd

00:59.433 --> 01:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
places around the United States,
often near parts of the nation's
critical telecommunications

01:05.366 --> 01:07.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
network.

01:07.866 --> 01:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one part of what U.S.
intelligence officials
see as intensifying
Russian espionage and

01:13.000 --> 01:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
counterespionage measures
both here and in Russia.

01:15.800 --> 01:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With me now for more on these
stories are Karen DeYoung of
The Washington Post and Ali

01:21.533 --> 01:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Watkins of Politico.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks to you both.

01:24.333 --> 01:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These two stories are
different enough, I want to
handle them one at a time.

01:27.233 --> 01:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, apologies to you, Ali.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I want the turn first
to Karen DeYoung.

01:30.866 --> 01:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Karen, walk us through
how this is coming about.

01:34.433 --> 01:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Obama administration took
away these compounds to punish
the Russians, and now the Trump

01:40.633 --> 01:42.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
White House is talking
about giving them back?

01:42.766 --> 01:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN DEYOUNG, The Washington
Post: Well, they were not --
although the Russians charged

01:45.100 --> 01:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they were expropriated,
they're still the property
of the Russian government.

01:49.633 --> 01:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the Americans did in the
Obama administration was to ban
the Russians from having access

01:55.566 --> 01:57.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

01:57.633 --> 01:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They told them they all had
to leave in 24 hours, and
they couldn't come back.

01:59.900 --> 02:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the FBI and other
agencies went in and proved
to their own satisfaction that

02:04.866 --> 02:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they thought was happening
there was actually happening.

02:08.200 --> 02:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump administration in
a meeting with - - between
Secretary Tillerson, Secretary

02:15.100 --> 02:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of State Tillerson and the
Russian foreign minister, Sergei
Lavrov, last month said that

02:21.800 --> 02:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they would drop what had been
a linkage between the two, what
the Trump administration had

02:28.366 --> 02:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said was linkage between letting
the Russians go back into
the buildings and have access

02:34.266 --> 02:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to them again and the Russians
giving up a situation that
had been going on for several

02:41.233 --> 02:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years in St. Petersburg,
where, in response to previous
U.S. sanctions against Russia

02:46.566 --> 02:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over Ukraine, the Russians had
refused to allow the Americans
to build a new consulate

02:52.266 --> 02:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in St. Petersburg.

02:54.333 --> 02:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the administration
had said, well, let's -- you
give us our consulate, and we

02:58.766 --> 03:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will give you back
your building.

03:00.400 --> 03:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Russians said, no, you're
in the wrong and we're not.

03:04.600 --> 03:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This was an illegal
expropriation.

03:07.733 --> 03:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a couple days later, when
Foreign Minister Lavrov was
here, the Americans said, OK, we

03:12.733 --> 03:14.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
won't link them anymore.

03:14.866 --> 03:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And since then, the Americans
have been working on specific
proposals to give the Russians

03:21.133 --> 03:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the conditions under
which they will give them back.

03:24.466 --> 03:29.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Russians said today
in Moscow that -- that
Tillerson had told them
that they would send

03:32.033 --> 03:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them specific proposals, but
they haven't gotten anything
yet, but they're still confident

03:36.066 --> 03:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they're going to
get their compounds back.

03:39.900 --> 03:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Ali, talking
about sort of Russian
activities, let's turn to you.

03:44.366 --> 03:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your reporting found
that U.S. intelligence
officials were finding
Russian diplomats turning

03:51.100 --> 03:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up in odd places around
the country, right?

03:53.066 --> 03:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALI WATKINS, Politico: This
has been kind of a growing
concern of what my understanding

03:59.866 --> 04:03.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is the FBI over the
last year-and-a-half
of Russian diplomats
within the U.S. who are

04:04.533 --> 04:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supposed to follow pretty
stringent travel rules.

04:06.533 --> 04:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're supposed to notify
the State Department when they
travel anywhere outside of their

04:09.500 --> 04:11.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
posting.

04:11.566 --> 04:15.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Russian diplomats
effectively disregarding
those travel rules and
turning up in places

04:15.433 --> 04:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they shouldn't have been
or that they never told the
State Department they were

04:18.400 --> 04:19.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going.

04:19.833 --> 04:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And what do
they think they were up to?

04:20.633 --> 04:22.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALI WATKINS: Yes.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As U.S. intelligence officials
started kind of looking at
where these guys were turning

04:25.333 --> 04:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, they would turn up
over where a fiber-optics
cable ran underground, or
these strange locations

04:31.933 --> 04:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that when, taken as a whole, it
was -- became clear that they
were on some kind of mission

04:37.533 --> 04:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to kind of map the
infrastructure.

04:39.833 --> 04:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The intel part went to this
infrastructure mapping of
some of the telecommunications

04:44.233 --> 04:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
networks in the country.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: And was this
-- is this a change
from previous behavior?

04:48.966 --> 04:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does it seem like the Russians
are emboldened somehow?

04:51.766 --> 04:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALI WATKINS: You know, there
is an element of this that's
kind of par for the course.

04:56.066 --> 04:58.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is natural
intelligence gathering.

04:58.133 --> 05:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The whole art of espionage
is trying to do things that a
host country doesn't want you

05:02.433 --> 05:04.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

05:04.533 --> 05:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what's different about this
is that there's been kind of a
burgeoning debate, particularly

05:07.833 --> 05:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the last year with this
election operation, of the U.S.,
particularly under the Obama

05:14.733 --> 05:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration, being unwilling
to fight back on this, and
not cracking down as much as

05:20.000 --> 05:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they could, when they know that
these Russian diplomats who are
presumed intelligence operatives

05:25.800 --> 05:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are doing these things, brazenly
disregarding these rules that
they're supposed to follow.

05:29.166 --> 05:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ali and Karen, let
me ask you both - - and I will
start with you, Ali -- earlier

05:36.166 --> 05:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, Vladimir Putin again
denied that the Russian state
was involved in the meddling

05:40.766 --> 05:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the election, but suggested
it could be patriots in Russia.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of
that statement, Ali?

05:48.933 --> 05:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALI WATKINS: I mean, there are
some very -- it's a lot of kind
of wordplay going on there,

05:53.333 --> 05:54.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I think.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Putin is not stupid.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He knows what he's saying, in
that Russian intelligence is
fundamentally different from

05:59.400 --> 06:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. intelligence, in that
there are a lot more gray
zones in the world of Russia.

06:03.800 --> 06:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when Putin says this
could have been private
sector patriotic actors,
but we didn't know

06:10.633 --> 06:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anything about it on a state
level, from a U.S. perspective,
that might make sense.

06:13.733 --> 06:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An American intelligence
operation isn't
necessarily set up to use
private sector hackers.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Putin is kind of
exploiting that gray
zone and that disconnect.

06:22.600 --> 06:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's not surprising that he'd
say something like that, but
it no doubt comes with a bit

06:26.566 --> 06:27.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a wink-wink.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Karen, what
do you think of it?

06:29.333 --> 06:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been watching the
Russians for a long time.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you take of that?

06:34.900 --> 06:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN DEYOUNG: Well, I
think that the allegation
has always been that the
Russians worked through

06:40.600 --> 06:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
individuals, non-governmental
individuals, in order to do
this hacking, and that they

06:46.033 --> 06:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were guided by and turned
the information over to
Russian intelligence.

06:52.466 --> 06:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think what Putin is doing
is basically acknowledging that
they did it in a very indirect

06:59.833 --> 07:01.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

07:01.933 --> 07:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's kind of thumbing
his nose at the Americans and
saying, you know, you can't

07:07.733 --> 07:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pin this on us, even though
I think that he's not
really fooling anybody.

07:11.433 --> 07:13.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Very good.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Karen DeYoung, Ali Watkins,
thanks for being with us.

07:15.166 --> 07:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREN DEYOUNG: You're welcome.
