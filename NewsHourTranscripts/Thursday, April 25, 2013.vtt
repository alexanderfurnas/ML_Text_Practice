08:50.699 --> 08:52.372
SOME SORT OF INQUIRY ABOUT

BUT THE FBI'S LINE ON THIS

08:52.374 --> 08:53.980
THAT.
BUT THE FBI'S LINE ON THIS
IS THAT HE WASN'T DOING

08:53.982 --> 08:56.258
BUT THE FBI'S LINE ON THIS
IS THAT HE WASN'T DOING
ANYTHING ILLEGAL, AND THEY

08:56.260 --> 08:57.798
IS THAT HE WASN'T DOING
ANYTHING ILLEGAL, AND THEY
DID AS MUCH INVESTIGATION AS

DID AS MUCH INVESTIGATION AS
THEY COULD AND THEY COULDN'T

FOR THEM TO GO BEYOND JUST
PUTTING HIM ON THIS LIST.

AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I THINK

09:04.534 --> 09:06.374
PUTTING HIM ON THIS LIST.
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I THINK
THERE IS SOME CRITICISM, WHY

THERE IS SOME CRITICISM, WHY
WASN'T HE, FOR EXAMPLE, PUT

ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE

DEFICIT LATER.
THAT'S REALLY A REVERSAL OF
WHAT REPUBLICANS USED TO

37:55.542 --> 37:56.947

38:07.569 --> 38:08.571
GO TO THE LIBRARY BEFORE IT
WAS COMPLETED, I UNDERSTAND,
BEFORE ALL THE EXHI

38:08.573 --> 38:09.610
WAS COMPLETED, I UNDERSTAND,
BEFORE ALL THE EXHI
BUSINESSES WERE THERE.

38:09.612 --> 38:12.056
BEFORE ALL THE EXHI
BUSINESSES WERE THERE.
BUT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE OF

38:12.058 --> 38:14.400
BUSINESSES WERE THERE.
BUT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE OF
THE PORTRAIT OF GEORGE BUSH

38:14.402 --> 38:15.505
BUT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE OF
THE PORTRAIT OF GEORGE BUSH
THAT IT WANTS TO PRESENT TO

38:15.507 --> 38:16.009
THE PORTRAIT OF GEORGE BUSH
THAT IT WANTS TO PRESENT TO
US?

38:16.011 --> 38:18.185
THAT IT WANTS TO PRESENT TO
US?
>> ABSOLUTELY.

38:18.187 --> 38:19.424
US?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AND THE CENTER PIECE, OF

38:19.427 --> 38:21.269
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AND THE CENTER PIECE, OF
COURSE, IS WHAT HE DID TO

38:21.271 --> 38:22.607
AND THE CENTER PIECE, OF

KEEP TERRORISM AT BAY AND
KEEP THE COUNTRY PRETTY
SAFE.

38:24.352 --> 38:25.723
KEEP THE COUNTRY PRETTY
SAFE.
SO THAT'S AT THE CENTRE OF

38:25.725 --> 38:26.761
SAFE.
SO THAT'S AT THE CENTRE OF
IT THEY DO HAVE ONE THING

38:26.764 --> 38:28.738
SO THAT'S AT THE CENTRE OF
IT THEY DO HAVE ONE THING
THAT IS SORT OF AN

38:28.740 --> 38:30.146
IT THEY DO HAVE ONE THING
THAT IS SORT OF AN
INNOVATION, GROWING

38:30.148 --> 38:32.189
THAT IS SORT OF AN
INNOVATION, GROWING
INNOVATION OF SOME OF THESE

38:32.191 --> 38:32.993
INNOVATION, GROWING
INNOVATION OF SOME OF THESE
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARIES WHICH

38:32.994 --> 38:34.533
INNOVATION OF SOME OF THESE
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARIES WHICH

PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARIES WHICH
IS A THEATRE THAT YOU CAN GO
IN AND DEAL WITH SOME OF THE

IN AND DEAL WITH SOME OF THE
DECISIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT
HAD TO MAKE.

38:37.014 --> 38:38.118
DECISIONS THAT THE PRESIDENT
HAD TO MAKE.
IN THIS CASE, PRINCIPLES, DO

38:38.120 --> 38:40.765
HAD TO MAKE.
IN THIS CASE, PRINCIPLES, DO
YOU GO TO WAR AGAINST IRAQ.

38:40.766 --> 38:42.137
IN THIS CASE, PRINCIPLES, DO
YOU GO TO WAR AGAINST IRAQ.
I MEAN THE ARGUMENTS FOR

YOU GO TO WAR AGAINST IRAQ.
I MEAN THE ARGUMENTS FOR
BOTH SIDES.

38:42.810 --> 38:44.851
I MEAN THE ARGUMENTS FOR
BOTH SIDES.
SO THAT DOES HELP, I THINK,

38:44.853 --> 38:45.890
BOTH SIDES.
SO THAT DOES HELP, I THINK,
EDUCATE THE PEOPLE WHO DO

38:45.892 --> 38:46.224
SO THAT DOES HELP, I THINK,
EDUCATE THE PEOPLE WHO DO
COME.

38:46.227 --> 38:47.464
EDUCATE THE PEOPLE WHO DO
COME.
IN BUT I GUESS I WOULD BE A

38:47.466 --> 38:48.972

IN BUT I GUESS I WOULD BE A
LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SIDE

38:48.974 --> 38:50.211
IN BUT I GUESS I WOULD BE A
LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SIDE
THAT GEORGE BUSH'S

38:50.213 --> 38:51.751
LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SIDE
THAT GEORGE BUSH'S
REPUTATION IS MORE FLUID

38:51.753 --> 38:54.064
THAT GEORGE BUSH'S
REPUTATION IS MORE FLUID
BECAUSE AT THIS THINK A

38:54.066 --> 38:55.303
REPUTATION IS MORE FLUID
BECAUSE AT THIS THINK A
PRESIDENT'S REPUTATION

38:55.305 --> 38:56.576
BECAUSE AT THIS THINK A
PRESIDENT'S REPUTATION
DOESN'T REALLY BEGIN TO GEL

38:56.578 --> 38:58.250
PRESIDENT'S REPUTATION
DOESN'T REALLY BEGIN TO GEL
UNTIL ABOUT 40 OR 50 YEARS

38:58.252 --> 38:59.323
DOESN'T REALLY BEGIN TO GEL
UNTIL ABOUT 40 OR 50 YEARS
LATER BECAUSE THAT'S HOW

38:59.325 --> 39:00.697
UNTIL ABOUT 40 OR 50 YEARS
LATER BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
LONG IT REALLY TAKES US TO

39:00.699 --> 39:02.003
LATER BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
LONG IT REALLY TAKES US TO
UNDERSTAND, FOR INSTANCE, IN

39:02.004 --> 39:03.041
LONG IT REALLY TAKES US TO
UNDERSTAND, FOR INSTANCE, IN
THIS CASE WHAT THE MIDDLE

39:03.044 --> 39:04.449
UNDERSTAND, FOR INSTANCE, IN
THIS CASE WHAT THE MIDDLE
EAST LOOKS LIKE, WHAT THE

39:04.451 --> 39:05.488
THIS CASE WHAT THE MIDDLE

THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT WILL
ENABLE TO US SEE THINGS FROM

ENABLE TO US SEE THINGS FROM
THE INSIDE.
SO IN ALMOST EVERY

39:13.328 --> 39:14.699

SO IN ALMOST EVERY
PRESIDENCY IT LOOKS VERY

39:14.701 --> 39:17.043
SO IN ALMOST EVERY
PRESIDENCY IT LOOKS VERY

39:17.045 --> 39:17.648

39:31.585 --> 39:33.493
WHAT THEY'VE DONE AFTER

GEORGE W. BUSH, FOR EXAMPLE,

39:33.495 --> 39:34.933
THEIR PRESIDENCY.
GEORGE W. BUSH, FOR EXAMPLE,

I WAS THINKING TODAY THAT

39:43.678 --> 39:46.055

I WAS THINKING TODAY THAT
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE ONE OF

39:46.057 --> 39:48.265
I WAS THINKING TODAY THAT
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE ONE OF
THESE PRESIDENTS WHO DIDN'T

39:48.267 --> 39:49.740
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE ONE OF
THESE PRESIDENTS WHO DIDN'T
HAVE DURING THE COURSE OF

39:49.742 --> 39:52.151
THESE PRESIDENTS WHO DIDN'T
HAVE DURING THE COURSE OF
THEIR ADMINISTRATION SOME

HAVE DURING THE COURSE OF
THEIR ADMINISTRATION SOME
TERRIBLY DIFFICULT AND OFTEN

THEIR ADMINISTRATION SOME
TERRIBLY DIFFICULT AND OFTEN
VERY OBVIOUS AND

39:55.637 --> 39:56.942
TERRIBLY DIFFICULT AND OFTEN
VERY OBVIOUS AND
DISAPPOINTING REVERSAL THAT

39:56.944 --> 39:58.583
VERY OBVIOUS AND
DISAPPOINTING REVERSAL THAT
THEY HAD TO COME TO TERMS

39:58.585 --> 39:59.488
DISAPPOINTING REVERSAL THAT
THEY HAD TO COME TO TERMS
WITH.

39:59.490 --> 40:01.028

ANOTHER, DAMAGE QUOTE THEIR
LEGACY.

40:03.410 --> 40:05.484
ANOTHER, DAMAGE QUOTE THEIR
LEGACY.
BUT I THINK MICHAEL'S POINT

40:05.485 --> 40:06.824
LEGACY.
BUT I THINK MICHAEL'S POINT
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

40:06.826 --> 40:08.399
BUT I THINK MICHAEL'S POINT
IS VERY IMPORTANT.
WHICH IS YOU KNOW GEORGE

HISTORY.
HE WON'T BE AROUND TO HEAR

THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

40:18.015 --> 40:19.722
WHAT IT IS.
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS

BUT HISTORIANS THEMSELVES

40:33.392 --> 40:34.763
THAT IT IS UNDETERMINED.
BUT HISTORIANS THEMSELVES

BOUNCE FROM THE OPENING OF
HIS LIBRARY.

41:37.474 --> 41:38.846
BOUNCE FROM THE OPENING OF
HIS LIBRARY.
BECAUSE THIS ARRAY OF

41:38.848 --> 41:39.886

AND IN AN ODD WAY THE BEST
THING FOR A PRESIDENT'S
HISTORICAL REPUTATION IS TO

THING FOR A PRESIDENT'S
HISTORICAL REPUTATION IS TO
LEAVE OFFICE UNDER A CLOUD.

41:57.441 --> 41:59.449
HISTORICAL REPUTATION IS TO
LEAVE OFFICE UNDER A CLOUD.
BECAUSE AS MICHAEL AND ELLEN

41:59.451 --> 42:02.497
