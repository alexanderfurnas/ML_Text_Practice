07:32.067 --> 07:33.533
>> WELL, THE REASON FOR TH

07:33.533 --> 07:36.033
STUDY IS I NOTICED IN MY

07:36.033 --> 07:38.700
PRACTICE, ONCE WE DID NOT HAVE

07:38.700 --> 07:39.633
SAMPLES, THAT I WAS WRITING FO

07:39.633 --> 07:42.333
MORE GENERICS AND THE PATIENTS

07:42.333 --> 07:43.567
REFERRED FROM DERMATOLOGISTS

07:43.567 --> 07:45.333
WERE ON MORE EXPENSIVE

07:45.333 --> 07:45.600
MEDICATIONS.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.133
SO WE TRIED TO LOOK AT IT.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.967
IN THE DATA, WE FOUND THAT IT IS

07:50.967 --> 07:52.067
TRUE THAT DERMATOLOGISTS ARE

07:52.067 --> 07:53.533
USING SAMPLES MORE THAN OTHE

07:53.533 --> 07:54.700
SPECIALTIES OVER THE LAST TE

07:54.700 --> 07:54.833
YEARS.

07:54.833 --> 07:56.533
AND A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH

07:56.533 --> 08:04.400
THE USE OF WHAT'S CALLED BRAND

08:04.400 --> 08:06.000
GENERICS, GENERICS UNDER BRAND

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
NAME, VERY EXPENSIVE

08:07.000 --> 08:08.433
>> THE DRUG COMPANIES WOULD SAY,

08:08.433 --> 08:09.900
DON'T THESE FREE SAMPLES HEL

08:09.900 --> 08:11.267
THE POOR WHO MIGHT NOT BE ABLE

08:11.267 --> 08:12.600
TO AFFORD THE MEDICATIONS OR

08:12.600 --> 08:14.467
HELP THEM GET IMMEDIATELY ON THE

08:14.467 --> 08:14.867
DRUG

08:14.867 --> 08:16.600
>> THAT'S WHAT DERMATOLOGIST

08:16.600 --> 08:18.567
AND FITS WILL OFTEN SAY.

08:18.567 --> 08:19.800
BUT THE DATA IS VERY CLEAR

08:19.800 --> 08:20.933
THAT THE POOR PATIENTS ARE NOT

08:20.933 --> 08:23.200
THE ONES WHO USUALLY GET THE

08:23.200 --> 08:23.433
SAMPLES.

08:23.433 --> 08:24.733
WE DIDN'T LOOK AT THAT IN OU

08:24.733 --> 08:26.133
STUDY BUT THAT'S BEEN SHOWN IN

08:26.133 --> 08:27.033
OTHER STUDIES.

08:27.033 --> 08:30.033
>> SO IS THERE A CONNECTIO

08:30.033 --> 08:31.500
BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT

08:31.500 --> 08:33.100
DRUG COMPANIES NOW SPEND

08:33.100 --> 08:35.233
IS THIS BASICALLY OUR FREE

08:35.233 --> 08:37.267
SAMPLES THE MARKETING WRITE-OFF?

08:37.267 --> 08:37.667
>> YES

08:37.667 --> 08:39.733
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A

08:39.733 --> 08:41.933
LEAST OVER $6 BILLION A YEAR

08:41.933 --> 08:43.333
SPENT BY PHARMACEUTICA

08:43.333 --> 08:44.833
COMPANIES IN SAMPLING.

08:44.833 --> 08:46.333
AND SO THAT COST EVENTUALLY HA

08:46.333 --> 08:48.500
TO BE PAID BY SOMEONE.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.067
AND THE PRICE OF THE GENERIC

08:51.067 --> 08:52.567
DRUG MAY BE QUITE A BIT LESS

08:52.567 --> 08:54.400
THAN THE PRICE OF A BRAND NAME

08:54.400 --> 08:56.100
OR BRANDED GENERIC

08:56.100 --> 08:58.167
AND IT'S ONLY THE BRANDE

08:58.167 --> 08:59.467
GENERICS OR THE BRANDED DRUG

08:59.467 --> 09:00.667
THAT ARE SAMPLED

09:00.667 --> 09:02.967
SO THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT THE

09:02.967 --> 09:04.100
DERMATOLOGISTS ARE CHANNELED

09:04.100 --> 09:05.300
INTO WRITING PRESCRIPTIONS FOR

09:05.300 --> 09:07.067
>> AND WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT

09:07.067 --> 09:08.433
THAT THIS IS -- THE SAMPLES AR

09:08.433 --> 09:10.200
ALSO A WAY TO GET THE MOST

09:10.200 --> 09:10.833
RECENT MEDICATIONS INTO TH

09:10.833 --> 09:13.967
HANDS OF DOCTORS

09:13.967 --> 09:15.900
>> SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT THE BEST

09:15.900 --> 09:16.033
THING.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.067
THERE ARE STUDIES WITH

09:18.067 --> 09:19.067
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE THA

09:19.067 --> 09:20.000
SOMETIMES THE RECENT MEDICATIONS

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
ARE NOT STUDIED AS WELL AND TH

09:22.000 --> 09:23.467
RISK OF DEATH OR DYING FROM TH

09:23.467 --> 09:26.100
USE OF SAMPLES CAN BE THERE.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.500
AND DERMATOLOGISTS, WE DON'T SEE

09:27.500 --> 09:29.533
THAT, BUT THE OTHER PROBLEM IS

09:29.533 --> 09:30.667
THAT THE RECENT MEDICATIONS HAVE

09:30.667 --> 09:33.267
NOT BEEN PROVEN BETTER THA

09:33.267 --> 09:35.400
GENERIC IN MOST SITUATIONS

09:35.400 --> 09:38.800
>> SO THE $6.3 BILLION, THOS

09:38.800 --> 09:40.467
ARE COSTS PASSED ON TO THE

09:40.467 --> 09:40.700
CONSUMER

09:40.700 --> 09:42.233
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.567
ONE OF THE FOCUSES OF OUR STUD

09:43.567 --> 09:45.267
WAS FOR THE DERMATOLOGIST TO

09:45.267 --> 09:46.300
REALIZE THAT ALTHOUGH THEY THINK

09:46.300 --> 09:48.333
THEY'RE HELPING THE PATIENTS

09:48.333 --> 09:49.500
THEY ARE REALLY BEIN

09:49.500 --> 09:51.567
MANIPULATED TO WRITE FOR MOR

09:51.567 --> 09:53.267
EXPENSIVE MEDICATIONS WITH N

09:53.267 --> 09:54.367
PROVEN BENEFIT OF THOS

09:54.367 --> 09:55.633
MEDICATIONS OVER THE GENERIC

09:55.633 --> 09:56.067
DRUGS.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.933

BETTER THAN CARRIE UNDERWOOD

13:17.767 --> 13:19.200
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE READING.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.200
LAST YEAR, RESEARCHERS RELEASE

13:21.200 --> 13:22.500
FINDINGS FROM A STUDY ON WHA

13:22.500 --> 13:24.267
THEY CALLED THE NASTY EFFECT

13:24.267 --> 13:25.567
TWO GROUPS OF PEOPLE WERE SHOW

13:25.567 --> 13:28.433
A WEB ARTICLE ABOU

13:28.433 --> 13:28.867
NANOTECHNOLOGY

13:28.867 --> 13:29.800
BASICALLY, TINY MACHINES

13:29.800 --> 13:31.000
IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'D EXPEC

13:31.000 --> 13:32.900
PEOPLE TO FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.767
AT THE END OF ONE VERSION OF THE

13:34.767 --> 13:36.567
ARTICLE, THE RESEARCHERS MADE UP

13:36.567 --> 13:37.700
CIVIL, POLITE COMMENTS

13:37.700 --> 13:39.400
AND AT THE END OF THE OTHER,

13:39.400 --> 13:41.267
ANGRY AND INSULTING COMMENTS

13:41.267 --> 13:43.033
THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THE

13:43.033 --> 13:44.300
GROUP THAT HAD READ THE VERSIO

13:44.300 --> 13:47.000
WITH NEGATIVE COMMENTS CAME AWAY

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
WITH VERY STRONG, POLARIZE

13:49.000 --> 13:50.433
FEELINGS ABOUT NANOTECHNOLOG

13:50.433 --> 13:52.000
AFTER READING IT

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT

13:53.000 --> 13:54.500
THEY KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT IN THE

13:54.500 --> 13:55.167
FIRST PLACE.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.667
SO WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS?

13:56.667 --> 13:58.367
SOME SITES LIKE POPULAR SCIENC

13:58.367 --> 14:00.633
ARE REMOVING COMMENT

14:00.633 --> 14:01.200
ALTOGETHER

14:01.200 --> 14:03.967
OTHERS, LIKE ESPN.COM, ARE ONL

14:03.967 --> 14:05.000
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO COMMENT WIT

14:05.000 --> 14:06.267
THEIR REAL NAMES

14:06.267 --> 14:07.967
THROUGH SITES LIKE FACEBOOK.

14:07.967 --> 14:10.067
THE IDEA IS THAT PEOPLE ARE LESS

14:10.067 --> 14:12.033
LIKELY TO BE RUDE IF THEIR REA

14:12.033 --> 14:13.533
NAME AND PHOTO ARE ATTACHED TO

14:13.533 --> 14:14.567
WHAT THEY SAY.

15:46.567 --> 15:47.933
ANONYMOUS COMMENTING CAN BE AN

THE VATICAN NEXT WEEKEND,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.800
DOUBLE CANONIZATION, WHEN TW

FORMER POPES WILL BE MAD

SAINTS

HERE TO TELL US MORE IS RACHEL

18:11.733 --> 18:14.967
FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.

18:14.967 --> 18:17.833
WE DON'T SEE CANONIZATIONS VER

18:17.833 --> 18:18.700
OFTEN BUT TWO AT A TIME?

18:18.700 --> 18:20.600
>> THIS IS A FIRST

18:20.600 --> 18:21.433
POPE FRANCIS OBVIOUSLY APPROVE

18:21.433 --> 18:22.567
AND WANTED TO PUT INTO EFFEC

18:22.567 --> 18:23.967
AND DID IT AS PART OF HI

18:23.967 --> 18:26.667
BREAKING WITH VATICAN PROTOCOL

18:26.667 --> 18:28.533
AND TRADITION AS HE'S DONE

18:28.533 --> 18:29.500
THROUGHOUT HIS FIRST YEAR IN THE

18:29.500 --> 18:29.800
PAPACY

18:29.800 --> 18:31.433
>> WHO ARE THE TWO POPES

18:31.433 --> 18:32.433
THEY SEEM TO REPRESENT VER

18:32.433 --> 18:34.400
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CHURCH.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.733
>> THERE'S POPE JOHN XXIII WHO

18:36.733 --> 18:40.267
WAS IN OFFICE FROM 1958 TO 1963.

18:40.267 --> 18:42.567
AND HE'S KNOWN FOR MODERNIZING

18:42.567 --> 18:44.000
REFORMS THAT REALLY BROUGHT TH

18:44.000 --> 18:45.500
CHURCH INTO THE NEW CENTURY AN

18:45.500 --> 18:46.900
OUT INTO THE WORLD MORE.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.800
AND HE'S KIND OF A HERO FOR TH

18:48.800 --> 18:50.500
MORE LIBERAL WING OF THE

18:50.500 --> 18:52.333
CATHOLIC CHURCH.

18:52.333 --> 18:54.667
THE OTHER IS POPE JOHN PAUL II

18:54.667 --> 18:57.000
WHO SERVED FROM 1978 TO 2005

18:57.000 --> 18:58.200
WHEN HE DIED

18:58.200 --> 19:00.867
AND HE IS SEEN AS THE KIND O

19:00.867 --> 19:02.633
HERO FOR MOR

19:02.633 --> 19:04.800
CONSERVATIVE-LEANING CATHOLICS

19:04.800 --> 19:07.100
PARTLY BECAUSE HE THOUGHT TH

19:07.100 --> 19:10.467
CHANGES JOHN XXIII PUT INT

19:10.467 --> 19:11.700
EFFECT HAD GONE TOO FAR.

19:11.700 --> 19:13.067
IT WAS KIND OF A COURS

19:13.067 --> 19:14.800
CORRECTION FOR JOHN PAUL II TO

19:14.800 --> 19:15.367
COME IN.

19:15.367 --> 19:16.600
>> WERE THERE POLITICA

19:16.600 --> 19:17.233
CONSIDERATIONS HERE?

19:17.233 --> 19:18.867
IT SEEMS POPE FRANCIS IS

19:18.867 --> 19:19.733
PLEASING BOTH SIDES BY DOING

19:19.733 --> 19:20.000
THIS

19:20.000 --> 19:21.867
>> THAT'S HOW PEOPLE ARE READING

19:21.867 --> 19:23.767
IT, LIKE BALANCING THE TICKET.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.767
THERE'S A LEFT/RIGHT DIVIDE IN

19:25.767 --> 19:27.200
THE CHURCH AND IT IS VERY WIDE

19:27.200 --> 19:28.600
BY BRINGING THESE TWO ME

19:28.600 --> 19:30.767
TOGETHER FOR A CANONIZATION AT

19:30.767 --> 19:31.733
THE SAME TIME, HE'S SAYING A LOT

19:31.733 --> 19:33.200
OF DIFFERENT THINGS.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.467
HE'S SAYING THAT ONE ISN'T -

19:34.467 --> 19:36.433
THEY'RE NOT AT ODDS WITH EAC

19:36.433 --> 19:37.967
OTHER.

19:37.967 --> 19:38.733
THAT THEY'RE MORE ON A CONTINUUM

19:38.733 --> 19:40.167
OF HOW THEY LED THE CHURCH

19:40.167 --> 19:41.467
AND OUGHT THAT THERE'S ROOM FO

19:41.467 --> 19:41.633
EVERYBODY.

19:41.633 --> 19:44.633
THIS IS A BIG MESSAGE OF HIS

19:44.633 --> 19:46.067
PONTIFICATE, THAT HE WANTS ALL

19:46.067 --> 19:47.100
PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT VIEWS TO B

19:47.100 --> 19:48.033
WELCOME IN THE CHURCH.

19:48.033 --> 19:49.767
>> SO BACKING UP JUST A SECOND

19:49.767 --> 19:51.600
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BECOME

19:51.600 --> 19:51.833
SAINT?

19:51.833 --> 19:53.400
>> THERE'S A PROCESS THAT TH

19:53.400 --> 19:55.000
CHURCH GOES THROUGH THAT'S

19:55.000 --> 19:57.633
INCREDIBLY LENGTHY AND VER

19:57.633 --> 19:57.867
INTENSIVE.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.233
IT'S FIRST, SOMEONE LOOK

19:59.233 --> 20:01.133
THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE LIFE

20:01.133 --> 20:02.800
YOUR WRITINGS.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.033
DECIDES WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAD

20:04.033 --> 20:05.333
EXHIBITED HEROIC VIRTUE.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.433
THAT'S THE PHRASE THEY USE

20:06.433 --> 20:07.333
THE POPE APPROVES THAT

20:07.333 --> 20:11.067
THE NEXT STEP IS BEATIFICATION

20:11.067 --> 20:13.300
THAT'S WHEN A MIRACLE IS

20:13.300 --> 20:14.433
ATTRIBUTED TO YOUR INTERSESSION.

20:14.433 --> 20:16.967
FY PRAYED TO POPE JOHN PAUL II

20:16.967 --> 20:18.100
AND WAS CURED OF SOMETHING

20:18.100 --> 20:19.933
THAT'S A MIRACLE THE CHURC

20:19.933 --> 20:22.933
WOULD HAVE TO CERTIFY, THEN YO

20:22.933 --> 20:27.733
BECOME BEATIFIED

20:27.733 --> 20:30.000
THE CANONIZATION, USUALLY IT'S

20:30.000 --> 20:31.533
TWO MIRACLES THAT HAVE TO BE

20:31.533 --> 20:33.500
PROVED, BUT IN THIS CASE POP

20:33.500 --> 20:36.167
JOHN PAUL II HAD TWO MIRACLE

20:36.167 --> 20:37.600
ATTRIBUTED TO HIM AND CERTIFIED.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.867
JOHN XXIII ONLY HAD ONE.

20:39.867 --> 20:40.933
POPE FRANCIS DECIDED TO WAIV

20:40.933 --> 20:42.867
THE SECOND MIRACLE REQUIREMENT

20:42.867 --> 20:46.067
AND IT'S NOT AS UNUSUAL AS YOU'D

20:46.067 --> 20:46.267
THINK.

20:46.267 --> 20:47.633
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN A LOT BU

20:47.633 --> 20:50.000
THERE IS A LOT OF DEBATE WITHI

20:50.000 --> 20:54.733
THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, AMONGST

20:54.733 --> 20:55.633
THEOLOGIANS, WHETHER OR NOT TW

20:55.633 --> 20:56.300
MIRACLES ARE REQUIRED.

20:56.300 --> 20:58.467
>> THERE'S A WEIGHT PERIOD

20:58.467 --> 20:58.867
ISN'T THERE?

20:58.867 --> 21:00.133
ALMOST LIKE THE NBA OR BASEBAL

21:00.133 --> 21:01.867
HALL OF FAME, THERE HAS TO BE

21:01.867 --> 21:03.733
CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS THAT

21:03.733 --> 21:05.200
PASS

21:05.200 --> 21:05.900
POPE JOHN PAUL II, DID THA

21:05.900 --> 21:06.000
PASS

21:06.000 --> 21:08.700
>> RIGHT AFTER HE DIED THERE WAS

21:08.700 --> 21:10.367
THIS INCREDIBLE OUTPOURING O

21:10.367 --> 21:10.800
SUPPORT FOR HIM.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.633
THE CROWDS IN ST. PETER'S SQUARE

21:13.633 --> 21:16.667
CHANTING "SANTO SUBATO," WHICH

21:16.667 --> 21:17.600
MEANS MAKE HIM A SAINT

21:17.600 --> 21:18.167
IMMEDIATELY.

21:18.167 --> 21:20.300
WHEN POPE BENEDICT WAS ELECTED

21:20.300 --> 21:21.867
HE DECIDED TO WAIVE TH

21:21.867 --> 21:23.567
FIVE-YEAR WAITING PERIOD THA

21:23.567 --> 21:24.933
USUALLY IS REQUIRED AFTER

21:24.933 --> 21:26.867
DEATH BEFORE YOU EVEN STAR

21:26.867 --> 21:27.100
LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NO

21:27.100 --> 21:28.167
SOMEONE SHOULD BE ON TRACK T

21:28.167 --> 21:28.967
BECOME A SAINT

21:28.967 --> 21:30.767
>> SO ONE POPE GOT AN EXCEPTIO

21:30.767 --> 21:32.767
FOR THE TWO MIRACLES DOWN TO

21:32.767 --> 21:34.867
ONE, ONE POPE GOT BE A

21:34.867 --> 21:38.067
INTERCEPTION FOR THE WAITING

21:38.067 --> 21:38.467
TIME

21:38.467 --> 21:40.300
WE'RE HEARING WORLD LEADERS,

21:40.300 --> 21:41.133
PRESIDENTS, BUT THIS IS SOMEWHAT

21:41.133 --> 21:42.100
DIFFERENT THAN STANDARD, IT'

21:42.100 --> 21:43.767
NOT A HUGE THREE-DAY AFFAIR LIKE

21:43.767 --> 21:44.500
IT BECOMES

21:44.500 --> 21:45.067
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

21:45.067 --> 21:46.767
THIS IS THE NO FRILLS PAPACY

21:46.767 --> 21:48.900
HE'S MAKING ATE NO FRILLS DA

21:48.900 --> 21:49.233
ONIZATION.

21:49.233 --> 21:52.133
SO IT'S JUST GOING TO BE THE

21:52.133 --> 21:54.200
BASIC CEREMONY ITSELF IN ST.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.067
PETER'S SQUARE

21:56.067 --> 21:57.433
IT'S STILL ENORMOUSLY FESTIV

21:57.433 --> 21:59.133
AND SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE AROUND

21:59.133 --> 22:00.633
THE WORLD COULD BE WATCHING BU

22:00.633 --> 22:02.100
IT WON'T BE THE THREE-DA

22:02.100 --> 22:02.967
EXTRAVAGANZA
