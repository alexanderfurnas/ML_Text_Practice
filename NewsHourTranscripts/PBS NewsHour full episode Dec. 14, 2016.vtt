JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.138 --> 00:06.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.139 --> 00:07.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
President-elect Trump talks jobs
with the

00:10.477 --> 00:15.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation's biggest tech industry
leaders, as
he announces his choice for
secretary of energy.

00:15.582 --> 00:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Wednesday,
we sit down with white
separatist Richard

00:19.820 --> 00:24.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spencer to talk about how he's
energized white
identity politics during this
election.

00:24.491 --> 00:31.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And technology
vs. tradition,
the battle over building an
ambitious telescope

00:31.164 --> 00:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on a sacred Hawaiian mountain.

00:33.066 --> 00:37.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREA GHEZ, Astronomer, UCLA:
There's certainly
an element of native rights
issues, which

00:37.471 --> 00:39.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is far bigger than astronomy.

00:39.439 --> 00:46.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, astronomy, I think, right
now, is certainly
a lightning post for these
bigger issues.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

JUDY WOODRUFF: Short-term
interest rates are
moving up, for the first time in
a year.

01:06.266 --> 01:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Federal Reserve Board's
decision today
affects credit cards, home
equity loans and

01:11.305 --> 01:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
adjustable-rate mortgages.

01:13.507 --> 01:18.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fed policy-makers announced they
have increased
the benchmark rate by a
quarter-point.

01:18.745 --> 01:23.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several big banks followed suit,
raising their
prime lending rates to 3.75
percent.

01:23.684 --> 01:29.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a news conference, Fed Chair
Janet Yellen
said the Central Bank now
expects to raise

01:29.523 --> 01:32.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates three more times next
year, instead
of two.

01:32.759 --> 01:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: Our decision
to raise rates should certainly
be understood

01:39.833 --> 01:48.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as a reflection of the
confidence we have
in the progress the economy has
made and our

01:48.976 --> 01:56.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judgment that that progress will
continue,
and the economy has proven to be
remarkably

01:56.049 --> 01:57.918 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
resilient.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take a
closer look
at the Fed's decision and its
potential effects

02:00.921 --> 02:01.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
later in the program.

02:02.022 --> 02:04.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Silicon Valley
comes to
Manhattan.

02:04.624 --> 02:08.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump received the
biggest names in
the U.S. tech world today, and
praised their

02:08.996 --> 02:10.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
innovation.

02:10.731 --> 02:14.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It came after most of the
digital leaders
invited had backed Hillary
Clinton in the

02:14.034 --> 02:15.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

02:16.536 --> 02:19.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: This is
a truly amazing group of people.

02:19.973 --> 02:24.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Today,
president-elect Trump reached
out to executives from tech
giants like Amazon,

02:24.444 --> 02:25.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Google and Facebook.

02:25.512 --> 02:26.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to be
there for
you.

02:26.580 --> 02:34.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you will call my people, you
will call
me.

02:34.554 --> 02:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't make any difference.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have no formal chain of
command around
here.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: During the campaign,
he had a different
message, scolding the industry
for sending

02:39.860 --> 02:41.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
jobs overseas.

02:41.628 --> 02:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to get
Apple to
start building their damn
computers and things

02:44.598 --> 02:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this country, instead of in
other countries.

02:47.200 --> 02:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Earlier, Mr. Trump
officially said
he wanted Rick Perry to be
energy secretary.

02:52.973 --> 02:57.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was the longest-serving
governor of Texas,
a leading oil and gas producer.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He twice ran for president.

02:59.713 --> 03:05.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During his 2012 bid, Perry
called for eliminating
the Energy Department, but
famously couldn't

03:05.218 --> 03:06.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
name it during a debate.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK PERRY (R), Former Texas
Governor: It's
three agencies of government
that, when I

03:08.822 --> 03:14.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get there, that are gone,
commerce, Education,
and the -- what's the third one
there?

03:15.028 --> 03:15.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's see.

03:16.029 --> 03:16.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: You can't name the
third one?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICK PERRY: I can't.

03:18.965 --> 03:21.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The third one, I can't.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.070 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Oops.

03:23.103 --> 03:27.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Last night, at a
rally in Wisconsin,
the president-elect defended his
choice of

03:27.107 --> 03:31.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ExxonMobil chairman Rex
Tillerson to be secretary
of state.

03:31.678 --> 03:34.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Critics say Tillerson's too
close to Russia.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: A great
diplomat.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A strong man.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A tough man.

03:39.386 --> 03:44.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A man who's already earned an
avalanche of
endorsements and growing praise
from our nation's

03:44.324 --> 03:46.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
top leaders.

03:46.193 --> 03:51.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rex will be a fierce advocate
for America's
interests around the world, and
has the insights

03:51.498 --> 04:01.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and talents necessary to help
reverse years
of foreign policy blunders and
disasters.

04:01.308 --> 04:06.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Of the fourteen
Cabinet-level picks
Mr. Trump has announced since
the election,

04:06.813 --> 04:09.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
10 of them are white men.

04:09.082 --> 04:14.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, the president-elect has
selected three
women of color for top
positions, South Carolina

04:14.921 --> 04:21.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Nikki Haley for U.N.
ambassador,
former Labor Secretary Elaine
Chao to be transportation

04:21.361 --> 04:24.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secretary, and Seema Verma to
oversee Medicare
and Medicaid.

04:24.865 --> 04:30.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lone African-American choice
is housing
secretary-designee Dr. Ben
Carson.

04:30.937 --> 04:36.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet to be announced by Mr.
Trump, his choices
for the secretaries of
agriculture, interior

04:36.109 --> 04:37.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and veterans affairs.

04:37.544 --> 04:40.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:40.313 --> 04:44.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This evening,
the president-elect
announced he's chosen Ronna
McDaniel to chair

04:44.885 --> 04:46.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Republican National
Committee.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's the niece of Mitt Romney,
and currently
chairs the Michigan Republican
Party.

04:50.624 --> 04:54.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
United Nations Human Rights
Commission warned

04:54.294 --> 04:59.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that South Sudan is on the brink
of -- quote
-- "all-out ethnic civil war."

04:59.065 --> 05:04.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The African nation has suffered
years of brutal
fighting, with tens of thousands
killed and

05:04.171 --> 05:06.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than a million people
displaced.

05:06.339 --> 05:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, in Geneva, U.N. officials
reported
widespread atrocities and rapes,
with some

05:12.012 --> 05:13.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
victims as young as 2 years old.

05:13.880 --> 05:17.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMIN SOOKA, Chair, United
Nations Commission
on Human Rights: A U.N. survey
found that

05:17.350 --> 05:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
70 percent of women in the camp
had been raped
since the conflict erupted, the
vast majority

05:23.924 --> 05:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them not by unarmed, unknown
men, but by
police or soldiers.

05:29.496 --> 05:36.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a staggering 78 percent of
them had been
forced to watch someone else
being sexually

05:36.970 --> 05:38.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violated.

05:38.738 --> 05:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The commission
chief urged
immediate deployment of another
4,000 U.N.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
peacekeepers to South Sudan.

05:45.111 --> 05:49.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Syria,
there's word that
a truce is back on in Aleppo,
after it failed

05:49.916 --> 05:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to take effect this morning.

05:51.351 --> 05:56.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, there was a long day of
recriminations
and fierce new attacks.

05:56.823 --> 06:03.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From early morning on, gunfire
and shelling
blasted Eastern Aleppo.

06:03.997 --> 06:11.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The cease-fire brokered
yesterday by Russia
and Turkey was supposed to allow
rebels and

06:11.404 --> 06:14.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
civilians safe passage to
Northern Syria.

06:14.541 --> 06:19.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first buses even arrived to
ferry them
away, but they left empty.

06:19.479 --> 06:25.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. officials, rebel groups and
activists
blamed Syria's ally Iran for
imposing new

06:25.852 --> 06:31.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
conditions, including a
simultaneous evacuation
of two villages being shelled by
rebels.

06:31.858 --> 06:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Criminal Assad regime and
the Iranians
have broke the cease-fire, and
they are back

06:41.101 --> 06:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to attack the civilians and
continue the genocide.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Ankara,
Turkish President
Recep Tayyip Erdogan faulted
Syrian forces

06:48.174 --> 06:50.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for breaking the cease-fire.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): We were hoping to
evacuate civilians

06:53.046 --> 06:57.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and opposition forces from East
Aleppo, but,
unfortunately, once again,
rockets were fired.

06:57.651 --> 07:01.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Syrian state
TV blamed rebel
shelling.

07:01.054 --> 07:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Bashar al-Assad
rejected any
criticism of his military in a
Russian TV

07:05.925 --> 07:07.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interview.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, President of
Syria (through
translator): It doesn't matter
what they ask.

07:09.462 --> 07:15.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The translation of their
statement is for
Russia: Please, stop the
advancement of the

07:15.735 --> 07:16.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Syrian army against the
terrorists.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is the meaning of their
statement.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Forget about the rest.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You went too far in defeating
the terrorists.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That shouldn't happen.

07:25.578 --> 07:29.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Late today,
the U.N. Human
Rights Office warned the Syrian
government

07:29.416 --> 07:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and its allies have almost
certainly committed
war crimes with the renewed
assault on Aleppo.

07:34.854 --> 07:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei
Lavrov predicted thousands will
be able to

07:39.059 --> 07:41.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leave Eastern Aleppo once it
falls.

07:41.361 --> 07:45.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through
translator): I expect that the
rebels will

07:45.065 --> 07:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cease resistance in the next two
to three
days.

07:48.601 --> 07:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the minority that declines
to do so, it
will be their own choice.

07:52.339 --> 07:55.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And in
Washington, the White
House charged that Russia could
have prevented

07:55.875 --> 07:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all this carnage by enforcing a
truce last
month.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
The Russia couldn't hold up
their end of the

08:02.215 --> 08:03.750 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bargain.

08:03.783 --> 08:07.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know they have got all kinds
of explanations
for why that may be the case.

08:07.721 --> 08:14.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of them are rooted in the
fact that they're
either unable or unwilling to
control their

08:14.928 --> 08:16.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
client government.

08:16.796 --> 08:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tonight came
new statements
from rebels and the pro-Assad
alliance that

08:19.366 --> 08:21.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the latest cease-fire is back
on.

08:21.368 --> 08:25.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say evacuations will begin
tomorrow at
dawn.

08:25.138 --> 08:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This evening, Turkey announced
it will join
Russia and Iran in a summit on
Syria later

08:29.376 --> 08:31.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this month.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, it was
anything but a warm Wednesday
across parts

08:34.447 --> 08:36.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Plains and the Midwest.

08:36.449 --> 08:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arctic air triggered windchill
advisories
for 10 states, from North Dakota
to Ohio.

08:42.589 --> 08:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Commuters in Chicago bundled up
to brave the
colder-than-usual conditions, as
windchills

08:47.861 --> 08:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in that city plunged to minus-15
degrees.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The cold wave is moving
eastward, followed
by snow.

08:54.501 --> 08:58.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's word
of a huge new
data breach at Yahoo.

08:58.204 --> 09:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company now says hackers
stole information
from more than one billion user
accounts back

09:03.510 --> 09:05.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in August of 2013.

09:05.278 --> 09:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's separate from a 2014 breach
at Yahoo
involving 500 million accounts.

09:10.350 --> 09:15.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the rally on
Wall Street
stalled today, as the Federal
Reserve forecast

09:15.321 --> 09:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more rate hikes than expected
next year.

09:17.957 --> 09:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 118
points to close at 19792.

09:24.431 --> 09:28.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 27, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
18.

09:28.468 --> 09:33.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the
Library of Congress
is out with this year's 25
additions to the

09:33.206 --> 09:34.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
National Film Registry.

09:34.974 --> 09:39.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They include the 1980s hits "The
Breakfast
Club," "The Princess Bride," and
"Who Framed

09:39.946 --> 09:41.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Roger Rabbit."

09:41.281 --> 09:44.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also added, Disney's "The Lion
King" and "Thelma
and Louise."

09:44.150 --> 09:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The movies are chosen for
special preservation
based on their cultural,
historic or artistic

09:48.555 --> 09:50.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
importance.

09:50.390 --> 09:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the GOP chief
strategist on Trump's latest
Cabinet picks;

09:55.128 --> 09:59.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reconstructing the Russian hacks
leading up
to the election; a look at the
man behind

09:59.732 --> 10:06.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rise of neo-Nazi ideology;
and much more.

10:06.439 --> 10:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President-elect
Trump has now
named nearly all of his picks to
serve in

10:17.517 --> 10:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his Cabinet, but some are not
without their
controversies.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here to discuss some of those
choices, and
more, is Sean Spicer.

10:24.691 --> 10:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the chief strategist and
communications
director for the Republican
National Committee.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's also an adviser to Mr.
Trump.

10:31.231 --> 10:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sean Spicer, welcome back to the
program.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let me start by...

10:35.435 --> 10:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, Communications
Director, Republican
National Committee: Thanks,
Judy.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me start by asking about the
announcement
today about Governor Rick Perry,
former governor

10:40.106 --> 10:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Texas, as the secretary of
energy.

10:42.242 --> 10:46.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is someone who we know has
had close
ties to the oil industry, is not
considered

10:46.279 --> 10:51.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an expert in nuclear energy,
which is a major
focus of that statement, and who
during a

10:51.784 --> 10:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary debate forgot the name
of the Energy
Department when he was asked
about federal

10:57.123 --> 11:00.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
departments he said he had
wanted to eliminate.

11:00.059 --> 11:01.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why Rick Perry?

11:01.628 --> 11:04.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, you look at
his record
in Texas.

11:04.564 --> 11:09.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's the largest --
longest-serving governor
in Texas, created almost 2.2
million jobs,

11:09.736 --> 11:14.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
largely from finding resources
in Texas that
he could harness to make sure
that people

11:14.974 --> 11:16.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
got employed.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at the number of jobs,
and not just
that, but the number of the
wages that went

11:19.279 --> 11:21.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think when Donald Trump looks
at the energy
sector, he sees that as a place
to really

11:23.116 --> 11:27.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
create wealth for this country
and for individuals,
to put Americans back to work
with good-paying

11:27.320 --> 11:29.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jobs that have benefits.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he looks to Governor Perry
as someone
with a proven track record of
getting that

11:31.524 --> 11:36.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done and as someone who was
elected multiple
times as Texas governor, showed
a tremendous

11:37.030 --> 11:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
amount of support from the
people of Texas.

11:39.866 --> 11:44.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does the
president-elect still
believe, as he said on the
campaign trail,

11:44.370 --> 11:49.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the science behind climate
change is
still not settled, in other
words, something

11:49.542 --> 11:53.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that most climate scientists say
is absolutely
correct?

11:53.680 --> 11:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, I think you
just said it
yourself, most.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's where his
head is at.

11:58.585 --> 12:04.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He understands that there's
elements of man,
mankind that affect climate, but
the exact

12:04.457 --> 12:09.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact of it and what has to be
done to change
that is something there is some
dispute about

12:09.062 --> 12:11.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
within the community, not just
science, but
within the industry.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think, look, the bottom line
is this.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He believes in clean air, clean
water.

12:15.368 --> 12:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He understands the need to
preserve areas
of this country to make sure
that we maintain

12:19.973 --> 12:24.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the splendor and the
environment, but he wants
to do so in a way that ensures
that we don't

12:24.711 --> 12:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hamper economic growth and job
creation.

12:27.013 --> 12:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about another
one of president-elect's
choices, and that's

12:31.250 --> 12:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rex Tillerson to be secretary of
state.

12:33.786 --> 12:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard, yes, a number of
Republican
senators are on board, but
several say they

12:37.924 --> 12:39.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have concerns.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marco Rubio says his concerns
are serious.

12:41.995 --> 12:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John McCain said -- quote -- he
has concerns
about what kind of business we
do "with a

12:47.533 --> 12:51.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
butcher, a murderer, and a
thug," which is
how he describes Vladimir Putin.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you respond to this?

12:53.673 --> 12:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, with all due
respect, Judy,
that's two.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not several.

12:58.244 --> 13:00.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that we're going to
continue to
work with them, and not just
Republicans,

13:00.213 --> 13:01.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
but Democrats.

13:01.414 --> 13:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, I have spent some time
talking to Rex
Tillerson.

13:02.982 --> 13:05.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's an amazing human being.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's an American success story,
not just in
his business life.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's a rags-to-riches success
story.

13:10.356 --> 13:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He stated working at 8, lived in
a one-bedroom
house until the time he went to
college and

13:14.327 --> 13:19.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grew to become the CEO of one of
the world's
largest companies.

13:19.198 --> 13:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He truly is the embodiment of
the American
dream.

13:21.267 --> 13:24.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On a personal level, he is just
an amazing
person.

13:24.103 --> 13:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think when you look at his
track record
it in business, a world-class
businessman

13:28.307 --> 13:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has relationships with over
200 countries
spanning four decades, he's
tough by all accounts.

13:34.347 --> 13:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gets the job done and largely
is unbelievably
successful.

13:38.584 --> 13:42.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what we need, to bring
his business
experience and acumen and
understanding of

13:42.288 --> 13:46.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the geopolitical world that we
are in today
to fight for America and put
America's interests

13:46.292 --> 13:48.027 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
first.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no question, I think, as
more and
more people get to know Rex
Tillerson, they're

13:50.229 --> 13:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be really proud of the
choice that
Donald Trump made as our next
secretary of

13:53.566 --> 13:55.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, another
Russia story
that certainly we're all
following this week,

13:57.637 --> 14:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is the report out of the
intelligence
community, in particular by the
CIA, that

14:02.408 --> 14:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Russian -- that Russian
officials were
behind the attempt, the
cyber-attack against

14:07.380 --> 14:12.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Democratic National
Committee and other
prominent Democrats, and that in
fact it appears

14:12.585 --> 14:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was done in order to tilt the
election
in favor of Mr. Trump.

14:18.091 --> 14:22.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you -- we now have
several senators,
including the Senate majority
leader, Mitch

14:23.029 --> 14:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McConnell, saying there needs to
be a serious
and thorough investigation.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the president-elect prepared
to cooperate
with this investigation wherever
it leads?

14:31.471 --> 14:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, it's not a
question of
cooperate.

14:34.073 --> 14:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they want to have a hearing
-- or excuse
me -- hearing or investigation,
they should.

14:37.310 --> 14:41.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that like, with all
-- I would
like to sort of de-pack that for
a second.

14:41.948 --> 14:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, there's evidence that
suggests that
Russian entities were behind
probing different

14:47.553 --> 14:49.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sites and databases.

14:49.122 --> 14:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is zero evidence that they
had any impact
on the outcome of this election.

14:52.925 --> 14:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump won with 306
electoral votes,
2,300 counties and 62 million
Americans voted

14:57.830 --> 14:59.499 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for him.

14:59.532 --> 15:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's a big difference
between Russia
or other entities trying to hack
a system

15:03.603 --> 15:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or probe a system, as is the
case in a lot
of -- but there was zero
evidence that they

15:09.342 --> 15:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had any impact on the outcome.

15:11.110 --> 15:14.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, prior to the election,
it was the
U.S. government, the Department
of Homeland

15:14.080 --> 15:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security in particular, that was
reassuring
Americans that because our
voting system is

15:17.717 --> 15:21.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
so disparate, and we use
different voting
machines in so many different
precincts, that

15:21.621 --> 15:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is no way that anyone
could have an
impact on the election.

15:24.724 --> 15:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I really find it somewhat
reprehensible
that so many entities on the
left, and, frankly,

15:29.262 --> 15:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some in the media are now trying
to undermine
the legitimacy of this election.

15:32.865 --> 15:36.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact is, prior to the
election, it was
made very clear, by all of them,
that our

15:36.936 --> 15:41.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
electoral system and our voting
systems were
ironclad and that they couldn't
be hack or

15:41.841 --> 15:45.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interrupted, particularly
because of how we
vote as a country in terms of
various precincts

15:46.012 --> 15:49.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and counties throughout the
country that use
different systems that are never
actually

15:49.182 --> 15:50.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attached to it.

15:50.983 --> 15:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to now turn back and attempt
to delegitimize
this election is frankly sad and
pathetic.

15:54.821 --> 15:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, with all
due respect
-- and I do want to ask you
another question

15:58.524 --> 16:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in addition -- it is not just
the media that
is reporting what the CIA...

16:02.995 --> 16:05.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: No, it's the left.

16:05.097 --> 16:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the media
and, again,
Republican senators, including
Mitch McConnell,

16:08.701 --> 16:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are saying there needs to be
an investigation.

16:11.270 --> 16:14.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Sean Spicer, I want to ask
you one another
thing.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A man you know very well, Reince
Priebus,
who has been the chairman of the
Republican

16:18.511 --> 16:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party, now named to be the chief
of staff
under president-elect Trump,
said in an interview

16:24.517 --> 16:28.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today that he thinks there are
going to be
fewer press briefings.

16:28.988 --> 16:29.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
In other words...

16:29.989 --> 16:30.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:30.990 --> 16:31.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: No, that's not what
he said.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Actually, no, no, no.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With all due respect, Judy, not
to keep using
the phrase over and over again,
but he didn't

16:35.795 --> 16:37.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
say that.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was asked by a radio talk
show host if
all of the traditions and
business as usual

16:40.733 --> 16:44.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were going to be kept, and he
threw out a
bunch of suggestions and said,
we need to

16:44.871 --> 16:46.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rethink everything.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he threw out a bunch of
different ideas
and said, you know, we should
rethink some

16:49.208 --> 16:50.176 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of these.

16:50.209 --> 16:52.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do we need to do everything
every day?

16:52.044 --> 16:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does it need to be on camera,
some of the
stuff that, frankly, your own
colleagues and

16:55.514 --> 16:58.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different academic institutions
have questioned
as well.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, please, don't turn that on
us.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We only cited several things
that would be
under consideration.

17:03.089 --> 17:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, a lot of them, the
press has
even been very supportive of.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then final
question.

17:08.895 --> 17:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When will Mr. Trump hold a full
news conference,
so that reporters who cover him
can ask questions?

17:14.967 --> 17:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, he's made
himself available
multiple times to the media.

17:18.771 --> 17:22.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sat down with The New York
Times, 30 or
40 reporters, for an
hour-and-a-half the other

17:22.475 --> 17:23.843 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been down in front of the
pool cameras
several times this week.

17:26.212 --> 17:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think you should expect
full press conference
probably right after the
holidays.

17:30.283 --> 17:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sean Spicer,
adviser to president-elect
Trump, thank you very much.

17:34.620 --> 17:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Thank you very
much, Judy.

17:41.627 --> 17:51.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The recent
reports that
the U.S. intelligence community
believes Russia

17:51.137 --> 17:56.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sought to help Donald Trump win
the election
through the hacking of
Democratic political

17:56.042 --> 17:58.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organizations has rocked the
country.

17:58.444 --> 18:03.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As we just heard,
president-elect Trump dismisses
the idea that Russia was
responsible or that

18:03.182 --> 18:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it wanted him to win the White
House.

18:05.818 --> 18:10.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's New York Times featured
an extensive
timeline of the hacking, and
what it may have

18:10.690 --> 18:12.491 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wrought.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by one of the
reporters who
wrote the story, Eric Lipton,
and by Dmitri

18:15.227 --> 18:17.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Alperovitch.

18:17.263 --> 18:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
He is the co-founder of
CrowdStrike, the
cyber-intelligence
firm that investigated the
hacking of the

18:21.133 --> 18:22.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DNC.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eric Lipton, I want to start
with you.

18:24.036 --> 18:30.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your reporting shows a really
large gap between
when the FBI reached out to the
DNC and when

18:30.743 --> 18:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama or the U.S.
government attributed
that these hacks were by the
Russians.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What caused this?

18:37.616 --> 18:39.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ERIC LIPTON, The New York Times:
That's right.

18:39.218 --> 18:43.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it was September of 2015
that the
FBI first reached out to the DNC
to alert

18:43.055 --> 18:48.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an I.T. contractor who worked
there that there
appeared to be someone operating
within their

18:48.160 --> 18:51.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system, and that operator was
perhaps linked
to Russian hackers.

18:51.931 --> 18:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it wasn't until October of
2016, so more
than a year later, that the
administration

18:58.504 --> 19:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the intelligence agencies
formally issued
a statement attributing that
cyber-attack

19:04.210 --> 19:06.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Russian actors.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so that's quite a long time.

19:08.414 --> 19:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was -- many, many months
passed between
when the FBI first essentially
called the

19:12.718 --> 19:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DNC and the time in which the
DNC in fact
confirmed that the hackers were
present.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That didn't take place until
late April.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So there was quite a delay.

19:21.460 --> 19:24.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that delay occurred at a
time when the
presidential election was
playing out.

19:24.930 --> 19:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the hacked e-mails then
became public
and had an influence on that
process.

19:29.035 --> 19:33.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dmitri
Alperovitch, within
days of your company getting the
contract

19:33.706 --> 19:37.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the DNC, you figured out
who was behind
this.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did you do it?

19:39.445 --> 19:43.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH, Co-Founder
and CEO, CrowdStrike:
Well, the DNC Called us in, in
May of 2016,

19:43.616 --> 19:45.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in May of this year.

19:45.384 --> 19:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They wanted us to check out
these anomalous
activities that they were
starting to see

19:48.754 --> 19:50.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the network.

19:50.589 --> 19:53.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we deployed our technology
called Falcon
on every machine within the
company, within

19:53.559 --> 19:55.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the corporation.

19:55.327 --> 19:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And basically it allowed to us
essentially
see everything that was
happening on every

19:58.764 --> 20:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
server and laptop and desktop at
the Democratic
National Committee.

20:02.001 --> 20:07.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we found is that there
were two actors
independently operating within
that network.

20:07.506 --> 20:10.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the tradecraft that they
were using, the
tools that they were using and
other digital

20:10.976 --> 20:15.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forensics, sort of digital
fingerprints, if
you will, indicators that we
picked up, matched

20:16.015 --> 20:19.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the indicators that we had
previously associated
with these two groups.

20:19.285 --> 20:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are called Fancy Bear and
Cozy Bear,
and that we affiliated with
Russian intelligence

20:23.122 --> 20:24.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agencies.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Eric, as
Dmitri's software
pointed out, this wasn't the
first time that

20:27.560 --> 20:29.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russians had done this.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It just seems to be an
escalation.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC LIPTON: That's right.

20:33.232 --> 20:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, during the Obama and
McCain race,
there was hacking that occurred
there.

20:38.771 --> 20:43.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been quite a
number of federal
agencies that have been attacked
and infiltrated

20:43.843 --> 20:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by some of the same players that
went into
the DNC.

20:46.312 --> 20:51.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, and, in fact, the director
of national
intelligence gave a warning in
2015, saying

20:51.283 --> 20:56.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was already evidence that
there was
-- folks were targeting the
presidential candidates

20:56.088 --> 20:57.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for this year's elections.

20:57.623 --> 21:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there was lot of reasons to
be on the guard
for a possible cyber-attack.

21:02.995 --> 21:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you have to wonder why --
that said,
the Russians, if in fact it was
the Russians

21:08.000 --> 21:13.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and everything suggests that
it was -- are
quite, you know, quite skilled
at infiltrating

21:13.706 --> 21:15.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
systems.

21:15.541 --> 21:21.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you do sort of wonder why
there wasn't
a higher state of alert at the
DNC to detect

21:21.780 --> 21:23.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and stop an incursion.

21:23.482 --> 21:27.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dmitri, is the
standard
operating procedure for the FBI
and how they

21:27.720 --> 21:29.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
warn companies?

21:29.522 --> 21:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seemed, in Eric's report, at
the beginning,
they were dealing with a
low-level I.T. guy

21:32.758 --> 21:38.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who was a subcontractor, and
that person didn't
even believe that it was
actually an FBI call.

21:38.063 --> 21:42.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Well, I
think you have
to appreciate that the FBI does
literally

21:42.768 --> 21:46.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hundreds of notifications like
this on a weekly
basis.

21:46.338 --> 21:50.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of intrusions that
are happening
in our country from a variety of
different

21:50.142 --> 21:53.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation-state adversaries that
the FBI picks
up in the course of their
investigations.

21:53.746 --> 21:57.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So most of the time, they just
don't have
the resources to do more than
try to call

21:57.983 --> 21:59.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and notify a corporation.

21:59.985 --> 22:05.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think in this case, however,
given the high-profile
target, given that this was an
election season,

22:05.391 --> 22:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think more should have been
done.

22:07.226 --> 22:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given the proximity of the DNC
to the FBI
headquarters, just about a mile
away, someone

22:12.965 --> 22:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could have gone to the DNC and
notified them
in person.

22:15.534 --> 22:18.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
Eric, one of the
stories -- you had a separate
piece about

22:18.571 --> 22:22.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this, but one of the things that
got buried
in this while we were all
focused on the DNC

22:22.408 --> 22:26.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hack and perhaps the Podesta
e-mails were
how some of this information
actually made

22:26.111 --> 22:32.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it down into very key House
races, the hack
into the DCCC, the congressional
campaign

22:32.384 --> 22:33.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
committee.

22:33.385 --> 22:35.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC LIPTON: That's right.

22:35.187 --> 22:39.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, at the same time as the
hackers got into
the DNC, they share a building
and actually

22:39.358 --> 22:43.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a connection between the
computer system
of the DNC and the Democratic
Congressional

22:43.662 --> 22:45.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Campaign Committee.

22:45.564 --> 22:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they were able to take
tens of thousands
of pages of documents from the
DCCC, which

22:49.335 --> 22:52.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
oversees the House races by
Democrats.

22:52.037 --> 22:56.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They took these documents and
then they distributed
them to bloggers and reporters
in individual

22:56.442 --> 23:02.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states at key moments, like
right before specific
debates, before primaries, to
try to damage

23:02.381 --> 23:04.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the standing of the Democratic
candidates.

23:04.483 --> 23:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all the documents that went
out were related
to, you know, opposition
research other collections

23:09.755 --> 23:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of documents from the Democrats.

23:12.291 --> 23:15.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those document dumps, you know,
had real consequences
on some Democrats.

23:15.861 --> 23:20.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while the Trump folks
suggest that this
had no impact on the election, I
think, if

23:20.633 --> 23:24.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you look at some of the House
races, in particular
in Florida, there was a
particular House race

23:24.803 --> 23:30.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the party wanted one woman
who was running,
Annette Taddeo, to be their
candidate, and

23:30.776 --> 23:35.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she lost after the document dump
embarrassed
her, and it became a subject of
debates and

23:35.881 --> 23:37.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
news coverage.

23:37.182 --> 23:39.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that was -- that was
consequential.

23:39.718 --> 23:42.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it didn't get much attention
from the
media, because we were so
focused on other

23:42.821 --> 23:43.922 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dmitri, we
just have a few
seconds.

23:45.524 --> 23:48.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are there enough measures in
place in preventing
this from happening again?

23:48.193 --> 23:52.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: I think
every organization
needs to assume that they are
compromised.

23:52.931 --> 23:57.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We see so much of these
intrusions from nation-states
and criminal groups that it's a
daily occurrence

23:57.870 --> 24:02.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for organizations, companies,
and nonprofits
and government agencies alike.

24:02.308 --> 24:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So everyone needs to be focused
on doing compromise
assessments to make sure that
their networks

24:06.679 --> 24:08.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are truly clean.

24:08.547 --> 24:10.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Dmitri Alperovitch
from CrowdStrike, Eric Lipton
from The New

24:10.382 --> 24:11.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
York Times, thank you both.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC LIPTON: Thank you.

24:14.253 --> 24:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DMITRI ALPEROVITCH: Thank you.

24:21.527 --> 24:28.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: White nationalist
groups say
that Donald Trump's electoral
victory was

24:28.934 --> 24:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also a win for their brand of
white identity
politics.

24:32.738 --> 24:36.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A man named Richard Spencer has
helped to
shape this racist ideology.

24:36.075 --> 24:42.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has gained notoriety in
recent weeks for
statements that most find
abhorrent, but that

24:42.047 --> 24:43.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have increased his following.

24:43.782 --> 24:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s P.J. Tobia has
the story.

24:47.386 --> 24:52.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Richard Spencer
wants to redefine
what it means to be American.

24:52.858 --> 24:57.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's credited with coining the
phrase alt-right,
adding an intellectual veneer to
a racist

24:57.696 --> 25:02.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
movement based on a mix of white
nationalism,
neo-Nazi beliefs and hard-edged
populism.

25:02.501 --> 25:06.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER, National Policy
Institute:
This country does belong to
white people,

25:06.805 --> 25:08.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
culturally, politically,
socially, everything.

25:08.807 --> 25:11.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We define what America is.

25:11.243 --> 25:14.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Last week, he spoke
at Texas A&amp;M
University.

25:14.713 --> 25:15.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER: Look at the
history of multiracial
nations.

25:15.714 --> 25:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a history of conflict.

25:16.715 --> 25:19.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a history of distrust.

25:19.651 --> 25:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Tempers quickly
flared inside
the auditorium, while, outside,
protesters

25:26.225 --> 25:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
denounced his message of white
identity politics
and confronted his supporters.

25:31.397 --> 25:36.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The demonstrators tried to storm
the meeting
room, but were pushed back by
police.

25:36.869 --> 25:40.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
During the presidential
campaign, Spencer
and his followers were a small,
but vocal

25:40.339 --> 25:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pillar of support for Donald
Trump, mostly
active online, targeting those
critical of

25:45.310 --> 25:49.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Republican nominee with
ugly, sometimes
anti-Semitic attacks.

25:49.648 --> 25:53.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Media profiles of Spencer
followed, focusing
on his privileged upbringing,
education at

25:53.786 --> 25:56.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
elite institutions and sartorial
choices.

25:56.955 --> 26:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then came this event in November
celebrating
Donald Trump's election victory
in downtown

26:01.493 --> 26:02.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington, D.C.

26:03.028 --> 26:06.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER: America was,
until this past
generation, a white country.

26:06.265 --> 26:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: It was a forum for
the National
Policy Institute, a kind of
white nationalist

26:10.869 --> 26:12.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think tank Spencer runs.

26:12.704 --> 26:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His keynote address ended with
Nazi salutes.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER: Hail Trump.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hail our people.

26:18.510 --> 26:19.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hail victory.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

26:21.380 --> 26:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: The Holocaust
Museum, Anti-Defamation
League and others denounced the
speech as

26:25.951 --> 26:28.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an anti-Semitic attack.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Spencer says his racist
provocations are purposeful.

26:30.656 --> 26:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER: The alt-right
has come a
long way.

26:33.459 --> 26:38.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump as a -- you know,
as a first
step toward identity politics
has a come a

26:38.330 --> 26:40.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long way.

26:40.132 --> 26:44.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a time to be a little
outlandish, and
so that's why I did that
applause line, which

26:44.036 --> 26:45.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a bit naughty.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: A bit naughty?

26:46.271 --> 26:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, we're talking about --
people are
"sieg heiling."

26:48.807 --> 26:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about an ideology
that hundreds
of thousands of Americans died
to extinguish.

26:53.412 --> 26:54.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's a bit of fun?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD SPENCER: Right.

26:56.315 --> 27:02.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whenever anyone says that I care
about my
people, I care about my
identity, I want to

27:02.287 --> 27:08.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expand and deepen my identity,
the first thing
you always hear -- and it's
become a joke

27:08.794 --> 27:13.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- is, ah, Adolf Hitler, ah, the
Ku Klux Klan,
ah, the Southern Confederacy.

27:13.298 --> 27:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's these boogeymen that are
thrown at any
legitimate and genuine movement
for identity.

27:21.240 --> 27:25.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think at some level people
want to throw
them back in the face of their
attackers.

27:25.577 --> 27:29.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: When a journalist
writes something
that your guys don't like, you
know, it's

27:29.648 --> 27:32.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a picture of her superimposed in
an oven.

27:32.384 --> 27:34.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, you could see the
concern there.

27:34.119 --> 27:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER: It's pixels and
words.

27:35.921 --> 27:38.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: And a swastika is
just an image.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's not just an image, man.

27:40.692 --> 27:41.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think you know that.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm positive that you know that.

27:44.129 --> 27:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think you're just trolling.

27:45.230 --> 27:46.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:46.231 --> 27:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER: I'm not a very
good troll.

27:48.066 --> 27:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, look, I -- there is a line
to be crossed,
and to a point where I won't
defend anyone,

27:54.506 --> 27:58.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and that is any kind of
imminent, real, physical
threat of violence.

27:58.844 --> 28:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Despite Spencer's
privileged upbringing
and lifestyle, his are a
politics of victimhood.

28:03.849 --> 28:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER: If you were
born in 1978,
like I was, or 1988 or to '98,
you have experienced

28:09.454 --> 28:11.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being a minority.

28:11.323 --> 28:16.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have experienced, let's say,
undergraduate
life, where you have gone
through some white

28:16.562 --> 28:18.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
guilt indoctrination.

28:18.397 --> 28:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have experienced trying to
get a job at
a major corporation, where you
know that their

28:22.501 --> 28:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hiring is geared almost totally
towards not
hiring you.

28:28.340 --> 28:33.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Those who know white
nationalism
best say that Spencer's message,
newly packaged

28:33.145 --> 28:37.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for millennials in sharp suits
and clever
memes, are in fact a very old
product.

28:37.382 --> 28:39.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANK MEEINK, Author,
"Autobiography of a
Recovering Skinhead": At the
heart and at

28:39.751 --> 28:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the core of the alt-right, no
matter what
they say, it's all about race.

28:45.958 --> 28:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Frank Meeink is
former neo-Nazi
from South Philly.

28:49.595 --> 28:52.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a youth, he hosted a cable
access show
called "The Reich."

28:52.764 --> 28:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By age 18, he was doing hard
time for kidnapping
and torture, but left the
movement shortly

28:57.302 --> 28:58.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after getting out of prison.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANK MEEINK: Every bit of it is
about race.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It all comes from that.

29:02.474 --> 29:08.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look deeper, it comes
from fear,
fear that the white race is
losing this country,

29:08.513 --> 29:10.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fear that -- the Mexicans coming
in.

29:10.616 --> 29:12.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's all about fear.

29:12.517 --> 29:14.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're losing something.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: He says this sense
of loss has
always been a part of the
radical right.

29:17.322 --> 29:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANK MEEINK: I always hear the
same arguments:
Well, they have BET.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why can't we have white
entertainment television?

29:23.729 --> 29:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, all of television is white
entertainment
television.

29:27.866 --> 29:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's like this -- they're
getting something
that I'm not, and everything's
being taken

29:33.271 --> 29:34.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
away from me.

29:34.973 --> 29:38.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Meeink now coaches
youth hockey
to steer kids in the right
direction.

29:38.143 --> 29:42.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says, if Spencer does have
influence in
a Trump administration, he'd use
it to roll

29:42.114 --> 29:44.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back affirmative action and
diversity programs.

29:45.017 --> 29:48.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Meeink doesn't believe that
Spencer's
Nazi arm salutes are merely
ironic.

29:48.520 --> 29:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK MEEINK: It's not a joke
when there's
people whose family members were
killed in

29:55.160 --> 30:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Holocaust because of people
doing that
arm salute, because of people
mindlessly just

30:02.134 --> 30:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
following their hatred and their
bigotry and
knowing that it doesn't piss off
liberals.

30:10.442 --> 30:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What it does is, it scares human
beings who
care about humanity.

30:15.580 --> 30:20.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: And despite all his
high-minded
talk of theory and history,
sometimes, when

30:20.852 --> 30:23.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenged, Richard Spencer
resorts to basic
insults.

30:23.121 --> 30:24.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER: She's dancing.

30:24.556 --> 30:25.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Perhaps she will lose some
weight.

30:25.691 --> 30:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Spencer's dream is
an all-white
nation.

30:28.627 --> 30:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the near term, he wants to
set up an office
for his National Policy
Institute, currently

30:32.998 --> 30:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
run from his home.

30:34.766 --> 30:39.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The institute was established in
2005 with
funds from William Regnery II
and others.

30:39.805 --> 30:44.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They hold press conferences,
publish studies,
a journal and white nationalist
blog posts.

30:44.976 --> 30:49.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Southern Poverty Law Center
calls the
institute and others like it
academic racist

30:49.815 --> 30:50.916 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organizations.

30:50.949 --> 30:51.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER: Now we have a
place at the
table.

30:51.950 --> 30:53.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that is a major achievement.

30:53.485 --> 30:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of that has to do with
Trump, obviously.

30:56.121 --> 31:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I want to do is to
start to influence
culture more directly, start to
influence

31:00.759 --> 31:04.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy more directly, start to
influence society
more directly.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's going to involve
professionalization.

31:06.198 --> 31:10.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That is building real
institutions here in
the real world.

31:10.836 --> 31:14.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: The Trump campaign
didn't respond
to a request for comment on this
story.

31:14.906 --> 31:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nonetheless, Spencer thinks
America is ready
for his message.

31:17.809 --> 31:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD SPENCER: The alt-right
has gone from
a movement that wasn't connected
to the mainstream

31:24.750 --> 31:27.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a movement that's now really
connected
to the mainstream.

31:27.319 --> 31:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Richard Spencer has
energized
a tiny group of passionate
followers.

31:31.556 --> 31:35.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It's about reawakening
people of America,
and get white people to stand up
for their

31:35.827 --> 31:38.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
roots and to quit being put down
by things
like Black Lives Matter.

31:39.030 --> 31:43.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: With the election of
Donald Trump,
racist groups of all stripes are
hoping their

31:43.435 --> 31:47.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
message will be more widely
accepted, but
the protests that greeted
Spencer and his

31:47.873 --> 31:53.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
followers at Texas A&amp;M are proof
that mainstream
may be a bridge too far for
white nationalism.

31:53.678 --> 32:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm P.J.
Tobia in
College Station, Texas.

32:02.921 --> 32:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Today's
interest rate hike
by the Fed marks just the second
time it has

32:12.564 --> 32:17.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raised rates since the 2008
financial crisis
and the major recession that
followed.

32:17.335 --> 32:22.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when Fed chairwoman Janet
Yellen announces
a move like that, even one
that's widely expected,

32:22.574 --> 32:23.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it is still a big deal.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown continues.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Over the last
year, the Fed
had signaled several times that
a rate hike

32:28.713 --> 32:32.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was imminent, only to back away
as economic
growth stayed sluggish.

32:32.517 --> 32:36.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, though, the move by the
Federal Reserve
Board of Governors was
unanimous, restarting

32:36.922 --> 32:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a move upward from historically
low interest
rates.

32:39.991 --> 32:41.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why now, and what is the Fed
seeing?

32:42.027 --> 32:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn once again to Diane
Swonk, an economist
with her own consulting firm in
Chicago.

32:47.332 --> 32:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Diane, welcome back.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Start there.

32:49.501 --> 32:50.468 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why now?

32:50.502 --> 32:51.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the Fed seeing?

32:51.937 --> 32:54.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DIANE SWONK, Founder, DS
Economics: Well,
we are seeing some inflation.

32:54.039 --> 32:58.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the economy -- the Fed is
sort of looking
at things getting stronger, and
it's an acknowledgment

32:58.443 --> 33:00.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the U.S. economy is
stronger.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's actually raised rates.

33:01.046 --> 33:02.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they could have done it
in September.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was this postponement to
December.

33:04.749 --> 33:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's more than time for the Fed
to raise rates.

33:06.651 --> 33:12.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, I think Janet
Yellen also signaled
very clearly that this is a
turning point

33:12.424 --> 33:13.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the Fed.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They not only -- not are we just
seeing a
forecast of rate hikes next
year.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we're going to see much
more than
one.

33:18.830 --> 33:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, it only takes two to get
more than one.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we will get the three
that the Fed
is expecting.

33:23.702 --> 33:28.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They're seeing an
economy that
is growing, perhaps even too
fast, enough

33:28.840 --> 33:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they want to raise rates.

33:30.809 --> 33:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's after an election in
which many Americans
saw an economy that wasn't
growing fast enough

33:35.113 --> 33:36.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for them.

33:36.915 --> 33:39.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE SWONK: It actually isn't
an acknowledgment
that the economy is growing too
fast.

33:39.451 --> 33:42.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The monetary policy is still
very, very easy.

33:42.220 --> 33:45.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To think of this, you kind of
think of it
as the Fed is not taking the
punch away from

33:45.757 --> 33:46.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the party.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're just not spiking it
anymore.

33:48.526 --> 33:52.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're worried about some
people getting
a little tipsy on the side, some
real estate

33:52.130 --> 33:55.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bubbles they're very concerned
about in the
commercial real estate market.

33:55.500 --> 33:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And although they didn't state
it explicitly,
the run-up in the stock market
that we have

33:59.371 --> 34:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen since the election has a
lot of attributes
of a bubble.

34:02.507 --> 34:05.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is certainly going to
be some concern
about that within the circle for
the Fed.

34:05.944 --> 34:08.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, and, of
course, the big
question is to what extent does
the election

34:08.747 --> 34:14.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Donald Trump changes the
game, right, and
changes the economic outlook,
and, therefore,

34:14.085 --> 34:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the outlook for interest rates,
with tax hikes
or stimulus.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did Janet Yellen say about
that today?

34:21.293 --> 34:25.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE SWONK: Well, clearly,
there are some
within the Fed -- there are
participants at

34:25.130 --> 34:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the meeting that actually did
put that into
their forecasts.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And most of them didn't.

34:29.401 --> 34:32.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think she was very
cautious to say the
cloud of uncertainty regarding
policy, because

34:32.871 --> 34:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Fed is in the situation that
they have
got to react to actual policy,
not promises

34:37.108 --> 34:38.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of policy changes.

34:38.910 --> 34:42.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the spectrum of what could
happen are
both bad and good, depending on
whether they're

34:42.480 --> 34:46.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protectionist policies that
might raise inflation
without boosting growth or
whether they're

34:46.785 --> 34:50.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pro-stimulus, pro-growth
policies that will
raise inflation by actually
raising growth.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The spectrum is very vague.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we don't have any policies
yet to react
to.

34:55.226 --> 34:57.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think that's very
important.

34:57.295 --> 35:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other issue that's very
clear, Chair Yellen
made a real attempt to assert
the Fed's independence

35:02.734 --> 35:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without provoking the new
president-elect,
because she was really sort of
walking on

35:06.671 --> 35:11.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eggshells in an effort to, this
is what is
expected, this is what we're
doing, but didn't

35:11.242 --> 35:15.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to provoke president-elect
Trump, because
he did criticize her very much
on the campaign

35:15.814 --> 35:17.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trail.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people they're talking about
replacing
-- putting into two seats in the
Federal Reserve

35:20.118 --> 35:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are currently are going to
be very hostile
to Chair Yellen.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she asserted that, listen,
she's not going
anywhere.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her term goes until next year.

35:27.659 --> 35:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she even intimated that she
might stick
around longer and fulfill her
term.

35:31.629 --> 35:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have only had one Fed chair
ever that,
once they were done with their
term as Fed

35:36.101 --> 35:37.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chair, stayed on as governor.

35:37.435 --> 35:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He was, indeed,
very critical
of her.

35:40.005 --> 35:41.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, as you say, she just has
one year.

35:41.940 --> 35:46.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you're thinking there is the
possibility
here of some kind of coming
dispute, open

35:46.811 --> 35:48.146 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dispute?

35:48.179 --> 35:50.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE SWONK: I think there's
going to be a
lot of open dispute.

35:50.382 --> 35:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two Fed chairs that are
going to be filled
are going to be filled by people
who don't

35:54.552 --> 35:58.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like what this Federal Reserve
has done, and
they're going to be critical of
it, and they're

35:58.390 --> 36:01.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be, in fact, confirmed
by being critical.

36:01.126 --> 36:05.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, there may be buyer's
remorse later on
if they raise rates a lot, and
these are people

36:05.196 --> 36:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who end up taking over the Fed,
because they're
going to replace not only two
Fed seats.

36:09.200 --> 36:13.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also going to have the
attempt to
replace the chair and replace
the vice chair

36:13.271 --> 36:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
within about a year-and-a-half.

36:15.106 --> 36:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, President-elect Trump is
going to have
a lot of impact on the Fed at
the same time

36:19.944 --> 36:25.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Congress is looking to have
oversight
to be able to make the Fed sort
of acquiesce

36:25.050 --> 36:28.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to political cycles, instead of
economic cycles.

36:28.119 --> 36:31.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Diane Swonk,
thank you very
much.

36:31.489 --> 36:38.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE SWONK: Thank you.

36:38.930 --> 36:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to our
continuing series
of conversations with outgoing
members of

36:46.271 --> 36:48.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Obama administration.

36:48.540 --> 36:53.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of Agriculture Tom
Vilsack is the
last original member of the
Obama Cabinet.

36:53.545 --> 36:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is also the former governor
of Iowa.

36:56.381 --> 37:01.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We began the conversation by
looking ahead
to his yet-to-be-named successor
in the Trump

37:01.186 --> 37:03.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM VILSACK, U.S. Agriculture
Secretary: I
would say that, from an
agricultural perspective,

37:05.290 --> 37:10.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a little bit of concern,
because some
of the folks I don't know are
particularly

37:10.228 --> 37:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supportive of the renewable fuel
industry
and the renewable fuel standard,
which is

37:14.899 --> 37:17.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a big part of certainly
Midwestern agriculture.

37:17.569 --> 37:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm hopeful that, when we
see his ultimate
selection for ag secretary, that
we will see

37:22.607 --> 37:28.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone who is a strong advocate
for renewable
fuels, and what that means to
Midwestern producers.

37:28.580 --> 37:32.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for that matter, now, all
over the country,
we're seeing more and more of
the biofuels

37:32.650 --> 37:34.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being produced from a variety of
sources.

37:34.452 --> 37:36.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, renewable
fuels.

37:36.754 --> 37:42.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Any other signals that you have
seen him give
as it affects agriculture
policy, food stamp

37:42.861 --> 37:46.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy, a big part of what the
department
does?

37:46.164 --> 37:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM VILSACK: Well, on a positive
side, his
designee to be ambassador to
China, former

37:51.069 --> 37:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or current Governor Terry
Branstad from
Iowa, who I think is actually a
good selection

37:55.039 --> 37:59.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of his relationship with
President
Xi in China and his longstanding
relationship

37:59.110 --> 38:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the president, and the fact
that Governor
Branstad is a tireless advocate
for agriculture.

38:03.848 --> 38:07.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's sort of a good news
opportunity
there, I think, especially with
our number

38:07.619 --> 38:09.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one trading partner.

38:09.787 --> 38:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still yet to be determined about
the impact
on some of the poverty programs
like SNAP.

38:14.759 --> 38:17.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is a very effective
poverty-reducing
program.

38:17.862 --> 38:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're seeing reduced rolls in
SNAP.

38:19.397 --> 38:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it will be interesting.

38:20.765 --> 38:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is food
stamps.

38:22.433 --> 38:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOM VILSACK: Food stamps, yes.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will be interesting to see
what, if anything,
is proposed.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of people don't
understand the
makeup of the SNAP population,
of the food

38:28.773 --> 38:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stamp population, 80 percent
senior citizens,
people with disabilities,
children, and those

38:33.745 --> 38:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are actually in the work
force working.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's
interesting you should
say that, because some
congressional Republicans

38:38.983 --> 38:40.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are talking about overhauling
it.

38:40.451 --> 38:43.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have yet to hear, I think,
from Mr. Trump
himself on that.

38:43.688 --> 38:46.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOM VILSACK: Yes, I think that
there's a misunderstanding.

38:46.558 --> 38:50.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The folks who are not -- who are
able-bodied,
who are adults, who don't have
dependents,

38:50.428 --> 38:54.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a desire to make sure
that they get
to work and that they aren't
basically gaming

38:54.732 --> 38:56.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the system.

38:56.534 --> 38:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reality is, they have a
responsibility
to either be involved in work or
education,

38:58.970 --> 39:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or they're limited in terms of
their benefits.

39:01.206 --> 39:04.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's going to be a
little bit
more difficult than they might
assume to overhaul

39:04.442 --> 39:05.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that program.

39:05.443 --> 39:07.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a working program.

39:07.178 --> 39:11.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The election,
Donald Trump
did much better with and among
rural vote

39:11.849 --> 39:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters than did the Democratic
Party nominee,
Hillary Clinton.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why do you think that is?

39:17.288 --> 39:21.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What was it about -- that he
said and his
appeal that wasn't there on her
part?

39:21.559 --> 39:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM VILSACK: Well, I think,
actually, it goes
far beyond one election cycle.

39:24.662 --> 39:29.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the Democrats have -- we
really have
failed to be in rural America,
in the sense

39:29.267 --> 39:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of having our leaders spending
time talking
to folks in rural America.

39:33.871 --> 39:37.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president has been there,
but other than
the president and vice
president, we have

39:37.375 --> 39:40.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
had not a whole lot of
conversation in rural
America.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Including by
Hillary Clinton?

39:42.247 --> 39:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM VILSACK: Well, Hillary
Clinton was there
during the Iowa caucuses, but I
think the

39:45.883 --> 39:49.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nature of a campaign makes it
more difficult
once you become the candidate.

39:49.954 --> 39:54.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there's a messaging
opportunity here throughout,
not just in the election season,
but before

39:54.225 --> 39:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the election, the opportunity to
underscore
what government is doing in a
positive way

39:59.197 --> 40:00.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in partnership with rural folks.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's a messaging issue.

40:02.900 --> 40:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's being there physically,
talking to folks,
listening to people, respecting
and admiring

40:07.639 --> 40:11.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they do, and then making
sure that they
understand precisely what the
partnership

40:11.743 --> 40:12.710 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

40:12.744 --> 40:14.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will give you an example.

40:14.545 --> 40:18.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Very few people know that my
department is
responsible for 1.2 million home
loans since

40:18.516 --> 40:20.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have been secretary.

40:20.285 --> 40:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's 1.2 million families that
are living
in homes in rural America that
would never

40:23.454 --> 40:28.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have homeownership, but for the
United States
Department of Agriculture's
programs.

40:28.092 --> 40:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to do more of educating
people about
the partnership that does exist
between rural

40:32.430 --> 40:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
America and their government.

40:34.365 --> 40:41.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
it's principally
a messaging issue, that the
policies are right?

40:41.272 --> 40:44.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because when you talk to voters
in some of
these areas, they're saying they
just think

40:44.208 --> 40:49.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington, as it is today, just
doesn't even
care who they are.

40:49.213 --> 40:53.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM VILSACK: Five -- over 5,000
water projects
have been financed by my
department.

40:53.451 --> 40:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have invested billions of
dollars in economic
opportunity.

40:57.722 --> 41:02.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have supported over 100,000
businesses,
supporting nearly half-a-million
jobs in rural

41:02.126 --> 41:03.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

41:03.227 --> 41:05.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The unemployment rate has been
cut nearly
in half.

41:05.330 --> 41:08.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The poverty rate has come down
faster than
it has in 25 years.

41:08.266 --> 41:11.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The food insecurity rate among
children is
its lowest in history.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, I think it is a messaging
issue, Judy.

41:13.338 --> 41:18.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have not done a good
job of explaining
to people in rural America what
is actually

41:18.276 --> 41:20.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happening, number one.

41:20.211 --> 41:23.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, number two, we're not
expressing appreciation
and acknowledging the
contribution that rural

41:23.948 --> 41:25.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
America makes.

41:25.249 --> 41:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where does your food come from?

41:26.317 --> 41:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where does the water come from?

41:27.485 --> 41:29.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where does the energy feedstock
come from?

41:29.087 --> 41:30.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It all comes from rural areas.

41:30.555 --> 41:32.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where does your military come
from?

41:32.423 --> 41:36.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly 35 to 40 percent of the
military is
from 15 percent of America's
population living

41:36.260 --> 41:37.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in rural America.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It makes a tremendous
contribution to this
country.

41:39.864 --> 41:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It just isn't recognized.

41:41.065 --> 41:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how do
Democrats turn that
around?

41:42.934 --> 41:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM VILSACK: Well, I think,
first and foremost,
showing up, making sure that we
focus not

41:47.372 --> 41:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just on elections, not just on
presidential
elections, but we begin the
process of rebuilding

41:52.076 --> 41:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the infrastructure of the party
at the grassroots.

41:55.012 --> 41:59.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin going out to all those
rural counties
and begin having a conversation
with rural

41:59.150 --> 42:03.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters and making sure that we
hear their
concerns, hear their complaints,
and also

42:03.588 --> 42:08.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
educate them about what we are
doing, making
sure that we focus on state
legislative races,

42:08.659 --> 42:11.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just congressional, Senate,
governor,
and presidential races.

42:11.863 --> 42:16.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it's incredibly
important that we
have a greater investment in
infrastructure.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two final
questions.

42:18.035 --> 42:22.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you prepare to leave the
Department of
Agriculture, what do you think
you have done

42:22.240 --> 42:23.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's made the most difference?

42:23.541 --> 42:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM VILSACK: Well, the rural
economy is significantly
better.

42:26.411 --> 42:30.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Children in this country will be
healthier
in the long run because of the
changes we

42:30.248 --> 42:32.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have made in school lunch and
school snack
programs.

42:32.650 --> 42:35.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our natural resources,
particularly our working
lands, are more resilient.

42:36.020 --> 42:40.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And more money is being invested
in soil conservation
and water preservation.

42:40.191 --> 42:44.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our forests will be in better
shape if Congress
does what it needs to do to fix
the fire-suppression

42:44.529 --> 42:46.297 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
budget.

42:46.330 --> 42:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think we're leaving the
department,
we're leaving rural America,
we're leaving

42:49.434 --> 42:52.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country, and particularly
the youngsters
of this country in better shape
than when

42:52.970 --> 42:54.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we found them in 2009.

42:54.839 --> 42:59.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That seems to me to be the
threshold question:
Are things better or worse than
they were

42:59.710 --> 43:00.845 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2009?

43:00.878 --> 43:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think people have to remember
where we were
in 2009.

43:03.314 --> 43:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were losing 800,000 jobs a
month.

43:05.049 --> 43:06.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had an unemployment rate in
double digits.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We had poverty rates soaring.

43:08.519 --> 43:10.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had kids who were food
insecure.

43:10.288 --> 43:14.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, we have a lot less
unemployment, a
lot less poverty, and a lot
fewer kids who

43:14.559 --> 43:16.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are food insecure.

43:16.360 --> 43:20.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in just a few
words, what
is the part of President Obama's
legacy that

43:20.198 --> 43:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you think is most likely it to
endure, given
that we're about to turn the
executive branch

43:26.170 --> 43:28.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over to someone who has very
different political
views?

43:28.539 --> 43:32.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM VILSACK: Well, I think
President Obama
is going to be treated very,
very well by

43:32.777 --> 43:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
history in terms of his ability
to save the
economy.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's certainly true in
rural areas.

43:37.882 --> 43:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, the unemployment rate is
substantially
reduced, the poverty rate is
down, and in

43:41.452 --> 43:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
large part because of the
investments that
were made during the Recovery
Act and thereafter,

43:45.456 --> 43:47.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
historic investments.

43:47.124 --> 43:49.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Record amounts of investment has
been made
in the infrastructure in rural
areas.

43:49.393 --> 43:51.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's still work to be done,
no question.

43:51.629 --> 43:54.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're in much better shape
than we were
before, number one.

43:54.499 --> 43:59.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, number two, I think,
certainly, he has
created an opportunity for
America to understand

43:59.770 --> 44:01.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that diversity is a blessing,
diversity is
a strength.

44:01.973 --> 44:05.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It isn't necessarily something
to be concerned
about.

44:05.810 --> 44:09.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, at the end of the
day, we're
going to learn that this country
operates

44:09.714 --> 44:16.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
best when it celebrates and
surrounds itself
and appreciates diversity, and
doesn't shun

44:16.721 --> 44:18.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

44:18.489 --> 44:21.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of
Agriculture Tom
Vilsack, thank you for talking
with us in

44:21.325 --> 44:27.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your final month or two of being
in that position.

44:27.532 --> 44:29.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

44:29.800 --> 44:34.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TOM VILSACK: You bet.

44:34.338 --> 44:36.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

44:36.607 --> 44:43.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight, a most
unusual battle between
scientists and native

44:43.147 --> 44:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hawaiians over the construction
of a massive
observatory.

44:45.583 --> 44:51.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is all about a plan to
build the largest
telescope on Earth on a shield
volcano.

44:51.756 --> 44:55.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Astronomers say it can offer
unique sights
to view the cosmos, but it would
be created

44:55.560 --> 44:57.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on what is also considered
sacred ground.

44:58.029 --> 45:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien has our
report for our weekly look at
the Leading

45:01.832 --> 45:03.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Edge of science and technology.

45:03.935 --> 45:10.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: For astronomers,
it may be
the ultimate focal point this
side of outer

45:10.942 --> 45:12.710 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
space.

45:12.743 --> 45:18.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 14,000-foot summit of Mauna
Kea on the
island of Hawaii is home to 13
observatories

45:18.049 --> 45:20.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that have rewritten the
textbooks.

45:20.918 --> 45:25.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Astronomer Andrea Ghez is a
frequent visitor,
here to learn more about the
black hole at

45:26.023 --> 45:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the center of our galaxy.

45:27.391 --> 45:30.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREA GHEZ, Astronomer, UCLA: I
feel like
a kid in a candy shop.

45:30.394 --> 45:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got lots to do, lots --
a lot of interesting
problems that we're working on
that's been

45:35.700 --> 45:38.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enabled with advanced
technology.

45:38.436 --> 45:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And further advances are just
going to make
that all the better.

45:41.305 --> 45:47.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ghez uses the
most powerful
observatory here, the Keck,
which has two

45:47.345 --> 45:49.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
10-meter-wide mirrors.

45:49.180 --> 45:55.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But plans to shed more light on
her star quest
are stuck in a black hole of
resentment and

45:55.453 --> 45:57.154 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anger.

45:57.188 --> 46:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turns out what's precious to
the scientists
is sacred to the native Hawaiian
culture.

46:04.095 --> 46:16.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PUA CASE, Activist: There's no
word for how
I feel about that mountain in
English.

46:16.440 --> 46:22.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no word that would be
deep enough
to say how I feel about that
mountain.

46:22.446 --> 46:28.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Pua Case is one
of the most
vocal opponents of the $1.4
billion 30-meter

46:28.452 --> 46:31.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
telescope, the TMT.

46:31.188 --> 46:36.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the next big observatory
on the horizon,
and astronomers believe the
summit of Mauna

46:36.360 --> 46:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kea is the ideal place to build
it.

46:39.196 --> 46:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PUA CASE: This mountain peaks
into the realm
of the Sky Father to Wakea.

46:44.835 --> 46:49.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's where I go when I need to
say my prayers,
when I want to be heard, because
I know my

46:49.640 --> 46:52.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voice is closest to the heavens
when I am
there.

46:52.610 --> 46:58.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Their protests
emerged at the
groundbreaking on October 7,
2014.

46:58.249 --> 47:03.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Opponents successfully argued
the approval
process was illegally
circumvented, and so

47:03.354 --> 47:08.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Hawaiian Supreme Court
revoked the building
permit, forcing the project to
start the long

47:08.893 --> 47:10.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
process over.

47:10.695 --> 47:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY SANDERS, Project Manager,
Thirty Meter
Telescope: So, there's going to
be 492 glass

47:13.731 --> 47:14.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mirrors this size.

47:14.999 --> 47:18.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Gary Sanders is
project manager
of the TMT.

47:18.769 --> 47:24.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is a multinational
partnership involving
science enterprises in the U.S.,
Canada, India,

47:24.842 --> 47:25.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Japan, and China.

47:26.010 --> 47:28.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY SANDERS: Scientists, we
love what we
do.

47:28.512 --> 47:29.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We adore it.

47:29.747 --> 47:31.515 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

47:31.549 --> 47:35.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We just don't understand
sometimes that those
around us, while they might be
pleased with

47:35.486 --> 47:39.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, even excited by it, may not
adore it the
way we do.

47:39.090 --> 47:40.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a blind spot.

47:40.858 --> 47:45.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Observatories
started appearing
on the summit of Mauna Kea about
60 years

47:45.563 --> 47:47.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

47:47.364 --> 47:52.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was always opposition, but
it blossomed
in the late 1990s, when NASA
proposed four

47:52.436 --> 47:58.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smaller telescopes be placed
beside the big
Keck mirrors to enhance their
resolution.

47:58.442 --> 48:01.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the idea was scuttled amid
local opposition.

48:01.746 --> 48:06.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TMT managers say they tried to
learn from
that experience.

48:06.050 --> 48:11.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY SANDERS: We tried as best
we could to
meet the concerns and actually
to become part

48:11.122 --> 48:14.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the community, rather than
mere visitors
of the community.

48:14.391 --> 48:20.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when the opposition emerged,
the additional
opposition emerged as we began
the groundbreaking

48:20.765 --> 48:23.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the construction, frankly,
we were surprised.

48:23.601 --> 48:27.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: You let Mount Fuji stand.

48:27.338 --> 48:28.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mount Fuji is sacred.

48:28.439 --> 48:31.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our Mauna Kea is just as sacred
as Mount Fuji.

48:31.442 --> 48:33.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Please hear us.

48:33.210 --> 48:38.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The TMT project
took shape
while native Hawaiians were
rediscovering

48:38.449 --> 48:48.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their cultural heritage.

48:48.492 --> 48:56.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their cultural heritage.

48:56.500 --> 49:02.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Peter Apo is a singer,
songwriter and trustee
of the Office of Hawaiian
Affairs, a state

49:03.007 --> 49:06.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agency that aims to improve the
lives of Hawaiians.

49:06.343 --> 49:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER APO, Office of Hawaiian
Affairs: The
TMT issue is largely under the
umbrella of

49:12.850 --> 49:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what Hawaiians refer to as
nationhood.

49:16.220 --> 49:21.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a strong feeling that
the way Hawaii
became the 50th state of the
nation, beginning

49:21.625 --> 49:23.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with annexation, was illegal.

49:23.427 --> 49:30.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the TMT and other issues
like it really
spring from this unresolved and
unreconciled

49:30.801 --> 49:32.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
question of self-determination.

49:32.636 --> 49:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREA GHEZ: There's certainly
an element
of native rights issues, which
is far bigger

49:38.242 --> 49:40.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than astronomy.

49:40.110 --> 49:46.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, astronomy, I think, right
now, is certainly
a lightning post for these
bigger issues.

49:46.517 --> 49:51.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Andrea Ghez is
focused on one
of the big issues in astronomy
at the very

49:51.422 --> 49:53.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
heart of the galaxy.

49:53.190 --> 49:58.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and her team have proven the
existence
of a black hole there by
tracking how stars

49:58.262 --> 49:59.530 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
orbit around it.

49:59.563 --> 50:03.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in science, the answers
often spark new
questions.

50:03.567 --> 50:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREA GHEZ: Almost everything
we see there
is inconsistent with our models,
so it's making

50:08.639 --> 50:10.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us scratch our heads.

50:10.341 --> 50:15.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I keep reminding myself that
we are only
seeing the brightest things, and
it would

50:15.779 --> 50:20.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be like trying to understand the
financial
market if you could only see the
biggest transactions.

50:20.150 --> 50:25.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In astronomy, the
solution
is to build bigger and better
telescopes.

50:25.856 --> 50:31.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a mirror 30 meters in
diameter would be
a hundred times more powerful
than Keck's,

50:31.762 --> 50:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it would be one of the
largest moving
structures ever constructed.

50:36.066 --> 50:38.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The building will be 18-stories
tall.

50:38.602 --> 50:45.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PUA CASE: The construction, the
destruction,
and the desecration to a sacred
place, to

50:45.376 --> 50:50.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any mountain anywhere, you can
never change
that.

50:50.114 --> 50:52.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can never go back.

50:52.650 --> 50:57.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know how grateful we are to
be in this
circle on this Mauna today.

50:57.121 --> 51:02.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you lead us, great mountain,
and you tell
us what to do.

51:02.426 --> 51:05.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we align with you in the
heart.

51:05.496 --> 51:13.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't even pay that telescope
no mind, because
I know it won't be built.

51:13.604 --> 51:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They know it won't be built.

51:16.073 --> 51:17.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ancestors will not allow it.

51:17.875 --> 51:23.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, while the TMT
project pursues
a new permit, it is also hedging
its bets,

51:23.881 --> 51:27.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
choosing an alternate site in
the Canary Islands.

51:27.584 --> 51:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Astronomers say that would be a
huge loss
for Hawaii.

51:30.354 --> 51:36.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREA GHEZ: It's a treasure to
have something
that's so valuable to our
knowledge that we

51:36.126 --> 51:37.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can achieve.

51:37.294 --> 51:39.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It can be best done here.

51:39.063 --> 51:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER APO: One of the challenges
that we have
is that, when you use the word
sacred, it

51:44.368 --> 51:46.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
means no discussion.

51:46.203 --> 51:51.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they won't come to the table
to discuss
anything, because there will be
no compromise.

51:51.709 --> 51:54.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The TMT will not be built.

51:54.078 --> 51:56.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that makes it a little bit
difficult to
talk about anything.

51:56.647 --> 52:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: If the TMT moves
on from Hawaii,
Mauna Kea will still remain a
powerful perch

52:02.386 --> 52:08.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to study the cosmos for decades,
but it could
