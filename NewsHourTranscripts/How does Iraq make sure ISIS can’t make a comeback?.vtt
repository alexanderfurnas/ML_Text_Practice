JUDY WOODRUFF: Iraqi leaders
and the top American military
commander in Iraq proclaimed the

00:05.200 --> 00:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
liberation of the city
of Mosul yesterday.

00:08.066 --> 00:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what's the next step
in that war-torn country?

00:11.200 --> 00:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does the Iraqi government have
a plan to prevent ISIS from
returning and to rebuild Iraq's

00:16.933 --> 00:18.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
second largest city?

00:18.366 --> 00:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For some answers, we
turn to Feisal Istrabadi.

00:21.233 --> 00:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a former Iraqi diplomat,
and he's now director of the
Middle East Center at Indiana

00:25.900 --> 00:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
University, Bloomington.

00:28.466 --> 00:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Feisal Istrabadi, welcome
back to the program.

00:31.033 --> 00:36.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How much of a blow to
ISIS was the retaking
of the city of Mosul?

00:38.033 --> 00:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FEISAL ISTRABADI, Former Deputy
Iraqi Ambassador to United
Nations: Well, it's a huge blow,

00:40.133 --> 00:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because one of the ways in which
ISIL distinguished its brand
from al-Qaida before was that it

00:46.366 --> 00:51.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was able to conquer and
hold territory, erase an
international boundary,
declare a caliphate,

00:53.666 --> 00:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and engage in the fight against
forces that regard it as
infidel, be they other Muslims

00:59.466 --> 01:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or Western forces.

01:02.133 --> 01:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it sort of distinguished
itself in that way.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now it is retreating.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It has lost the largest
city that it occupied.

01:09.433 --> 01:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are plans under way to
make it lose Raqqa as well
in Syria, and slowly -- and

01:15.600 --> 01:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hopefully not slowly
to expel it from Iraq.

01:18.200 --> 01:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's a psychological and an
ideological, huge blow to ISIL.

01:24.366 --> 01:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
does it still control?

01:25.900 --> 01:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What capability
does it still have?

01:28.500 --> 01:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: Well, it still
has the ability - - I mean, your
own reporting earlier in the

01:32.266 --> 01:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program was that it still is
able to put on sort of the
skirmish attacks, although, last

01:39.533 --> 01:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week, it was able to
manage to conduct an
attempt at a counterattack,
which was repelled,

01:45.233 --> 01:47.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of course.

01:47.366 --> 01:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the main fear that
I have now is that ISIL
becomes a classical
terrorist organization,

01:53.233 --> 01:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as al-Qaida was before, able
to pull off, you know, attacks
of varying size in Baghdad

02:00.366 --> 02:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other places.

02:02.433 --> 02:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're already seeing that
it is metamorphosing into
that kind of an organization.

02:07.533 --> 02:09.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that again is
deeply disturbing.

02:09.400 --> 02:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how
well-equipped is the government
of Iraq to deal with that?

02:13.133 --> 02:18.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: It's
very difficult to repel
those sorts of attacks.

02:20.066 --> 02:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to have perfect
intelligence and a perfect
ability to respond.

02:23.733 --> 02:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, unfortunately, neither the
Iraqi government now, nor the
Americans when they had a large

02:30.700 --> 02:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
presence, when the U.S. had a
large presence in Iraq, have
been able to control that.

02:35.233 --> 02:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ultimate solution for this
problem has to be political.

02:39.366 --> 02:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has to be a situation where
sort of the underlying disease
which has allowed at least

02:47.100 --> 02:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
enough people to fail
to participate in the
political process, that
sort of disease has

02:54.133 --> 02:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be treated, rather than
continuing to treat the
symptoms of the disease.

02:58.466 --> 03:03.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, we have collectively,
the Iraqis, the international
community, we have collectively

03:04.633 --> 03:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
failed to do that
over the years.

03:06.733 --> 03:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're referring
to the sectarian divisions in
Iraq that have led to one group

03:10.800 --> 03:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prevailing over another.

03:12.833 --> 03:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you see any improvement in
the Shia-Sunni divisions in
Iraq over the last several years

03:18.833 --> 03:20.866 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
since the larger
war ended there?

03:20.866 --> 03:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: I see hope
that the future need not
be what the past has been.

03:27.633 --> 03:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that, in distinction
to his predecessor, the current
prime minister of Iraq has good

03:33.533 --> 03:35.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intentions.

03:35.133 --> 03:38.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What we don't have,
however, is a plan.

03:38.100 --> 03:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Good intentions will not get
us past this sort of impasse
that we have been in since

03:43.733 --> 03:46.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
after 2003.

03:46.700 --> 03:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There needs to be a coming
together of the Iraqi political
class, and a sort of a sorting

03:53.700 --> 03:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of what our priorities are
and how we prepare our modus
vivendi, how we engage in

04:00.800 --> 04:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reconciliation, what kinds of
power-sharing we're willing
to engage, all within a larger

04:06.866 --> 04:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
constitutional,
democratic framework.

04:09.733 --> 04:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that, unfortunately,
we haven't done.

04:13.433 --> 04:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now we have to do it at
the same time as we have the
reconstruction of the country

04:17.533 --> 04:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at hand, as well, of course, as
providing immediate humanitarian
relief for the refugees

04:22.500 --> 04:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fleeing the cities that are
being liberated from ISIL.

04:27.300 --> 04:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And when you
speak of we having to do this,
are you referring to the United

04:31.166 --> 04:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States or are you referring
to the Iraqi government?

04:33.533 --> 04:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: All of us.

04:35.933 --> 04:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that that is something
that the international
community, the United
States, of course the

04:43.766 --> 04:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iraqis in the first instance
-- it has to be an Iraqi
project in the first instance.

04:48.633 --> 04:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the United States is
a part of the process.

04:52.733 --> 04:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The international community
needs to encourage these three
tracks, sort of the immediate

04:59.700 --> 05:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
humanitarian relief,
the physical rebuilding
of the country, and,
more importantly, the

05:05.700 --> 05:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
political rebuilding
of the country.

05:07.800 --> 05:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is going to be sort of
a multipronged effort that
has to occur simultaneously.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the Iraqis will
need the support of the
international community.

05:15.666 --> 05:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And very, very
quickly, you see the will of
the international community

05:18.466 --> 05:20.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that?

05:20.600 --> 05:24.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: I hope
so, because the failure
of the Iraqis to do
this, the failure of the

05:26.466 --> 05:30.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
international community
to support this effort
will mean that, just
as al-Qaida left ISIL,

05:32.266 --> 05:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this incarnation of ISIL will
lead to ISIL 2.0, 3.0, 4.0.

05:39.233 --> 05:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's just condemning the
Middle East, the region and
perhaps the world to an endless

05:42.566 --> 05:43.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cycle of violence.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A
sobering message.

05:45.566 --> 05:47.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Feisal Istrabadi, we
thank you very much.

05:47.533 --> 05:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEISAL ISTRABADI: Thank you.

05:48.533 --> 05:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a pleasure, as always.
