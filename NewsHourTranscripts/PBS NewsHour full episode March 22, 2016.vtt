JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.608 --> 00:14.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
terror in Brussels: ISIS claims
responsibility

00:14.514 --> 00:21.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for blasts at an airport and
subway, killing
at least 30 -- how Europe
grapples with another

00:21.221 --> 00:23.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deadly attack.

00:23.090 --> 00:28.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday: President
Obama wraps up his historic trip
to Cuba with

00:28.161 --> 00:31.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a promise to bury the remnants
of the Cold
War.

00:31.265 --> 00:36.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And preparing for
disaster
when living near the most
dangerous fault

00:36.303 --> 00:38.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
line in America.

00:38.171 --> 00:40.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAWN SHARP, President, Quinault
Indian Nation:
So many of our memories are here
in this village,

00:40.607 --> 00:43.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the thought of it being
underwater, you
know, there's a lot of trauma to
that prospect

00:43.911 --> 00:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that a very sacred site could no
longer exist.

00:46.480 --> 00:54.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.755 --> 00:57.624 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.658 --> 01:09.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Once again, a major
European capital
has been shut down by terror.
Today's bombings

01:09.036 --> 01:15.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Brussels left at least 31
people dead.
More than 180 were wounded,
including an undetermined

01:15.108 --> 01:16.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
number of Americans.

01:16.877 --> 01:21.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attacks paralyzed the city
for most of
the day, and triggered an
all-out manhunt.

01:21.815 --> 01:31.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thick smoke and screams of panic
captured
by a cell phone moments after
double explosions

01:31.391 --> 01:38.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rocked the Belgian capital's
airport. Suitcases
stood abandoned as would-be
passengers scrambled

01:38.231 --> 01:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over collapsed ceilings and
shattered windows.

01:40.901 --> 01:46.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I hear an explosion. And
all the ceilings
is going down. And then I just
go under the

01:46.673 --> 01:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sink. And then the second
explosion went.
And then everything is black.
And I see -- when

01:51.611 --> 01:55.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I go out, I see all -- a lot of
people with
blood.

01:55.048 --> 02:00.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
tried to flee
towards the arrivals and we
couldn't get there,

02:00.554 --> 02:06.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there was glass everywhere,
crash, crash,
crash everywhere. And we went
toward the taxis.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a total confusion. It was
truly hell.

02:09.496 --> 02:14.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Belgian prosecutors
say it was
the work of two suicide bombers,
attacking

02:14.901 --> 02:21.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just seconds apart, during the
morning rush.
They say a third suspect
escaped. Passengers

02:21.875 --> 02:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and employees alike streamed out
of the smoldering
entrance, while hundreds of
others were evacuated

02:27.681 --> 02:29.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the tarmac.

02:29.549 --> 02:35.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, about an hour later,
another blast,
this time on a subway train as
it left a station

02:35.889 --> 02:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
near the European Union's
headquarters. Footage
posted to social media showed
passengers evacuating

02:42.129 --> 02:45.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one car as emergency personnel
treated the
wounded.

02:45.532 --> 02:49.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): These
are war injuries.
I have more than 40 years of
experience on

02:49.836 --> 02:53.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the job, so I have seen a lot of
things. I
think this is the worst thing I
have ever

02:53.940 --> 02:55.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seen in my career.

02:55.742 --> 02:59.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The twin attacks,
claimed by the
Islamic State group, sent
Belgium's terror

02:59.413 --> 03:05.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alert to the highest level and
put the entire
city under lockdown for hours.
Police found

03:05.218 --> 03:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a third bomb at the airport and
disposed of
it.

03:09.423 --> 03:13.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flights and train service were
canceled or
diverted, and people were
ordered to remain

03:13.794 --> 03:15.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in place.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES MICHEL, Belgian Prime
Minister (through
translator): Ladies and
gentlemen, what we

03:17.497 --> 03:22.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feared has happened. Our country
and our citizens
have been hit by blind, violent
and cowardly

03:22.803 --> 03:28.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks. We are confronted with
a challenge,
a difficult challenge, and we
must face it

03:28.775 --> 03:32.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by standing united, showing
solidarity and
staying together.

03:32.245 --> 03:37.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The attacks in
Brussels came four
days after the arrest there of
Salah Abdeslam,

03:37.818 --> 03:44.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the top suspect in November's
terror attacks
in Paris that left 130 dead.

03:44.324 --> 03:48.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they cast new doubts on
Belgian intelligence-gathering
and security.

03:48.929 --> 03:53.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s chief foreign
affairs correspondent,
Margaret Warner, spoke with the
Belgian ambassador

03:53.967 --> 03:56.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the United States in
Washington today

03:56.169 --> 03:59.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHAN VERBEKE, Belgian
Ambassador to the United
States: Some indications pointed
to the fact

03:59.239 --> 04:05.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that something may happen. The
security levels
were heightened. The presence of
security

04:05.545 --> 04:13.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, including military,
quite visible,
had been enhanced. And still it
happened,

04:13.587 --> 04:21.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so the answer to your question
is, it can
happen even when you take all
security preparedness.

04:21.261 --> 04:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: World leaders,
including President
Obama, pledged solidarity with
the Belgians.

04:26.533 --> 04:29.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He learned of the attacks on the
second day
of his visit to Cuba.

04:29.402 --> 04:32.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
We will do whatever is necessary
to support

04:32.038 --> 04:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our friend and ally Belgium in
bringing to
justice those who are
responsible, and this

04:38.612 --> 04:44.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is yet another reminder that the
world must
unite. We must be together,
regardless of

04:44.651 --> 04:51.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nationality or race or faith, in
fighting
against the scourge of
terrorism.

04:51.725 --> 04:57.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And in Paris,
President Francois
Hollande urged leaders
everywhere to recognize

04:57.097 --> 04:58.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the danger.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): Terrorism hit
Belgium, but Europe

05:01.568 --> 05:07.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was targeted, and the whole
world is concerned.
We are facing a global threat,
which demands

05:07.140 --> 05:09.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a global response.

05:09.042 --> 05:14.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The immediate
response in Britain,
France, Germany and elsewhere,
was to bolster

05:14.414 --> 05:19.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security at airports, train
stations and border
crossings.

05:19.419 --> 05:25.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the U.S., similar measures
were taken in
major urban areas, including
Washington and

05:25.192 --> 05:26.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New York.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL DE BLASIO (D), Mayor of New
York: Let
me say at the outset, there is
no specific

05:30.096 --> 05:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and credible threat against New
York City
at this time, but we are in a
high state of

05:35.569 --> 05:37.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vigilance and readiness.

05:37.404 --> 05:42.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The Brussels
Airport, meanwhile,
will stay closed at least
through Wednesday.

05:42.442 --> 05:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later today, President Obama
ordered U.S.
flags lowered to half-staff at
government

05:47.147 --> 05:52.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
buildings. And the Department of
Homeland
Security said it has no credible
intelligence

05:52.319 --> 05:57.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of any threat to the United
States. We will
return to the Brussels attacks
after the news

05:57.057 --> 05:58.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

05:58.892 --> 06:02.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The bombings
dominated much
of the day for the U.S.
presidential candidates.

06:02.796 --> 06:08.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican front-runner Donald
Trump suggested
using torture to disrupt future
attacks.

06:08.368 --> 06:14.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told NBC -- quote -- "If they
can expand
the laws, I would do a lot more
than water-boarding.

06:14.441 --> 06:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to get the information
from these
people" -- end quote.

06:17.811 --> 06:23.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's rival Ted Cruz went
further, calling
for police surveillance of
Muslim neighborhoods.

06:23.583 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
It's standard good policing to
direct your

06:29.589 --> 06:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resources to where the threat is
coming from.
We should do the exact same
thing are radical

06:33.627 --> 06:38.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islamic terrorism. We need to
work proactively
with the Muslim community
cooperatively, just

06:38.431 --> 06:42.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like when law enforcement is
going after gang
activity, you work with the
community where

06:42.769 --> 06:44.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gangs are located.

06:44.604 --> 06:48.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the Democratic
side, Hillary
Clinton called for policies that
are -- quote

06:48.174 --> 06:54.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "consistent with our values."
And she told
NBC: "It's unrealistic to say
we're going

06:54.147 --> 06:57.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to completely shut down our
borders to everyone."

06:57.617 --> 07:02.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fellow Democrat Bernie Sanders
appealed for
international solidarity, as did
Republican

07:02.922 --> 07:09.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Kasich. Both parties hold
nominating
primaries today in Arizona and
Utah. Democrats

07:09.562 --> 07:12.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
also hold caucuses in Idaho.

07:12.198 --> 07:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A planned courtroom
battle between
Apple and the FBI never happened
today. Instead,

07:18.405 --> 07:24.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal prosecutors said they
may not need
Apple to unlock the iPhone used
by the mass

07:24.477 --> 07:29.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shooters in San Bernardino. They
say an outside
party came forward over the
weekend and showed

07:29.549 --> 07:34.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the FBI how to access data on
the encrypted
phone after all.

07:34.087 --> 07:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The new NATO and
U.S. commander
in Afghanistan apologized today
for the American

07:40.226 --> 07:42.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bombing of a hospital last year.

07:42.462 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General John Nicholson traveled
to Kunduz
and met with victims' relatives
and staff

07:47.434 --> 07:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the now-closed hospital. The
October strike
killed 42 people and wounded
dozens more.

07:54.274 --> 07:59.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A U.S. investigation found that
it was -- quote
-- "tragic and avoidable," and
more than a

07:59.346 --> 08:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dozen military personnel were
punished.

08:02.148 --> 08:07.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Indonesia,
thousands of taxi
drivers protested in Jakarta,
demanding a

08:07.520 --> 08:13.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ban on Uber and other
ride-hailing apps. The
demonstration wreaked traffic
chaos in the

08:13.660 --> 08:18.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
city's already-congested
streets. Cabbies
carried banners denouncing the
competition

08:18.398 --> 08:24.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as illegal, and even assaulted
some motorbike
drivers working for the apps.

08:24.971 --> 08:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Close
Uber and GrabCar,
please, because we're suffering
losses now.

08:31.111 --> 08:35.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government said the apps
will encourage
young people to use public
transport. But

08:35.115 --> 08:39.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since GrabCar and Uber came into
the market,
we have been having a hard time
earning a

08:39.352 --> 08:41.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
living.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Today marked the
second such protest
by taxi drivers in Jakarta this
month.

08:44.958 --> 08:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The former mayor
of Toronto,
Canada, Rob Ford, died today,
after a career

08:50.330 --> 08:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marred by drinking and drug
problems. Ford
was elected in 2010, but a
series of scandals

08:56.770 --> 09:02.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
erupted, and he ultimately
admitted using
crack cocaine. He dropped a
reelection bid

09:02.575 --> 09:08.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after being diagnosed with a
rare cancer,
but later won a city council
seat. Rob Ford

09:08.214 --> 09:09.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was 46 years old.

09:10.016 --> 09:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In economic news,
Wall Street
struggled to gain traction after
the Brussels

09:14.053 --> 09:20.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks hurt airline and travel
company stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 41 points

09:20.493 --> 09:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to close at 17582. The Nasdaq
rose 12 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped about
two.

09:27.600 --> 09:32.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And about 30 of
the real-life
Rosie the Riveters were honored
in Washington

09:32.939 --> 09:38.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today for building planes and
doing other
vital jobs during World War II.
The women,

09:39.012 --> 09:44.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many in their 80s and 90s, took
a special
flight from Detroit. They wore
red and white

09:44.617 --> 09:50.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
polka dot head scarves,
mimicking the image
in the famous "We Can Do It"
poster.

09:50.123 --> 09:55.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, they visited the U.S.
Capitol and the
World War II Memorial. It was
all part of

09:55.462 --> 09:57.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Women's History Month.

09:57.297 --> 10:01.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour":
what the Brussels attacks mean
in the global

10:01.734 --> 10:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight against terror; President
Obama pressures
Cuba on human rights; the
difficulties of

10:07.874 --> 10:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
educating children in foster
care; and much
more.

10:15.682 --> 10:28.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now back to the
attacks in
Brussels and the latest on the
investigation

10:28.828 --> 10:30.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into who was behind them.

10:30.530 --> 10:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn to Peter Spiegel. He's
the Brussels
bureau chief for The Financial
Times.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to you, Peter Spiegel.

10:37.403 --> 10:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what is the very latest
that's known about
figuring out who was behind
this?

10:42.609 --> 10:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER SPIEGEL, The Financial
Times: Well,
this evening, the Brussels
authorities put

10:46.479 --> 10:51.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out a photo of sort of three men
carrying
luggage carts at the airport
just before the

10:51.751 --> 10:53.486 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
explosion.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have identified them as,
they think,
the three perpetrators. Two of
them, they

10:55.522 --> 10:59.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe, are the actual bombers,
and then
the third is on the loose now.
There have

10:59.259 --> 11:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been raids all day in the
Schaerbeek neighborhood,
which is just north of here.
They have more

11:03.696 --> 11:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evidence there that ISIS is --
that cell was
quite entrenched.

11:07.367 --> 11:11.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They found more bomb materials.
They found
chemicals. They found ISIS flags
and other

11:11.471 --> 11:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paraphernalia. They are trying
to basically
find out how broad and how deep
this network

11:16.776 --> 11:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was. It's suspected that it is
linked to arrests
that you mentioned in your
opening piece,

11:20.880 --> 11:24.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Salah Abdeslam, who was the --
one of the
bombers who sort of fled Paris
and didn't

11:24.584 --> 11:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kill himself, one of the only
surviving -- believed
to be one of the surviving
plotters from the

11:28.421 --> 11:30.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Paris attack.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The arrest happened on Friday.
There's some
speculation, some belief in the
officials

11:32.592 --> 11:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we talked to that perhaps these
plotters terrorists
moved up their attack because
they were afraid

11:36.229 --> 11:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abdeslam was talking to police
and had maybe
ratted them out. And so there
was some belief

11:40.800 --> 11:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they moved up the attack.

11:42.635 --> 11:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're trying to find out right
now how much
that cell is implanted here in
Brussels. But

11:47.507 --> 11:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other than that, that claim of
credit that
ISIS has put out over their
Internet sites,

11:52.845 --> 11:57.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we really don't have a huge
amount of information
right now about who these guys
are, where

11:57.183 --> 11:58.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they were based.

11:59.018 --> 12:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police have actually pled
for information
for the one person they think is
on the run.

12:02.155 --> 12:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yet again, sort of catching
authorities
by surprise and they don't have
a huge amount

12:06.459 --> 12:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of ideas right now about who
these guys are.

12:08.595 --> 12:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Brussels
was on high
alert, we know, after the arrest
of the Paris

12:13.333 --> 12:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suspect, Mr. Abdeslam, last week
and it had
been on alert since the Paris
attack.

12:20.873 --> 12:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A number of experts today are
saying, why
wasn't Brussels better prepared?

12:24.911 --> 12:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD+IT /MD-IT /PETER SPIEGEL:
Yes. And
the Belgian authorities have
come under a

12:29.682 --> 12:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of pressure, a lot of attack
even back
from the Paris attacks.

12:32.619 --> 12:36.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You remember the Paris attacks
were largely
organized here in Brussels in
the Molenbeek

12:36.889 --> 12:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
neighborhood, which is really
just a mile
away from where I'm talking to
you here. So

12:40.693 --> 12:44.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this has been -- the Belgians
get very defensive
about this. Why all the Belgian
bashing?

12:44.831 --> 12:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact of the matter is
that a number
of the jihadis, particularly
those who travel

12:49.035 --> 12:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into Syria as foreign fighters,
had come from
Brussels and other parts of
Belgium. Belgium

12:53.640 --> 12:58.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has the largest percentage of
nationals who
have gone to Syria and Iraq to
fight for ISIS.

12:58.778 --> 13:03.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a perception, at
least, that
they had used Brussels as sort
of an organizing

13:03.483 --> 13:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place. The Belgian authorities
dispute this.
They don't think they're any
worse they Paris

13:08.388 --> 13:13.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or any of the other major cities
that have
large and sometimes radicalized
Muslim populations,

13:13.493 --> 13:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but what is true, in talking to
Belgian officials,
is that up until about 18 months
ago, Belgium

13:18.297 --> 13:22.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
didn't invest in the
intelligence assets,
in the military assets that are
needed to

13:22.135 --> 13:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
counter these kind of radical
groups.

13:25.738 --> 13:30.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After Charlie Hebdo in
particular and some
of the associated raids after
that, the new

13:30.143 --> 13:33.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Belgian government did start
ramping up the
amount of money they're putting
into their

13:33.346 --> 13:36.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence services, into the
security services.
But the question is whether it's
been too

13:36.582 --> 13:38.351 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
little too late.

13:38.384 --> 13:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have to ramp up so quickly
to try to
get the handle on this thing,
that this could

13:41.320 --> 13:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been a lapse and inability
because they
are so behind the heart of the
curve right

13:46.359 --> 13:48.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

13:48.227 --> 13:50.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
®MD+IT /MD-IT /Peter
Spiegel, what is the security
situation there

13:50.329 --> 13:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now? Are they expecting more
attacks?

13:52.532 --> 13:58.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD+IT /MD-IT /PETER SPIEGEL:
Well, we're
back on level four, which is the
terror alert

13:58.805 --> 14:00.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for imminent attack.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But literally just a few hours
ago, they told
us all we could leave our
buildings. Parents

14:04.577 --> 14:08.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were able to pick their kids up
from school
who were basically held at the
school for

14:08.448 --> 14:11.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most of the afternoon. So we're
not in sort
of a lockdown situation, if you
remember,

14:11.684 --> 14:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after November, after the Paris
attacks, where
the Belgian authorities said we
had to sort

14:15.088 --> 14:17.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of like hide in place for about
a week.

14:17.457 --> 14:21.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not in that situation now.
There is
a general feeling that this
current attack

14:21.260 --> 14:25.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is now over, that they have this
cell on the
run or they have going into
hiding.

14:25.231 --> 14:31.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, there is nervousness
that because
they do have these suspects in
detention,

14:31.604 --> 14:35.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that these suspects and
particularly Abdeslam
have knowledge about the cells
that are operating

14:35.641 --> 14:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Europe, that some of these
other cells
will come out and act now, for
fear of being

14:40.613 --> 14:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turned up and arrested in the
days to come.

14:43.316 --> 14:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Peter Spiegel,
who is the Brussels
bureau chief for The Financial
Times, we thank

14:48.187 --> 14:50.089 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

14:50.123 --> 14:56.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on the
threat of terrorism
in Europe and beyond, I'm joined
by Rick Nelson

14:56.262 --> 15:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Cross Match Technologies.
He's a former
Naval officer who served at the
National Security

15:01.334 --> 15:06.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Council and the National
Counterterrorism
Center. And Lorenzo Vidino,
director of the

15:06.773 --> 15:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program on Extremism at the
Center for Cyber
and Homeland Security at George
Washington

15:12.378 --> 15:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University. He is an expert on
radicalization
and terrorism in Europe and he
has advised

15:17.750 --> 15:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. and European lawmakers.

15:19.685 --> 15:24.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lorenzo Vidino, based on
everything that we
have just heard and everything
that we just

15:24.490 --> 15:30.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the reporter in Brussels,
Peter Spiegel,
are we now engaged in truly a
global war now?

15:30.663 --> 15:35.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LORENZO VIDINO, George
Washington University:
I think it's undeniable that
ISIS has inspired

15:35.101 --> 15:37.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
individuals worldwide to carry
out attacks.

15:37.637 --> 15:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what we're seeing
now is that
ISIS is directing. That is kind
of the novelty

15:42.008 --> 15:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Paris attacks and part of
the Brussels
attacks today, is directly
engaged in attacking

15:48.881 --> 15:55.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Africa, Middle East and
the West. So
we have more organized clusters
and networks

15:55.922 --> 15:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have received training in
Syria and Iraq
and have received the order to
mobilize and

15:59.659 --> 16:01.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
carry out the attacks.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they are more sophisticated
than the individuals
who are just inspired by ISIS
ideology, like,

16:05.932 --> 16:10.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, the San Bernardino
shooters here
in the United States. There is a
different

16:10.236 --> 16:14.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
degree of sophistication when
you receive
some sort of training and
experience in the

16:14.173 --> 16:18.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
battlefield and radicalization
that ISIS provides
to individuals throughout
Europe.

16:18.544 --> 16:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Rick Nelson, are you
persuaded
that this is connected to the
Paris attacks?

16:22.481 --> 16:26.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RICK NELSON, Cross Match
Technologies: I am
indeed persuaded.

16:26.485 --> 16:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS has been building networks
in Europe
for close to three years now,
and there's

16:30.990 --> 16:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no doubt in my mind that there
are significant
networks throughout Europe,
leveraging Belgium

16:37.230 --> 16:42.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Brussels in particular, and
we saw that
in France, but we saw that today
in Belgium.

16:42.368 --> 16:45.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately I think there
are going
to be more attacks on the
horizon that will

16:45.104 --> 16:46.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be connected to these cells.

16:46.973 --> 16:50.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, staying with
you, Rick Nelson,
maybe you could answer for
people who just

16:50.343 --> 16:52.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
follow this casually, why
Belgium?

16:52.511 --> 16:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK NELSON: Well, Belgium has a
number of
issues that it faces.

16:57.149 --> 17:02.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really is a microcosm for the
larger issues
that are facing Europe. First
and foremost,

17:02.989 --> 17:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe in general, Belgium
specifically, has
not done a very good job of
integrating many

17:07.994 --> 17:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these Muslim communities into
their larger
society. A lot of these
communities are in

17:12.765 --> 17:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enclaves in urban environments.

17:14.967 --> 17:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is not a lot of hope for
jobs. There's
not a lot of hope to get out of
these environments,

17:20.673 --> 17:27.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that really puts in place a
sense of disenfranchisement,
of marginalization, and ISIS and
other terrorist

17:27.146 --> 17:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups are very, very effective
at capitalizing
on that marginalization and
getting these

17:31.317 --> 17:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals to join their cause
or to take
an act of violence that gives
them a larger

17:35.922 --> 17:40.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sense of meaning and perhaps a
pathway out
of the situation they find
themselves in.

17:40.259 --> 17:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Lorenzo Vidino, do
Belgian authorities
have any kind of hold on this?
How do you

17:45.631 --> 17:51.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
monitor suspicions? Are there
resources enough
to follow up on every single
threat that you

17:51.604 --> 17:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hear about or is reported to
you?

17:53.506 --> 17:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORENZO VIDINO: No, I think
that's a general
problem throughout Europe, but
it's particularly

17:56.375 --> 18:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acute in Belgium, where --
because of a variety
of issues that have to do with
lack of investment

18:01.614 --> 18:03.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in intelligence and law
enforcement.

18:03.516 --> 18:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The federal nature of the
Belgian state, with
a lot of divisions with
different forces there

18:07.787 --> 18:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and don't talk to one another,
they are severely
understaffed. Add to that the
fact that Belgium

18:12.992 --> 18:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provides an incredibly large,
disproportionate
number of foreign fighters, so
they're stretched

18:19.332 --> 18:21.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
extremely thin.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As I say, it's a problem
throughout Europe,
but particularly acute in
Belgium and investments

18:24.837 --> 18:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have been made in law
enforcement now
are sort of a bit too little,
too late.

18:28.341 --> 18:33.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Rick Nelson, how
should other
countries be responding if this
is indeed

18:33.179 --> 18:34.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now a global threat?

18:34.981 --> 18:40.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK NELSON: One of the things
this is going
to force in the European Union
and beyond

18:40.119 --> 18:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the fact that these nations
are going to
have to share information more
readily than

18:44.023 --> 18:45.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they have in the past.

18:45.858 --> 18:49.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has been some hesitation
by countries
to share intelligence
information throughout

18:49.395 --> 18:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the E.U. I think France started
the dialogue
moving forward. And Belgium, the
incidents

18:54.467 --> 18:59.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today just further reiterate
this, is that
the European nations are going
to have to

18:59.505 --> 19:03.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
share intelligence and
information if they're
going to be successful against
these threats.

19:03.743 --> 19:07.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These threats, these attacks are
very basic.
They're very rudimentary, even
though the

19:07.980 --> 19:12.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
command-and-control may be
sophisticated.
They're going to be very
difficult to identify

19:12.351 --> 19:17.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in advance unless there is very
credible intelligence
and the countries are going to
have to work

19:17.757 --> 19:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
together to build that credible
intelligence
to thwart these attacks.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Lorenzo Vidino, it
seems incredible
after all this time that there
wouldn't be

19:24.563 --> 19:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
improved intelligence-sharing at
this stage.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORENZO VIDINO: It has gotten
better over
the last few years.

19:29.802 --> 19:33.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's more coordination. The
reality is
that there is a lot of talk of
creating sort

19:33.639 --> 19:40.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of a European FBI, a law
enforcement intelligence
agency that supervises the work.
There is

19:40.479 --> 19:47.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europol, but Europol doesn't
really have the
same basic capabilities that a
real transnational,

19:47.920 --> 19:50.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pan-European law enforcement
agency would
have.

19:50.389 --> 19:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It facilitates the passage of
information,
but really doesn't have
arresting powers.

19:54.927 --> 20:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Really, 99 percent, I would say,
of the counterterrorism
capability rests with individual
countries.

20:02.101 --> 20:07.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you have those petty
jealousies, those
political issues, those divides
that create

20:07.506 --> 20:09.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a lot of problems.

20:09.442 --> 20:12.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Terrorists don't know borders.
They go from
one European country to the
other. Law enforcement,

20:12.344 --> 20:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence are very much stuck
within their
own borders.

20:15.481 --> 20:18.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Rick Nelson,
whenever we have
talked about battling ISIS, at
least in this

20:19.018 --> 20:25.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, it's always seemed
territorial, putting
boots on the ground, somehow
saving Raqqa,

20:25.057 --> 20:30.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making it a very Syrian-based
war. Is this
something that now is going to
have -- are

20:30.629 --> 20:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we going to have to expand our
thinking about
how to battle ISIS?

20:33.132 --> 20:35.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICK NELSON: Well, absolutely.

20:35.367 --> 20:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, what we have seen with
all -- most
terrorist groups, at least in
the last 15

20:40.005 --> 20:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, that, you know, the idea
of having
a safe haven or a piece of
terrorist territory

20:45.411 --> 20:49.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from which to operate is
critical to these
organizations.

20:49.215 --> 20:52.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what has made -- one of the
things that
has made ISIS so successful is
that they do

20:52.985 --> 20:57.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a piece of territory in
Syria and Iraq,
where they are building, have
the ability

20:57.790 --> 21:02.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to plan, the ability to
communicate, the ability
to train. They have got a safe
haven in that

21:02.862 --> 21:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
area of the world where they can
train these
fighters, send them back, they
can communicate

21:06.765 --> 21:08.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
relatively freely.

21:08.567 --> 21:12.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as long as they have the
area to operate
freely and to plan and conduct
these types

21:13.005 --> 21:17.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of attacks, you are going to see
these cells
continue to grow and continue to
be a problem

21:17.943 --> 21:19.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for not only Europe, but the
United States.

21:19.745 --> 21:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And as long as there
is a civil
war that shows no signs of
abating in Syria,

21:24.383 --> 21:26.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is there any way to really get
to the root
of this?

21:26.619 --> 21:30.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORENZO VIDINO: I think that's
very difficult.
Rick is spot on in saying that
as long as

21:30.055 --> 21:35.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a base there in Syria
and Iraq, and
particularly in Syria, there's
no end in sight,

21:35.060 --> 21:36.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the problem will be
there.

21:36.996 --> 21:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If anything, actually, it's
getting more acute,
because we're seeing that ISIS
is developing

21:40.199 --> 21:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also secondary bases. I think
Libya is particularly
interesting. We are starting to
see that there's

21:45.204 --> 21:50.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a minor flow of foreign fighters
no longer
going to Syria and Iraq, but
going to Libya,

21:50.409 --> 21:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is obviously even closer
to Europe.
And I think that's also very
problematic.

21:53.345 --> 21:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is it fair to say
that Belgium,
France, the United States should
be bracing

21:58.484 --> 22:00.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for more attacks?

22:00.252 --> 22:03.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LORENZO VIDINO: I think
particularly in Europe,
I think that's a very likely
scenario.

22:03.055 --> 22:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the United States faces
a minor threat
compared to -- a smaller threat
compared to

22:08.227 --> 22:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe. We do not see the same
level of sophistication.
We see individuals that are
linked to ISIS

22:13.899 --> 22:18.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from an ideological point of
view, very few
with operational ties that do
exist here,

22:18.904 --> 22:21.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the size, the magnitude of
the threat
in Europe is much, much bigger.

22:21.774 --> 22:25.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Lorenzo Vidino of
George Washington
University and Rick Nelson of
Cross Match

22:25.578 --> 22:30.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Technologies, thank you both
very much.

22:30.449 --> 22:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LORENZO VIDINO: Pleasure.

22:32.851 --> 22:36.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICK NELSON: Thank you.

22:36.088 --> 22:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We earlier heard
from President
Obama in Cuba when he spoke of
the Brussels

22:42.194 --> 22:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks. He had additional
business to do
in Havana today, including a
major address

22:47.700 --> 22:49.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Cuban people.

22:49.401 --> 22:51.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

22:51.537 --> 22:56.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I believe in the Cuban people.

22:56.709 --> 23:01.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In the final speech
of his historic
visit, President Obama laid out
a future of

23:01.981 --> 23:03.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
possibilities, but no
guarantees.

23:03.983 --> 23:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: I have come here
to bury the
last remnant of the Cold War in
the Americas.

23:10.289 --> 23:16.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I want the Cuban people,
especially the young
people, to understand why I
believe that you

23:16.262 --> 23:22.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should look to the future with
hope, not the
false promise which insists that
things are

23:22.234 --> 23:27.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better than they really are, or
the blind
optimism that says all your
problems can go

23:27.373 --> 23:29.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
away tomorrow.

23:29.108 --> 23:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: With state TV beaming
the speech
into Cuban households, Mr. Obama
talked of

23:32.945 --> 23:34.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
freedom.

23:34.847 --> 23:38.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: But let me tell
you what I believe.
I can't force you to agree, but
you should

23:38.951 --> 23:40.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know what I think.

23:40.753 --> 23:46.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe citizens should be
free to speak
their mind without fear, to
organize and to

23:46.592 --> 23:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criticize their government and
to protest
peacefully, and that the rule of
law shouldn't

23:53.799 --> 23:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
include arbitrary detentions of
people who
exercise those rights.

23:57.002 --> 24:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Yesterday, the
communist island's
state-run media ignored Cuban
President Raul

24:03.008 --> 24:08.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Castro's tense exchange with
American reporters
on political prisoners. But,
today, with all

24:08.213 --> 24:13.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Cuba watching, Mr. Obama
directly addressed
Castro, who looked on from a
balcony.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: And given your
commitment to
Cuba's sovereignty and
self-determination,

24:16.622 --> 24:21.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am also confident that you
need not fear
the different voices of the
Cuban people and

24:21.827 --> 24:24.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their capacity to speak and
assemble and vote
for their leaders.

24:24.797 --> 24:29.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Obama went on to
urge the Castro
government to improve commercial
ties. At

24:29.735 --> 24:33.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same time, he repeated his
own commitment
to lift the U.S. trade embargo.

24:33.839 --> 24:40.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: It is an outdated
burden on
the Cuban people. It's a burden
on the Americans

24:40.379 --> 24:47.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who want to work and do business
or invest
here in Cuba. It's time to lift
the embargo.

24:47.619 --> 24:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This isn't the first
time the president's
made that pledge, and he took
nearly 40 members

24:52.725 --> 24:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Congress along to reinforce
the message.

24:55.461 --> 24:59.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here in Washington, the odds
of getting
lawmakers to approve a total
repeal of the

24:59.765 --> 25:06.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
embargo remain slim. There are
still major
roadblocks, due mainly to Cuba's
human rights

25:06.305 --> 25:07.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
record.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
House Speaker Paul Ryan
reinforced that point
today at a briefing.

25:10.843 --> 25:14.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
And the president takes a trip
to Cuba, where

25:14.680 --> 25:20.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he effectively gets nothing in
return, and
he legitimizes a tyrannical
dictatorship.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The irony wasn't lost on me.

25:22.421 --> 25:26.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: All the
individuals around this
table have shown extraordinary
courage.

25:26.492 --> 25:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: After his speech in
Havana, Mr.
Obama met with Cuban dissidents
at the U.S.

25:31.363 --> 25:36.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Embassy. He praised their
courage and said
America's own history is proof
of how change

25:36.535 --> 25:38.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can come.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

25:40.973 --> 25:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us for a
look at the
first baseball game between Cuba
and an American

25:47.212 --> 25:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Major League team in nearly 20
years; plus,
refugees in limbo as a new deal
promises to

25:53.819 --> 26:00.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
send them back Turkey; and
preparing for what
some say is the inevitable, a
tsunami on the

26:00.159 --> 26:02.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
West Coast.

26:02.060 --> 26:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, they are among the
most difficult
populations to educate. When
compared to their

26:09.268 --> 26:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peers, children living in foster
care are
far more likely to be suspended
or expelled

26:14.840 --> 26:19.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from school, and end up
incarcerated or homeless
later in life.

26:19.411 --> 26:24.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in Pittsburgh, the city's
child welfare
system has tried an innovative
approach that

26:24.249 --> 26:26.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could become a model for others.

26:26.084 --> 26:31.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s April Brown has
the first
of two stories, part of our
American Graduate

26:31.423 --> 26:35.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
series, a public media
initiative funded by
the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, and

26:36.028 --> 26:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the latest installment in our
weekly series
Making the Grade.

26:40.098 --> 26:46.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: At only 19 years
old, Lafayette
Goode has already faced a
lifetime of challenges

26:46.138 --> 26:47.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
growing up in a rough section of
Pittsburgh.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAFAYETTE GOODE, Former Foster
Youth: I got
kicked out of my house at 13.
That was the

26:51.009 --> 26:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hardest thing I ever had to deal
with, because
I couldn't believe my mom was
really trying

26:54.313 --> 26:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to kick me out at this age.
Like, I'm so young.
Like, where am I going to go?

26:58.116 --> 27:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Where Lafayette
went was into
Allegheny County's child welfare
system before

27:03.255 --> 27:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he turned 14. As a foster youth,
he was hardly
alone.

27:07.259 --> 27:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANDERS, Casey Family
Programs: There
are about 400,000 children in
foster care

27:11.463 --> 27:13.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nationally.

27:13.265 --> 27:16.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: David Sanders is a
vice president
at Casey Family Programs, an
organization

27:16.168 --> 27:18.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that works to improve foster
care across the
nation.

27:18.804 --> 27:25.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANDERS: If you walk in as
a social
worker to a child's home, it
might be the

27:25.210 --> 27:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very last time that that child
ever sees their
bedroom.

27:28.180 --> 27:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, oftentimes, we
forget that to
get into foster care, they were
abused or

27:33.118 --> 27:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
neglected probably to a level
that is quite
significant to actually be moved
from their

27:38.490 --> 27:40.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
families.

27:40.292 --> 27:43.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The educational
statistics for
youth in foster care have been
consistently

27:43.395 --> 27:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grim. Multistate studies have
found that just
50 percent finish high school.
Of that group,

27:48.967 --> 27:53.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
only 20 percent go on to
college, and fewer
than one in 10 of those students
actually

27:53.839 --> 27:56.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
earn a bachelor's degree.

27:56.408 --> 28:01.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For all his early challenges,
Lafayette Goode
is now on a positive path. He
graduated high

28:01.313 --> 28:05.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
school on time, and is planning
to start a
trade school program soon. How
he beat the

28:05.984 --> 28:11.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
odds is a testament to a network
of support
systems put in place by Marc
Cherna, who was

28:11.056 --> 28:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hired 20 years ago to take over
the county's
child welfare system.

28:14.126 --> 28:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC CHERNA, Director, Allegheny
County Department
of Human Services: It was a
system that was

28:16.595 --> 28:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of control. It had quite a
few child deaths.
It had caseloads that were
expanding every

28:23.602 --> 28:29.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
month. Very few, if any, systems
were in place
at all. And we were vilified by
the community.

28:29.841 --> 28:33.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Cherna began his
reform effort
by asking the community
questions.

28:33.579 --> 28:41.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC CHERNA: The worst thing you
can do is
come into a place and say, I
have got all

28:41.853 --> 28:43.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the answers.

28:43.789 --> 28:48.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The tradition of
community consultation
continues today, both in large
groups and

28:49.027 --> 28:53.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in smaller ones. We joined
Cherna recently
at Ritter's, a local diner
that's like his

28:53.832 --> 28:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
second office, because he has so
many breakfast
meetings here.

28:57.936 --> 29:02.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since coming to Pittsburgh,
Cherna has helped
dramatically reduce caseloads,
and pushed

29:02.207 --> 29:06.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for more supports that allow
children in the
system to stay with family
members.

29:06.078 --> 29:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC CHERNA: Kids do better in
their own homes
whenever possible. And the
highest correlation

29:11.617 --> 29:17.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for really low grades and
attendance and everything
else is, the more they move, the
worse things

29:17.556 --> 29:22.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are. Just something as simple as
that, identifying
that and then doing
intervention, it really

29:22.427 --> 29:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can make a difference for kids.

29:24.229 --> 29:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Cherna's office
also started
collecting data, loads of it,
including data

29:28.166 --> 29:33.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Pittsburgh Public
Schools. It revealed
that fewer than one-third of
kids in foster

29:33.071 --> 29:42.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care have a 2.5 GPA or higher.
And only about
42 percent of them were
proficient in reading.

29:42.581 --> 29:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another hallmark of Cherna's
tenure has been
hiring adults who went through
the system

29:46.184 --> 29:51.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
themselves to mentor and
advocate for current
foster youth. They're known as
youth support

29:51.690 --> 29:53.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
partners.

29:53.458 --> 29:57.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Justin Quast (ph) is the man
Lafayette
relies on. He sometimes gives
rides and is

29:57.262 --> 30:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trained to provide anything from
emotional
support to helping youth get
social services

30:01.733 --> 30:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and building job skills..

30:03.502 --> 30:06.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN QUAST, Youth Support
Partner: He's
like so close to my age that we
understand

30:06.571 --> 30:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
each other. As soon as we met,
we just clicked.

30:09.374 --> 30:12.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Youth support partner
Lanika Dorsey
once needed a mentor herself.

30:12.744 --> 30:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANIKA DORSEY, Youth Support
Partner: I think
I first entered the system when
I was around

30:17.749 --> 30:19.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
3 or 4.

30:19.518 --> 30:23.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Lanika says abuse,
neglect and
constantly being forced to move
eventually

30:23.488 --> 30:29.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made her feel broken. She says,
for years,
she couldn't trust anyone. But
that changed

30:29.294 --> 30:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when she was paired with youth
support partner
Jovanna Robinson (ph).

30:33.265 --> 30:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANIKA DORSEY: She kept her
word. She made
me trust people and believe
people when they

30:43.275 --> 30:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said things to me. That's
something I never
had growing up throughout the
system.

30:47.779 --> 30:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: It was Jovanna who
suggested
Lanika could use her experiences
and become

30:52.184 --> 30:53.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a youth support partner herself.

30:53.952 --> 30:59.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANIKA DORSEY: Me being able to
help kids
helps me in a way, you know,
because I see

30:59.691 --> 31:06.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
myself in them a lot. But I'm a
work in progress.
Every day, I still work on me.
I'm still lost,

31:06.998 --> 31:08.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just not as lost.

31:08.767 --> 31:12.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: In addition to
youth support
partners, Allegheny County has
also hired

31:12.537 --> 31:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
educational liaisons like
William Battles.
Battles makes sure foster youth
like 19-year-old

31:17.843 --> 31:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jazmin Holmes (ph) are in class,
have the
credits to graduate high school,
and he makes

31:22.781 --> 31:32.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them aware of benefits like
scholarships that,
as foster youth, they're
eligible for.

31:32.124 --> 31:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Battles recently helped Jazmin
through the
enrollment process at the
Community College

31:36.027 --> 31:37.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Allegheny County.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BATTLES, Educational
Liaison: It's
very rewarding, because when you
are able

31:39.531 --> 31:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help them navigate the whole
admissions
process and financial aid, it
kind of eases

31:48.006 --> 31:52.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their mind of schools and
everything else
that's going on in their life
too, on top

31:52.644 --> 31:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a fresh start at a community
college or
university.

31:57.482 --> 32:02.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: While many foster
youth like
Jazmin focus on the future, it
has been important

32:02.587 --> 32:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the county's reform process
to have some
of them reflect on the past.

32:09.127 --> 32:13.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty-year-old Naadiya Cellars
was placed
in foster care five years ago
after her mother

32:13.498 --> 32:18.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
died. She's now encouraging
Pittsburgh residents
to consider becoming foster
parents. Naadiya

32:18.904 --> 32:22.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says it's often difficult to get
people to
simply remember that they are
kids.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAADIYA CELLARS, Former Foster
Youth: The
hardest part about being in
foster care is

32:23.875 --> 32:28.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you are not allowed to do
everything
else that everybody else is
allowed to do.

32:28.613 --> 32:32.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, all the rules, like, you
are not allowed
to spend the night at your
friend's house

32:32.050 --> 32:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unless they have clearances.
Those are always
the hardest parts.

32:34.753 --> 32:40.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANDERS: They want to be
seen as young
people who are facing life's
challenges, have

32:40.559 --> 32:45.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same dreams that any other
young person
has, but so often the fact that
they have

32:45.130 --> 32:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been in foster care, they feel
like they are
then stigmatized as being
failures or unlikely

32:50.602 --> 32:52.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to succeed.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think one of the most
important things
is to really dispel that notion.

32:55.440 --> 33:00.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Casey Family
Programs' David
Sanders credits Marc Cherna for
creating innovative

33:00.278 --> 33:05.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
programs that have helped reduce
the number
of youth in foster care by 60
percent over

33:05.550 --> 33:07.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the last two decades.

33:07.152 --> 33:11.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But replicating that kind of
success elsewhere
is no easy task, Sanders says.

33:12.023 --> 33:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One major reason for that?

33:13.892 --> 33:17.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SANDERS: The turnover
among child welfare
leaders makes it very difficult
to sustain

33:17.696 --> 33:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
progress. So, even if somebody
puts something
in place, what often happens is
that it's

33:22.067 --> 33:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dismantled as soon as somebody
new comes in,
and that rotation of leaders
happens every

33:26.671 --> 33:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year-and-a-half or two years.

33:28.506 --> 33:32.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: As new data comes
in, it's being
used to find out how well their
reforms are

33:32.510 --> 33:36.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working. And Marc Cherna knows
his work is
far from finished.

33:36.448 --> 33:40.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC CHERNA: I have been doing
this work for
over 40 years and if there was a
magic bullet,

33:40.719 --> 33:46.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we wouldn't be talking about it
today. This
is very complex work. There is
no easy solution.

33:46.091 --> 33:49.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been billions and
billions of dollars
spent on this.

33:49.094 --> 33:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of people way
smarter than me
who thought about this, and I
still struggle

33:53.899 --> 33:55.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with it.

33:55.333 --> 33:58.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm April
Brown in Pittsburgh.

33:58.470 --> 34:03.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Online, you can read
more on how
data is being used to support
Pennsylvania's

34:03.909 --> 34:09.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
most vulnerable children.

34:09.447 --> 34:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United
Nations Refugee
Agency says it will not
cooperate with a European

34:22.694 --> 34:26.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan to deport migrants arriving
in Greece
from Turkey.

34:26.998 --> 34:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNHCR said it would no longer
help to transfer
migrants and refugees to
detention centers,

34:33.638 --> 34:39.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from which some could be
deported. The agency's
action could disrupt the deal
with Turkey

34:39.577 --> 34:45.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
signed last Friday, which is
aimed at halting
the migrant flow. And the walls
being rebuilt

34:45.517 --> 34:50.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Europe will likely only grow
taller after
today's attacks in Brussels.

34:50.622 --> 34:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the island of Lesbos, in
Greece, special
correspondent Malcolm Brabant
reports.

34:55.360 --> 34:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This was one of
the last
boats to land on the beaches of
southern Lesbos.

34:59.998 --> 35:04.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a desperate attempt to
beat the deadline
set by Europe, which effectively
shut down

35:04.836 --> 35:09.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the refugee trail.

35:09.174 --> 35:17.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The screams marked the moment of
realization
that two people had been
suffocated in the

35:17.649 --> 35:27.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chaos and darkness of the
crossing. As medical
teams fought in vain to revive
the crush victims,

35:27.492 --> 35:31.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Syrian called Bashir spoke to
the migrants'
aspirations.

35:31.262 --> 35:37.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We hope they don't take
this into effect.
We hope that we can make it to
Europe. I don't

35:37.902 --> 35:43.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know if we get there. If we are
lucky, we
can move on. If we are not, I
don't know what

35:43.608 --> 35:45.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will happen to us.

35:45.410 --> 35:48.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: For two
consecutive nights,
the vigil of these volunteers on
the beaches

35:48.580 --> 35:55.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of southern Lesbos has been
futile. They have
spent long cold nights
anticipating new arrivals,

35:55.053 --> 35:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using the cover of darkness to
avoid Turkish
patrols.

35:57.856 --> 36:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But no one has reached the
shore. Spanish
lifeguards, who've rescued
thousands of people

36:04.062 --> 36:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the winter months have, for
the moment,
been made redundant by the ships
of Frontex,

36:09.100 --> 36:13.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Europe's border agency,
patrolling the waters
dividing Turkey from Greece.

36:13.238 --> 36:18.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yet volunteer Rebecca
Michaelides believes
the exodus from Turkey is just
temporarily

36:19.010 --> 36:20.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on hold.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA MICHAELIDES, Volunteer:
The people
will keep on coming because
they're very desperate

36:22.814 --> 36:30.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in leaving Turkey and just
trying for a better
future. Being turned back for us
and for myself

36:30.955 --> 36:34.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not really a solution to the
problem.

36:34.459 --> 36:40.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a lot deeper, and going
back to as deep
as the war in Syria that needs
to be stopped,

36:40.498 --> 36:44.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also to the hardship of
these people and
what they're going through, that
we need,

36:44.702 --> 36:46.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as Europe, to be -- to help
them.

36:46.938 --> 36:52.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The efforts to
reinforce
fortress Europe alarm Ahmad Ali,
a dentist

36:52.243 --> 36:57.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from a besieged Syrian city
close to the Iraqi
border. He asked us not to show
his face,

36:57.382 --> 37:00.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for fear of endangering
relatives still in
Syria.

37:00.085 --> 37:07.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMAD ALI, Refugee: We don't
need to go back.
Everybody here is worried about
the situation,

37:07.792 --> 37:16.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so we just -- we need to cross
the border
to search for our lives. We
can't stay here

37:16.668 --> 37:18.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a long time.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Prime
candidates to be among
the first deported are
Pakistanis, who are

37:21.673 --> 37:28.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regarded by many countries as
economic migrants.
They have been turning up at a
detention center

37:28.213 --> 37:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Lesbos to be registered. But
in a possible
blow to the E.U.-Turkey deal,
the United Nations

37:33.485 --> 37:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Refugee Agency said it wouldn't
work in these
camps because the migrants and
refugees were

37:38.556 --> 37:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being held against their will.

37:42.127 --> 37:47.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A large group of Pakistanis were
put in handcuffs
as they were sent to mainland
Greece for what

37:47.732 --> 37:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could be the first leg of a
journey back to
their homeland. The prospect of
being returned

37:52.837 --> 37:59.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Pakistan terrifies Imran
Sharif, a Christian
policeman who claims he faces
possible death

37:59.077 --> 38:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for alleged blasphemy against
Islam.

38:01.446 --> 38:10.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IMRAN SHARIF, Refugee: If the
Greece government
puts me back in Pakistan, where
there are

38:10.889 --> 38:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many people waiting for me to
kill me or put
me in the jail -- I don't like
that somebody

38:18.530 --> 38:24.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kills me in front of my child,
so if they
are trying to pull me back, I
will suicide

38:24.636 --> 38:26.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

38:26.604 --> 38:30.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: At the camp
that's been sheltering
the Pakistanis next to the
detention center,

38:30.341 --> 38:34.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
volunteer Ayesha Keller had this
advice for
would-be travelers waiting on
the Turkish

38:34.913 --> 38:36.648 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coast.

38:36.681 --> 38:39.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYESHA KELLER, Volunteer: At the
moment, I
don't think it's worth risking
your life to

38:39.150 --> 38:44.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cross over to Lesbos or one of
the other Greek
islands, because it's so unclear
what the

38:44.088 --> 38:50.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation is. It just doesn't
make sense on
a humanitarian level. And I
thought the E.U.

38:50.228 --> 38:54.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was about protecting human
rights, and now
they have agreed to something
like this.

38:54.566 --> 38:59.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand what they're trying
to do. I
understand that they want to cut
down smuggling

38:59.070 --> 39:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they want to cut down people
crossing
in a dangerous way. But this
doesn't just

39:04.075 --> 39:08.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seem to be a sensible solution.
And it's just
going to increase smuggling, as
all the borders

39:08.346 --> 39:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close. Rather than having a
legal way to cross,
people are going to go across
illegally.

39:12.250 --> 39:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: One of the main
reasons why
Turkey has accepted this deal
permitting the

39:16.354 --> 39:21.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
return of migrants is that it
was promised
that its application to join the
European

39:21.659 --> 39:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union will be fast-tracked. But
the terrorist
attacks in Brussels today have
damaged Turkey's

39:26.764 --> 39:28.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cause.

39:28.633 --> 39:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Skeptical governments are
reluctant to accept
Turkey because it would extend
the European

39:32.637 --> 39:38.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
borders to Syria and Iraq, and
would possibly
increase the likelihood of
terrorism within

39:38.209 --> 39:42.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the E.U. And so this
controversial arrangement
could be undermined.

39:42.981 --> 39:49.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are hugely uncertain times
for the migrants
trapped in Greece and facing
deportation.

39:49.354 --> 39:55.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Lesbos.

39:55.994 --> 40:09.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's a question of
when, not if,
a major seismic disaster will
strike the Pacific

40:09.841 --> 40:14.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Northwest. Scientists put the
odds of a big
earthquake and tsunami occurring
within the

40:14.379 --> 40:17.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
next 50 years at 37 percent.

40:17.548 --> 40:22.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what are coastal communities
doing to
prepare and to make sure that
they are resilient

40:22.920 --> 40:25.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the face of an extreme event?

40:25.089 --> 40:28.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" correspondent William
Brangham
decided to find out.

40:28.760 --> 40:33.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I'm standing
on the coast
of Washington. This is the very
edge of the

40:33.765 --> 40:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continental United States. And
just a few
miles out in the Pacific Ocean
is considered

40:38.069 --> 40:42.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the most dangerous
seismic faults in
all of North America.

40:42.507 --> 40:47.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists believe if that fault
were to rupture,
it could devastate much of the
Pacific Northwest.

40:47.679 --> 40:52.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fault is known as the
Cascadia subduction
zone, where two tectonic plates
meet underneath

40:52.517 --> 40:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Pacific Ocean. This fault
line stretches
700 miles along the coast.

40:56.921 --> 40:59.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN MURPHY, Federal Emergency
Management Agency:
Earthquakes have no season. It's
earthquake

40:59.691 --> 41:01.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
season every day.

41:01.592 --> 41:04.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ken Murphy is
FEMA's regional
administrator. He oversees
emergency operations

41:04.929 --> 41:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Northwest region. He
says if this
whole fault were to rupture, not
only would

41:09.634 --> 41:14.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there be a catastrophic
earthquake, but that
quake would then trigger an
enormous tsunami,

41:14.472 --> 41:17.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which would crash into the
Pacific Northwest
minutes later.

41:17.408 --> 41:24.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN MURPHY: You roughly have
about 140,000
square miles of communities and
land and people

41:24.582 --> 41:27.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up and down Washington, Oregon,
and Northern
California.

41:28.019 --> 41:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Major cities
like Seattle,
Vancouver and Portland could be
seriously

41:32.757 --> 41:40.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
damaged. FEMA estimates that in
an 8- or 9-magnitude
quake, nearly 13,000 people
could be killed,

41:40.398 --> 41:44.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with another 20,000 injured. A
million people
would be made homeless.

41:44.602 --> 41:47.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And to some, these are
conservative estimates.

41:47.238 --> 41:53.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN MURPHY: It's not just FEMA,
but how we
as a nation are going to respond
to this,

41:53.644 --> 41:56.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because it's really going to
take everybody's
efforts.

41:56.247 --> 42:01.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This threat
has people across
the Northwest worried, no more
so than in

42:01.119 --> 42:07.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coastal Washington, towns like
Westport, Ocean
Shores, Ocosta. Chuck Wallace is
an emergency

42:07.125 --> 42:08.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
manager for this county.

42:08.893 --> 42:10.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK WALLACE, Grays Harbor
County Emergency
Manager: If you're in an
inundation zone or

42:10.695 --> 42:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close to the coast, if you feel
an earthquake,
you have to suspect that a
tsunami could be

42:15.633 --> 42:19.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
following. And if there is one,
if they are
coming, we would have anywhere
from 15 to

42:20.004 --> 42:23.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
25 minutes along the coast to
move to higher
ground.

42:23.141 --> 42:27.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And so the
town of Ocosta,
with just a few thousand
residents, is now

42:27.645 --> 42:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
building this, a large tsunami
evacuation
shelter here on top of its
public school.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the first of its kind in
North America.

42:35.653 --> 42:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA AKERLUND, Superintendent,
Ocosta School
District: Well, right now we're
in the stair

42:37.488 --> 42:43.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tower. This is after the
earthquake. We're
evacuating to the rooftop for
the tsunami

42:43.795 --> 42:45.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evacuation.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So there's
four stairwells
like this one?

42:47.231 --> 42:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAULA AKERLUND: Yes.

42:49.066 --> 42:51.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Paula Akerlund
is the school
superintendent for the district,
and she was

42:51.702 --> 42:56.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instrumental in getting this
shelter built.
Akerlund said they started
discussing this

42:56.140 --> 43:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shelter four years ago. In an
ominous coincidence,
hours later, the massive tsunami
hit Japan.

43:04.615 --> 43:11.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The whole world watched as waves
destroyed
buildings and roads and entire
towns in just

43:11.322 --> 43:13.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a matter of minutes.

43:13.224 --> 43:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA AKERLUND: We learned a lot
about what
to do in this building from the
Japanese earthquake

43:18.930 --> 43:24.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and tsunami. So, one of the
things that we
knew from Japan is that some
buildings were

43:24.368 --> 43:24.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overtopped.

43:24.769 --> 43:25.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

43:25.903 --> 43:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Water coming
up over the
roof.

43:27.772 --> 43:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA AKERLUND: Yes. And so we
tried to make
the walls here high enough so
that that would

43:32.310 --> 43:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no happen. And then, also, I
think it will
serve another purpose, because
there will

43:36.080 --> 43:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be children up here with us and
they won't
really see what's happening, I
think, for

43:41.252 --> 43:42.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
awhile. I think that might be a
good thing.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Oh, so the
walls will protect
them from watching their
community.

43:45.756 --> 43:47.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAULA AKERLUND: Kind of protect
them from
watching.

43:47.558 --> 43:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our whole focus is on the safety
and welfare
of the kids, and so we try to
think about

43:52.964 --> 43:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
things like that.

43:54.899 --> 43:58.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And the kids
in Ocosta have
been absorbing some of this
concern too. Listen

43:58.836 --> 44:01.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to what we happened to hear in
this sixth
grade class.

44:01.372 --> 44:03.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Andrew, what are you
reading?

44:03.641 --> 44:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: I'm reading "Escaping
the Giant Wave."

44:06.210 --> 44:08.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Oh, "Escaping the Giant
Wave."

44:08.779 --> 44:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several of us sitting here have
been having
tsunami dreams. And we're just
taking it to

44:13.217 --> 44:17.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean that it's because it's in
the news, not
that it's any kind of
premonition. Yes, not

44:17.989 --> 44:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to happen, just something
because we
talk about it and stuff. But
tell me about

44:22.226 --> 44:25.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the title. How does the title
fit in with
what you're reading so far?

44:25.496 --> 44:32.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: The news truck blared
out there was
a tsunami coming at 5:30, and it
was 5:20.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: And was there actually a
tsunami coming?

44:35.072 --> 44:35.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

44:35.806 --> 44:37.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Yes. Goodness' sakes.

44:37.708 --> 44:41.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The highly
reinforced structure
they have built isn't just to
protect the

44:41.846 --> 44:47.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
620 students at the school. The
roof can hold
nearly 2,000 people, and
officials say no

44:47.852 --> 44:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one would be turned away in a
disaster, and
the shelter will be accessible
24/7 from this

44:52.990 --> 44:54.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
point forward.

44:54.792 --> 45:00.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The total cost? Just over $2
million. And
get this: No state or federal
money was used

45:00.398 --> 45:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offered to build it. Locals had
to vote on
a bond specifically to raise
their own taxes

45:05.803 --> 45:08.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to build this, and this isn't a
wealthy community.

45:08.506 --> 45:12.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAULA AKERLUND: I had no idea
whether it would
pass or not.

45:12.243 --> 45:19.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I told one of our teachers, if
the bond passes,
I will be doing a happy dance,
and he told

45:19.183 --> 45:24.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me it's going to pass by 70
percent. And it
did, it did. And I was doing a
little happy

45:24.655 --> 45:26.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
little dance, yes.

45:26.390 --> 45:30.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But how likely
is it that
this shelter will ever be
needed? Skeptics

45:30.861 --> 45:35.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can point out that there's no
recorded history
of a major quake and tsunami
here, so what's

45:35.433 --> 45:37.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the likelihood?

45:37.268 --> 45:42.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the answer to that can be
found in one
of the great seismological
detective stories,

45:42.707 --> 45:47.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it happened here on the
Copalis River,
about 40 miles north of Ocosta.
I went up

45:47.645 --> 45:49.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the river with local guide Dave
Agner.

45:49.480 --> 45:53.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you know how tall these
cedars would've
been back in their day?

45:53.250 --> 45:57.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what's known as the
Ghost Forest.
These dead cedar trees hold a
crucial clue

45:57.955 --> 46:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the very real danger facing
the Pacific
Northwest.

46:00.591 --> 46:05.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVE AGNER, Guide: William,
straight ahead
at 12:00. You see that tree that
is partially

46:05.796 --> 46:07.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the river and partially on
the land?

46:07.632 --> 46:12.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For years, it
was thought
these trees had died over time,
decades apart.

46:12.503 --> 46:18.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the late 1980s, two
scientists found
evidence that these trees all
died simultaneously,

46:18.242 --> 46:23.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the ground beneath them
plunged downwards
several feet, which is often
what occurs in

46:23.381 --> 46:25.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
subduction zone earthquakes.

46:25.483 --> 46:31.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They found strong evidence of a
major quake
300 years ago, but had it also
triggered a

46:31.555 --> 46:38.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tsunami? A few years later, a
Japanese scientist
proved that it had. He was
looking through

46:38.329 --> 46:43.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
centuries-old records trying to
understand
a mysterious tsunami that hit
Japan in 1700.

46:43.968 --> 46:49.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he saw the data from
Washington's Ghost
Forest, he realized they were
the exact same

46:49.907 --> 46:51.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
event.

46:51.842 --> 46:56.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That quake off Washington's
coast sent a tsunami
that not only flooded the
Pacific Northwest,

46:56.080 --> 47:00.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but also traveled 5,000 miles
across the ocean
and hit Japan.

47:00.151 --> 47:06.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVE AGNER: There was evidence
of a massive
one in 1700, and the Japanese
kept fantastic

47:06.590 --> 47:12.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
records. The shoguns required
very, very good
record-keeping, or you could
lose your life

47:12.096 --> 47:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you promised a certain crop
and it didn't
come in.

47:15.332 --> 47:20.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just a few
miles from the
Ghost Forest, another community
is trying

47:20.538 --> 47:25.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to grapple with this looming
threat in an
even more dramatic fashion. The
Quinault Indian

47:25.543 --> 47:28.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nation has lived along this
coast for centuries.

47:28.612 --> 47:30.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Fawn Sharp is their president.

47:30.414 --> 47:32.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAWN SHARP, President, Quinault
Indian Nation:
If you look behind me, you will
see where

47:32.183 --> 47:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our treaty was negotiated in
1855 at the mouth
of the Quinault River, where the
Quinault

47:36.120 --> 47:40.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
River meets the ocean. And it's
150 years
ago. Nobody at that time ever
anticipated

47:40.958 --> 47:44.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this entire central part of
our community
would ever be underwater.

47:44.895 --> 47:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This aerial
rendering of
their village shows how, in the
event of a

47:48.799 --> 47:54.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quake and tsunami, the entire
area would be
inundated with water. So,
they're going to

47:54.071 --> 48:00.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move the whole village up the
hill to this
spot. But moving an entire
village is not

48:00.211 --> 48:01.912 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
easy.

48:01.946 --> 48:04.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAWN SHARP: These are major
facilities. This
is a brand-new courthouse,
fairly new.

48:04.982 --> 48:06.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And that's
going to have
to be moved?

48:06.851 --> 48:10.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAWN SHARP: And that's going to
have to be
moved. Our community center, our
central gathering

48:11.021 --> 48:13.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place will have to obviously be
moved.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's a lot
of structures.

48:16.026 --> 48:20.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FAWN SHARP: Yes. Our membership
sees the exciting
opportunity of creating a new
village and

48:20.197 --> 48:24.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what that might look like, but
so many of
our memories are here in this
village, and

48:24.201 --> 48:27.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the thought of it being
underwater, you know,
there's a lot of trauma to that
prospect that

48:27.605 --> 48:29.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a very sacred site could no
longer exist.

48:29.940 --> 48:34.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Quinault
hope to have
the entire village moved to
higher ground

48:34.078 --> 48:36.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
within the next five years.

48:36.914 --> 48:41.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in Ocosta, the tsunami
shelter is just
getting its finishing touches.
Officials say,

48:41.252 --> 48:45.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if a quake hit tomorrow, the
shelter's ready
to hold anyone who can get here.

48:45.756 --> 48:50.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Emergency manager Chuck Wallace
says this
building, and how it got built,
is a model

48:50.427 --> 48:52.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of what a community can do.

48:52.129 --> 48:54.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK WALLACE: You know, you sit
back and
they always say, well,
government did this,

48:54.698 --> 48:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government did that. No, the
people did this.

48:56.467 --> 49:02.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA AKERLUND: This very small
community,
very self-reliant community
takes care of

49:02.439 --> 49:08.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other. People here were
willing to increase
their tax dollars to build this
facility for

49:08.712 --> 49:13.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their kids and their
grandchildren. So, I
think that that's a remarkable
thing.

49:13.417 --> 49:17.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They hope to
have a ribbon-cutting
for the shelter in June.

49:17.588 --> 49:23.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
along the Washington coast.

49:23.060 --> 49:32.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: diamond
diplomacy, and
a unique stage to heal decades
of division.

49:32.403 --> 49:34.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our story.

49:34.171 --> 49:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was baseball
with a Cuban
flair, as the thaw in U.S.-Cuban
diplomatic

49:35.973 --> 49:37.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relations spilled into the realm
of sports,
and a game with deep histories
in both nations.

49:37.808 --> 49:39.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The crowd cheered when President
Obama joined
Cuban President Raul Castro for
a game between

49:39.510 --> 49:41.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban
national
team, just the second such game
in more than

49:41.278 --> 49:42.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 years. There was a moment of
silence for
the victims of the Belgium
terror attacks,

49:42.646 --> 49:44.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
followed by the singing of the
national anthems
of both countries.

49:44.415 --> 49:46.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ceremonial first pitches
were thrown by
Luis Tiant, Cuban native and
former Major

49:46.116 --> 49:46.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
League star, and legendary Cuban
national
team pitcher Pedro Luis Lazo.
And then the

49:47.017 --> 49:48.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
game was on, with a bit more
symbolism.

49:48.886 --> 49:50.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rays lead-off batter Dayron
Varona is a native
Cuban who defected to the U.S.
three years

49:50.821 --> 49:52.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago in the hopes of playing
ball. One anticipated
byproduct of the warming
U.S.-Cuban relations

49:52.590 --> 49:53.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be a relaxation of the
embargo that
bans Cuban players from playing
in the U.S.

49:53.757 --> 49:55.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peter Bjarkman has written
widely on baseball
in Cuba.

49:55.526 --> 49:57.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BJARKMAN, Author, "A
History of Cuban
Baseball": The difficulty right
now is that

49:57.361 --> 49:59.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the players can only find a way
to Major League
Baseball if they defect, because
they're not

49:59.163 --> 50:00.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowed to legally emigrate out
of the country
to come and play professional
baseball.

50:00.931 --> 50:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, nothing has changed the
position of
the Cuban government. They are
willing to

50:02.800 --> 50:04.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk about making some of their
players available,
but they want to control the
ownership of

50:04.702 --> 50:05.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those players, have them come
back, play during
the winter season in Cuba, play
on the Cuban

50:05.135 --> 50:06.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
national team.

50:06.937 --> 50:08.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When the Rays
scored the first
run of the game, Michelle Obama
cheered, and

50:08.038 --> 50:09.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there was a handshake between
the two presidents.

50:09.974 --> 50:11.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an interview with ESPN
commentators, President
Obama spoke of the role of
baseball in bring

50:11.809 --> 50:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
social change, citing the
example of Jackie
Robinson, who once played in
Cuba and whose

50:12.643 --> 50:14.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
widow, Rachel, attended the
game.

50:14.445 --> 50:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
If you think about Jackie
Robinson playing

50:16.280 --> 50:17.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this ball park a couple of
months before
he breaks the color barrier in
Major League

50:17.681 --> 50:19.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Baseball, that is the power of
baseball. That's
the power of sports.

50:19.316 --> 50:21.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It can change attitudes
sometimes in ways
that a politician can never
change.

50:21.151 --> 50:21.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The president
left after three
innings. The Major League Tampa
Bay Rays went

50:21.719 --> 50:22.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on to win the game 4-1.

50:22.686 --> 50:24.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

50:24.488 --> 50:25.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
more of Jeff's
conversation with Peter Bjarkman
about the

50:25.823 --> 50:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
future of Cuban and American
baseball. That's
on our home page.

50:27.658 --> 50:29.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also on the "NewsHour" online:
As President
Obama prepares to leave Cuba,
the artist known

50:29.526 --> 50:31.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as El Sexto, which means The
Sixth, is raising
the issue of free expression in
his country
