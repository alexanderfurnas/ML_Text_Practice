JUDY WOODRUFF: A new
flash point in the tense
and fraying alliance
between the United States

00:04.933 --> 00:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Turkey, after Turkish
security forces attacked
protesters during
President Erdogan's

00:10.733 --> 00:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
recent visit to Washington, D.C.

00:13.266 --> 00:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has our report.

00:14.933 --> 00:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a warning: Images in this
report may disturb some viewers.

00:19.733 --> 00:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's been
one month since attackers
launched into protesters outside

00:25.933 --> 00:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Turkish ambassador's
residence in Washington.

00:29.533 --> 00:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now D.C. officials have issued
warrants on assault charges.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Police Chief Peter Newsham:

00:35.300 --> 00:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEWSHAM, Acting
Washington, D.C., Police
Chief: We all saw the
violence that was perpetrated

00:37.666 --> 00:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against peaceful demonstrators
here in Washington,
D.C., and it's just
something we're not going

00:40.666 --> 00:43.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to tolerate.

00:43.233 --> 00:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
demonstrators had gathered
at a park shortly after
Turkey's president,

00:45.266 --> 00:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Recep Tayyip Erdogan,
met with President Trump
at the White House.

00:48.466 --> 00:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, as Erdogan arrived
at the ambassador's
residence, trouble started.

00:53.433 --> 00:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Video showed security
guards and supporters teeing
off on the protesters.

00:57.500 --> 01:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
D.C. police officers tried to
separate and calm the crowd,
but nine people were hurt.

01:04.533 --> 01:07.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Two people were arrested
that day, and two more
were apprehended by
U.S. Marshals yesterday.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now there are 12 new warrants
for Turkish security officers.

01:11.433 --> 01:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most, if not all, returned
home after the attack.

01:14.833 --> 01:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Two Canadians are
also being sought.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's unclear why they
allegedly joined the melee.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chief Newsham is calling for
the suspects to surrender
and not fight extradition.

01:23.166 --> 01:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEWSHAM: If you
are a law-abiding person,
and you feel like you
didn't do anything wrong,

01:32.133 --> 01:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then please present yourself
here to answer to these charges.

01:35.366 --> 01:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Erdogan responded to the
charges, and said the
demonstrators were associated

01:39.366 --> 01:44.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with Kurdish militants
who've been engaged in a
long insurgency against
the Turkish government.

01:46.433 --> 01:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through translator):
Of course we're going the fight

01:48.500 --> 01:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this on legal and
political grounds.

01:50.633 --> 01:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What kind of law is this?

01:52.733 --> 01:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If my security guards are not
going to protect me, why would
I bring them with me to America?

01:56.133 --> 02:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
Erdogan's role in all of
this remains a question.

02:00.366 --> 02:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the incident, The
New York Times examined
the video and spotted
Erdogan's head of security

02:07.266 --> 02:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaning into the president's
car, and then speaking into
his earpiece, just before three

02:10.400 --> 02:12.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
guards ran toward
the protesters.

02:12.966 --> 02:16.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the time, the State
Department said it
communicated -- quote
-- "concerns" to Turkey

02:16.766 --> 02:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the confrontation, and
today said -- quote - - "We
will weigh additional actions."

02:21.133 --> 02:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN COOK, Council on Foreign
Relations: President Erdogan's
security team irresponsible,

02:25.833 --> 02:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unprofessional and violent.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Steven Cook
is a senior fellow with the
Council on Foreign Relations

02:30.733 --> 02:32.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Washington.

02:32.833 --> 02:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says relations between
Washington and Ankara are as
bad as they have ever been.

02:35.700 --> 02:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN COOK: Charging President
Erdogan's security team
with crimes is going to add

02:42.700 --> 02:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another element of tension
between the two countries.

02:46.500 --> 02:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This tension will no doubt be
used by the Turkish leadership
to advance their own political

02:51.366 --> 02:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agenda, which is only
going to cause raw feelings
here in Washington.

02:55.600 --> 02:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The U.S.
and Turkey are already at odds
over Kurdish forces fighting

02:59.666 --> 03:01.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

03:01.766 --> 03:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Turks have demanded the
U.S. extradite exiled cleric
Fethullah Gulen for allegedly

03:05.633 --> 03:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
organizing last
summer's failed coup.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
