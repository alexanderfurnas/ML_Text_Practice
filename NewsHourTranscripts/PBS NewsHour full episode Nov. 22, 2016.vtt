JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.205 --> 00:06.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.007 --> 00:11.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: From
conflicts
of interest to climate change,
president-elect

00:11.612 --> 00:14.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump goes on the record with
The New York
Times.

00:14.648 --> 00:18.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk with Trump's senior
adviser, Kellyanne
Conway.

00:19.019 --> 00:24.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we meet the man challenging
Nancy Pelosi
for leadership of the Democratic
Party in

00:24.124 --> 00:26.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the U.S. House of
Representatives.

00:26.293 --> 00:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: how the mother of a dead
ISIS fighter
battles to end radicalization in
Europe.

00:32.699 --> 00:37.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLA BENYAHIA, Mother of
Killed ISIS Fighter:
Maybe that anger is, I'm using
it as a strength

00:37.571 --> 00:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to kind of hit back at them and
say, no, you
are not taking any more of our
children.

00:41.608 --> 00:49.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:49.983 --> 00:52.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.920 --> 01:03.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President-elect
Donald Trump
is off to Florida tonight for
the long Thanksgiving

01:03.163 --> 01:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weekend, and he's trailing
headlines in his
wake.

01:06.366 --> 01:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sat down today at The New
York Times for
an extensive, live-tweeted
question-and-answer

01:11.939 --> 01:13.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
session.

01:13.740 --> 01:17.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Julie Davis, who covers the
White House, was
one of The Times reporters in
the meeting

01:17.344 --> 01:19.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Mr. Trump, and she joins me
now.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Julie Davis, welcome back to the
"NewsHour."

01:22.215 --> 01:24.718 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
So, this was an
on-again/off-again session,
wasn't it?

01:24.751 --> 01:27.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE DAVIS, The New York Times:
This was.

01:27.321 --> 01:33.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had planned for it to be from
1:00 to 2:00
today, and then we found out via
tweet early

01:33.961 --> 01:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this morning that Mr. Trump had
decided to
cancel.

01:37.331 --> 01:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But shortly thereafter, within a
couple more
hours, he tweeted again, and we
heard from

01:41.969 --> 01:47.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
our business and editor
colleagues here at
The Times that it was back on.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we all did get to sit down.

01:49.309 --> 01:53.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it was partly
over whether
it was on the record or not; is
that right?

01:53.647 --> 01:55.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE DAVIS: That's right, yes.

01:55.415 --> 01:57.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had agreed to sit down with
us on the record.

01:57.684 --> 02:02.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He met briefly with the
publisher for a few
moments beforehand off the
record, and had

02:02.789 --> 02:07.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said earlier on Twitter that he
wanted -- that
we had changed the ground rules
at the last

02:07.627 --> 02:11.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment and he was canceling,
when, in fact,
he was the one who asked that it
be off the

02:11.431 --> 02:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
record and didn't want to show
up unless it
was.

02:14.201 --> 02:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we did end up getting to
terms, and it
was on the record.

02:17.371 --> 02:21.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you have
been following
what he has been saying quite a
while.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you think stood out?

02:23.710 --> 02:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE DAVIS: Well, the Donald
Trump we saw
today here at The Times was a
different tone

02:30.183 --> 02:33.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and some different positions
than what we
heard on the campaign trail.

02:33.320 --> 02:39.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We asked him about prosecuting
Hillary Clinton,
which was a favorite chant of
his supporters

02:39.192 --> 02:40.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the campaign trail.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said he wasn't really
interested in doing
that.

02:42.829 --> 02:47.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wanted to get past the
election, it was
very divisive and he really had
no interest

02:47.300 --> 02:48.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in that.

02:48.301 --> 02:50.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So that was new.

02:50.103 --> 02:54.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also backed off of his
insistence that
the United States should begin
water-boarding

02:54.307 --> 02:56.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terror suspects again.

02:56.076 --> 02:59.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he's spoken to General
Mattis, who
he has been considering for his
secretary

02:59.813 --> 03:04.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of defense, and he says
essentially that water-boarding
doesn't work and that he's
inclined to buy

03:04.551 --> 03:05.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that assessment.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So that was new.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he also said that he
wouldn't necessarily
rip up the Paris climate accord,
which is

03:10.724 --> 03:14.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that he's really been
railing against
or had been railing against as a
candidate.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So there was a lot that was new.

03:16.463 --> 03:20.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And yet when -- I
gather from
the reporting of The Times, when
reporters

03:20.567 --> 03:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pressed him on his business
arrangements and
how those might be affected when
he becomes

03:26.640 --> 03:30.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
president, he was pretty
insistent on his
position on that.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did he say about that?

03:32.712 --> 03:35.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIE DAVIS: Well, he
essentially said -- you
know, we asked him about whether
he would

03:35.348 --> 03:36.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
liquidate his business.

03:36.349 --> 03:37.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said: Well, I really can't.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's real estate.

03:38.351 --> 03:40.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't just sell things off.

03:40.153 --> 03:44.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And essentially his point was:
As president,
I'm not really bound by any of
the ethics

03:44.891 --> 03:46.760 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rules.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no such thing as a
conflict of interest
if you're president, which, if
you look at

03:48.595 --> 03:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the letter of the rules, may be
true.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when we pressed him on what
he would do
to comply with the spirit of the
rules, which

03:53.767 --> 03:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he should he would want to do --
he said:
I don't have to do anything, but
I would like

03:57.037 --> 04:00.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do something to give the
appearance that
there isn't a conflict -- he
really couldn't

04:00.874 --> 04:02.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be nailed down on that.

04:02.542 --> 04:05.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he wouldn't say specifically
if there
was any one thing that he would
be willing

04:05.178 --> 04:09.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to submit to as president that
would ensure
to the American people that he
is dividing

04:09.583 --> 04:15.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his role as president from his
business role
as the head of this real estate
and business

04:15.255 --> 04:17.090 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
empire.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the other
thing -- one
of the other things The Times
reporters pressed

04:19.159 --> 04:25.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
him on was the so-called
alt-right movement,
the connection of his senior
adviser Steve

04:25.665 --> 04:28.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bannon to that movement.

04:28.301 --> 04:31.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did he have to say about
that?

04:31.371 --> 04:34.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE DAVIS: Well, he very
forcefully defended
Steve Bannon.

04:34.508 --> 04:40.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he's a decent guy, he's
been treated
unfairly, and if he held any of
those views,

04:40.046 --> 04:44.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if he, Mr. Trump, thought that
Steve Bannon
was a racist or an anti-Semite,
that of course

04:44.351 --> 04:47.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he would never have hired him,
and if he heard
him say anything or made any
decisions along

04:47.988 --> 04:50.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those lines, that he would be
out.

04:50.123 --> 04:56.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also was asked to and he did
disavow the
alt-right gathering, the Nazi
supporters gathering

04:56.296 --> 04:58.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in D.C., which happened over the
weekend.

04:58.698 --> 05:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said: If those people are
encouraged by
me, I don't want that and I'm
not asking that.

05:03.904 --> 05:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said he very strongly
condemned and
disavowed that.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we haven't seen him do it on
Twitter.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in some other venues, he has
been less
vocal about it, but certainly
today at this

05:13.580 --> 05:19.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting he was very -- he was
adamant that
those are not views he tolerates
and he doesn't

05:19.519 --> 05:21.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believe that Mr. Bannon holds
them.

05:21.354 --> 05:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reporter Julie
Davis, after
Donald Trump, the
president-elect Trump, had

05:24.824 --> 05:30.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a long and extended talk with
New York Times
reporters today in New York,
thank you, Julie

05:30.063 --> 05:30.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Davis.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIE DAVIS: Thanks, Judy.

05:32.832 --> 05:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

more online,
where you can read the live

05:36.603 --> 05:38.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
New York Times meeting.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

05:41.541 --> 05:47.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will hear from Trump
senior adviser
Kellyanne Conway right after the
news summary.

05:47.380 --> 05:53.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
President Obama commuted
the sentences of another 79
federal prisoners

05:53.053 --> 05:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, taking him over the 1,000
mark.

05:56.156 --> 06:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House says that's more
than the
last 11 chief executives
combined.

06:01.328 --> 06:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Obama has focused on
nonviolent drug offenders,
arguing that it makes no sense
for them to

06:06.766 --> 06:08.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
serve long prison terms.

06:08.702 --> 06:14.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

for overtime pay.

06:16.676 --> 06:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Labor Department
regulation was set
to take effect December 1, but
21 states sued

06:22.349 --> 06:23.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to stop it.

06:23.783 --> 06:29.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rule mandates overtime for
anyone making
less than about $47,000.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's double the current
standard.

into a tree.

06:48.642 --> 06:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

the wreckage
today, and the National
Transportation Safety

06:53.280 --> 06:55.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Board sent a team to
investigate.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER HART, Chairman,
National Transportation
Safety Board: We certainly send
our condolences

06:58.084 --> 06:59.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the parents of those
children.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My daughter rides a school bus
every day.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I understand that.

07:02.822 --> 07:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will do everything we can to
try to prevent
this from happening again.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shot a police officer.

07:23.810 --> 07:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otis McKane was arrested Monday,
a day after
Detective Benjamin Marconi was
ambushed in

07:30.016 --> 07:31.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his police car.

07:31.751 --> 07:36.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McKane answered questions from
reporters last
night as he was being taken to
jail.

07:36.423 --> 07:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said he didn't know Marconi.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OTIS MCKANE, Suspect: I have
been through
several custody battles, and I
was upset at

07:40.193 --> 07:41.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the situation I was in.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I lashed out at somebody who
didn't deserve
it.

07:44.864 --> 07:48.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you have anything
to say to his
family?

07:48.668 --> 07:50.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
OTIS MCKANE: I'm sorry.

07:50.203 --> 07:53.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: McKane now faces
a capital
murder charge.

07:53.907 --> 08:01.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Turkey, a sweeping purge
ensnared another
15,000 soldiers, police and
civil servants

08:01.081 --> 08:02.882 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan's
expanding crackdown since last
summer's failed

08:06.853 --> 08:08.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coup attempt.

08:08.621 --> 08:14.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 38,000 people have
been jailed,
and more than 100,000 ousted
from their jobs.

08:14.828 --> 08:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General Motors will be allowed
to delay recalling
millions of vehicles in the U.S.
for potentially

08:20.467 --> 08:22.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
defective air bags.

08:22.235 --> 08:27.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration
agreed to the unusual move
today.

08:27.474 --> 08:32.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It includes 6.8 million older
model pickups
and SUVs.

08:32.112 --> 08:38.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GM has argued that the Takata
air bag inflators
in those vehicles are, in fact,
safe.

08:38.651 --> 08:42.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company now has until August
of next year
to prove it.

08:42.822 --> 08:46.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And on Wall Street, the
post-election market
rally cracked yet another
barrier.

08:46.893 --> 08:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 67
points to close above 19000 for
the first

08:53.566 --> 08:54.634 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

08:54.667 --> 08:58.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 17, and the S&amp;P
500 added
four.

08:58.872 --> 09:04.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
we talk to
Trump aide Kellyanne Conway and
the man challenging

09:04.844 --> 09:10.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nancy Pelosi to lead House
Democrats; plus,
a mother's struggle after her
son left home

09:10.683 --> 09:23.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to join ISIS; and much more.

09:23.163 --> 09:27.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump transition team is in
its second
week of work preparing to take
over the White

09:27.700 --> 09:30.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House and begin the next
administration.

09:30.370 --> 09:35.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To discuss what's ahead, we turn
to Kellyanne
Conway, former campaign manager
and senior

09:35.508 --> 09:38.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adviser to president-elect
Trump's transition
team.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She joins me from New York.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome, Kellyanne Conway.

09:42.549 --> 09:46.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to ask you first about
the president-elect,
what he said during the
campaign.

09:46.419 --> 09:52.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He repeatedly called his
opponent crooked
Hillary, said she should be in
jail, and his

09:52.459 --> 09:55.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crowds yelled "Lock her up."

09:55.195 --> 09:58.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now he says he doesn't want to
see the Clintons
hurt.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If that's the way he felt, why
so much focus
on putting her in jail?

10:02.335 --> 10:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Senior
Adviser: Judy,
it doesn't change the fact that
a majority

10:06.806 --> 10:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the country finds Hillary
Clinton to be
neither honest nor trustworthy.

10:10.977 --> 10:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She does have that veracity
problem with the
people.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was very clear.

10:14.647 --> 10:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's one of the reasons
she wasn't
elected president and he was.

10:18.117 --> 10:23.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also, as president-elect,
has made
very clear, including today in
an on-the-record

10:23.256 --> 10:27.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting with The New York Times
that I attended,
he made very clear that he
thinks that Hillary

10:27.660 --> 10:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton has suffered enough and
that he's
looking toward the future and
not the past.

10:33.166 --> 10:41.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So at this moment, he's saying
he has no interest
in pursuing these allegations or
these charges.

10:41.975 --> 10:46.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, you know, for
those who
are also asking for him to be
the president

10:46.379 --> 10:52.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all Americans, to help heal a
divided nation,
they ought to be happy to hear
what his words

10:52.252 --> 10:54.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are today.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Something else
Mr. Trump was
emphatic about during the
campaign was undoing

10:56.789 --> 10:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Paris climate change accord.

10:59.492 --> 11:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to The New York Times today,
it's reported
that he said he's open now to
what decision

11:06.699 --> 11:08.468 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to make on that.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But isn't it the case that, with
that accord,
you either sign it or you don't,
that there's

11:12.705 --> 11:14.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no compromise?

11:14.507 --> 11:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, he also
said today
-- I was sitting right there,
Judy -- he said:

11:17.043 --> 11:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to take a look at it.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he will when he's president.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will take a look at it and he
will make
his decision.

11:22.582 --> 11:27.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's well aware of the Paris
climate accords
and what it means if you agree
or you don't

11:27.887 --> 11:28.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agree to it.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's pretty unequivocal, as you
note.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But there was a longer
conversation about
climate change.

11:33.293 --> 11:39.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was a longer conversation
about the
many different issues, frankly.

11:39.165 --> 11:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he said, I will take a look
at it.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what a responsible leader
does.

11:42.235 --> 11:46.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They assume office, consult with
their experts
and make decisions.

11:46.873 --> 11:52.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We learned,
Kellyanne Conway,
the president-elect has had two
phone calls,

11:52.412 --> 11:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he said, with President
Obama since
he met with him the week of the
election.

11:57.917 --> 12:01.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you tell us how long those
calls lasted
and what they talked about?

12:01.120 --> 12:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, they
weren't as long
as the 90-minute meeting that
President Obama

12:04.924 --> 12:09.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and president-elect Trump had in
the Oval
Office when he visited recently,
Judy.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they have had a couple of
follow-up conversations.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the country should be
happy about
that.

12:14.767 --> 12:20.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They both have a vested interest
in a peaceful
transition in our great
democracy.

12:20.139 --> 12:26.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And president-elect Trump said
today again
on the record that President
Obama has been

12:26.045 --> 12:28.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very gracious to him, very
helpful.

12:28.514 --> 12:31.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had a conversation or two
about specific
issues.

12:31.651 --> 12:37.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, in the case of one
issue which
sounded like it had global
implications, Mr.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump refused to elaborate.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It basically was a conversation
among presidents.

12:41.995 --> 12:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we as a people, we
as the voters
and citizens, have to respect
that.

12:46.866 --> 12:50.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I have a couple
of -- several
questions for you, Kellyanne
Conway.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to call them quick-answer
questions,
because there is so much to talk
about.

12:54.841 --> 12:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But starting with the Affordable
Care Act,
there have been a number of
prominent Republican

12:58.911 --> 13:02.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members of Congress in the last
few days who've
said that they -- now that they
have looked

13:02.682 --> 13:06.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at it, they think that this
should be done
over several years, the repeal
of it, the

13:06.719 --> 13:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change of it, because they don't
want to disrupt
insurance markets.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is the president open to that,
president-elect
open to that?

13:14.727 --> 13:18.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: The --
president-elect Trump
has made very clear that he
intends to repeal

13:18.698 --> 13:21.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and replace Obamacare, and
replace it with
what, Judy?

13:21.467 --> 13:26.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that you can actually
purchase health
insurance across state lines,
much the way

13:26.239 --> 13:29.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you would auto insurance, for
example, and
many foods and services.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're not restricted to one
state.

13:32.478 --> 13:37.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in a free market,
patient-centered
health care system, you would
want that to

13:37.450 --> 13:39.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happen.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second, we would block-grant
Medicaid to the
states, so those that are
closest to the people

13:42.388 --> 13:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who would receive Medicaid are
those making
the decisions about that.

13:46.559 --> 13:51.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Third, health savings accounts
for all Americans,
so that you control more of that
spending.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It rolls over and it may, in
fact, accrue
interest.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:55.868 --> 13:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: But you're
more personally,
intimately in charge of the
spending for these

13:59.605 --> 14:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
personal, intimate health care
decisions.

14:01.874 --> 14:05.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think also, through his
tax reform plan,
getting rid of that Obamacare,
Affordable

14:05.912 --> 14:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Care Act penalty, where you
basically are
forced between two bad choices,
either buy

14:11.651 --> 14:15.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the government-run health
insurance or pay
the penalty.

14:15.621 --> 14:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he's going to do some very
specific things.

14:18.324 --> 14:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has a Republican House and
Senate that
will help him do that.

14:21.394 --> 14:25.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are also some things
within the system
that he may want to preserve if
they're working,

14:25.998 --> 14:30.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if he and his experts decide
these are working
and these are worth retaining.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not here to hurt people.

14:32.038 --> 14:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's here to make better on the
promise that
was never really fulfilled
through this Affordable

14:35.341 --> 14:41.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Care Act, which is to have
affordable, accessible,
quality, ridden with choices,
and access and

14:41.848 --> 14:43.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good access for all health
insurance.

14:43.516 --> 14:47.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just ask
you a few other
short-answer questions.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the other things that the
president-elect
talked about in the campaign is
no changes

14:50.890 --> 14:54.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in entitlements, Social
Security, Medicare
and so forth.

14:54.360 --> 14:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the last few days, Speaker
Paul Ryan, though,
has talked about changing
Medicare into a

15:00.032 --> 15:04.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
premium support system,
partially privatizing
it.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this something Mr. Trump
would be open
to doing?

15:06.606 --> 15:10.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: So,
President-elect Trump
has made very clear he wants to
make good

15:10.343 --> 15:15.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the promises that we as a
nation have made
to the seniors who rely upon
Medicare and

15:15.414 --> 15:20.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly the lower-income
Americans who rely
upon Medicaid and other
entitlements like

15:20.753 --> 15:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Social Security, frankly, for
those who receive
that.

15:24.390 --> 15:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, he is open to
hearing different
solutions and better ways of
doing things.

15:29.829 --> 15:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will, I'm sure, take a look
at Speaker
Ryan's proposal and other
proposals.

15:34.734 --> 15:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's somebody I know well who is
a great listener
and learner and really does pull
together

15:39.472 --> 15:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a multitude of counselors and
try to rely
on best practices.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But he's also a doer.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is not somebody who pushes
paper or kicks
the can down the road.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's an accountable -- he's a
businessman.

15:49.982 --> 15:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's used to accountability,
results, delivery,
and performance.

15:53.085 --> 15:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think in this case, he
will go ahead
and look at alternatives, Judy,
as long as

15:57.890 --> 16:03.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it doesn't interfere with what
he has said,
his commitment to keep the
promises to those

16:03.329 --> 16:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
currently relying on them.

16:05.164 --> 16:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We also saw today
in his talk
with The New York Times that Mr.
Trump distanced

16:09.569 --> 16:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself from the so-called
alt-right.

16:12.505 --> 16:17.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But people look at the rhetoric
during the
campaign, the nationalist
rhetoric, tough

16:17.343 --> 16:20.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
language about immigrants, about
Muslims.

16:20.046 --> 16:24.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This has resonated with
nationalist groups
like the alt-right.

16:24.684 --> 16:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are there regrets on his part,
on the part
of the people around him about
how heated

16:30.990 --> 16:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the language got and extreme
during the campaign?

16:33.626 --> 16:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Judy, he could
not be more
firm and more unequivocal in his
disavowal

16:39.198 --> 16:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of those elements.

16:41.167 --> 16:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's never asked them to be at
his rallies
to support him, to "endorse him"
-- quote,

16:46.739 --> 16:48.441 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unquote.

16:48.474 --> 16:51.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has been very clear in
disavowing them,
and he did it again today again
at The New

16:51.477 --> 16:52.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
York Times.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was asked two separate
questions about
that particular issue.

16:55.248 --> 17:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think assigning to him
everything that's
ever been said or done by
anybody who says

17:01.621 --> 17:04.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they support him is truly
unfair.

17:04.123 --> 17:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't hear Hillary Clinton
being asked
again and again if she agreed
with many people

17:09.662 --> 17:16.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shouting out that those pigs
should fry, let's
smell the bacon frying,
referring to our honored

17:16.035 --> 17:19.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
men and women in blue, our law
enforcement
officers.

17:19.705 --> 17:25.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so he cannot be more
emphatic and unequivocal
about distancing himself from
and denouncing

17:25.778 --> 17:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rhetoric of and the policies
of this element
of society.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I don't know what else he
can do.

17:32.685 --> 17:38.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I guess the
question is,
could he be more forceful right
now in personally

17:38.324 --> 17:45.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
denouncing some of the hate
crimes that are
taking place, acts of violence,
of disrespect

17:45.064 --> 17:52.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
toward people, toward
minorities, Muslims,
children, African-American,
Hispanic children?

17:52.038 --> 17:58.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, there's been a rise
in these
incidents since the election.

17:58.377 --> 18:03.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Couldn't Mr. Trump say something
to try to
persuade the individuals
responsible for this

18:03.549 --> 18:04.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to stop?

18:04.550 --> 18:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: He has.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I assure you he feels that
way in an ongoing
fashion.

18:07.954 --> 18:13.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you can assure yourself that
he is denouncing
it on a daily basis, on a
constant basis.

18:13.960 --> 18:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also told CBS' "60 Minutes,"
he told them
to cut it out when he was asked
a similar

18:18.898 --> 18:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
question about 10 days ago.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So everybody should know where
he stands on
this.

18:24.170 --> 18:28.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing is that, you
know, I hope
there's a lot of coverage of the
protesters

18:28.074 --> 18:29.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against him.

18:29.875 --> 18:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were 20,000-strong right
outside our door
here in Trump Tower about 10 or
11 days ago,

18:34.747 --> 18:37.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Judy, and it wasn't a
comfortable situation.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had people -- you have
people wishing
him harm.

18:41.387 --> 18:45.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have the threats towards him
and his family
and those of us around him on
the rise.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We just don't talk about it.

18:47.827 --> 18:53.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think everybody ought
to take the
temperature down a few notches
and, frankly,

18:53.132 --> 18:57.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take the example of Donald Trump
and Barack
Obama and Joe Biden and Mike
Pence and so

18:57.436 --> 19:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many others, who are saying, let
this guy
form his government, give him a
chance, because

19:02.742 --> 19:04.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
#heisyourpresident.

19:04.610 --> 19:09.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just finally,
to the children
of undocumented immigrants in
this country,

19:09.215 --> 19:13.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who we see, through reporting
over the last
few weeks, are now saying
they're living in

19:13.519 --> 19:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fear that their parents are
going to be deported,
their families are going to be
torn apart,

19:18.691 --> 19:22.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what is Mr. Trump's message to
these children?

19:22.161 --> 19:25.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will the president -- will he --
let me just
ask this.

19:25.131 --> 19:30.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will he undo President Obama's
executive order
on the children of undocumented
immigrants?

19:30.302 --> 19:35.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: So, I think
there are fewer
issues where president-elect
Donald Trump

19:35.674 --> 19:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could have been more clear than
he was on
immigration the whole time
during his candidacy.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He put out a 10-point plan that
addressed
all this.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wants people to be here
legally.

19:45.418 --> 19:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wants to respect the fact
that folks are
standing in line and it takes
them many, many

19:50.423 --> 19:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years and different processes
and, in many
instances, Judy, a whole bunch
of money for

19:56.095 --> 20:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people that are giving up such a
high percentage
of their disposable income to
try to become

20:01.100 --> 20:02.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American citizens.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The process must be respected.

20:04.103 --> 20:06.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The rule of law must be honored.

20:06.639 --> 20:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he says -- he tells them all
the time,
if you are a good person, if you
are here

20:12.845 --> 20:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you would like to stay here,
you would
like to come back here, that
they're not who

20:17.883 --> 20:22.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's talking about when he says
we're first
going to get rid of the two
million or so

20:22.354 --> 20:25.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- people don't really know the
exact number
-- of the criminals who don't
belong here

20:25.524 --> 20:26.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to begin with.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They will be out immediately.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then he is going to secure the
border.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's going to build the wall.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said Mexico will pay for it.

20:32.131 --> 20:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he's going to take a
look at who's
here and decide -- he's made
this very clear

20:37.002 --> 20:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- and decide, with his experts,
what should
happen.

20:40.706 --> 20:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, for those saying
they live
in fear, again, I think they
should be part

20:45.144 --> 20:47.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the conversation.

20:47.079 --> 20:52.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They should reach out and try to
not be so
presumptively accusatory,
frankly, or presumptively

20:52.318 --> 20:57.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
negative towards the
president-elect, and
instead try to build that
trusting relationship

20:57.990 --> 21:03.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and try to, frankly, explain
their case to
him and to his advisers in a way
that I know

21:03.362 --> 21:04.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he's open to hearing.

21:04.630 --> 21:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he's made very clear he
wants the rule
of law honored.

21:07.299 --> 21:10.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These sanctuary cities have to
stop.

21:10.035 --> 21:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They lead to the murders of
people, all these
innocent kids.

21:13.672 --> 21:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What about those angel moms and
dads?

21:15.541 --> 21:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What about their children, Kate
Steinle, and
the angel moms that went all
around for us,

21:21.380 --> 21:23.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Julie and Angela?

21:23.449 --> 21:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these women are -- they're
suffering in
a way that can never be healed
either, all

21:28.454 --> 21:34.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of the leftist policies
of sanctuary
cities harboring illegal
immigrants who have

21:34.994 --> 21:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
committed crimes and shouldn't
be here.

21:37.296 --> 21:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kellyanne Conway,
adviser,
senior adviser to
president-elect Donald Trump,

21:41.767 --> 21:42.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we thank you.

21:42.768 --> 21:43.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Thank you,
Judy.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All the best.

21:45.437 --> 21:49.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
the Democrats
and their path ahead.

21:49.909 --> 21:55.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio is
making a bid
to be minority leader in the
House of Representatives,

21:55.147 --> 21:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenging the current minority
leader, Nancy
Pelosi.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins us from Youngstown.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman, thank you for being
with us.

22:02.221 --> 22:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did just speak with Kellyanne
Conway, advising
the president-elect.

22:06.725 --> 22:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it does sound as if he may
be more amenable
to working with Democrats,
working with moderates

22:13.132 --> 22:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in his own party than we thought
during the
election.

22:16.335 --> 22:20.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much do you think you and
other Democrats
are prepared to work with him?

22:20.573 --> 22:21.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

22:21.574 --> 22:24.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIM RYAN (D), Ohio: Well, we
have to see.

22:24.210 --> 22:28.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I have been around
long enough now,
Judy, to know that the devil is
in the details.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we want to see actual
proposals.

22:30.516 --> 22:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, sometimes, the rhetoric,
whether it hardens
or softens throughout the course
of a post-election

22:36.922 --> 22:43.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few weeks, is always revealed
by the details
of the proposals.

22:43.062 --> 22:49.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're respectful of what the
American people
have done, although we may not
like it, and

22:49.702 --> 22:52.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have an obligation to sit
down and at least
listen.

22:52.171 --> 22:57.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In brief, how
would your agenda
for the Democrats differ from
that of Leader

22:57.643 --> 22:58.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pelosi's?

22:58.644 --> 22:59.845 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

22:59.878 --> 23:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM RYAN: Well, I think it's an
idea of emphasis,
really.

23:05.918 --> 23:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have not focused on the
economic issues
that are so important to people
in working-class

23:12.791 --> 23:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
places like Youngstown, Ohio.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You look at what happened on
election night.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our economic message clearly
isn't penetrating.

23:20.799 --> 23:26.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we need to be focused on
these folks
who live in areas like mine
where the median

23:26.238 --> 23:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
household income is $57,000 a
year, which
means a husband and wife are
working and each

23:31.110 --> 23:33.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
making under 30 grand.

23:33.078 --> 23:37.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't see the Democratic
Party as a home
for them, and they left us in
droves on Tuesday

23:38.017 --> 23:39.852 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night.

23:39.885 --> 23:43.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we're left to clean up
the mess, and
I think the issue really is, how
do you connect

23:43.889 --> 23:45.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to those voters?

23:45.791 --> 23:48.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you
saying the Democrats'
message has been the wrong one,
or they just

23:48.861 --> 23:53.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had the wrong messengers in
Hillary Clinton
and Nancy Pelosi, among others?

23:53.866 --> 23:55.734 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

23:55.768 --> 24:01.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM RYAN: Well, our party has
become a coastal
party, and that was revealed
again on Tuesday,

24:01.440 --> 24:06.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where the middle of the country
is red and
we have blue on the coasts.

24:06.278 --> 24:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is no way to sustain a
national party.

24:10.249 --> 24:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think it has been the
messengers,
it has been the message.

24:14.720 --> 24:21.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people in Middle America
think that the
Democrats are too close to the
donor class,

24:21.360 --> 24:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that they care more about
the donor class
than they do about the working
class.

24:24.897 --> 24:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have to change that, or
we're never
going to get back into the
majority, Judy.

24:28.600 --> 24:34.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We know that
experts who look
at the loss of blue-collar
manufacturing jobs

24:34.340 --> 24:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country over the past
decade or more
say that, yes, some of these
jobs can come

24:39.712 --> 24:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back, but many of them will not
come back
because of automation, because
of robotics,

24:44.249 --> 24:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because of globalization.

24:45.684 --> 24:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there a danger in misleading
voters about
that?

24:49.388 --> 24:50.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

24:50.522 --> 24:53.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM RYAN: I don't think it's
misleading them
at all.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's being there with
them, understanding
their issues.

24:56.428 --> 24:59.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, the low-end manufacturing,
it is not
coming back.

24:59.164 --> 25:04.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we're lying to the
American people
if we say they are coming back.

25:04.236 --> 25:09.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a huge opportunity
in advanced
manufacturing with regard to
aerospace or

25:09.942 --> 25:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wind turbines, where the average
wind turbine
has about 8,000 component parts,
gear shifts,

25:17.015 --> 25:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hydraulics, bolts, aluminum.

25:18.917 --> 25:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are things that we can
make in communities
like mine and other communities
in the Great

25:22.721 --> 25:24.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lake states.

25:24.490 --> 25:29.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a focus on renewable energy
really is
about a resuscitation of our
manufacturing

25:29.094 --> 25:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
base, all the while trying to
create those
new high-tech jobs in the maker
movement,

25:34.700 --> 25:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in additive manufacturing, which
is projected
to grow at 25 percent a year for
the next

25:40.072 --> 25:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10 years, but getting our work
force in front
of these areas of the economy
that are going

25:45.077 --> 25:49.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to grow, but, at the same time,
recognizing,
Judy, that there's a lot of
people in communities

25:49.815 --> 25:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that don't want to get retrained
to run a
computer.

25:52.050 --> 25:55.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to run a backhoe and
they want to
sling cement blocks.

25:55.888 --> 26:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so by rebuilding the country
through a
strong infrastructure program,
we could put

26:00.592 --> 26:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
those people back to work, too.

26:02.361 --> 26:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned --
you talked
about the Democrats becoming a
party of the

26:06.131 --> 26:08.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coasts, that the rest of the
country has been
overlooked.

26:08.834 --> 26:12.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also been said by Democrats
themselves
the party has been too much into
what they

26:12.771 --> 26:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call identity politics, paying
attention to
particular groups,
African-Americans, Hispanics,

26:19.445 --> 26:23.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the LGBT community, certain
groups of women,
and so on.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think that's a problem
for the Democratic
Party?

26:25.717 --> 26:27.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if you do, what do you do
about it?

26:27.719 --> 26:28.787 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:28.821 --> 26:31.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIM RYAN: I don't think they're
mutually exclusive.

26:31.256 --> 26:35.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have a role and
responsibility,
especially after the kind of
campaign we just

26:35.494 --> 26:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came through, to make sure that
we are going
to vigorously fight for equality
for all Americans.

26:41.366 --> 26:43.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those issues are very, very
important
to us.

26:43.969 --> 26:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the heart of our party has
to be a message
that unites the entire party and
unites independents

26:49.875 --> 26:52.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Republicans maybe to come
our way.

26:52.344 --> 26:55.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that message is a strong,
robust economic
message.

26:56.014 --> 27:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you look at Trump and
why he won,
he had all these issues that a
lot of people

27:00.986 --> 27:06.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe didn't want to talk about
or maybe didn't
agree with him on, but his
economic message

27:06.391 --> 27:11.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was so robust that it won the
day, and it
won the day big time.

27:11.230 --> 27:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we better get back to a
robust economic
message about the future, what's
the future

27:15.701 --> 27:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look like, what's the future of
work, where
do we have to make investments,
where are

27:19.705 --> 27:23.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the public-private partnerships,
where are
the business incubators, where's
the research.

27:23.942 --> 27:25.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those are Democratic issues.

27:25.277 --> 27:28.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know how to do this much
better than the
Republicans.

27:28.247 --> 27:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have got to focus on it
and let everyone
know, whether you're a
millennial or a middle-class

27:33.952 --> 27:39.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
person in places like
Youngstown, Ohio, that
you're going to have an
opportunity in a Democratic

27:39.258 --> 27:41.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

27:41.226 --> 27:44.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman Tim
Ryan, running
for minority leader in the House
of Representatives,

27:44.863 --> 27:54.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we thank you.

27:54.907 --> 28:00.646 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we thank you.

28:00.679 --> 28:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the wars in Iraq and Syria
continue, Europe
is on a high state of alert, on
guard against

28:06.585 --> 28:12.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fleeing foreign fighters
attempting to slip
back into their home or adoptive
countries.

28:12.090 --> 28:16.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Britain's state of alert
severe, the
mother of one young British
fighter killed

28:16.895 --> 28:23.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Syria has launched a
deradicalization project
as part of her personal war
against the Islamic

28:23.702 --> 28:24.670 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
State.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Malcolm Brabant reports from
Birmingham.

28:27.506 --> 28:32.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Nicola Benyahia
leafs through
a box of childhood memories.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLA BENYAHIA, Mother of
Killed ISIS Fighter:
Look at his little picture
there.

28:34.780 --> 28:39.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: They were left
by her 19-year-old
son, Rasheed, when he slipped
away to Syria

28:39.051 --> 28:40.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to join Islamic State.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It included a letter foretelling
his death.

28:43.255 --> 28:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICOLA BENYAHIA: "Death can
strike at any
time.

28:45.190 --> 28:47.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Give all my money to mama.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My bank card is in the case of
my phone.

28:49.361 --> 28:53.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember me in your prayers, and
remember
that death will take everyone.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now is the time to turn to God.

28:55.033 --> 28:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I love you all for the sake of
God.

28:57.803 --> 29:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember to treat mama and papa
with respect
and honor.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Rasheed."

29:03.442 --> 29:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Almost exactly
a year ago,
Rasheed Benyahia's father
received a call

29:06.979 --> 29:11.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say his son had been killed
in a drone
strike on the Syrian-Iraqi
border.

29:11.817 --> 29:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the run-up to his death, the
teenager had
been clingy in Internet
conversations with

29:16.254 --> 29:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his mother, which she has
preserved in a small
book.

29:19.324 --> 29:21.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Both sensed the end was near.

29:21.193 --> 29:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICOLA BENYAHIA: I was waiting
for that call
to say that he was dead.

29:24.229 --> 29:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of me wanted that call,
almost, like,
to end the nightmare, to end it.

29:30.369 --> 29:36.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was -- and I used to catch
myself thinking,
how can you, as a mother, want
that call?

29:36.341 --> 29:40.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, on the other hand, I wanted
the nightmare
to end.

29:40.178 --> 29:41.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: For him or for
you?

29:41.880 --> 29:43.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICOLA BENYAHIA: For him and me.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I felt I was caught in a
nightmare that I
had no choosing of.

29:46.451 --> 29:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I felt he was caught in a
situation that he
had absolutely no power over.

29:51.423 --> 29:52.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He couldn't get out.

29:52.824 --> 29:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He didn't have his passport.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They'd taken it from him.

29:55.327 --> 29:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I knew that, even if he
changed his mind,
he was stuck.

29:59.698 --> 30:04.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Rasheed was
brought up in
a liberal household by his
Algerian father

30:04.870 --> 30:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and mother, Nicola, a British
convert to Islam.

30:07.372 --> 30:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLA BENYAHIA: Aggression and
Rasheed are
just two words that don't go
together.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Violence wasn't something that
was in him.

30:13.745 --> 30:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think I ever saw him,
even as a child,
lash out.

30:17.449 --> 30:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why it's more shocking
when I found
out that he had actually gone to
join ISIS,

30:21.053 --> 30:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and knowing the atrocities that
they were
kind of carrying out.

30:26.491 --> 30:32.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Mrs. Benyahia
believes her
son was radicalized at
Birmingham's Green

30:32.164 --> 30:33.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lane mosque.

30:34.032 --> 30:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police didn't wish to
discuss Green Lane's
involvement, and the mosque
didn't respond

30:37.669 --> 30:39.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to a request for an interview.

30:39.538 --> 30:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLA BENYAHIA: He began going
to a new mosque
that had some sort of, kind of
quite orthodox,

30:43.542 --> 30:47.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, I would say, quite extreme
kind of thinking
in Islam.

30:47.979 --> 30:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's when I could see the
change within
Rasheed.

30:53.218 --> 31:00.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We're here in the 17th
division military
base, just outside the city of
Al Raqqa.

31:00.325 --> 31:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're here with the soldiers
of Bashar.

31:02.728 --> 31:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can see them now digging
their own graves
in the very place where they
were stationed.

MALCOLM BRABANT: During his time
with Islamic
State, the family asked whether
he had participated

31:12.070 --> 31:15.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in atrocities, but he only said
he'd only
been a witness.

31:15.707 --> 31:20.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLA BENYAHIA: It was a public
beheading
that had taken place, and
basically they were

31:20.512 --> 31:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forced to watch it, because
they're made to
watch these things, one, to
desensitize them,

31:26.318 --> 31:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, secondly, to -- as a
warning to them
that, if they're thinking about
possibly leaving

31:31.923 --> 31:38.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or changing their minds, that
this is what
could happen to them as well.

31:38.897 --> 31:44.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As Islamic
State's strongholds
of Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in
Syria come under

31:44.136 --> 31:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increased military pressure,
there are concerns
that jihadis who don't wish to
fight to the

31:49.074 --> 31:54.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
death will try to slip away and
return home
to places like Birmingham.

31:54.412 --> 31:57.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Along with most other European
countries,
Britain is having to live with
the ever-present

31:57.883 --> 31:59.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
threat of terrorism.

31:59.751 --> 32:03.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the country's new
anti-terrorism
coordinator, the authorities
have managed

32:03.755 --> 32:07.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to thwart 10 potential attacks
over the past
two years.

32:07.592 --> 32:13.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at any given time, there are
supposed
to be about 500 live
investigations under

32:13.165 --> 32:15.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

32:15.033 --> 32:19.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The authorities say there are
about 850 Britons
who are a security concern
who've gone to

32:19.271 --> 32:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight in Syria, about half of
those have returned
to the country, and about one in
three of

32:23.875 --> 32:27.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
those are living in the
Birmingham area.

32:27.312 --> 32:31.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Britain's current security level
is severe,
which means an attack is likely.

32:31.249 --> 32:33.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE SOUTHERN, West Midlands
Counter Terrorism
Unit: What has happened in
Europe could play

32:33.351 --> 32:35.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out anywhere within the U.K.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a real threat that we all
face.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're alive to that.

32:39.457 --> 32:43.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Sue Southern
heads the anti-terrorist
unit in the Birmingham region.

32:43.161 --> 32:44.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's prepared for returning
jihadis.

32:44.830 --> 32:50.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE SOUTHERN: We are ready, and
in some cases
we already have evidence
waiting.

32:51.002 --> 32:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will deal with people
proportionately,
but they will be arrested.

32:55.707 --> 32:56.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will investigate that.

32:56.842 --> 33:00.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will treat each case on
its own merits.

33:00.579 --> 33:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Birmingham is
one of Britain's
most diverse cities, and
moderate Muslims

33:04.883 --> 33:09.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use the main street to try to
counter misunderstanding
and extremism.

33:09.554 --> 33:13.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hamza Ali Khan opposes those who
go to fight
in Syria or Iraq.

33:13.458 --> 33:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAMZA ALI KHAN, British Muslim:
God will not
ask you to go to a country to
commit such

33:17.262 --> 33:19.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
atrocities.

33:19.097 --> 33:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they go to such countries
such as Syria,
they go with the intention of
causing bad,

33:22.801 --> 33:24.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they go with the intention of
killing innocent
people.

33:24.736 --> 33:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
God says in the Koran, in our
Koran, in our
holy book that if you were to
kill someone,

33:31.109 --> 33:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was as if you have killed the
entire world,
and if you were to save someone,
it's as though

33:36.248 --> 33:39.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you have saved the entire world.

33:39.451 --> 33:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Amid the street
musicians
and shoppers, there is an air of
vigilance,

33:44.389 --> 33:49.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Toby Ephram from Southern
Sudan is doing
his bit by trying to counter the
propaganda

33:49.361 --> 33:51.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Islamic State.

33:51.162 --> 33:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOBY EPHRAM, Ahmadiyya Muslim
Association:
The fact I can tell the world
today there

33:53.565 --> 33:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is no verse in the Koran that
somebody will
die by destroying himself,
destroying the

33:59.371 --> 34:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
innocent people and then to
think that God
is going to give him a red
carpet by having

34:05.277 --> 34:08.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
75 virgins, that is a wrong
concept.

34:08.546 --> 34:13.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Dr. Imran
Awan, a criminologist
at Birmingham City University,
doubts the

34:13.852 --> 34:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effectiveness of using theology
alone.

34:15.620 --> 34:17.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:17.522 --> 34:19.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IMRAN AWAN, Birmingham City
University: Primarily,
I don't think mosques are in
touch with a

34:19.724 --> 34:21.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lot of the younger people.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what needs to happen
is, in a
sense, get them onto a digital
platform.

34:24.729 --> 34:29.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I call it a digital
revolution, where
mosques and imam leaders are
online and on

34:29.801 --> 34:31.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Internet.

34:31.569 --> 34:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they need to flood
the Internet
with countermessaging and sort
of counter

34:34.539 --> 34:35.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the ISIS propaganda.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think that's a huge role.

34:37.208 --> 34:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But a string of
anti-I.S.
videos is starting to appear.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: We are hope.

34:42.981 --> 34:48.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are action against
division, against
violence, against death.

34:48.253 --> 34:51.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is our fate and our future.

34:51.957 --> 34:58.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Dr. Awan has
suggested that
repentant jihadis returning to
Britain could

34:58.063 --> 35:03.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be turned by the authorities to
help deradicalization
programs.

35:03.802 --> 35:05.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something that you would
consider?

35:05.770 --> 35:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUE SOUTHERN: I don't dispute
that there is
absolute value in being able to
use the experiences

35:09.574 --> 35:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of others to deter others.

35:11.943 --> 35:17.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we have to be clear
about is that,
if an individual has traveled
and has gained

35:17.115 --> 35:23.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the type of training and
capability and comes
back with the I.S. narrative,
which is anti-West

35:23.788 --> 35:30.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and attack those in the West, we
have a duty
to protect the citizens of the
U.K., both

35:30.595 --> 35:32.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here and overseas.

35:32.397 --> 35:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: After keeping a
low profile
since her son's death, Nicola
Benyahia, in

35:36.634 --> 35:41.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the head scarf, has joined other
mothers present
at this conference in Paris in
publicly fighting

35:41.706 --> 35:43.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against Islamic State.

35:43.641 --> 35:47.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She believes that, as a Muslim,
she might
perhaps succeed where the police
and other

35:47.479 --> 35:52.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organizations might not be
trusted by families
of children on the verge of
radicalization.

35:52.650 --> 35:57.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLA BENYAHIA: Maybe that
anger is, I'm
using it as a strength to kind
of hit back

35:57.522 --> 36:00.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at them, and say, no, you are
not taking any
more of our children.

36:01.026 --> 36:06.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think a mother can hate
them as much
when they have taken the one
thing, a child,

36:06.197 --> 36:07.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from you.

36:07.966 --> 36:14.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will do everything in my
power, as a
mother, as a professional,
whatever I can,

36:14.339 --> 36:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fight against them and give
our young people
a different narrative.

36:18.977 --> 36:24.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Nicola Benyahia
worries she
might be rejected by the Muslim
community

36:24.949 --> 36:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for raising a taboo issue that
is often only
discussed behind closed doors,
but she wants

36:30.121 --> 36:35.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to save other families from
similar pain,
so that some good can come from
her son's

36:35.360 --> 36:36.594 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
death.

36:36.628 --> 36:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Birmingham.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the power of

Reporter Kavitha Cardoza from
our partners
at Education Week looks at a
program to expose

36:57.182 --> 36:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
students to our national parks.

36:59.551 --> 37:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making the
Grade.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO, National Park
Service: Nice
big circle.

37:04.722 --> 37:06.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Come on in.

37:06.524 --> 37:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Fourth graders
from Pennycook
Elementary School will soon see
something

37:10.428 --> 37:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have never seen before.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO: So, welcome to
the Redwood
Forest, everyone.

37:14.999 --> 37:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Even though
they live in
Oakland, just 45 minutes away,
most have never

37:20.605 --> 37:22.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been to a national park.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You might call it a sensory
experience.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO, National Park
Service: Aaron,
can you tell us, what is another
way we can

37:27.912 --> 37:28.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
observe nature?

37:29.013 --> 37:31.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Like, with our nose?

37:31.549 --> 37:34.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO: With our noses.

37:34.119 --> 37:39.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Ranger Aracely
Montero leads
the tour.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The children approach the first
stand of redwoods.

37:41.526 --> 37:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO: We are now
inside of the
magical forest of Muir Woods.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Oh, my God.

37:49.634 --> 37:52.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO: Everyone, take
a good look
up.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Whoa.

37:54.806 --> 38:02.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO: We're now
standing under
one of the tallest living things
in the world.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: In this
classroom, students
use all their senses.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: This one feels thick.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: It feels really thick,
doesn't it?

38:09.287 --> 38:10.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: It smells like salt.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Look up there.

38:12.390 --> 38:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those are clusters of ladybugs.

38:14.058 --> 38:18.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: It's like a whole
country of them.

38:18.596 --> 38:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Teacher Darlene
Wong says
that place-based learning,
having children

38:23.001 --> 38:28.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learn by experiencing subjects,
rather than
simply reading about them,
teaches skills

38:28.606 --> 38:29.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like critical thinking.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DARLENE WONG, Teacher: Show me
your evidence.

38:31.943 --> 38:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What evidence do you have to
prove what you're
saying or what you're writing
here?

38:35.880 --> 38:36.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Whoa.

38:36.881 --> 38:38.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's so big.

38:38.783 --> 38:43.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The National
Park Service's
educational programs serve
approximately seven

38:43.421 --> 38:45.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
million children every year.

38:45.590 --> 38:51.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rangers conduct teacher
workshops, go on classroom
visits, and, perhaps most
importantly, create

38:51.963 --> 38:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
curriculum for these trips based
on state
standards.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This class is learning about
California habitats.

38:58.403 --> 39:00.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Ooh, look what I found.

39:00.405 --> 39:04.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Without these
programs, Wong
says she couldn't have brought
her class to

39:04.776 --> 39:06.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the forest.

39:06.544 --> 39:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARLENE WONG: In terms of
testing and what
we have to cover in terms of
curriculum and

39:09.781 --> 39:14.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time, it's really -- it would be
really hard
to justify it.

39:14.819 --> 39:17.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Julia Washburn
went from
junior ranger...

39:17.088 --> 39:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA WASHBURN, National Park
Service: It
still fits.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It still fits.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: ... to park
ranger.

39:21.159 --> 39:25.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now she oversees all educational
programs
for the National Park Service.

39:25.830 --> 39:35.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA WASHBURN: It's one thing
to read about
a wetland, for example, in a
textbook.

39:35.473 --> 39:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a very different thing
to be standing
up to your thighs in mud in a
swamp or in

39:48.319 --> 39:51.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a wetland, such as the
Everglades.

39:51.189 --> 39:52.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It just really makes the
learning tangible
and very relevant, so students
can understand

39:52.557 --> 39:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why they're learning something,
not just what
they're learning.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The source of
the excitement?

39:55.893 --> 39:59.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Long-legged bugs called water
striders.

39:59.130 --> 40:04.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's not as easily seen are
the challenges
facing the Park Service.

40:04.769 --> 40:06.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Budgets are down.

40:06.638 --> 40:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's 10 percent fewer staff
than five years
ago, and the next generation of
park visitors

40:11.142 --> 40:13.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is uncertain.

40:13.444 --> 40:17.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Using national parks as
classrooms isn't just
about learning.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also about growing the next
generation
of park visitors.

40:20.285 --> 40:23.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRACE LEE, Executive Director,
National Park
Trust: If we don't engage young
people of

40:23.655 --> 40:28.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
color right now with our parks,
then, 100
years from now, we are very
concerned that

40:28.960 --> 40:33.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there won't be the celebration
of the 200th
anniversary of the National Park
Service.

40:33.598 --> 40:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Grace Lee heads
the National
Park Trust.

40:36.234 --> 40:40.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They raise money for 20,000 kids
to visit
parks every year.

40:40.238 --> 40:44.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRACE LEE: They have been
studies that have
done recently that have shown,
of the almost

40:44.876 --> 40:50.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
300 million people that have
gone to national
parks in the last couple of
years each year,

40:50.481 --> 40:56.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a very small percentage of
them are young
people, and even a smaller
percentage of them

40:56.254 --> 40:58.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are children of color.

40:58.456 --> 41:06.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Fifty years
ago, the National
Park Service partnered with AAA
and Chevrolet

41:06.798 --> 41:14.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to reach returning World War II
veterans and
their families, creating the
generation of

41:14.472 --> 41:16.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
park users we see today.

41:16.474 --> 41:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aging baby boomers remain the
largest percentage
of park visitors overall.

41:20.912 --> 41:24.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN JARVIS, Director,
National Park Service:
What we're feeling now is that
there's a new

41:24.449 --> 41:28.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generation that is more urban,
more diverse.

41:28.786 --> 41:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe they are first-generation
immigrants
to the United States,
first-generation citizens.

41:34.359 --> 41:38.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe they came from a country
that didn't
have public lands or parks or a
tradition

41:38.229 --> 41:39.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of that.

41:39.931 --> 41:46.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we are reaching the kids
and they're
bringing their parents to the
parks.

41:46.304 --> 41:50.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Jon Jarvis, the
director
of the National Park Service,
says America's

41:50.541 --> 41:53.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parks must tell the country's
evolving story.

41:53.344 --> 41:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN JARVIS: Filling in the
gaps, as I
would say, in the American
narrative.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have added sites for civil
rights, like
Harriet Tubman.

42:00.051 --> 42:05.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We added Stonewall, which tells
the story
of the LGBT civil rights
movement as well.

42:05.256 --> 42:11.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to be telling that
story, so that
all Americans feel part of the
patriotic and

42:11.662 --> 42:14.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
symbolic values that this nation
embodies.

42:14.432 --> 42:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Jarvis says
they have also
embraced technology, Webcams,
online chats,

42:21.773 --> 42:23.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even video games.

42:23.241 --> 42:26.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Park sites are actually
Pokemon GO
sites?

42:26.244 --> 42:27.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JONATHAN JARVIS: They are.

42:27.912 --> 42:29.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They are.

42:29.680 --> 42:34.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pokemon GO community has
spread these
little monsters all over the
National Park

42:34.352 --> 42:39.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Service, and we're embracing
that, because
it's getting people outside and
getting -- using

42:39.357 --> 42:42.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
technology in a way that sort of
connects
them to these places.

42:42.693 --> 42:44.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Whoa.

42:44.529 --> 42:48.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Here in the
Redwood Forest,
these 10-year-olds have found
something better

42:48.733 --> 42:50.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than Pokemon GO characters.

42:50.201 --> 42:51.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Turkeys.

42:51.202 --> 42:53.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Gobble, gobble.

42:53.037 --> 42:59.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN JARVIS: The evidence
shows that when
kids are exposed to the place,
they learn,

42:59.210 --> 43:03.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they retain, they become more
interested and
more excited about learning.

43:03.614 --> 43:04.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Whoa.

43:04.882 --> 43:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: How do you feel right
now?

43:09.320 --> 43:15.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Being in the Redwood
Forest makes
me feel happy.

43:15.693 --> 43:17.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Being in the Redwood
Forest makes
me want to meditate.

43:17.895 --> 43:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Being in the Redwood
Forest makes
me feel short.

43:20.231 --> 43:21.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:21.966 --> 43:26.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The director of
the Park
Service hopes that using parks
as classrooms

43:26.604 --> 43:28.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is just the beginning.

43:28.506 --> 43:32.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN JARVIS: What I wanted
to do was to
say that the National Park
Service is a contributor

43:32.844 --> 43:37.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to American education, both for
students,
but for lifelong learning as
well.

43:37.348 --> 43:42.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: For the "PBS
NewsHour" and
Education Week, I'm Kavitha
Cardoza, reporting

43:42.220 --> 43:48.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area
in California.

43:48.993 --> 44:00.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to a preview
of the second
half of the PBS miniseries
"Black America

44:00.872 --> 44:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Since MLK," and to Jeffrey
Brown.

44:03.774 --> 44:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The series
subtitle is "And
Still I Rise."

44:07.879 --> 44:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as that suggests, it
focuses on the progress
and continuing struggles of
African-Americans

44:12.850 --> 44:14.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since the civil rights movement.

44:14.819 --> 44:19.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's both cultural history and a
personal
journey told by Harvard
Professor Henry Louis

44:19.457 --> 44:21.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gates, who joins me now.

44:21.092 --> 44:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Skip Gates, welcome back to
you.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES, Professor,
Harvard University:
Thank you.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nice to be back on the program.

44:25.296 --> 44:27.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the
introduction of this,
you say, "As a young man, I was
convinced

44:27.498 --> 44:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the change was right around the
corner."

44:29.066 --> 44:31.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, it was and it wasn't.

44:31.636 --> 44:34.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES: It was and it
wasn't.

44:34.272 --> 44:38.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was 15 in 1965, which is where
the series
starts.

44:38.776 --> 44:40.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the conceit of the series is
this.

44:40.545 --> 44:45.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Martin Luther King came back
and said,
what's happened since I have
been gone, what

44:45.449 --> 44:46.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would you tell him?

44:46.751 --> 44:48.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's happened to the black
community?

44:48.452 --> 44:53.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, you would say, well, Dr.
King, the black
middle class since 1970 has
doubled.

44:53.291 --> 44:57.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The black upper middle class,
because of something
called affirmative action, has
quadrupled.

44:57.395 --> 45:03.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Dr. King would say, my God,
we must have
solved poverty, the problem of
poverty -- because

45:03.434 --> 45:09.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remember, at the time when Dr.
King passed,
people thought poverty was a
virus which could

45:09.373 --> 45:10.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be cured with antibiotics.

45:10.374 --> 45:12.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

45:12.176 --> 45:14.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES: They really
thought poverty
could be wiped out, that it was
an act of

45:14.946 --> 45:16.747 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
will.

45:16.781 --> 45:21.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you would say, well, Dr.
King, we haven't
wiped out poverty, because the
child poverty

45:21.352 --> 45:23.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rate in 1970 was 41 percent.

45:23.955 --> 45:25.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He would say, what is it now?

45:25.856 --> 45:26.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thirty-eight percent.

45:26.857 --> 45:28.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what does that mean?

45:29.026 --> 45:32.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the black community, it's
the best of
times, it's the worst of times.

45:32.597 --> 45:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let's look at a
clip from tonight's
episode, which looks at the
simultaneous explosion

45:37.635 --> 45:40.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of black celebrity and middle
class.

45:40.071 --> 45:49.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HENRY LOUIS GATES: Oprah
embodied a new era,
an era of black crossover
superstars.

45:49.413 --> 46:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Michael Jackson to Bill
Cosby, Michael
Jordan to Whitney Houston,
African-Americans

46:00.424 --> 46:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were winning fame and fortune in
ways that
would have been unimaginable
even a decade

46:09.300 --> 46:10.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

46:10.301 --> 46:12.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TINA TURNER, Actress/Musician:
Listen to me.

46:12.136 --> 46:16.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES: And their
success encouraged
America to think differently
about race.

46:16.974 --> 46:22.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VINCENT BROWN, Harvard
University: What happens
is that I think white people can
now suddenly

46:23.014 --> 46:27.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
imagine themselves identifying
with black
success in a new way.

46:27.818 --> 46:32.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What that means is that, if you
happen to
be famous, right, then we will
accept you

46:32.657 --> 46:36.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into our society as a rough
equal, maybe even
a better.

46:36.227 --> 46:37.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: How about a little
one-on-one?

46:37.662 --> 46:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL JORDAN, Former NBA
Player: All right.

46:39.897 --> 46:43.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES: Black success
wasn't confined
to the realm of celebrities.

46:43.968 --> 46:49.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African-Americans were making
dramatic gains
in almost every arena.

46:49.206 --> 46:56.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, that
astonishing rise of
a culture and political presence
of blacks

46:56.514 --> 47:00.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in America, how important was it
overall or
has it been to overall progress?

47:00.518 --> 47:03.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES: Oh, it was
crucial.

47:03.120 --> 47:04.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a result of affirmative
action.

47:04.789 --> 47:09.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I went to Yale, I entered
Yale in 1969.

47:09.527 --> 47:14.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ninety-six black kids entered
that year, as
opposed to six in 1966.

47:14.265 --> 47:18.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What, was there a genetic blip
in the race,
and all of a sudden there were
90 smart black

47:18.869 --> 47:20.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people who hadn't existed
before?

47:20.905 --> 47:22.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we were the affirmative
action generation.

47:22.907 --> 47:27.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were there and we were part
of this transformative
element that integrated
historically white

47:27.945 --> 47:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
institutions in the power
structure, which
is what we were supposed to do.

47:31.782 --> 47:33.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But what happened?

47:33.617 --> 47:38.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lani Guinier, my colleague at
Harvard, used
to say that affirmative action
was a class

47:38.355 --> 47:40.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
escalator.

47:40.191 --> 47:44.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we were on that class
escalator, and we
were going up the social and
economic scale

47:44.428 --> 47:46.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the United States, and
somebody hit the
off switch.

47:46.797 --> 47:50.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All those people who hadn't
gotten on the
escalator when we did were left
behind.

47:50.267 --> 47:54.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we have a class gap within
the race.

47:54.739 --> 47:56.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a huge class gap.

47:56.707 --> 48:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, part of the reason I did
this series was
to remind those of us who
benefited from affirmative

48:02.246 --> 48:07.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
action and who have done so well
over the
last 50 years that there is
still a huge segment

48:07.885 --> 48:10.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of African-Americans left
behind.

48:10.187 --> 48:17.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To what extent do
you see the
campaign and the results as a
repudiation

48:17.361 --> 48:23.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the black presence in our
culture and in
our politics, or even a backlash
against it?

48:23.934 --> 48:29.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES: I think that
the Trump
vote, particularly among the
working class,

48:29.240 --> 48:32.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a reflection of economic
anxiety.

48:32.343 --> 48:34.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People are afraid.

48:34.211 --> 48:38.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It used to be, if you deferred
gratification,
you kept your nose
metaphorically clean, like

48:38.115 --> 48:42.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people in my hometown did,
all of whom
worked at the paper mill, you
would one day

48:42.620 --> 48:45.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get a mortgage, you would buy
one car, you
would get two cars, you would
get a couple

48:45.790 --> 48:48.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TVs, and then you would send
your kids to
college.

48:48.325 --> 48:50.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And your kids would do better
than you.

48:50.394 --> 48:53.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that's no longer the case
for a lot
of people.

48:53.130 --> 48:57.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, where are we
in the saga
of what you're telling Dr. King
many years

48:57.768 --> 48:59.503 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
later?

48:59.537 --> 49:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES: I think I
would say, Dr.
King, the jury is out, and there
is a great

49:01.872 --> 49:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal of anxiety within the
African-American
community, within the Democratic
Party, within

49:06.610 --> 49:13.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liberal states like my state,
the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, about the
vulnerability

49:13.551 --> 49:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the gains that we have made.

49:15.853 --> 49:20.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happens if, in the next
four years, the
vacancy, one vacancy, two
vacancies on the

49:20.391 --> 49:21.358 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
court?

49:21.392 --> 49:23.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What will happen to voting
rights?

49:23.194 --> 49:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What will happen to a woman's
right to choose
an abortion within Roe v. Wade,
et cetera,

49:29.099 --> 49:30.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
et cetera?

49:30.167 --> 49:32.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm very worried about that.

49:32.036 --> 49:34.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have to be vigilant and
we're going
to fight.

49:34.405 --> 49:38.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
series is "Black
America Since MLK: And Still I
Rise."

49:39.009 --> 49:40.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Henry Louis Gates, thank you
very much.

49:40.344 --> 49:42.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HENRY LOUIS GATES: Thank you
very much.

49:42.213 --> 49:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And "Black
America Since MLK:
And Still I Rise" airs tonight
on PBS at 8:00

49:53.090 --> 49:59.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Eastern, 7:00 Central.

49:59.363 --> 50:04.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight: Twenty-one
people received
the Presidential Medal of
Freedom this year,

50:04.101 --> 50:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from artists and entertainers,
to philanthropists
and scientists.

50:08.372 --> 50:11.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama handed out the
medals at the
White House this afternoon.

50:11.375 --> 50:15.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Extraordinary Americans who have
lifted our

50:15.546 --> 50:22.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spirits, strengthened our union,
pushed us
towards progress.

50:22.720 --> 50:28.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These two have donated more
money to charitable
causes than anyone ever.

50:28.225 --> 50:33.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many years ago, Melinda's mom
told her an
old saying: To know that even
one life has

50:33.764 --> 50:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
breathed easier because you have
lived, that
is success.

50:38.068 --> 50:43.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By this and just about any other
measure,
few in human history have been
more successful

50:44.008 --> 50:48.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than these two impatient
optimists.

50:48.812 --> 50:50.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

50:51.015 --> 50:59.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Ellen DeGeneres
has a way of
making you laugh about some
thing, rather

50:59.723 --> 51:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than at someone, except when I
danced on her
show.

51:04.094 --> 51:05.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She laughed at me.

51:05.195 --> 51:06.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:06.196 --> 51:07.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: But that's OK.

51:07.965 --> 51:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's easy to forget now, when we
have come
so far, where now marriage is
equal under

51:14.972 --> 51:22.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the law, just how much courage
was required
for Ellen to come out on the
most public of

51:22.279 --> 51:24.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stages almost 20 years ago.

51:24.381 --> 51:26.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

51:26.283 --> 51:32.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: Now, every
journalist in the
room, every media knows the
phrase Newt Minow

51:32.790 --> 51:35.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coined: the vast wasteland.

51:35.426 --> 51:39.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the two words Newt prefers
we remember
from his speech to the nation's
broadcasters

51:39.997 --> 51:43.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are these: public interest.

51:43.867 --> 51:47.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's been the heartbeat of his
life's work.

51:47.104 --> 51:48.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

51:48.572 --> 51:55.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The game of
baseball has a handful
of signature sounds.

51:55.045 --> 51:56.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You hear the crack of the bat.

51:56.914 --> 52:01.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got the crowd singing
in the seventh
inning stretch.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you have got the voice of
Vin Scully.

52:03.620 --> 52:09.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he heard about this honor,
Vin asked,
with characteristic humility,
"Are you sure?

52:09.994 --> 52:11.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm just an old baseball
announcer."

52:11.628 --> 52:13.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:13.530 --> 52:21.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: And we had to
inform him that,
to Americans of all ages, you
are an old friend.

52:21.171 --> 52:23.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

52:23.073 --> 52:30.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Here's how great
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
was; 1967, he had spent a year
dominating

52:30.981 --> 52:31.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
college basketball.

52:31.982 --> 52:33.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The NCAA bans the dunk.

52:33.684 --> 52:35.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:35.185 --> 52:41.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: They didn't say it
was about
Kareem, but it was about Kareem.

52:41.125 --> 52:42.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:42.126 --> 52:44.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

52:45.029 --> 52:52.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: There's a reason
you call somebody
the Michael Jordan of -- Michael
Jordan of

52:52.202 --> 53:00.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
neurosurgery, or the Michael
Jordan of rabbis,
or the Michael Jordan of
outrigger canoeing.

53:00.411 --> 53:01.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

53:01.945 --> 53:06.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Because Michael
Jordan is the
Michael Jordan of greatness.

53:06.283 --> 53:08.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

53:08.619 --> 53:12.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: I am the
president.

53:12.589 --> 53:14.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is the Boss.

53:14.258 --> 53:15.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

53:15.692 --> 53:20.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: And pushing 70, he
is still
laying down four-hour live sets.

53:20.264 --> 53:25.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you have not been at them, he
is working,
fire-breathing rock 'n' roll.

53:25.135 --> 53:31.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I thought twice about giving
him a medal
named for freedom, because we
hope he remains,

53:31.542 --> 53:35.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in his words, a prisoner of rock
'n' roll
for years to come.

53:35.312 --> 53:36.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

53:36.680 --> 53:39.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What a
star-studded group.

53:39.383 --> 53:44.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Medal of Freedom winners
marked the occasion
with a star-studded mannequin
challenge.

53:44.788 --> 53:58.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can watch that on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:58.936 --> 54:00.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:00.571 --> 54:01.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:01.705 --> 54:04.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

54:04.308 --> 54:14.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

54:14.351 --> 54:28.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
