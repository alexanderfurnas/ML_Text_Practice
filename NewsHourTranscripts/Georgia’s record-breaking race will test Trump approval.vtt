JUDY WOODRUFF: It's the most
expensive race in history to
fill a seat in the U.S. House

00:04.366 --> 00:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Representatives.

00:05.900 --> 00:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's in a
district consistently
Republican for decades.

00:09.733 --> 00:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Newt Gingrich was the
congressman for Georgia's
6th District for 20 years.

00:13.833 --> 00:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was most recently vacated
by Tom Price when he was tapped
to be secretary of health

00:19.566 --> 00:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and human services.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Democrats are pinning
their hopes and lots of their
money on a young candidate.

00:26.666 --> 00:28.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins
brings us up to speed.

00:28.366 --> 00:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: More
than $50 million, that's
how much has been spent.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The special election
between Democrat Jon
Ossoff and Republican
Karen Handel in suburban

00:36.833 --> 00:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Atlanta has drawn outsized
national attention because, in
some ways, it hinges on a name

00:42.600 --> 00:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not on the ballot.

00:44.566 --> 00:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Divisions over President
Trump have Democrats
thinking they have a chance.

00:47.266 --> 00:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We break it down now
with Andra Gillespie.

00:49.233 --> 00:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a political science
professor at Emory
University in Atlanta.

00:52.833 --> 00:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Greg Bluestein, a
reporter with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution
and native of Georgia's

00:57.700 --> 00:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
6th Congressional District.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for joining us.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to start this by
looking at the extraordinary
numbers involved in
this race, the dollar

01:06.866 --> 01:08.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
figures.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From what we know, as of the
reports at the end of May,
the Democrat in this race, Jon

01:11.933 --> 01:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ossoff, had brought in $23
million, Republican Karen Handel
$4.5 million, but outside groups

01:18.400 --> 01:19.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$25 million.

01:19.900 --> 01:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let me start with you, Greg.

01:22.033 --> 01:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How close is this race,
quickly, and why is there
so much spending here?

01:25.333 --> 01:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG BLUESTEIN, The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution: Yes,
this race is neck and neck.

01:27.533 --> 01:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Most public polls show
Ossoff within a one-
or two- or three-point
lead, within the margin

01:31.233 --> 01:33.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of error.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You talk to six different
analysts down here, you will
get six different opinions.

01:35.466 --> 01:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it really could be either
way tomorrow, when we have the
final vote -- $42 million-plus

01:41.866 --> 01:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has now been spent on just ads
alone, many of them negative.

01:44.966 --> 01:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, district residents have
been pummeled and metro
Atlanta residents at large have

01:48.300 --> 01:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been pummeled with ads about
this race, which means there is
a very slim number of undecided

01:52.900 --> 01:54.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voters here.

01:54.433 --> 01:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Andra, what
is happening here politically?

01:56.466 --> 01:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this just the extent of
spending everywhere, or is there
something different about this

01:59.366 --> 02:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
race that has brought
in so much money?

02:01.533 --> 02:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDRA GILLESPIE, Emory
University: Well, unlike
a midterm election,
where you have hundreds

02:04.466 --> 02:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of congressional races going
on simultaneously, both parties
have been able to focus on each

02:09.333 --> 02:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
individual special
race at a time.

02:11.433 --> 02:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And because this was the most
competitive of the special
elections that have been held

02:14.766 --> 02:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this spring, it garnered
the most attention.

02:17.733 --> 02:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so campaign spending
and campaign fund-raising
are in part a signal
about how competitive

02:23.333 --> 02:25.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a race is.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, in that respect,
it's not surprising that
this race broke records.

02:27.033 --> 02:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
Unbelievable race.

02:29.033 --> 02:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have had even another
turn of events here in the last
week with the congressional

02:31.966 --> 02:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shooting that happened
outside of Washington that
is now entering this race.

02:35.333 --> 02:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we saw, as you
mentioned, the ad war, Greg.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ad war has brought
about a new ad in this race.

02:40.133 --> 02:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's play a clip of it.

02:42.200 --> 02:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Now the unhinged left
is endorsing and applauding
shooting Republicans.

02:49.533 --> 02:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
When will it stop?

02:50.833 --> 02:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It won't if Jon Ossoff
wins on Tuesday.

02:53.566 --> 02:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I don't want
to necessarily talk about
that ad itself, but this idea,

02:57.266 --> 03:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greg, of whether that shooting
could affect this race.

03:00.233 --> 03:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have heard Republicans in
Georgia think that it might.

03:03.033 --> 03:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, apparently, the
people who made that
ad think that it could.

03:05.433 --> 03:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG BLUESTEIN: Yes, and we
have also had both candidates
and their campaigns condemn

03:10.033 --> 03:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the ad and call for
it to be taken down.

03:13.566 --> 03:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's being talked about in the
district, but I don't know how
much it will actually influence

03:16.966 --> 03:18.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any votes.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As we mentioned earlier, there
are so few undecided voters.

03:20.500 --> 03:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this ad is targeting, I
think, Karen Handel supporters,
obviously, who go to the polls

03:26.733 --> 03:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for her, and many of them
are already locked in.

03:28.733 --> 03:32.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Early voting has already
exceeded 140,000, so
the majority of the
voters who will show

03:34.633 --> 03:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, who will end up
casting ballots have
already cast their ballots.

03:36.766 --> 03:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I'm not sure how much it
will change the race, but it
certainly is something we're

03:38.500 --> 03:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all talking about down here.

03:40.466 --> 03:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Do you
think that will affect
voting at all, the shooting?

03:42.500 --> 03:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: I think that
this type of ad, especially
an independent expenditure

03:45.700 --> 03:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like this, is a reflection
of how parties don't control
certain types of politics as

03:51.300 --> 03:53.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much anymore.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this shows one of the
negative consequences of
allowing outside groups
to be able to spend

03:56.833 --> 03:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money in these types of races.

03:58.833 --> 04:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, they go off-script
and they do things that actually
the campaigns themselves

04:02.133 --> 04:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would actually reject and find
actually more harmful than good.

04:05.433 --> 04:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Greg, I saw
you nodding about off-script.

04:07.466 --> 04:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, someone who likes
to go off-script, of
course, is President Trump.

04:10.366 --> 04:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He actually has participated
in this race, in fact tweeting
just today in support of

04:14.166 --> 04:16.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican Karen Handel.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's really been the sort of
subtext with this entire race.

04:18.933 --> 04:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much do you think
President Trump is a factor?

04:21.566 --> 04:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this a test of President
Trump's approval right now?

04:24.433 --> 04:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG BLUESTEIN: He is no
doubt -- undoubtedly a factor.

04:27.166 --> 04:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every time some local
candidates or operatives
try to say that he's
not, we just point to

04:34.166 --> 04:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fact that he has -- not
only has he sent a string of
tweets out, but he's recorded

04:37.900 --> 04:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
robo-calls, he's come down
and stumped with Karen Handel.

04:41.766 --> 04:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So has Vice
President Mike Pence.

04:43.433 --> 04:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So he is without a doubt a
major factor in this race.

04:46.166 --> 04:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And really the only reason why
Democrats really think they
can win this is because of the

04:49.633 --> 04:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
narrow margin that he won
the district by in November.

04:52.866 --> 04:54.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And
let's talk about that.

04:54.366 --> 04:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going to show some
more numbers about that.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's amazing to me.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look at this.

04:59.300 --> 05:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mitt Romney won this district
by 23 points and, as you say,
President Trump just by one.

05:03.066 --> 05:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Andra, I want to ask you.

05:05.066 --> 05:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have these two candidates
who represent somewhat of a
conservative view and a liberal

05:08.400 --> 05:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
view, but lately they have
moved toward the middle.

05:10.633 --> 05:12.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who are they trying
to appeal to?

05:12.300 --> 05:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who will decide this race?

05:14.300 --> 05:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: In particular,
both campaigns have tried to
reach out to suburban women

05:17.366 --> 05:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters, so particularly
college-educated white women.

05:20.666 --> 05:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen super PACs in
support of Karen Handel mention
that she would be the only

05:24.900 --> 05:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
woman in Georgia's
congressional delegation.

05:26.933 --> 05:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have seen Jon Ossoff play
the Planned Parenthood card,
noting that when Karen Handel

05:33.866 --> 05:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was an executive at the Susan G.
Komen Foundation, she allegedly
helped get Planned Parenthood

05:38.866 --> 05:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defunded to help fit a
certain political agenda.

05:41.066 --> 05:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if there is some
moderate-leaning even Republican
women who might be uncomfortable

05:45.900 --> 05:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with playing abortion politics
with, say, breast cancer, that
might be a way to demobilize

05:52.066 --> 05:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that constituency
and help his cause.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is
one heck of a race, guys.

05:55.666 --> 05:59.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Andra Gillespie and Greg
Bluestein, I'm jealous
I'm not down there, but
thank you for joining

05:59.266 --> 06:00.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREG BLUESTEIN: Thank you.

06:01.266 --> 06:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: Thank you.
