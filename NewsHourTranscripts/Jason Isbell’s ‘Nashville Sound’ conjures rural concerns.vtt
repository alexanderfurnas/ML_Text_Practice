JUDY WOODRUFF: Nashville
has long been considered
the beating heart of
the country music world,

00:05.633 --> 00:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the new album "The Nashville
Sound" by Jason Isbell is
infusing the genre with rock,

00:11.600 --> 00:13.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
folk and blues.

00:13.700 --> 00:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Grammy Award winner has
turned heads with his lyrics,
which this time around address

00:17.800 --> 00:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
topics like poverty,
race, and love.

00:20.766 --> 00:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown recently joined
Isbell on the first stop
of his international tour.

00:27.666 --> 00:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In his song
"The Last of My Kind," Jason
Isbell creates a character based

00:38.533 --> 00:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on people he grew up around
in rural Northern Alabama who
fear how the world is changing.

00:48.266 --> 00:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL, Musician: A lot
of people that I grew up with,
went to school with in Alabama,

00:56.466 --> 01:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a lot of people in my family
who told me growing up that
cities were terrible places

01:03.500 --> 01:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and anything outside of our
little circle was scary and
dangerous and frightening.

01:07.233 --> 01:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought about the effect
that had on people, when you
start to believe that, and

01:11.500 --> 01:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you let yourself be so afraid
of other people and the outside
world, that you never feel

01:16.500 --> 01:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tethered, you never
feel a connection with
the rest of humanity.

01:19.466 --> 01:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I wrote that song
based on that kind of fear.

01:23.633 --> 01:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In both ballads
and hard-charging rock 'n' roll
songs like "Cumberland Gap,"

01:35.166 --> 01:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isbell's storytelling prowess
has made him one of today's most
acclaimed singer-songwriters.

01:39.500 --> 01:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His last album, "ÑMDNMÑSomething
More Than Free," won two
Grammys and achieved the

01:45.933 --> 01:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rare feat of topping folk, rock,
and country charts in 2015.

01:55.266 --> 02:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now 38, he's back with a new
album titled "The Nashville
Sound," and we joined him and

02:02.300 --> 02:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his band, The 400 Unit, at
the Thomas Wolfe Auditorium in
Asheville, North Carolina, on

02:06.800 --> 02:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the first day of their
new national tour.

02:20.566 --> 02:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once again, Isbell's
songs are filled with
rural country characters,
this time also reflecting

02:26.733 --> 02:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the nation's political
and cultural fears.

02:28.833 --> 02:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:40% size:100%
ÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑJASON
ISBELL:
It's
just
hard
to
tell
people
who

02:31.033 --> 02:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are my family that anybody in
government really cares about
them, because I don't think I

02:37.233 --> 02:39.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can sell that.

02:39.166 --> 02:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think I can convincingly
tell Middle America that
the government gives a damn.

02:42.633 --> 02:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Disaffected
white male, yes?

02:44.633 --> 02:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON ISBELL: Yes.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yes, you hear about that.

02:48.233 --> 02:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think a lot of people
try to tell us that that's who
elected our current president,

02:55.233 --> 02:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I don't necessarily believe
that, because I know a lot of
disaffected white males and

02:57.466 --> 03:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
disaffected white people
in general who didn't
vote at all because they
didn't think anybody

03:01.533 --> 03:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gave a damn about them.

03:03.066 --> 03:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They just didn't
believe in the political system.

03:04.866 --> 03:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON ISBELL: No.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They thought the system had
been broken for a long time.

03:08.933 --> 03:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Isbell started
out as many do, in bands that
travel by van wherever the

03:15.266 --> 03:17.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gigs take them.

03:17.700 --> 03:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His first big break was as a
member of the southern indie
rock band the Drive-By Truckers.

03:22.466 --> 03:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That came to an end when his
drinking and drug abuse grew
so bad, he was thrown out

03:26.000 --> 03:29.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the band.

03:29.233 --> 03:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took him several years
to sober up and restart
his life and career.

03:36.233 --> 03:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: Before I stopped
drinking, I thought, if I quit
drinking, am I still going

03:40.500 --> 03:41.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be funny?

03:41.733 --> 03:42.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Am I still going to
be a good songwriter?

03:42.966 --> 03:44.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Am I going to still be
a rock 'n' roll person?

03:44.433 --> 03:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are people going to still
want to be around me?

03:47.133 --> 03:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, is my creativity
going to be there if I
quit doing these drugs?

03:50.700 --> 03:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Am I going to be able
to record in the studio,
these kinds of things?

03:55.633 --> 04:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they sound so ridiculous
even just coming out of my
mouth, like, of course, that's

04:00.100 --> 04:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not where the work comes from.

04:02.233 --> 04:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But I can
see where the anxiety
comes from, because, I
mean, in your business,

04:06.200 --> 04:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's a thin line, isn't it,
between kind of making it and
not making it or having success

04:10.933 --> 04:11.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not?

04:11.933 --> 04:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON ISBELL: Yes.

04:12.933 --> 04:14.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yes, it's hard.

04:14.866 --> 04:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really hard to make a
living writing songs and singing
them, really, really hard.

04:17.966 --> 04:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of people, they try it
out like as a lottery ticket.

04:22.066 --> 04:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then, if it doesn't work,
they go do something else.

04:24.933 --> 04:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's not the
tradition that I come from.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I come from a group of people
who pretty much set themselves
to do this for the rest of

04:33.166 --> 04:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their life, whether
it kills them or not.

04:34.666 --> 04:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's how I was early on.

04:36.366 --> 04:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's how I still am.

04:38.500 --> 04:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now he's on
the road with his wife, Amanda
Shires, herself a singer and

04:45.400 --> 04:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
songwriter who performs
on her own and as
bandmate with her husband.

04:52.100 --> 04:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they're joined by
their almost 2-year-old
"Moon Shadow"-loving
daughter, Mercy Rose.

04:57.866 --> 05:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isbell's recent breakthrough
success allows some
newfound traveling comforts.

05:01.966 --> 05:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: We have recently
gotten to the point where
we can have multiple buses.

05:06.366 --> 05:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something I never really
thought that I would get to.

05:08.666 --> 05:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe one bus, that'd be
great, with a trailer behind
it with our gear in it.

05:13.266 --> 05:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was always the goal for me.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: This
is how you judge where
you're at, right, by...

05:16.633 --> 05:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: Oh, God, yes.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... whether it's
a van or one bus or two buses?

05:19.300 --> 05:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JASON ISBELL: Yes.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

05:21.466 --> 05:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's practical
concerns, you know?

05:23.600 --> 05:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I have always made
the art I wanted to make,
and I will always do that.

05:25.800 --> 05:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm going to judge my level
of success by whether or not
I can hear myself on stage,

05:32.833 --> 05:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or whether or not my wife can
come along with me and have
a mirror to put her makeup on

05:38.533 --> 05:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in, and my baby can have a
bunk with this, like, dog gate
that we bought at Petco and

05:41.966 --> 05:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bolted to the outside of the
bunk, so she doesn't roll off
in the middle of the night.

05:53.133 --> 05:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In one beautiful
love song on the new album,
Isbell writes and sings

06:01.100 --> 06:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as himself about a future of
joy and sorrow with his wife.

06:05.033 --> 06:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: If you can write
a good love song now that
actually adds something to the

06:09.866 --> 06:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
canon of love songs, then
you're qualified, in my
opinion, because that's tough.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's like painting a picture
of a tree that needs to exists.

06:18.133 --> 06:23.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How many times have
people done that before?

06:29.800 --> 06:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another song
getting much attention tackles
racism in America today.

06:43.766 --> 06:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's called "White Man's World."

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON ISBELL: It's important
for me to just continue to
notice that there are doors that

06:54.300 --> 06:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are open for me that
wouldn't be if I wasn't
white or if I wasn't male.

06:58.933 --> 07:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not guilty about it,
and I'm not ashamed of it.

07:01.733 --> 07:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I had no control over it.

07:03.800 --> 07:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I need to consider those
things, because, if I don't,
then I'm just running wild and

07:10.500 --> 07:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
never really considering what
privilege that I have and how
to make the world a better

07:14.200 --> 07:19.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
place for people don't
get what they deserve.

07:21.200 --> 07:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jason Isbell
and The 400 Unit will tour the
nation this summer and into

07:27.700 --> 07:29.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the fall.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeffrey Brown in
Asheville, North Carolina.

07:32.333 --> 07:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And,
as you heard, he's on
an international tour.
