On the "NewsHour" tonight: In a
Memorial Day
tradition, President Obama lays
a wreath at

00:16.617 --> 00:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
to honor fallen
service members.

00:20.254 --> 00:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: The Iraqi army, backed by
the U.S.,
battle Islamic State forces in
the key city

00:25.726 --> 00:31.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Fallujah, trying to take back
the Iraqi
city seized by the terror group
two years

00:31.064 --> 00:32.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

PETER BALAKIAN, Pulitzer Prize
Winner: One
of the reasons for my writing
"Black Dog of

00:54.988 --> 01:01.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fate" was to try to make sense
of growing
up in a family in which a
traumatic history

01:01.428 --> 01:02.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was really repressed.

01:02.663 --> 01:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

01:10.404 --> 01:23.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: The battle to
recapture the Islamic
State's last major stronghold in
Western Iraq

01:23.617 --> 01:28.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been joined in earnest.
Government troops
began pushing into Fallujah
today, after seizing

01:28.455 --> 01:33.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most of the city's outskirts in
the last week.
An Iraqi commander says the
fighting was fierce.

01:33.860 --> 01:37.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have a full report on
the battle after
the news summary.

01:37.965 --> 01:43.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
Officials in Afghanistan
reported more than 50 police
killed in a string

01:43.337 --> 01:48.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Taliban attacks, the first
since the group
named a new leader last week.
The militants

01:48.475 --> 01:55.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hit checkpoints in Eastern
Helmand Province,
killing 33 officers on Sunday,
and up to 24

01:55.215 --> 01:59.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
others today. Residents in the
provincial
capital said artillery and
machine gun fire

01:59.820 --> 02:02.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be heard close to the
city.

02:02.622 --> 02:07.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On this Memorial Day, President
Obama made
special mention of the Americans
who died

02:07.060 --> 02:12.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the past year in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
It was the last time this
commander in chief

02:12.265 --> 02:16.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
will lead the nation's
observances on a day
of time-honored traditions.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our report.

02:18.772 --> 02:22.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Every day, there are American
families who

02:22.442 --> 02:27.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pray for the sound of a familiar
voice when
the phone rings. Instead, a car
pulled up

02:27.848 --> 02:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the house, and there was a
knock on the
front door, and the sound of
"Taps" floated

02:34.221 --> 02:36.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through a cemetery's trees.

02:36.823 --> 02:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thousands of
headstones
bore mute witness at Arlington
National Cemetery

02:45.332 --> 02:49.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, as the president first
laid a wreath
at the Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier, and then

02:49.836 --> 02:51.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spoke of the sacrifice they
represent.

02:51.671 --> 02:55.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: If you look
closely at the white
markers that grace these hills,
one thing

02:56.009 --> 03:01.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you will notice is that so many
of years,
dates of birth and dates of
death, are so

03:01.114 --> 03:02.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
close together.

03:02.849 --> 03:10.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They belong to young Americans,
those who
never lived to be honored as
veterans for

03:10.624 --> 03:17.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their service, men who battled
their own brothers
in civil war, those who fought
as a band of

03:17.497 --> 03:25.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brothers an ocean away, men and
women who
redefined heroism for a new
generation.

03:25.038 --> 03:29.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: More than two
dozen American
service members have died in
Iraq and Afghanistan

03:29.910 --> 03:31.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
since last Memorial Day.

03:32.012 --> 03:36.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president today singled out
three of them,
all special forces troops killed
by Islamic

03:36.750 --> 03:43.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State fighters in Iraq, Navy
SEAL Charles
Keating IV, Marine Staff
Sergeant Louis Cardin,

03:43.790 --> 03:47.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Army Master Sergeant Joshua
Wheeler.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama also said
Americans, and the
government, must do more for
those who do

03:51.665 --> 03:53.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
return home.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: We have to make
sure our veterans
get everything that they have
earned, from

03:56.136 --> 04:02.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good health care to a good job,
and we have
to do better. Our work is never
done. We have

04:02.943 --> 04:06.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be there not only when we
need them, but
when they need us.

04:06.146 --> 04:10.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Amid the
ceremonies in Washington,
police locked down parts of the
White House

04:10.250 --> 04:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complex for a time, when someone
threw a suspicious
package over a fence. A woman
was later taken

04:15.856 --> 04:17.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into custody.

04:17.791 --> 04:22.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elsewhere, annual parades and
tributes played
out across the country. In New
Castle, Delaware,

04:22.696 --> 04:27.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice President Biden took part
in ceremonies
naming the state National Guard
headquarters

04:27.400 --> 04:31.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for his son, Beau Biden, who
died last year
of brain cancer.

04:31.371 --> 04:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Memorial Day also brought
thousands of
travelers to airports. There
were still long

04:35.976 --> 04:40.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security lines in some places,
but, for the
most part, delays appeared
shorter than before.

04:40.647 --> 04:43.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

04:43.884 --> 04:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: About 320 rescued
migrants and
refugees arrived at a port in
Sicily today.

JOHN YANG: About 320 rescued
migrants and
refugees arrived at a port in
Sicily today.

06:24.551 --> 06:28.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And something has happened in
Sweden that
had not happened since they
started keeping

06:28.488 --> 06:35.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
records in 1749. The country now
has more
men than women. The Swedish
government's new

06:35.996 --> 06:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
count is a rare (AUDIO GAP)

06:50.110 --> 06:54.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Iraqi forces
advance on the ISIS-held city of
Fallujah;

against Gawker generates a
fierce debate over
a free press; and much more.

07:10.530 --> 07:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against Gawker generates a
fierce debate over
a free press; and much more.

07:18.505 --> 07:22.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iraqi government, with
United States support,
stepped up the pace to retake
the city of

07:22.742 --> 07:27.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fallujah. Iraqi military forces
stormed the
southern edge of the city, which
has been

07:27.080 --> 07:32.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
controlled by ISIS since January
2014.

07:32.652 --> 07:38.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi tanks rolled down a main
road leading
into Fallujah, spearheading the
all-out push

07:38.325 --> 07:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to recapture the city. The
offensive to rout
ISIS militants began last week,
with government

07:45.332 --> 07:50.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces advancing slowly to try
to minimize
civilian casualties. Government
officials

07:50.770 --> 07:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and aid groups estimate at least
50,000 people
are trapped in the besieged
city.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HADI AL-AMIRI, Badr Organization
(through
translator): Our advice to our
troops is to

07:59.946 --> 08:05.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treat families gently and
kindly, and to respect
them. Our advice to fighters is
to protect

08:05.251 --> 08:07.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and guard public and private
properties.

08:07.354 --> 08:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Fallujah, about 40
miles west of
Baghdad, is one of the Islamic
State's last

08:12.625 --> 08:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major strongholds in the region.
ISIS has
controlled it since 2014.
Ramadi, farther

08:19.299 --> 08:25.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the west, was liberated at
the end of last
year. It was a major victory for
Iraqi forces,

08:25.538 --> 08:30.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but at a great cost. Much of
Ramadi was leveled
in the process.

08:30.710 --> 08:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fallujah may now face a similar
fate. It's
being bombarded by Iraqi forces
on the ground

08:36.683 --> 08:42.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the U.S.-led coalition from
the air. The
city is no stranger to
destruction. It was

08:42.555 --> 08:48.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
largely ruined back in 2004,
after the U.S.
invasion and subsequent battles
with insurgents.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maher Chmaytelli is the Reuters
bureau chief
in Baghdad.

08:51.965 --> 08:57.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHER CHMAYTELLI, Reuters: The
population
of Fallujah is -- is a
conservative population,

08:57.103 --> 09:02.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like an Islamic Sunni,
conservative,
has a Sunni conservative
background.

09:02.542 --> 09:10.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Historically, let's say, since
2003, since
Saddam was toppled, Fallujah was
very much

09:10.517 --> 09:16.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like a bastion of the insurgency
against first
the U.S. occupation of Iraq, and
later off

09:16.423 --> 09:21.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
against the Shiite-led
governments that were
put in place after the removal
of Saddam.

09:21.661 --> 09:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Thousands have been
displaced by
the years of fighting, and some
have been

09:26.065 --> 09:31.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
living in camps for two years.
They say conditions
in the city are desperate.

09:31.438 --> 09:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAAHJET IBRAHIM, Iraq (through
translator):
Those who are inside cannot
leave and those

09:36.643 --> 09:41.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are outside cannot help
them. I mean,
there is no food at all. A sack
of flour costs

09:41.481 --> 09:46.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than $800. And you can't
even get it.
Now my relatives who are still
there have

09:46.352 --> 09:50.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paid 683 U.S. dollars for 44
pounds of rice
and flour.

09:50.223 --> 09:55.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There have been calls
for the government
to open a safe corridor for the
injured, elderly

09:55.428 --> 09:57.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and children to leave.

09:57.464 --> 10:04.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Islamic State forces are
pressed in Fallujah,
they are striking back in
Baghdad. Mangled

10:04.070 --> 10:08.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wreckage was all that was left
of a suicide
bomber's car that detonated near
a commercial

10:08.808 --> 10:12.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
area today, killing eight
civilians and three
soldiers.

10:12.745 --> 10:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): By
launching such
attacks, the militants aimed to
thwart our

10:18.117 --> 10:22.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
determination and resolution to
go forward
with our victories in Fallujah
and Garma.

10:22.956 --> 10:26.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite the casualties that we
have suffered,
we are ready to proceed with our
battles and

10:26.893 --> 10:28.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our military gains.

10:28.862 --> 10:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The targets in the
Iraqi capital
have been largely Shiites, and
the Shiite-dominated

10:33.399 --> 10:35.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government is feeling the heat.

10:35.335 --> 10:39.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAHER CHMAYTELLI: Shia
politicians have been
pressuring the government to
take action against

10:39.072 --> 10:43.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fallujah after the series of
bombings that
we have seen, especially over
the pats two

10:43.910 --> 10:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks. As soon as he announced
the offensive
on Fallujah, we have seen more
or less the

10:48.781 --> 10:52.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shiite community rallying around
him, participating
in the battles.

10:52.485 --> 10:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Iraqi officials say
they have to
take Fallujah before moving on
to Mosul, the

10:57.423 --> 11:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
country's second largest city.

11:09.536 --> 11:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The presidential candidates had
a relatively
low-key Memorial Day.

11:13.540 --> 11:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, who's closing
in on the Democratic
nomination, went back to the
town she now

11:18.177 --> 11:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calls home, Chappaqua, New York,
to march
in a local Memorial Day parade.
Bernie Sanders

11:23.383 --> 11:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spent today in California, the
big prize of
next Tuesday's primaries, and
possibly his

11:28.454 --> 11:34.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last stand. He marked the
holiday in San Francisco,
ahead of two events this evening
in Oakland.

11:34.227 --> 11:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Donald Trump stayed
out of the
public eye today. But as of this
weekend,

11:38.565 --> 11:44.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he can now count a former
Republican governor
as a third-party rival. Gary
Johnson, who

11:44.537 --> 11:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was once New Mexico's chief
executive, ran
for president as a Libertarian
in 2012, winning

11:50.076 --> 11:55.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just about 1 percent of the
vote. On Sunday,
the party made him its nominee
once again,

11:55.815 --> 12:01.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and picked another former
Republican governor,
William Weld of Massachusetts,
to be his running

12:01.487 --> 12:03.356 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mate.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on all this and the
week ahead in
politics, we have Amy Walter of
The Cook Political

12:07.226 --> 12:10.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Report and Tamara Keith of NPR.

12:10.163 --> 12:16.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Amy, Tam, reporters finally
got their
contested convention this
weekend. The Libertarians

12:16.569 --> 12:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went to two ballots. With both
Donald Trump
and Hillary Clinton, the two
major party nominees,

12:21.975 --> 12:25.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so unpopular, the Libertarians
are hoping
this is going be their big year.

12:25.878 --> 12:27.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Amy, what do you think?

12:27.680 --> 12:29.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
they got a couple of hurdles to
overcome.

12:29.482 --> 12:32.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first is, I don't think a
lot of people
know anything about Gary Johnson
or William

12:32.885 --> 12:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Weld or what they stand for, and
so they are
going to have to figure out what
their message

12:36.322 --> 12:40.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is beyond just, I'm not Donald
Trump, I'm
not Hillary Clinton.

12:40.660 --> 12:43.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second thing is, they have
got to figure
out how to raise money to get
that message

12:43.730 --> 12:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out and to get some attention.
And, finally,
they got to figure out if they
can get the

12:47.734 --> 12:52.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
15 percent -- that's the
threshold that you
need to hit in major polls
leading up to the

12:52.605 --> 12:56.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first presidential debate to be
included in
those.

12:56.676 --> 13:02.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we remember Ross Perot was
included in
the debates in 1992. I think
that, in 1980,

13:02.882 --> 13:07.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you had Anderson was included in
at least
one of those debates. But 15
percent is still

13:07.120 --> 13:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very high bar. Without it, it
means that
they're not going to get a whole
much attention

13:13.059 --> 13:14.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
later in the fall.

13:14.861 --> 13:19.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Can they still make
an impact?
Can they still have a difference
in this face?

13:19.165 --> 13:23.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People will still tell you if
they were do
wild calculations to say that
Ralph Nader

13:23.970 --> 13:29.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cost Al Gore the 2000 election.
But, Tam,
can they really make a
difference this year?

13:29.809 --> 13:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: And I
will say Ralph Nader continues
to disagree

13:32.378 --> 13:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with that assessment. But most
people feel
the other way.

13:37.517 --> 13:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In talking to voters out there,
you hear people,
you hear Republicans saying, I
can't vote

13:42.388 --> 13:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Donald Trump. And maybe the
Libertarians
are a landing place, because
they are fiscally

13:47.860 --> 13:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative and they want
government out
of your life. Then you talk to
some Democrats.

13:52.865 --> 13:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was talking to some Democrats
in Albuquerque
who are Bernie people.

13:56.502 --> 14:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they -- if Bernie is not
there, rather
write in, they might vote for
Gary Johns,

14:00.773 --> 14:07.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they said. And they're -- the
Libertarian
platform is pro-marijuana, which
has in the

14:07.947 --> 14:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past attracted some subset of
younger voters
who get excited about.

14:13.786 --> 14:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they are not, as far as we
can tell -- and
things have been wild this year,
so subject

14:20.993 --> 14:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to change -- they are not
getting a huge influx
of voters necessarily.

14:26.799 --> 14:30.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You talk about the
Republicans,
the never Trumpers on the
Republican side.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They still keep talk be about
another candidate.

14:33.272 --> 14:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This weekend, we had that
tantalizing tweet
from Bill Kristol saying there
was going to

14:38.444 --> 14:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be another candidate. Are they
still looking?
Are they still trying to come up
with someone,

14:43.649 --> 14:45.084 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Amy?

14:45.118 --> 14:49.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: There's still a
fringe part of
the never Trump movement.

14:49.789 --> 14:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Kristol is leading that
charge. He's
the publisher of The Weekly
Standard, and

14:53.826 --> 14:56.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggesting that there could be
another candidate
out there. As you said, there
was a sort of

14:57.029 --> 15:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cryptic tweet that over the
holiday weekend
an independent candidate is
going to come

15:00.399 --> 15:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, he's going to be amazing.
Actually didn't
have a gender. This person is
going to be

15:04.270 --> 15:08.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amazing. Just wait until you see
who this
person.

15:08.307 --> 15:12.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have the name of that
candidate yet,
but they have their own hurdles
as an independent

15:12.211 --> 15:16.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
candidate. At least the
Libertarian candidates
have ballot access because of
their party

15:16.949 --> 15:22.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
status. A third-party candidate,
in order
to get on the ballot, there is a
tremendous

15:22.255 --> 15:24.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
level of work that you need to
do.

15:24.157 --> 15:28.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have already had one state
where the deadline
has passed. That's Texas. North
Carolina is

15:28.628 --> 15:33.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a week from now. You need
hundreds of thousands
of signatures, so it's not an
easy task to

15:33.366 --> 15:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overcome. But it goes to the
bigger point,
and this is what Tam brought up
too, which

15:36.435 --> 15:41.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, what do these candidates who
feel like
neither candidate speaks to them
-- if you're

15:41.040 --> 15:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Republican who just can't vote
for Donald
Trump, are you going to vote for
a Libertarian

15:44.911 --> 15:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who may also not share your
values?

15:47.513 --> 15:51.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their platform on issues, on
social issues
especially, is going to be far
to the left

15:51.284 --> 15:57.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from any conservative
Republicans. Their platform
on some fiscal issues may be too
far to the

15:57.490 --> 16:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right for some Democrats. This
is going to
be not an easy landing place for
a lot of

16:01.727 --> 16:03.496 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

16:03.529 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And like a lot of the
discussion
is about down-ballot candidates,
congressional

16:07.099 --> 16:11.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates, Senate candidates.
How much is
trying to affect the
presidential race? How

16:11.737 --> 16:17.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much of this is trying to give
small-government
conservatives that you were
talking about

16:17.710 --> 16:21.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
earlier a reason to go to the
polls to vote
for other candidates?

16:21.814 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I don't think that
the Libertarians
are trying to give them a
reason, but, certainly,

16:27.119 --> 16:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the never Trumps are looking for
something
to help these down-ballot
candidates.

16:32.058 --> 16:38.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And really down-ballots, Senate,
House, they
are working on it on their own.
You hear a

16:39.031 --> 16:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of members of Congress -- or
at least
some share, members of Congress,
saying, I

16:43.502 --> 16:47.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support the party's nominee. And
they don't
utter the name Donald Trump,
because they

16:47.173 --> 16:51.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
don't want to get those
unfavorables to brush
off on them.

16:51.777 --> 16:57.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that there is a lot
of scrambling
right now trying to figure out
how they deal,

16:57.850 --> 17:03.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how these candidates deal with a
top of the
ticket that is wildly unpopular
with the next

17:03.055 --> 17:09.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six months that are inevitably
going to be
scorched earth from both Trump
and Clinton,

17:09.528 --> 17:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and how you do get people to
care, show up,
and vote.

17:14.467 --> 17:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And Donald Trump has
obviously
not shown much, I don't know,
shall we say,

17:20.806 --> 17:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's not really magnanimous when
it comes
to people who say that they're
not going to

17:24.744 --> 17:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support him or have not been
full-throated
in their endorsement of him.

17:28.314 --> 17:32.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we saw last week, he told --
made some
very unflattering statements
about the governor

17:32.785 --> 17:36.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of New Mexico, a Republican who
hasn't endorsed
him, and other Republicans who
haven't come

17:36.956 --> 17:38.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on board with him.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for these Republicans trying
to figure
out how do I not endorse him,
but stay with

17:41.560 --> 17:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, distance myself, but not,
he's clearly
shown you that he's not going to
take that

17:46.699 --> 17:50.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lightly. If you don't show up to
an event
as elected official in the town
he's in that

17:50.836 --> 17:53.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you represent, he's probably
going to call
you out about that.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He essentially says,
I don't need
them.

17:55.474 --> 17:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, I don't need
them, but I
would like to attack them
nonetheless.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Let's talk about the
Democrats.

18:01.013 --> 18:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders is essentially
all in, in California.
Looks like he's not going to
leave the state

18:06.252 --> 18:13.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before the primary. Why? Why is
he doing this?
Why is he making this last stand
there?

18:13.326 --> 18:16.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I think the bottom
line is because
he can.

18:16.195 --> 18:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, mathematically -- and
Tamara and I have
talked about this now for
months, about how

18:20.833 --> 18:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important the math is, the
delegate math.
Hillary Clinton is on track to
win the nomination.

18:27.006 --> 18:31.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She has pledged delegate
support. Remember,
the candidates that you win by
winning states,

18:31.811 --> 18:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
54 percent of the pledged
delegates. She's
gotten 60 percent of the total
super, plus

18:37.383 --> 18:39.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pledged delegates.

18:39.185 --> 18:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has a lead in the overall
popular vote.
Bernie Sanders would need to win
91 percent

18:42.788 --> 18:47.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of all the pledged and
superdelegates in order
to win. That's not going to
happen. But what

18:47.727 --> 18:52.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's been able to do -- and I
think for all
the talk about all the
disruptions in this

18:52.198 --> 18:55.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign, this thing, this
smartphone has
been one of the biggest
disrupters, because,

18:55.901 --> 19:00.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normally, in the old days, a
candidate like
Bernie Sanders, who was
mathematically eliminated,

19:00.906 --> 19:03.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who lost lot of big states,
would run out
of money.

19:03.909 --> 19:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he would have had to have
left the campaign
trail. Now he's able to raise
all of it online,

19:09.949 --> 19:15.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in small donations. He's also
able to organize
his volunteers and his
supporters with this

19:15.855 --> 19:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tool, with blogs and all of the
rest. That
has been the thing that has kept
Bernie Sanders

19:21.594 --> 19:23.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this race.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Tamara, you just
were out
in California. What does it look
like on the

19:25.531 --> 19:26.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ground out there?

19:26.932 --> 19:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Certainly, both
candidates are
competing very hard.

19:29.702 --> 19:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, this weekend,
went to Visalia,
California, which is not a big
city. I think

19:36.208 --> 19:40.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is down on the list of the
size of cities
in the California Central
Valley, which is

19:40.579 --> 19:43.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not the most populous part of
California.
He's going all over.

19:43.916 --> 19:48.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is also going,
was there.
She's going back. She is
spending a lot of

19:48.254 --> 19:54.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time there. This is not for
Hillary Clinton
or Bernie Sanders really about
winning the

19:54.960 --> 20:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nomination. This is about that
taste that
is left in people's mouths at
the very end

20:01.133 --> 20:03.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the primary process.

20:03.069 --> 20:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Hillary Clinton, if she were
to lose California
at the very end, she is likely
to have clinched

20:09.341 --> 20:16.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already in New Jersey or even
before that.
But it just leaves us sort of
like, ugh, OK,

20:16.415 --> 20:18.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it sucks the wind out, it takes
the momentum
away.

20:19.018 --> 20:24.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Bernie Sanders, if he's
going to make
an argument to these
superdelegates that they

20:24.223 --> 20:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are completely wrong and they
shouldn't be
supporting Hillary Clinton, the
only thing

20:27.760 --> 20:32.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's got is to be able to say,
look at the
most populous blue state in
America. I won

20:33.032 --> 20:35.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that state. That's what he is
fighting for
right now.

20:35.501 --> 20:38.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: So, just like
Hollywood, California,
it's all about image and
perception.

20:38.737 --> 20:39.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Indeed.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: OK, great.

20:40.306 --> 20:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy, Tamara, thanks a lot for
being with us.

20:46.178 --> 20:50.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

20:50.549 --> 20:56.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Stay with us.

20:56.055 --> 21:01.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": why
Latinos say
their economic and voting power
is underestimated;

21:01.560 --> 21:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the do's and don't's of creating
political
narratives; and the Armenian
genocide in poetry.

21:09.435 --> 21:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: a most unusual legal
case about
media ethics, responsibility and
a billionaire's

21:15.641 --> 21:17.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
power.

21:17.376 --> 21:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It started with former wrestler
Hulk Hogan
suing Gawker Media for
publishing a video

21:21.046 --> 21:27.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of him having sex with a
friend's wife. A
jury awarded him $140 million
for invasion

21:27.720 --> 21:29.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of privacy.

21:29.555 --> 21:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, we learned Hogan's
suit was by
Peter Thiel, one of the
co-founders of PayPal

21:35.227 --> 21:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a major Silicon Valley
player. Thiel himself
was outed as a gay man by Gawker
Media nearly

21:41.500 --> 21:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a decade ago. That triggered a
critical public
letter from Gawker's co-founder,
Nick Denton.

21:48.541 --> 21:54.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He challenged Thiel to a public
debate, calling
him "a thin-skinned billionaire
with a vindictive

21:55.014 --> 22:00.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decade-long campaign quite out
of proportion
to the hurt you claim."

22:00.619 --> 22:04.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The case and the revelations
have sparked
big questions.

22:04.156 --> 22:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan recently spoke
with Jason
Tanz, the editor at large of
"Wired."

22:08.694 --> 22:13.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, let's go
over just basics
of what happened in this case,
because most

22:13.232 --> 22:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people aren't following Hulk
Hogan's sex tape
saga too closely.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JASON TANZ, "Wired": Sure.

22:19.538 --> 22:28.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a few years ago, Gawker
published an article
that included a video of a sex
tape that Hulk

22:28.414 --> 22:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hogan had made, actually was
made without
his knowledge. They declared it
was in the

22:33.752 --> 22:38.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public interest because Hulk
Hogan was a public
figure and he had gone on record
talking about

22:38.757 --> 22:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how he had not had sex with this
woman, and
they had proof that he had. So
they published

22:44.530 --> 22:48.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, somewhat gleefully, which
has always been
Gawker's kind of stock and
trade.

22:48.867 --> 22:56.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been very forward in
their -- in
what they declare to be in the
public interest.

22:56.141 --> 23:00.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they thought this was. Hulk
Hogan didn't
see things that way. He brought
a lawsuit

23:00.412 --> 23:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against them. The jury found
against Gawker
to the tune of $140 million,
which was a pretty

23:06.518 --> 23:08.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shocking about.

23:08.354 --> 23:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gawker has appealed the case and
they're waiting
to see how that plays out.

23:10.990 --> 23:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how does
Peter Thiel
get involved in this? He --
there's no love

23:14.560 --> 23:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lost between the founder of
Gawker, Nick Denton,
and Peter Thiel.

23:18.731 --> 23:23.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON TANZ: Nick Denton had
suspected that
there was actually somebody
funding Hulk Hogan's

23:23.302 --> 23:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lawsuit, because the way Hogan
was prosecuting
the suit, he was making
decisions that, if

23:29.875 --> 23:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he were interested in making
money, game theory
suggests that he would have done
something

23:33.679 --> 23:35.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
differently.

23:35.481 --> 23:40.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could have taken reportedly
about a $10
million settlement. He also
withdrew a part

23:40.819 --> 23:46.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the lawsuit that would have
required a
payout from Gawker's insurance.
They actually

23:46.925 --> 23:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just withdraw that, so that
Gawker would be
on the hook and not the
insurance company.

23:51.263 --> 23:57.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that indicated maybe there
was something
else going on. In 2007, Gawker
had -- and,

23:57.136 --> 24:04.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specifically, its site Valleywag
had outed
Peter Thiel as a gay man. Thiel
at the time

24:04.677 --> 24:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
swore his revenge. And now, nine
years later,
he is getting it. He had a team
of lawyers

24:10.349 --> 24:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who were looking for various
plaintiffs who
could file suits that they could
fund, and

24:15.087 --> 24:19.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
apparently they found more than
one. Supposedly,
there a couple of other suits
out there that

24:19.291 --> 24:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's prepared to bring against
Gawker as well.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, nothing
that Peter
Thiel is doing is illegal. There
are not any

24:23.696 --> 24:28.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
laws on the books that say you
can't fund
or aid someone else's legal
pursuit, right?

24:28.867 --> 24:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a kind of a bigger
question here
of this is a billionaire using a
tremendous

24:33.939 --> 24:40.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount of influence. He's an
ardent libertarian
who does speak up on behalf of
free speech,

24:40.946 --> 24:46.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but here he is crushing an
institution that
said something that he was,
well, ticked off

24:46.552 --> 24:48.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

24:48.287 --> 24:51.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON TANZ: Yes, I mean, the
tricky thing
about this is, Thiel feels
wronged, but he

24:51.957 --> 24:57.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not suing Gawker based on the
statement
that he feels wronged him. He's
not suing

24:57.196 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them for outing him.

24:59.098 --> 25:04.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's suing them for Hogan. And
based on his
actions and based on Hogan's
actions, it doesn't

25:04.803 --> 25:08.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seem that is what is motivating
him is justice
for Hogan. It seems that what is
motivating

25:08.607 --> 25:12.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him is essentially crushing
Gawker through
the court system.

25:12.578 --> 25:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are a lot of people, a
lot of people
in the press in particular, who
see that and

25:15.981 --> 25:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get very, very scared, because
the point isn't
even necessarily to win the
suit. He can continue

25:22.321 --> 25:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to litigate against Gawker and
rack up huge
legal fees and destroy them even
if he never

25:27.259 --> 25:29.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wins a suit.

25:29.128 --> 25:33.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what does
the tech community
in Silicon Valley, how do they
feel about

25:33.432 --> 25:36.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this? On the one hand, there's
the journalism
question. On the other hand,
there is that

25:36.468 --> 25:39.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peter Thiel is a smart guy and a
visionary
in this community.

25:39.738 --> 25:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON TANZ: Yes, there's been a
lot of defense
of Thiel within the tech
community.

25:44.309 --> 25:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gawker is an easy media property
to hate.
And Valleywag in particular, for
those in

25:47.780 --> 25:53.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tech industry, is a very
easy media property
to hate. They were glib, they
were cruel,

25:53.085 --> 25:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were callous, and they had,
some would
say, pretty bad editorial
judgment a lot of

25:57.189 --> 25:58.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the time,

25:58.991 --> 26:02.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like lot a First Amendment
cases, whether
that is Larry Flynt or Gawker,
it's very hard

26:02.428 --> 26:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to defend the specifics of this
particular
case. So, a lot of people within
Silicon Valley

26:08.367 --> 26:14.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are saying, look, this isn't any
different
from the ACLU or Greenpeace
funding suits

26:14.072 --> 26:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they think are going to end
up having
a greater social good.

26:18.210 --> 26:22.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, the greater social
good is punishing
and deterring people from
publishing the kind

26:22.648 --> 26:28.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of stuff that Gawker does. Now,
the concern,
of course, is who is to
determine what should

26:28.287 --> 26:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be punished? And even if we all
agree -- and
I'm not saying that we do -- but
even if we

26:31.924 --> 26:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all did agree that what Gawker
published shouldn't
have been published, by that
same logic, you

26:35.928 --> 26:40.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could say, I don't like the way
they're talking
about Theranos, and that's
really been unfair

26:40.365 --> 26:44.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Theranos, and I think that
that has been
unfair and untoward and is
click-bait, and,

26:44.970 --> 26:48.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
therefore, I'm going to punish
The Wall Street
Journal for publishing that.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one of those slippery slope
arguments
that you get into with these
First Amendment

26:51.577 --> 26:52.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disputes.

26:52.978 --> 26:55.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Jason Tanz from
"Wired," thanks so much.

26:55.347 --> 27:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JASON TANZ: Yes, thanks for
having me.

27:04.923 --> 27:11.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Much of the focus on
Latinos throughout
this election cycle has centered
on the divisive

27:11.597 --> 27:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and often heated questions about
immigration
and its effects.

27:15.400 --> 27:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now a bipartisan non-profit
group is trying
to change that. The Latino Donor
Collective

27:21.740 --> 27:26.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
(sic), as it's known, wants to
emphasize the
growing economic power of
Latinos and the

27:26.078 --> 27:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
potential force they can become.

27:28.213 --> 27:35.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with its co-founders,
Democrat Henry
Cisneros and Republican
businessman Sol Trujillo.

27:35.053 --> 27:38.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cisneros was housing secretary
in the Clinton
administration.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, thanks for being with
us.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Cisneros, I would like to
start with you.

27:42.728 --> 27:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two of you wrote an essay
for The Wall
Street Journal, and you said
that you have

27:46.365 --> 27:51.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been watching this presidential
campaign unfold
at first with disappointment,
then with concern

27:51.470 --> 27:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and now with real alarm. What is
alarming
you?

27:54.473 --> 27:58.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY CISNEROS, Co-Founder,
Latino Donor Collaborative:
Well, what alarms me is that the
rhetoric

27:58.477 --> 28:06.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Latinos seems to be giving
people permission
to denigrate this population, to
diminish

28:06.818 --> 28:10.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its place in American life. And
that's just
wrong.

28:10.722 --> 28:16.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a population of 55
million people,
growing to 100 million people.
It is essential

28:16.862 --> 28:23.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the American future. It is
already making
a major contribution in many
areas of American

28:23.168 --> 28:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life, from religion to politics
to entrepreneurship
and to corporate business and as
consumers.

28:33.512 --> 28:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the most important
areas is in
its contribution to the American
economy,

28:39.484 --> 28:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Sol has come to call the
mainstream economy,
the mainstream American economy,
the next

28:46.191 --> 28:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American economy. And it's just
wrong to categorize
a people somehow as -- using
phrases related

28:55.067 --> 29:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to rapists and murderers and
freeloaders,
et cetera, to characterize an
entire population.

29:01.673 --> 29:07.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And someone needs to stand up
and say, let's
talk about the truth of this
population. And

29:07.245 --> 29:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's role in American life.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trujillo, why are
the politicians
missing this? What aren't they
getting?

29:11.950 --> 29:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOL TRUJILLO, Co-Founder, Latino
Donor Collaborative:
No one talking how we drive
growth, how we're

29:15.921 --> 29:21.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creating jobs, what's creating
jobs, what
is our upside in terms of the
economy.

29:21.259 --> 29:27.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And is where today we have a new
mainstream
economy driven predominantly by
Latinos in

29:27.332 --> 29:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growth. Let me give you some
quick statistics.
There's about a
trillion-and-a-half dollars

29:31.703 --> 29:37.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of spend by Latinos in this
country today,
growing at $80 billion to $90
billion per

29:37.442 --> 29:39.211 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

29:39.244 --> 29:44.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On top that, let's talk about
job creation
and what are drivers of domestic
GDP growth.

29:44.883 --> 29:51.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Think about housing. Think about
home purchases.
Over the last decade, 51 percent
of all new

29:51.556 --> 29:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home mortgages taken out in the
United States
of America have been taken out
by Latino families.

29:57.996 --> 30:03.635 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
When you look at
entrepreneurship, in the
last half-decade, 86 percent of
all new business

30:03.669 --> 30:09.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
formations in the United States,
based upon
a recent Hoover study
commissioned through

30:09.508 --> 30:17.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Stanford Latino
Entrepreneurship Initiative,
shows that Latinos were creating
86 percent

30:17.449 --> 30:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of all new business formations.

30:19.618 --> 30:26.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without Latinos in the mix, we
as a nation
would have had net negative
business formations.

30:26.558 --> 30:32.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can go on with more data,
John. But,
as an American, as somebody that
cares about

30:32.664 --> 30:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our economy, which all of us at
the Latino
Donor Collaborative do, we want
to make sure

30:37.669 --> 30:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this story is understood,
rather than
mischaracterizations, incorrect
facts, which

30:45.544 --> 30:51.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will mislead policy decisions
that could be
very damaging to our economy.

30:51.316 --> 30:56.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Cisneros, you
talk about the
-- sort of the economic drivers
in the Latino

30:56.455 --> 31:01.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community. But at the same time,
there are
economic challenges to the
Latino community.

31:01.193 --> 31:07.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The BLS, Bureau of Labor
Statistics, says
that one in five Latinos is
working in a minimum

31:07.065 --> 31:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wage job, that unemployment
among Latinos
is higher than the national
average. Are there

31:12.504 --> 31:16.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still challenges among the --
for Latinos
in the economy?

31:16.108 --> 31:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRY CISNEROS: Oh, absolutely.
There are
huge challenges, many Latinos
working in underemployed

31:22.247 --> 31:25.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
situations, undercompensated
situations.

31:25.250 --> 31:29.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And one of the biggest
challenges confronting
the Latino community is the need
to close

31:29.087 --> 31:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the gap in educational levels.
And we are.
We're making progress in terms
of lowering

31:35.393 --> 31:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the dropout rate, improving the
high school
graduation rate, improving the
acception to

31:39.998 --> 31:41.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
college.

31:41.767 --> 31:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the most dangerous
things about
the kind of rhetoric we're
seeing today is

31:45.137 --> 31:51.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if it results in the
country failing
to recognize that it must invest
in Latinos,

31:51.409 --> 31:56.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that Latinos are ambitious
and want to
avail themselves of education
and providing

31:56.581 --> 32:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the means to do that, then
there's a huge
opportunity cost for the United
States.

32:02.554 --> 32:08.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a population that is
large. In fact,
it's going to be 100 million
people by about

32:08.093 --> 32:12.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2040, 25 percent of the American
population.
It's already the largest
minority and the

32:12.964 --> 32:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fastest growing minority. The
swing can be
immense. Either it can be a
large population

32:19.437 --> 32:24.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is a drag on American
society because
it is not receiving the proper
education and

32:24.509 --> 32:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proper investment, or it can be
truly one
of the absolute drivers, one of
the engines

32:30.482 --> 32:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of opportunity for the American
future, without
a doubt.

32:33.585 --> 32:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How can you get the
political power
to match the demographic power
and the economic

32:39.958 --> 32:46.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
power? In 20 -- the last
presidential election,
only 47 percent of Latinos
registered to vote

32:46.832 --> 32:47.532 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voted.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How can you improve that
turnout?

32:49.534 --> 32:56.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOL TRUJILLO: Well, John, let's
look at results
first before we get into the
what I call misleading

32:56.274 --> 32:58.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
statistical analysis.

32:58.076 --> 33:04.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you look at the last
election, one of the
big conclusions of the
Republican Party was

33:04.416 --> 33:09.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the reason why they lost
was because
of the fact that they didn't get
the Latino

33:09.921 --> 33:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote. If you look at the prior
election, same
conclusion, and the one before
that, until

33:16.161 --> 33:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you look back at George W. Bush,
and you look
at Ronald Reagan, who both were
able to get

33:22.167 --> 33:24.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over 40 percent of the Latino
vote.

33:24.803 --> 33:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, guess what? The base of
the Latino vote,
the percentage of total voters
as Latinos

33:31.843 --> 33:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has only gotten bigger. So, I
call it basic
elementary math. Then you have
to understand

33:38.383 --> 33:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the basic math. We can talk
about 47 percent
voter rates or we can talk about
42 and talk

33:46.391 --> 33:49.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about those numbers, but the
base is just
getting bigger.

33:49.961 --> 33:57.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the reality. There's
almost a million
young Latinos turning 18 every
year; 93 percent

33:57.135 --> 34:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them are native-born. And
it's dramatically
changing what we would call the
base, the

34:03.041 --> 34:08.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voter base, those who are going
to be active
in politics, and while at the
same time, other

34:08.413 --> 34:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups are actually in decline
as a percentage
of total. It's just math.

34:13.251 --> 34:17.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sol Trujillo, Henry
Cisneros, trying
to change the discussion about
Latinos in

34:17.689 --> 34:19.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
America, thanks for joining us.

34:19.090 --> 34:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HENRY CISNEROS: Thank you for
the opportunity.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOL TRUJILLO: Thank you, John.

34:22.394 --> 34:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The group that Mr.
Cisneros and
Mr. Trujillo have started is the
Latino Donor

34:26.631 --> 34:30.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Collaborative.

34:30.669 --> 34:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And next: the latest
addition to
our "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

34:42.347 --> 34:46.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a personal narrative on the
importance
that visuals play in making or
breaking a

34:46.618 --> 34:50.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political campaign or a White
House event.

34:50.455 --> 34:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy Woodruff sat down with
author Josh King
to discuss the significance of
imagery in

34:55.727 --> 34:57.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the age of optics.

34:57.529 --> 35:02.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Political
stagecraft has evolved
into a high form of art. But
that doesn't

35:02.400 --> 35:08.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean mishaps don't take place
along the campaign
trail or on the road with the
president.

35:08.073 --> 35:13.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn now to Josh King. He is
the author
of "Off Script: An Advance Man's
Guide to

35:13.745 --> 35:19.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House Stagecraft, Campaign
Spectacle,
and Political Suicide."

35:19.250 --> 35:20.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Josh King, welcome to the
"NewsHour."

35:20.685 --> 35:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH KING, Author, "Off Script:
Thanks, Judy.
Thanks for having me.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, first of all,
what is an
advance man?

35:24.356 --> 35:28.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH KING: An advance man is
basically a political
movie producer.

35:28.526 --> 35:32.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We roam the hustings of America
and around
the world trying to tell
political stories

35:32.797 --> 35:38.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by setting up tableaus that
connect a president
or a presidential candidate with
the places

35:38.236 --> 35:40.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are or the people that
they're interacting
with.

35:40.271 --> 35:45.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You were there
for some of
the most memorable moments of
the last several

35:45.510 --> 35:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic political leaders in
this country,
Michael Dukakis, when he ran for
president,

35:50.782 --> 35:52.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bill Clinton.

35:52.650 --> 35:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you make a wonderful point
of saying the
mistakes are where the people
learn, someone

35:59.357 --> 36:03.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in your job learns. And you
write beautifully
about what happened to Michael
Dukakis. Tell

36:03.461 --> 36:05.196 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that story.

36:05.230 --> 36:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH KING: Dukakis was down in
Michigan. He
was down in the summer of 1988,
and he had

36:09.134 --> 36:16.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to go and into a General
Dynamics land systems
plant and ride M1-A1 Abrams tank
to try and

36:16.474 --> 36:20.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look like a more credible
commander in chief.
But the tank didn't fit him, and
it showed

36:20.945 --> 36:25.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that day, and then in the
commercial that
Sig Rogich made five weeks later
and put on

36:25.316 --> 36:27.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the air on behalf of the
Bush-Quayle campaign.

36:27.052 --> 36:28.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On behalf of the
Republicans.

36:28.920 --> 36:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's interesting, because
you point out
Michael Dukakis had served in
the military,

36:32.690 --> 36:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been in Korea, in the U.S. Army,
but he still
didn't -- this picture didn't
work. What is

36:39.831 --> 36:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- how do you know what works
for a candidate
or for a president? What is a
setting that's

36:44.769 --> 36:46.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to work?

36:46.638 --> 36:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH KING: Well, it has to fit
who he is.
And as much as Dukakis had come
out of Swarthmore

36:50.608 --> 36:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and was drafted into the Army
and served in
Korea after the armistice, his
persona and

36:56.147 --> 37:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his executive experience was
based much more
on his life in Massachusetts, a
competent

37:01.152 --> 37:03.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administrator, a person who
could get things
done.

37:03.788 --> 37:07.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wasn't running to be a
commander in chief.
He was running on the economy.
He would have

37:07.225 --> 37:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been much better in a hospital
setting or
in a school, where he could
point to so many

37:11.396 --> 37:13.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things in his record that
matched who he was.

37:13.298 --> 37:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are other
images. You
were there for Bill Clinton. And
you shared

37:16.701 --> 37:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some images that are -- pictures
that are
in the book. You shared with us
just today

37:20.171 --> 37:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a picture of Bill Clinton
surrounded by a
swarm of gnats. What happened?

37:23.875 --> 37:28.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH KING: Well, they sent me to
Lyon, France.
It was the G7 Summit.

37:28.780 --> 37:33.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so much of that happens
indoors around
a big conference table. I wanted
to show him

37:33.351 --> 37:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a little more bucolic setting
to show that
he was really enjoying his
European trip.

37:39.124 --> 37:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the heat was growing. It was
one of the
hottest days of the year. And a
swarm of gnats

37:43.928 --> 37:46.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was forming around the
presidential podium.

37:46.364 --> 37:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I go into a store, and I buy
what I think
is insect repellent. I can't
really read the

37:50.435 --> 37:57.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
French writing on it. But I
spray it all over
the podium. Turns it out it was
insect killer.

37:57.075 --> 38:02.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because it was so hot and
the movie lights
that we trained on the president
to even out

38:02.046 --> 38:06.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the shadows for the TV shot was
-- were making
him sweat.

38:06.217 --> 38:11.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He got his hands on the podium.
And the questioning
was withering and he's starting
to rub his

38:11.289 --> 38:15.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eyes. And before this news
conference is over,
he's almost poisoned in his
eyes. He can't

38:15.894 --> 38:19.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- can hardly open them as he's
answering
questions about the Middle East.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a disaster for him and
for me that
day.

38:22.367 --> 38:26.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the other
scenes you
write about memorably, Josh
King, is what

38:26.237 --> 38:31.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened to President Bush when
he went out
on the aircraft carrier at the
end of -- what

38:31.976 --> 38:34.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people thought was the end of
the Iraq War.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KING: Right.

38:35.980 --> 38:41.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's May 1, 2003, the end of
combat operations
in Iraq. And to declare the end
of combat

38:41.286 --> 38:47.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operations, President Bush takes
an S-3 Viking
from San Diego to the deck of
the USS Abraham

38:47.492 --> 38:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lincoln in the Pacific Ocean.

38:49.661 --> 38:54.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when he gives his speech to
the nation
later on, now dressed in a blue
suit, does

38:54.365 --> 38:59.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this beautiful walk out from the
tower of
the carrier and comes to stage,
perfectly

38:59.070 --> 39:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
positioned and behind him is a
banner that
says "Mission Accomplished."

39:03.441 --> 39:08.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you heard the White
House's original
explanation and the ship's,
those two words,

39:08.713 --> 39:13.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Mission Accomplished," were for
the crew
of the Lincoln, which had
completed the longest

39:13.418 --> 39:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deployment of any aircraft
carrier since the
end of the Vietnam War.

39:17.855 --> 39:22.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the White House was the team
that put
that banner exactly where it
was, positioned

39:22.694 --> 39:27.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perfectly for a live national TV
shot. And
I declared that day it was a
great event in

39:27.465 --> 39:32.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all respects, but they didn't
need those two
words, because that's what
dogged Bush for

39:32.136 --> 39:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so many years after that event.

39:33.972 --> 39:37.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
explain -- if you
are working with a candidate or
a president

39:37.875 --> 39:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who says, wait a minute, I
thought this was
all on the level, I thought -- I
thought serving

39:41.412 --> 39:47.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country was about policy
positions and
about substance, you're telling
me it's about

39:47.118 --> 39:48.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
optics, what do you say?

39:48.920 --> 39:53.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH KING: To win any particular
primary or
general election and take home
electoral votes

39:53.591 --> 39:58.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in certain states, it's going go
to be covered
by local newspapers, by local
television,

39:58.062 --> 39:59.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by national television.

39:59.831 --> 40:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what they need is imagery to
fill their
packages, and we need to provide
the content

40:05.637 --> 40:11.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you, frankly, edit in and
present as
what happened that day in such a
boiled-down

40:11.209 --> 40:16.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fashion in two minutes. You get
-- Bill Clinton
or Donald Trump or Hillary
Clinton can't get

40:16.247 --> 40:21.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their policy ideas across in two
minutes.
So we feed the way the system
works.

40:21.185 --> 40:25.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, finally, as
you know very
well, what we're dealing with
today is a much

40:25.356 --> 40:27.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
faster news environment.

40:27.158 --> 40:28.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KING: Yes. Yes.

40:28.993 --> 40:31.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pictures are
taken all around.
A president can be photographed
in so many

40:31.362 --> 40:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more ways or a candidate. How
much harder
does that make the job?

40:35.566 --> 40:37.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSH KING: Infinitely harder.

40:37.435 --> 40:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I call 2004 the high watermark
of the age
of optics, because after that,
Facebook, Twitter,

40:42.040 --> 40:48.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YouTube took over. And we're
flooded with
so much, Judy, that perhaps
there's not staying

40:48.046 --> 40:53.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power of any great picture or
any negative
picture for more than a few
hours or a news

40:53.084 --> 40:54.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cycle or two.

40:54.886 --> 40:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I think is the most
powerful thing
that President Obama was able to
do last year

40:59.590 --> 41:05.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was that hour-long podcast with
Marc Maron
that he calls "WTF." And in
that, when you

41:05.196 --> 41:10.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remove the visual entirely, and
you just hear
what the president says for 60
minutes, and

41:10.702 --> 41:14.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost have this conversation in
your head,
let him say in long form what he
needs to,

41:14.906 --> 41:19.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had a much better appreciation
for Barack
Obama after that than, frankly,
seven years

41:19.744 --> 41:21.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of televised coverage.

41:21.546 --> 41:24.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're
saying, after all
this effort to get the picture
right, the

41:24.582 --> 41:26.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
picture may not matter?

41:26.050 --> 41:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH KING: My epiphany was that
perhaps the
words are more important.

41:28.753 --> 41:34.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need to do better job
listening and
creating content and allowing
people to have

41:34.292 --> 41:39.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a longer conversation. We don't
have all that
time on broadcast or commercial
television,

41:39.697 --> 41:43.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there are new mediums coming
through where
we can understand what people
have to say

41:43.434 --> 41:44.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lot better.

41:44.435 --> 41:46.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Josh King, thank
you very much.

41:46.237 --> 41:51.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Off Script: An Advance Man's
Guide to White
House Stagecraft, Campaign
Spectacle, and

41:51.743 --> 41:52.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Political Suicide."

41:52.243 --> 41:56.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We appreciate it.

41:56.381 --> 42:01.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH KING: Thank you.

42:01.953 --> 42:10.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now: how a writer is
coming to
terms with his family's own
traumatic past,

42:10.628 --> 42:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and how his use of poetry's
distinct style
helps him grapple with history.

42:15.833 --> 42:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our profile.

42:17.468 --> 42:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we should warn you, viewers
may find some
of the images disturbing.

42:21.472 --> 42:27.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Peter Balakian
grew up amid
the security and postwar
economic boom of

42:27.779 --> 42:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Jersey's suburban American
life. He played
football and worked as a stock
boy in Manhattan.

42:34.152 --> 42:37.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also early on became a reader
and writer
of poetry.

42:37.054 --> 42:42.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BALAKIAN, Pulitzer Prize
Winner: "The
day comes in strips of yellow
glass over trees.

42:42.927 --> 42:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I tell you the day is a
poem, I'm only
talking to you and only the sky
is listening."

42:49.167 --> 42:53.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It would lead to
encounters
with the likes of Allen Ginsberg
and over

42:53.538 --> 42:59.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the years seven collections. The
latest, "Ozone
Journal," just won the Pulitzer
Prize.

42:59.977 --> 43:05.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But from his grandmother
beginning at an early
age, Balakian heard occasional
hints of a

43:05.383 --> 43:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
darker family history set in
Armenia. And
he began to explore a past that
remains fought

43:10.988 --> 43:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over to this day, the expulsion
and killing
of 1.5 million Armenians by the
Ottoman Turks.

43:18.463 --> 43:23.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many members of Balakian's
family died. Others,
like his grandmother and aunts,
survived after

43:23.935 --> 43:27.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a horrific flight on foot.

43:27.038 --> 43:31.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Balakian would write about these
events in
history titled "The Burning
Tigris" and in

43:31.409 --> 43:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a family memoir, "Black Dog of
Fate."

43:33.878 --> 43:39.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BALAKIAN: One of the
reasons for my
writing "Black Dog of Fate" was
to try to

43:39.417 --> 43:45.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make sense of growing up in a
family in which
a traumatic history was really
repressed.

43:45.656 --> 43:48.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't spoken about. It was
silenced.

43:48.793 --> 43:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet the leakages that I
experienced as
a kid growing up in affluent
suburbia were

43:56.100 --> 44:00.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beguiling and weird and strange,
and they
stayed with me.

44:00.872 --> 44:04.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Leakages as in
like little
hints or stories, things you
would over hear?

44:04.609 --> 44:08.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BALAKIAN: Sure, things I
would overhear,
even my grandmother's kind of
weird dreams

44:08.346 --> 44:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and folk tales which would drift
on to me.

44:12.116 --> 44:16.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You pick up things and you
didn't know where
to put them. They were almost
deracinated.

44:16.754 --> 44:24.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in adult life I came to look
back at those
-- at those fragments and
encoded messages

44:24.562 --> 44:31.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a traumatic history. And it
really drove
me, in part at least, to work on
what became

44:31.102 --> 44:33.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a memoir, a coming of age story.

44:33.037 --> 44:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And how did it
work with poetry?
Were you discovering poetry at
the same time

44:37.775 --> 44:40.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you were sort of discovering
this history?

44:40.311 --> 44:43.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER BALAKIAN: Poetry came
first.

44:43.281 --> 44:50.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was an immersion for me as a
college student
in the early 1970s. I began
writing poems

44:50.121 --> 44:58.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a kind of passion, and I
never stopped.
I was working my way as a young
guy in his

44:58.162 --> 45:07.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20s writing lyric poems. And
around the mid
to late 1970s, for various
reasons, the news

45:07.138 --> 45:12.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of history started percolating
in me.

45:12.076 --> 45:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I started understanding more
of the big
picture of my own family's
historical experience

45:19.617 --> 45:28.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as genocide survivors. The poem
in its unique
form, its form of compressed
language and

45:28.392 --> 45:35.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particular kinds of probe
images, I like to
call them, or incisive,
compressed image language,

45:35.433 --> 45:45.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is capable of going to history
and its aftermath
in ways that no other literary
form can.

45:45.343 --> 45:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Who drowned waiting in the
reeds of the Ararat
plain? There, the sky is
cochineal. There,

45:53.150 --> 46:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the chapel windows open to raw
umber and twisted
goats. There, the obsidian
glistens and the

46:00.591 --> 46:03.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hawks eat out your eyes."

46:03.060 --> 46:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Many Armenians,
including Balakian's
grandmother, fled into what is
today Syria.

46:09.367 --> 46:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most were killed or starved to
death along
the way.

46:11.869 --> 46:15.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER BALAKIAN: As many as
450,000 Armenians
died here.

46:15.873 --> 46:22.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 2009, just
before the civil
war began, Balakian joined a "60
Minutes"

46:22.046 --> 46:25.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crew in Syria for a report on
their fate.

46:25.082 --> 46:30.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER BALAKIAN: Evidence comes
in many forms.
It comes in photographs, it
comes in texts

46:30.755 --> 46:35.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and telegrams. And it also comes
in bone.

46:35.326 --> 46:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was extraordinary then to be
there. Looking
back at it now, I feel like it's
a dream.

46:42.633 --> 46:47.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for me, it was also exciting
to be there,
because there's a very rich
Armenian culture

46:47.038 --> 46:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and community in Aleppo and a
gorgeous church.
And so all that was a kind of
connecting with

46:53.444 --> 46:55.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a diasporan culture.

46:55.746 --> 47:01.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then when the war started,
when the war
began to just destroy all of
this, I would

47:01.485 --> 47:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look on, on the screens and on
the TV images
and the computer images with
pain and disbelief

47:12.463 --> 47:19.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, just in the little case of
Armenian
cultural life there, churches
that were hundreds

47:19.303 --> 47:24.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of years old were gone. Whole
communities
were disbanded.

47:24.709 --> 47:29.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if that was true just for
the smaller
Armenian population of Syria, we
all knew

47:29.847 --> 47:35.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what was happening to the broad
Syrian population.

47:35.186 --> 47:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Peter
Balakian,
congratulations. Thank you.

47:42.126 --> 47:47.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER BALAKIAN: Thank you.

47:47.832 --> 47:52.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Now an ode to
desserts.

47:52.837 --> 47:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

47:58.075 --> 48:04.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he celebrates a meal's sweet
spot, dessert,
and explains why we should never
go without.

48:04.648 --> 48:08.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's an encore look.

48:08.085 --> 48:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BOULUD, Chef: A meal is a
crescendo.
And the crescendo wouldn't be
complete without

48:18.129 --> 48:24.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BOULUD, Chef: A meal is a
crescendo.
And the crescendo wouldn't be
complete without

48:24.468 --> 48:26.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the dessert.

48:26.270 --> 48:32.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last impression I think you
want to leave,
a long lingering, sort of,
dreamy feel of

48:32.943 --> 48:39.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the end of a meal. And I think
dessert, it
energizes you, the sugar. I
think you get

48:39.250 --> 48:40.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a little bit of the sugar rush.

48:40.518 --> 48:42.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The best part of it is
you soak it
in a lot of rum.

48:43.020 --> 48:45.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL BOULUD: That's Ghaya, our
pastry chef.

48:45.790 --> 48:51.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, right now, we're doing a
baba au rhum.
It's an old classic dessert
where it's maybe

48:51.462 --> 48:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not a children-driven dessert,
but, you know,
once you start to grow up, you
love baba au

48:57.201 --> 49:01.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rhum because that's the only
chance you have
to have a little bit of alcohol
in your dessert.

49:01.906 --> 49:08.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for us, we take this classic
idea of the
baba au rhum, but we make a
delicate baba,

49:08.345 --> 49:17.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is soaked in an aged white
rum, 3-years-old
white rum with vanilla. And then
we have pistachio,

49:17.121 --> 49:19.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a crust of pistachio on top.

49:19.790 --> 49:25.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we serve that with a
pistachio whip cream,
and the crunch of the little
pistachio, and

49:25.863 --> 49:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then on the side, also, is a
salad of citrus,
so there's grapefruit, there is
orange, there

49:32.970 --> 49:36.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a little bit of kumquat
confit in sugar
and all that.

49:36.707 --> 49:42.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the citrus is there to sort
of play with
the rum, play with the baba,
cool off a little

49:43.013 --> 49:50.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit the rum. The cream is there
to give richness
to either the baba or the
citrus. And the

49:50.487 --> 49:57.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sweet together, it's still a
very light, refreshing
dessert, and yet a very classic
French baba

49:57.695 --> 49:59.396 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
au rhum.

49:59.430 --> 50:09.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dessert is very artistic.
Dessert is sort
of an expression of art in a
very natural

50:09.306 --> 50:16.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way and in a very sort of
decadent way as
well. In cooking, yes, it's a
little bit more

50:16.580 --> 50:23.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like jazz, I mean, where you can
jam a little
bit. You can take -- you can be
spontaneous.

50:23.287 --> 50:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With pastry, it, I think, goes a
little bit
more like classical music. The
repertoire

50:31.662 --> 50:39.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is set, and it's a question of
just creating
the layers of intensity. The
texture, we respect

50:39.570 --> 50:45.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the taste. I don't think dessert
is really
the problem in a diet of people.

50:45.242 --> 50:50.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to eat dessert with
moderation, but
I think it's important to
continue to keep

50:50.180 --> 50:57.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yourself and your soul happy
with a bit of
sweetness. And I'm having
chocolate every

50:57.087 --> 51:04.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night at home. I have always bar
of chocolate.
And I break a little piece, and
I suck on

51:04.395 --> 51:10.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slowly and feel like, ah, that's
so good.
OK, that chocolate, maybe we
should do something

51:10.901 --> 51:15.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with it tomorrow.

51:15.306 --> 51:28.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later tonight this
Memorial Day
on PBS, a "POV" documentary
about post-traumatic

51:28.419 --> 51:31.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stress disorder and its haunting
effects on
veterans.

51:31.889 --> 51:37.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"Of Men and War" follows
veterans and their
families over a nine-year
period, focusing

51:37.628 --> 51:43.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on one residential treatment
center in California.
In this clip, men back from Iraq
and Afghanistan

51:43.701 --> 51:48.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are dealing with the difficulty
of adjusting
to civilian life, and frequent
problems with

51:48.672 --> 51:50.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anger and frustration.

51:50.507 --> 51:58.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I'm having trouble waking
up, like, just
completely livid. And I'm just,
I don't want

51:58.615 --> 52:03.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to even deal with this. So,
sometimes, I just
stay up for three days and fall
asleep on

52:03.887 --> 52:05.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whatever day I drop asleep.

52:05.823 --> 52:09.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: A lot of times, I find
myself thinking
things, and I say it out loud,
and everybody

52:09.994 --> 52:12.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looks at me like I'm just like
evil or like
insensitive.

52:13.030 --> 52:22.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's like, no, I didn't mean
it in an
insensitive way. It's just like
get yourself

52:22.072 --> 52:29.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- sometimes, you're sitting
there racking
my nine, and, you know, not like
I'm contemplating

52:29.747 --> 52:36.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anything, just bored and just
pondering everything.
I really just don't feel like I
fit in anywhere,

52:36.620 --> 52:38.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like at all.

52:38.655 --> 52:43.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: The reality is, you
definitely need to
be in therapy, because that's
where you're

52:43.761 --> 52:48.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be able to bounce
things off of somebody
and you just got to let other
people help

52:48.465 --> 52:52.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you to get there.

52:52.102 --> 52:58.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Thank you. He's here. The
madness ends.

52:58.275 --> 53:06.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Let's focus up here. You
have war-zone-related
issues. And being hostage to the
war zone

53:06.250 --> 53:11.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not having a life. This is
where you finally
stop running away.

53:11.955 --> 53:13.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Questions? Thoughts?

53:13.891 --> 53:17.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I'm concerned someone is
going to have
their opinion or give me some
kind of (EXPLETIVE

53:17.594 --> 53:23.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DELETED) whether they mean to or
not, primarily
Brooks, because he sometimes
looks evil when

53:23.901 --> 53:27.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's not trying to. You know
what I'm saying?

53:27.404 --> 53:29.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: He's the devil.

53:29.139 --> 53:32.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: You know what I mean? Like,
giving people
like -- think I'm looking at him
like I'm

53:32.443 --> 53:35.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking (EXPLETIVE DELETED)
angry or something.
When I'm talking about my
(EXPLETIVE DELETED)

53:35.212 --> 53:38.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just take one thing to set me
off, and I will
(EXPLETIVE DELETED) lose
(EXPLETIVE DELETED)

53:38.582 --> 53:40.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
my cool. I don't want to
(EXPLETIVE DELETED)
do that.

53:40.651 --> 53:44.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: But that's your stuff. And
that's why
it's good for you to be in a
group.

53:44.922 --> 53:51.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The group's purpose is to bear
witness to
your sharing of yourself. You
might not ever

53:51.462 --> 53:52.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
share this stuff again.

53:52.863 --> 53:58.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: "Of Men and War" airs
