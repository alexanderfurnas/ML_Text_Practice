WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Good evening.

00:05.472 --> 00:06.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm William Brangham.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.308 --> 00:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: The
White House
downplays reports that senior
adviser Jared

00:11.911 --> 00:16.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kushner wanted to create a
secret back channel
to talk with the Russians.

00:16.249 --> 00:21.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, ahead of President Trump's
impending
decision on the Paris climate
accord, a look

00:21.888 --> 00:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at how one nation is putting the
pedal to
the metal in the electric car
industry.

00:25.992 --> 00:28.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We are not going back.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are heading into the future.

00:29.963 --> 00:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in 10 years, we will
see that at
least half of the sale from Opel
is electric,

00:35.902 --> 00:39.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if things are moving in the
direction we are
seeing right now.

00:39.739 --> 00:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And, for
years, experts
charged that China was turning
to executed

00:44.644 --> 00:51.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prisoners to obtain human organs
for transplants
and growing a transplant tourism
business.

00:51.117 --> 00:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have reform efforts stopped the
practice?

00:53.253 --> 00:58.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MATAS, Attorney: They have
obviously
got a lot of people sitting
around waiting

00:58.958 --> 01:00.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be killed for a transplant.

01:00.760 --> 01:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are just picking the
right person
to be killed depending on who
the patient

01:04.664 --> 01:05.999 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

01:06.032 --> 01:12.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:12.939 --> 01:15.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:15.909 --> 01:25.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Americans
spent this Memorial
Day honoring the men and women
who made the

01:25.218 --> 01:26.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ultimate sacrifice.

01:27.020 --> 01:33.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since 1775, more than 1.2
million Americans
have died serving our country.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins reports.

01:35.462 --> 01:43.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: On this
national day of remembrance,
there were large events, like a
new president

01:43.169 --> 01:45.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
laying a wreath to an unknown
soldier.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We honor the noblest among us.

01:47.774 --> 01:52.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At Arlington
National Cemetery,
President Trump expressed what
he called undying

01:52.712 --> 01:54.481 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gratitude.

01:54.514 --> 02:00.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We pay tribute to
those brave
souls who raced in to gunfire,
roared into

02:00.420 --> 02:06.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
battle, and ran into hell to
face down evil.

02:06.426 --> 02:16.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They made their sacrifice not
for fame, or
for money, or even for glory,
but for country.

02:16.603 --> 02:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Afterward, Mr.
Trump stopped
with Homeland Security Secretary
John Kelly

02:21.508 --> 02:26.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the grave of Kelly's son
Robert, who was
killed in Afghanistan.

02:26.880 --> 02:31.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From there, the president met
other families
in Section 60 of the cemetery,
where military

02:31.551 --> 02:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members killed most recently,
especially in
Iraq and Afghanistan, are
buried.

02:34.687 --> 02:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He's looking down.

02:35.688 --> 02:38.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he's very proud of you.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Thank you so much.

02:39.526 --> 02:41.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you for everything you're
doing for
the country.

02:41.394 --> 02:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But, for many,
the holiday
was defined by hometowns and
smaller personal

02:47.200 --> 02:48.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
events.

02:48.601 --> 02:50.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Raleigh, North Carolina, the
day was for
supporting survivors.

02:50.904 --> 02:56.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: And we have a lot of
Vietnam veterans
in our detachment, so a lot of
those guys

02:56.843 --> 03:03.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen firsthand death,
losing friends
in their units, and so it's just
emotional

03:03.883 --> 03:05.518 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for us.

03:05.552 --> 03:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At a military
parade in Illinois,
it was a day to salute veterans.

03:10.089 --> 03:15.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And at the Fort Snelling
National Cemetery
in Minneapolis, Minnesota, as in
many places,

03:15.461 --> 03:19.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it was a day of simple,
important remembrance.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

03:22.802 --> 03:29.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today, more
than 1.3 million
Americans are serving on active
duty.

03:29.909 --> 03:34.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: North
Korea fired
another ballistic missile, the
latest in a

03:34.147 --> 03:37.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
series of tests, defying
international pressure.

03:37.317 --> 03:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The short-range missile landed
in Japanese
territorial waters.

03:40.753 --> 03:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Tokyo, Japan's chief cabinet
secretary
said there were no immediate
reports of damage,

03:45.692 --> 03:47.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but he delivered a sharp rebuke.

03:47.594 --> 03:50.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YOSHIHIDE SUGA, Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary
(through translator): North
Korea continues

03:50.897 --> 03:55.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking provocative actions,
despite the repeated
resolutions at the U.N. Security
Council.

03:55.935 --> 03:58.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hence, it is necessary to apply
pressure.

03:58.271 --> 04:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is not the time for dialogue
for dialogue's
sake.

04:01.774 --> 04:05.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We cannot tolerate these
repeated actions
and we lodge a strong protest
against North

04:05.645 --> 04:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Korea, criticizing them in the
strongest form.

04:08.414 --> 04:12.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Back in this
country, President
Trump also weighed in on the
test-launch,

04:12.385 --> 04:16.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tweeting that "North Korea has
shown great
disrespect for their neighbor
China."

04:17.023 --> 04:21.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House also condemned
the fatal stabbing
of two men aboard a train in
Portland, Oregon,

04:21.961 --> 04:23.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last week.

04:23.863 --> 04:27.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were trying to help two
young Muslim
women who were being harassed by
a white supremacist.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the good samaritans who
died was an
Army veteran.

04:30.937 --> 04:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A third man who also came to
their aid was
badly wounded, but survived.

04:35.608 --> 04:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, the president's
official White
House Twitter account tweeted:
"The violent

04:39.746 --> 04:42.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks in Portland on Friday
are unacceptable.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The victims were standing up to
hate and intolerance.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our prayers are with them."

04:47.353 --> 04:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president tweets regularly
from his personal
account, which has not made
mention of the

04:51.357 --> 04:53.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Portland attack.

04:53.693 --> 04:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rescuers today in Sri Lanka
recovered more
bodies, raising the death toll
from heavy

04:57.897 --> 05:02.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
floods and mudslides to at least
169 people.

05:02.168 --> 05:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crews worked around-the-clock to
identify
bodies and clear debris.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 100 people are still
missing since
last Thursday's downpour.

05:09.909 --> 05:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): My
house and small
shop were totally damaged by the
floods.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All my household items are gone
with the water.

05:18.484 --> 05:23.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nothing is left, even jewelry,
money and all
our earnings gone with the
water.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We managed to survive.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Seventy-five
thousand people
have now fled to relief camps
set up in the

05:29.028 --> 05:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country's south and west, as the
country braces
for yet more rain.

05:34.100 --> 05:38.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This holiday weekend became a
travel nightmare
for British Airways customers.

05:38.271 --> 05:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A power supply problem brought
the airline's
computer systems to a halt,
stranding some

05:43.242 --> 05:44.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
75,000 travelers.

05:44.577 --> 05:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, flights returned to
a near-normal
schedule.

05:48.181 --> 05:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British Airways' chief executive
said his
company is working to determine
what went

05:52.685 --> 05:54.587 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wrong.

05:54.620 --> 05:58.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX CRUZ, CEO, British Airways:
We are profusely,
profusely apologetic about what
has happened.

05:58.858 --> 06:04.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are very conscious of the
hardship that
many of our customers have had
to go through

06:04.731 --> 06:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on their way to their holidays,
sometimes
on the way to personal events.

06:07.567 --> 06:11.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Cruz said
that, by day's
end, around two-thirds of
passengers whose

06:11.371 --> 06:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flights were canceled over the
weekend will
reach their destinations.

06:15.375 --> 06:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a passing of note: We
learned today that
renowned sportswriter and
commentator Frank

06:19.879 --> 06:23.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Deford died yesterday in Key
West, Florida.

06:23.049 --> 06:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His career spanned five decades,
most notably
writing for "Sports Illustrated"
and providing

06:27.720 --> 06:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commentary on NPR's "Morning
Edition," from
which he just retired just this
month after

06:32.558 --> 06:34.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
37 years.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deford's views were always
delivered with
his signature passion and humor.

06:37.830 --> 06:42.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was in many ways the
quintessential American
sports fan, right down to his
disdain for

06:42.935 --> 06:47.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the internationally beloved game
of soccer,
as in this 2006 "NewsHour"
interview.

06:47.540 --> 06:51.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK DEFORD, Sportswriter:
Americans have
proven over and over again that
they don't

06:51.411 --> 06:52.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like the sport.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's not enough scoring.

06:54.213 --> 06:55.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are too many ties.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very frustrating game.

06:58.217 --> 07:03.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is called brilliant in
soccer is an incomplete
pass in football.

07:03.189 --> 07:06.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the sport itself is
overdramatized with
the falling down.

07:06.859 --> 07:13.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's entirely too many -- a
high percentage
of scores are because of
penalties, which

07:13.166 --> 07:14.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are very dubious.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, simply, we have shown over
and over again
that we reject that.

07:17.970 --> 07:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In 2013,
President Obama
awarded Deford the National
Humanities Medal,

07:23.142 --> 07:26.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first sportswriter to ever
receive the
honor.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Frank Deford was 78 years old.

07:28.848 --> 07:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the White
House responds to allegations
surrounding

07:32.618 --> 07:38.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president's son-in-law -- we
look at the
political and national security
implications;

07:38.157 --> 07:43.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Norway spearheads an electric
car revolution,
warning the U.S. could be left
behind; and

07:43.396 --> 07:56.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

07:56.476 --> 08:01.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to the ongoing investigation
into Russian
meddling in last year's
election, and whether

08:01.047 --> 08:06.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump campaign was in any
way involved,
may have taken a step closer to
the president's

08:06.152 --> 08:08.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own family.

08:08.154 --> 08:13.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was another weekend of damage
control for
the Trump White House, this
following allegations

08:13.059 --> 08:17.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against President Trump's
son-in-law and senior
adviser Jared Kushner.

08:17.663 --> 08:22.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, The Washington Post
reported that,
in December, Kushner discussed
with Russian

08:22.134 --> 08:27.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ambassador Sergey Kislyak the
possibility
of opening a secret and secure
communications

08:27.940 --> 08:30.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
channel between the Trump team
and Moscow.

08:30.776 --> 08:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It adds, they considered using
Russian diplomatic
sites in the U.S. in order to
shield their

08:36.549 --> 08:39.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pre-inauguration discussions
from monitoring.

08:39.819 --> 08:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several top administration
officials, while
not confirming the allegations,
have come

08:43.723 --> 08:45.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out defending Kushner.

08:45.458 --> 08:50.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, on ABC's "This Week,"
Secretary
of Homeland Security John Kelly
said that

08:50.162 --> 08:52.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the idea didn't bother him.

08:52.064 --> 08:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary:
It's both normal, in my opinion,
and acceptable.

08:55.334 --> 09:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Any way that you can communicate
with people,
particularly organizations that
are maybe

09:03.142 --> 09:06.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not particularly friendly to us,
is a good
thing.

09:06.546 --> 09:10.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Separately,
National Security
Adviser H.R. McMaster told
reporters he too

09:11.017 --> 09:12.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wasn't concerned.

09:12.652 --> 09:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "We have back-channel
communications
with a number of countries."

09:16.789 --> 09:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on CNN's "State of the
Union," Republican
Senator Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina questioned

09:21.861 --> 09:22.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the allegations altogether.

09:22.862 --> 09:24.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:24.664 --> 09:26.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: I don't
trust this story as far as I can
throw it.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The whole storyline is
suspicious.

09:28.167 --> 09:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have never been more concerned
and suspicious
about all things Russia than I
am right now.

09:32.872 --> 09:37.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For his part,
the president
told The New York Times on
Sunday he has total

09:37.209 --> 09:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
confidence in his son-in-law.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this, however, has done
little to quell
the storm of criticism.

09:43.215 --> 09:47.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former Acting CIA Director John
McLaughlin
told MSNBC he was shocked by the
charges.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, Former Acting
CIA Director:
I can't keep out of my mind the
thought that

09:51.490 --> 09:56.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if an American intelligence
officer had done
anything like this, we'd
consider it espionage.

09:56.762 --> 10:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And back on
ABC's "This
Week," California Democrat Adam
Schiff, the

10:01.434 --> 10:06.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ranking member of the House
Intelligence Committee,
said Kushner's access to
classified material

10:06.505 --> 10:07.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
needs to be reexamined.

10:07.506 --> 10:09.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California: But
I do think
there ought to be a review of
his security

10:11.877 --> 10:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clearance to find out whether he
was truthful,
whether he was candid.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If not then, there's no way he
can maintain
that kind of a clearance.

10:18.117 --> 10:22.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Before these
latest allegations
broke, Kushner's attorneys said
he'd work

10:22.088 --> 10:25.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with the Senate on its
investigation into
Russian election meddling.

10:25.658 --> 10:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, Chairman of the
Foreign Relations
Committee Tennessee Republican
Bob Corker

10:30.062 --> 10:33.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said Kushner will still
cooperate.

10:33.499 --> 10:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With me now to discuss the
Kushner allegations,
and the wider Russia probe, are
two men with

10:37.670 --> 10:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deep knowledge of intelligence
and law enforcement.

10:40.873 --> 10:44.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Frank Montoya Jr. spent 26 years
in the FBI.

10:44.176 --> 10:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He oversaw national security and
counterintelligence
probes.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins us from Salt Lake City.

10:49.615 --> 10:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And John Sipher served 28 years
in the CIA's
clandestine service stationed in
Russia and

10:54.620 --> 10:55.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern Europe.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also ran counterintelligence
investigations
within the agency.

10:59.458 --> 11:02.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now with the consulting
firm CrossLead.

11:02.461 --> 11:03.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

11:03.696 --> 11:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Sipher, I would like to
start with you.

11:06.132 --> 11:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is your reaction to this?

11:08.000 --> 11:11.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You said to me earlier that this
leak, this
particular leak, is different
from other leaks.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
How so?

11:13.105 --> 11:14.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER, Former CIA Officer:
What strikes
me about this which is so
unusual is, this

11:14.907 --> 11:16.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is really putting
hyperpartisanship.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's putting party above
country.

11:18.411 --> 11:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's trusting a hostile foreign
government
more than you trust the duly
elected government

11:23.783 --> 11:25.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is in power at the time.

11:25.584 --> 11:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's also unusual about
this, I think,
is many of these leaks, as
frustrating as

11:29.789 --> 11:34.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they probably are to the
administration, don't
strike to the heart of the
investigation.

11:34.660 --> 11:40.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This one sounds like it may do
so, because
it highlights a sensitive
collection effort,

11:40.633 --> 11:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if, in fact, true, and also it
looks like
it gives some information on
some of the things

11:45.438 --> 11:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have been seeing around the
edges for months
now.

11:48.007 --> 11:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Frank Montoya,
turning to
you, what is your reaction to
all this?

11:51.377 --> 11:57.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, you heard the
administration's defenders,
the national security adviser,
many people

11:57.083 --> 12:00.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arguing this is nothing, nothing
to see here,
please move on.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is your reaction?

12:01.454 --> 12:03.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA JR., Former FBI
Official: John
is spot on.

12:03.189 --> 12:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think some of the other
aspects of this,
we get track two kind of
communications or

12:08.394 --> 12:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diplomacy or however you want to
call these,
whether it's a back-channel
access to a government,

12:14.166 --> 12:19.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that's usually when you are
the government
in power, having that
communication with another

12:19.338 --> 12:21.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

12:21.140 --> 12:25.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What really stands out to me in
this one is
the discussion, if true, as John
noted, about

12:25.678 --> 12:31.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using a foreign nation state's
communications
system, especially like a
foreign nation state

12:31.817 --> 12:33.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like Russia.

12:33.552 --> 12:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just -- I think a term used
this past
weekend about either being
incredibly naive

12:40.126 --> 12:41.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or absolutely crazy.

12:41.927 --> 12:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say stupid is more like
it in terms
of just the thought process that
had to occur

12:47.600 --> 12:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if, in fact, that was the
discussion.

12:49.602 --> 12:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John, you
heard Frank mention
this, the idea that, again, if
these allegations

12:54.306 --> 13:00.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are true, that Kushner asked the
Russians,
can we use your facilities, your
hardware

13:00.479 --> 13:02.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have these communications?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why is that particularly
troubling?

13:04.250 --> 13:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: This is a very
sophisticated
adversary.

13:07.253 --> 13:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The notion that we would go and
work with
them inside their embassy, this
is something

13:11.857 --> 13:14.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that just is beyond the pale for
professionals.

13:14.493 --> 13:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it almost is, if you want to
assume this
is naivete by the Trump campaign
and Mr. Kushner,

13:20.933 --> 13:24.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it really is like lambs going in
to do with
the lions here.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a very dangerous thing.

13:26.772 --> 13:31.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
People who deal with the
Russians in the government
follow a whole series of
procedures and regulations

13:31.043 --> 13:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to avoid concerns of espionage
and subversion
and corruption.

13:35.114 --> 13:36.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it doesn't appear that they
did here.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
that there
is another rational explanation
for this,

13:40.019 --> 13:45.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that, perhaps as some of
Kushner's supporters
have said, they genuinely wanted
to talk to

13:45.090 --> 13:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Russians about Syria and
other matters,
and this was just maybe a poorly
chosen vehicle

13:51.463 --> 13:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for having those conversations?

13:52.832 --> 13:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: It's possible, but
like Frank
said, then very stupid.

13:57.803 --> 13:59.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Perhaps there's naivete here.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Having a back channel is
something that governments
have done in the past, and there
is nothing

14:02.308 --> 14:03.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wrong with it.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But my question would be, why
the secrecy?

14:05.845 --> 14:08.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect had been
talking about
changing the relationship with
Russia for

14:09.014 --> 14:10.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
quite a long time.

14:10.816 --> 14:14.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There would be no need to go to
this effort
to try to hide from your own
government what

14:14.787 --> 14:16.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you're doing.

14:16.555 --> 14:20.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA JR.: Yes, if I
could add to
that, William, this is also
demonstrating

14:20.125 --> 14:24.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a gross distrust or mistrust of
his own intelligence
community.

14:24.163 --> 14:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If that's what he wanted to do,
we could have
facilitated that for him.

14:27.933 --> 14:33.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even as president-elect, moving
into the inauguration
and beyond, when he becomes the
government,

14:33.372 --> 14:35.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is what we do for our
presidents.

14:35.574 --> 14:38.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I know you
talk with a lot
of agents, some of them who
might be in the

14:39.011 --> 14:41.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
midst of this actual
investigation.

14:41.080 --> 14:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do these ongoing leaks mean
to them,
do to them, do to their ability
to do their

14:45.918 --> 14:47.686 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs?

14:47.720 --> 14:50.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA JR.: Yes, from a
day-to-day
perspective, it makes it
incredibly difficult.

14:50.522 --> 14:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who they going to be able to
talk that is
going to want to tell them the
straight story,

14:55.694 --> 15:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if it's -- the fear is, it's
going to show
up on a news channel or on cable
or on the

15:02.334 --> 15:04.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Internet?

15:04.236 --> 15:08.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, yes, it really does make
it difficult
to dig into the matters that
need to be addressed

15:08.674 --> 15:12.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, you know, to put together
the pieces
of the puzzle that will get us
to the end

15:12.578 --> 15:14.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this thing.

15:14.313 --> 15:16.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But couldn't
you also argue
that there is a societal
benefit, that we

15:16.482 --> 15:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- it's useful for people to
know what their
government is up to?

15:20.619 --> 15:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA JR.: Yes, that's
one of the
conundrums right now.

15:23.455 --> 15:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This started out anyway as a
counterintelligence
investigation.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's become public.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are aspects of this, I
think, that are
really important.

15:32.898 --> 15:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at it from a
historical context,
for instance, one of the key
sources in the

15:39.471 --> 15:42.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Watergate issue was an FBI
special agent.

15:42.608 --> 15:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so individuals that have
information,
if there is concern that it may
-- that things

15:47.980 --> 15:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not going the way that they
should be
or they are not going to be able
to make the

15:51.050 --> 15:55.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case, could that be a reason for
these leaks,
at least to get the information
out there

15:55.955 --> 16:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to address initiatives beyond an
operation
or a source or a method, but
actually involves

16:01.427 --> 16:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the security of the republic?

16:02.995 --> 16:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, I can see why people would
think that
way.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: John, did you
want to add
to that?

16:07.433 --> 16:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: Just want to add
one thing.

16:09.268 --> 16:13.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of these leaks, there's
sort of talk
around this that there's a deep
state of people

16:13.539 --> 16:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the law enforcement and
intelligence community
that are trying to undermine the
president.

16:16.642 --> 16:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to make it clear,
from my understanding,
is, I don't think that's the
case.

16:20.612 --> 16:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a lot of leaks here,
but like many
leaks in this town, they tend to
come from

16:24.984 --> 16:29.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House or Congress or
people who
are back-briefed on pieces of
information.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when that comes out, that's
very frustrating.

16:31.390 --> 16:34.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have seen very little that
looks like
it's come out with the kind of
detail that

16:34.960 --> 16:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is coming from the professionals
in the FBI
or the CIA, the information that
is behind

16:39.798 --> 16:41.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this look.

16:41.567 --> 16:45.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, frustrating, yes, but, so
far, I don't
think this stuff is the
professionals are

16:45.404 --> 16:47.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
trying to undermine the
administration in
any way.

16:47.473 --> 16:51.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
John Sipher,
Frank Montoya, thank you both
very much.

16:51.076 --> 16:54.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: Thanks.

16:54.580 --> 17:00.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANK MONTOYA JR.: You bet.

17:00.419 --> 17:02.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

17:02.788 --> 17:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For more on
the allegations
surrounding Jared Kushner, the
White House's

17:08.060 --> 17:12.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
handling of the Russia
investigation, and
a look at the president's first
trip abroad,

17:12.831 --> 17:18.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's time for Politics Monday
with Tamara
Keith of NPR and Amy Walter of
The Cook Political

17:18.570 --> 17:19.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Report.

17:19.571 --> 17:20.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

17:20.572 --> 17:21.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Happy Memorial Day.

17:21.573 --> 17:22.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tam, first to
you.

17:24.476 --> 17:29.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have just been hearing about
these allegations
about Jared Kushner and this
possible back

17:29.081 --> 17:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
channel he wanted to deal with
the Russians.

17:32.584 --> 17:35.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is your sense of how the
White House
is handling this and dealing
with this?

17:35.654 --> 17:39.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, the
president has been
tweeting about fake news over
the weekend.

17:39.458 --> 17:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He sort of came home, and the
Twitter machine
turned right back on.

17:43.462 --> 17:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he wasn't necessarily
explicitly responding
to this, but it certainly seemed
like some

17:48.934 --> 17:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of it may have been inspired by
this, certainly.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's the
assumption.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And there's a lot
of reporting
that I have not personally been
able to confirm,

17:56.842 --> 18:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that the White House is
looking at creating
sort of a war room-type of
thing, where there

18:02.314 --> 18:06.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be -- much like in the
Clinton administration,
where there would be people
walled off to

18:06.351 --> 18:08.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deal with this.

18:08.153 --> 18:11.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
and the war room would be on top
of another

18:11.557 --> 18:15.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential shakeup, which is --
we hear the
story of a potential shakeup in
the White

18:15.060 --> 18:16.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House, it seems, every other
week.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And this week
is no different.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And this week seems
to be no different,
even though...

18:20.265 --> 18:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And thus far, it
hasn't shaken.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Correct.

18:23.135 --> 18:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: But this week
could be the week
that that changes.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

18:26.138 --> 18:30.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, you do a shakeup
because you know
that you have a problem or you
gaps and you're

18:30.242 --> 18:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to fill those gaps.

18:32.211 --> 18:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The challenge here, though, is,
even in building
the war room, what they're
talking about is

18:35.414 --> 18:41.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bringing people in to fill the
gaps who have
the same problems and challenges
as the people

18:41.353 --> 18:44.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are currently there in the
White House.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't have any governing
experience.

18:45.991 --> 18:50.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have loyalty to Donald
Trump, but don't
have the breadth of experience
in dealing

18:50.162 --> 18:54.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Washington that you need to
do to set
up as something as complicated
as a war room.

18:54.333 --> 18:58.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in dealing with Washington,
especially
the legislative process, they
still don't

18:58.103 --> 19:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have people in positions who can
go up and
work with Capitol Hill.

19:02.508 --> 19:07.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most important, you can have a
war room, you
can have a war plan, but if your
general -- in

19:07.846 --> 19:14.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this case, it's Donald Trump --
isn't following
the plan and is tweeting or is
going and giving

19:14.553 --> 19:17.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interviews that contradict the
plan, then
none of this really matters.

19:17.856 --> 19:18.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Makes your job
very tough.

19:18.857 --> 19:20.626 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For those
people who are
not following the scuttlebutt
about this,

19:22.494 --> 19:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if there's a shakeup, they're
talking about,
what, in the communications
department of

19:25.664 --> 19:27.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the White House?

19:27.499 --> 19:31.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, most of the
focus has been
on the communications, which
that seems like

19:31.436 --> 19:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treating the surface-level thing
and there's
something very deep going on
well below the

19:37.009 --> 19:38.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
surface.

19:38.544 --> 19:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House certainly has
had trouble
in the ways it has communicated.

19:42.214 --> 19:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of that is that, you know,
they do have
policy proposals that they're
trying to push

19:47.419 --> 19:51.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, but often they don't
provide the information
backing it up.

19:51.557 --> 19:54.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, let's go with the
president's tax
proposal.

19:54.193 --> 19:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in part, that was because
the president
in an interview said, I'm going
to have a

19:57.729 --> 20:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax proposal and you need to get
it together
in a week.

20:00.966 --> 20:03.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they threw together a tax
proposal
in a week.

20:03.402 --> 20:09.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There wasn't a lot of
communication or anything
about sort of like what this
thing is.

20:09.241 --> 20:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ultimately, it was on one sheet
of paper,
and there was no electronic
version.

20:13.278 --> 20:17.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was just a sheet of paper
that was passed
around, and then we would take
pictures and

20:17.282 --> 20:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
text it to our colleagues.

20:19.318 --> 20:25.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that is not like a fully
built-up plan.

20:25.591 --> 20:27.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not a rollout.

20:27.192 --> 20:30.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they have been not doing a
lot of rollouts.

20:30.829 --> 20:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even now, they're not in
control of their
narrative with a lot of the
stuff because

20:34.900 --> 20:37.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are leaks and there are
stories and
every day there is a story.

20:37.169 --> 20:42.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the things that they do
control, they
have not done it in a way that
past White

20:42.608 --> 20:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Houses have, where they have
been able to
sort of more dominate the
conversation.

20:47.779 --> 20:51.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What does this
do to the
president's larger agenda?

20:51.383 --> 20:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems like if they're not --
they have
got the White House, they have
got the Senate,

20:54.119 --> 20:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have got the Congress.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is their time.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: This is exactly
right.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to be judged -- this
president
is going to be judged on how
well he governs.

21:01.493 --> 21:04.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And his party is going to be
judged on that
more quickly than he is.

21:04.296 --> 21:07.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're up in 2018.

21:07.132 --> 21:12.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The challenge isn't simply that
it is difficult
to get some of these big things
through, right?

21:12.304 --> 21:17.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard enough to get health
care, tax reform,
infrastructure, but when the
president lacks

21:17.609 --> 21:20.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the focus and the discipline to
help make
this happen.

21:20.646 --> 21:25.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So part of the challenge is, if
you're going
to stick -- as I said, you're
going to stick

21:25.183 --> 21:27.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with a war plan, then stick with
the war plan.

21:27.219 --> 21:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you have your plan
going forward,
and then a tweet comes from the
president

21:32.391 --> 21:36.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States that then
takes us off-track
and back into this morass, it
seems every

21:36.595 --> 21:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time the White House seems to be
moving on,
getting to the next topic, the
president,

21:41.466 --> 21:45.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
whether by tweets or by
interviews or saying
something off the cuff, brings
them right

21:45.404 --> 21:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
back to where they started.

21:47.272 --> 21:51.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it were up to the president,
his communication
strategy would simply be for him
to get on

21:51.109 --> 21:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every day in front of -- or
behind the podium,
he would be the only messenger.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He sees himself still as the
best messenger.

21:58.583 --> 22:06.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the chaos candidacy that
worked for him
in 2016, it's the style that
worked for him

22:06.258 --> 22:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the business world, of course
it can translate,
he believes.

22:09.127 --> 22:11.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Of course it is going to
translate into governing.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It doesn't.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It hasn't.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You were with
the president
when he seemed to be doing some
of what Amy

22:16.468 --> 22:17.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is describing.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was on his whole trip
abroad.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do they look back at, the
administration,
as the successes of that trip?

22:23.742 --> 22:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: The remarkable
thing is, throughout
the trip, we were on our way to
Israel -- or

22:29.581 --> 22:34.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were on our way to Rome, and
we were asking
an administration official, how
did it go

22:34.653 --> 22:35.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Israel?

22:35.654 --> 22:36.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you think?

22:36.655 --> 22:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they kept going back to
Saudi Arabia.

22:38.523 --> 22:42.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every -- every time that they
had a chance,
administration officials went
back to Saudi

22:42.327 --> 22:43.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Arabia.

22:43.595 --> 22:45.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They saw that
as the highlight
of the trip?

22:45.230 --> 22:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think they
really did see
that as the highlight of the
trip.

22:47.032 --> 22:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing that stands out to
me about
that is that they announced
nearly $400 billion

22:51.403 --> 22:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in deals, and we still don't
have the details
of what those deals are.

22:57.676 --> 23:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not for lack of trying
to get that
information.

23:00.178 --> 23:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been asking on a regular
basis, you
know, hey, that arms deal,
what's it made

23:07.853 --> 23:09.221 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up of?

23:09.254 --> 23:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where does the other $400
billion come from
-- or $300 billion?

23:11.423 --> 23:13.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it just has not been
forthcoming.

23:13.291 --> 23:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they really do believe that
that beginning
part -- you know, one
administration official

23:18.263 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said that the president brought
the Muslim
world together.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They talk about it in
superlatives.

23:23.802 --> 23:25.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hmm.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.672 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Wow.

23:27.706 --> 23:31.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that we also
saw, the president
went and signed some big deals
in Saudi Arabia.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also went and told the
Europeans, hey,
you guys got to pay out more for
NATO.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On some level,
this is what
his base expects of him.

23:37.783 --> 23:38.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

23:38.950 --> 23:39.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I'm going to
go rattle the
cage.

23:39.985 --> 23:42.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to tell those euro
guys what's what.

23:42.454 --> 23:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, this has to resonate very
strongly with
them.

23:44.823 --> 23:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, this is -- he
campaigned
as an America-first candidate.

23:48.693 --> 23:54.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He campaigned as somebody who
was very skeptical
of these multinational deals.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was supportive of Brexit.

23:56.401 --> 23:59.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was very skeptical of NATO.

23:59.070 --> 24:06.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what we saw of President
Trump in Europe
was what we saw of President
Trump as a candidate.

24:06.278 --> 24:09.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that, we shouldn't be
surprised at all
about.

24:09.781 --> 24:15.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think there were mixed
signals, at the same
time, from administration
officials, saying,

24:15.120 --> 24:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, of course we're still very
supportive
of NATO.

24:17.989 --> 24:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, even though we didn't
explicitly,
the president didn't explicitly
use the term

24:21.993 --> 24:24.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Article 5 in his speech, of
course he supports
that.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I still think there's some
tension there.

24:26.898 --> 24:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's pretty clear that, when
the president
made his statements as a
candidate, he's following

24:32.204 --> 24:33.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
through with those as a
president.

24:33.772 --> 24:38.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Amy
Walter, Tamara
Keith, thank you both very much.

24:38.944 --> 24:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

24:49.387 --> 24:59.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

24:59.831 --> 25:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Stay with us.

25:05.904 --> 25:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
human rights
experts say that, for years,
China took organs

25:10.675 --> 25:16.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from executed prisoners for
transplants -- have
reform efforts stopped the
practice?; and

25:16.114 --> 25:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our summer reads, the new books
you won't
want to put down.

25:21.319 --> 25:24.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: President Trump
announced over
the weekend that he will decide
this week

25:24.956 --> 25:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether the U.S. will remain
part of the Paris
climate accord.

25:28.627 --> 25:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That accord, signed last year by
195 countries,
commits those nations to
significantly reduce

25:34.332 --> 25:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their carbon emissions to combat
climate change.

25:37.335 --> 25:42.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But President Trump has long
argued that environmental
regulations cost American jobs,
and he's vowed

25:42.440 --> 25:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to undo them, and he's also
described climate
change itself as a hoax.

25:47.312 --> 25:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
European leaders last week urged
the president
not walk away from the accord.

25:51.349 --> 25:56.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Scandinavia, which is a world
leader in
green technology, politicians
and environmentalists

25:56.321 --> 26:00.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want the president to follow
their lead, and
increase investment in
environmentally friendly

26:01.026 --> 26:03.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
technologies like electric cars.

26:03.728 --> 26:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports
from Norway, the world's fastest
growing electric

26:08.266 --> 26:10.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
car market.

26:10.101 --> 26:16.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Norway prides
itself on being
one of the world's most pristine
countries.

26:16.575 --> 26:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, amid the stunning scenery,
there are
reminders that its vast wealth
comes from

26:21.646 --> 26:24.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decades of gas and oil
production.

26:24.482 --> 26:29.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Norwegians are turning their
backs on
fossil fuels and embracing
electric cars like

26:29.721 --> 26:31.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nowhere else.

26:31.289 --> 26:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ann Kunish, who moved from
Wisconsin 30 years
ago, is one of the new converts.

26:35.460 --> 26:38.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANN KUNISH, Norway: This car is
a no-brainer.

26:38.096 --> 26:42.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no question about it.

26:42.367 --> 26:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very, very easy to choose
electric cars.

26:45.971 --> 26:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Norwegian government has
made it much
more financially feasible to buy
them.

26:51.276 --> 26:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't have the same fees,
free parking
in municipal spots.

26:56.514 --> 27:02.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More and more charging stations
are being
built, lower yearly fee to use
the roads,

27:02.287 --> 27:04.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no tolls.

27:04.055 --> 27:08.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: New electric
car sales in
Norway have now passed 100,000,
giving it

27:08.226 --> 27:12.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the highest per capita ownership
level in
the world.

27:12.230 --> 27:16.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In comparison, there are over
half-a-million
electric cars in the U.S.

27:16.134 --> 27:21.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To have the same percentage as
Norway, America
would require 6.25 million
electric cars on

27:22.007 --> 27:23.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the road.

27:23.742 --> 27:28.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Oslo's rush hour, as
electric car
drivers hunt a parking spot at
the city's

27:28.680 --> 27:30.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
biggest charging station.

27:30.615 --> 27:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The energy is almost completely
renewable
energy, as 98 percent of the
country's power

27:35.820 --> 27:38.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
comes from hydroelectric plants.

27:39.024 --> 27:44.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Norwegians endure some of the
world's heaviest
taxes, and removing sales
tariffs from electric

27:44.429 --> 27:45.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cars has been irresistible.

27:45.930 --> 27:50.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government aims to end sales
of gasoline
and diesel vehicles by 2025.

27:50.535 --> 27:54.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETTER HAUGNELAND, Industry
Advocate: There
has to be a big difference if
you choose a

27:54.973 --> 27:58.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
zero emission car or a polluting
car when
you buy it on the tax system.

27:58.476 --> 28:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Industry
advocate Petter
Haugneland argues taxes on
fossil fuel vehicles

28:03.782 --> 28:06.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should be increased to speed up
the process.

28:06.284 --> 28:11.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETTER HAUGNELAND: In Norway,
transport sector
is a key element to lower the
emissions.

28:11.690 --> 28:16.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to cut our emissions
very fast if
we're going to do something
about the climate

28:16.327 --> 28:18.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
problem.

28:18.096 --> 28:24.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In March,
President Trump
canceled a fuel economy ruling
put in place

28:24.969 --> 28:32.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Obama administration
requiring automakers
to achieve 54 miles a gallon by
2025, double

28:32.544 --> 28:34.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the present level.

28:34.345 --> 28:38.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Environmentalists claimed higher
standards
would boost sales of hybrid and
electric cars.

28:38.683 --> 28:41.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
The assault on the America auto
industry,

28:41.853 --> 28:43.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
believe me, is over.

28:43.254 --> 28:45.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's over.

28:45.123 --> 28:49.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Norway's
environment minister,
Vidar Helgesen, belongs to a
center-right

28:49.394 --> 28:52.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party that once aligned with the
Republicans.

28:52.430 --> 28:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It now has more in common with
the Democrats.

28:55.333 --> 28:59.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Helgesen didn't criticize
President Trump
directly, but sent a clear
message not to

28:59.671 --> 29:01.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
turn back the clock.

29:01.506 --> 29:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIDAR HELGESEN, Norwegian
Foreign Minister:
Our position is very much that
we very much

29:02.507 --> 29:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need to build competitiveness
for the future.

29:04.743 --> 29:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also need to care about the
jobs that don't
exist today that need to exist
in the future.

29:09.681 --> 29:13.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that the Chinese are
investing massively
in renewable energy.

29:14.018 --> 29:20.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know the Chinese and other
major up coming
economies are investing a lot in
electric

29:20.658 --> 29:22.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vehicles.

29:22.227 --> 29:25.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they're building green
competitiveness
for the future.

29:25.363 --> 29:29.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: And this is
precisely what
the minister is talking about:
an electric

29:29.834 --> 29:35.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
car start-up in southern Sweden
which is reinventing
the steering wheel to be more
like a game

29:35.406 --> 29:37.175 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
console.

29:37.208 --> 29:39.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEWIS HORNE, CEO, UNITI: This is
not how we
will mechanically achieve it in
the car, because

29:39.978 --> 29:42.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is not very nice for the
user.

29:42.347 --> 29:46.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are different ways we will
mechanically
achieve it, which will be
unveiled later this

29:46.551 --> 29:48.253 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

29:48.286 --> 29:50.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The CEO, Lewis
Horne, has
taken on 30 engineers and hopes
to employ

29:50.789 --> 29:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1,000 people once production
begins in early
2019 on a compact car that's
still under wraps.

29:57.495 --> 30:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEWIS HORNE: So, you can see a
little hint
of two models which are the
result of a lot

30:05.336 --> 30:07.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of research and design.

30:07.438 --> 30:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the future, the jobs are just
different.

30:09.874 --> 30:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Historically, when we have had
an industry
that's so damaging to our health
now, that's

30:15.513 --> 30:17.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not a place where you should be
creating more
jobs.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We should be creating more jobs
in the future
of these industries.

30:20.752 --> 30:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: There is no more
beautiful sight
than an American-made car.

30:27.392 --> 30:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The owner of
this '56 Chevy
Bel Air couldn't agree more.

30:33.298 --> 30:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Henning Kjensli works for the
American Car
Club of Norway.

30:36.301 --> 30:40.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But while he's sympathetic to
the need for
job creation, he's also in favor
of going

30:40.538 --> 30:42.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
green.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENNING KJENSLI, American Car
Club of Norway:
Developing and researching new
technology

30:44.142 --> 30:45.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
costs tons of money.

30:45.977 --> 30:50.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right now, the best earnings
in the American
automobile market is in the
full-size pickup

30:50.915 --> 30:52.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and SUV segment.

30:52.617 --> 30:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They should still make those
cars and sell
them and make money off of them,
but they

30:57.121 --> 31:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to sort of reinvest the
profits from
those cars into new and modern
technology.

31:05.096 --> 31:10.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Fuel prices are
the crucial
difference between the U.S. and
Norway.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Norwegians pay about $7 a
gallon.

31:12.637 --> 31:17.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gas is roughly five dollars
cheaper in America,
reducing the financial incentive
to drive

31:17.909 --> 31:19.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
electric.

31:19.377 --> 31:24.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is a partially
American-made electric
car, the $35,000 Ampera-e.

31:24.749 --> 31:28.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a collaboration between
General Motors
and South Korea's L.G.

31:28.119 --> 31:33.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GM's European arm, Opel,
launched the car
in Norway in May.

31:33.825 --> 31:39.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Impressed by its range of more
than 300 miles
on a single charge, so many
Norwegians have

31:39.264 --> 31:43.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been ordering the Ampera-e, that
there's now
a 15-month waiting list.

31:43.268 --> 31:44.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We are not going back.

31:44.869 --> 31:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are heading into the future.

31:47.372 --> 31:54.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in 10 years, we will
see that at
least half of the sale from Opel
is electric,

31:54.078 --> 31:57.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if things are moving in the
direction we are
seeing right now.

31:57.315 --> 32:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Norway may be a
world leader
when it comes to electric cars,
but its environmental

32:01.920 --> 32:03.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
record is far from perfect.

32:04.022 --> 32:06.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its greenhouse gas emissions are
increasing.

32:06.591 --> 32:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of those are coming from
oil and gas
production, which provides
Norway with its

32:10.595 --> 32:12.397 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wealth.

32:12.430 --> 32:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And critics are very unhappy
that Norway is
pushing to expand fossil fuel
production in

32:15.733 --> 32:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Arctic and believe that its
climate change
policies are inconsistent.

32:19.704 --> 32:25.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FREDERIC HAUGE, Bellona
Foundation: It's schizophrenic,
because Norway is a nice little
country of

32:25.209 --> 32:27.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
petroholics.

32:27.111 --> 32:31.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This
top-of-the-range electric
SUV is the pride and joy of
Frederic Hauge,

32:31.049 --> 32:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a veteran eco-warrior who was a
pioneer of
electric cars in Norway.

32:35.486 --> 32:39.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC HAUGE: You can say
maybe that the
electric car is a Trojan horse
towards the

32:39.824 --> 32:41.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Norwegian oil industry.

32:41.626 --> 32:46.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The battery revolution will
bring down the
oil price to $20 to $25 a barrel
before 2030.

32:46.731 --> 32:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the stupid things
Norway is doing
in the Arctic, the oil drilling,
will also

32:51.402 --> 32:53.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be stopped because of economic
reasons.

32:53.237 --> 32:58.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're setting up a
task force
in every federal agency to
identify and remove

32:58.609 --> 33:04.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any regulation that undermines
American auto
production and any other kind of
production.

33:04.515 --> 33:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Such statements
alarm environmentalists
in Denmark 300 miles to the
south.

33:10.521 --> 33:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Denmark generates about 40
percent of its
electricity from wind power and
is on track

33:15.393 --> 33:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to hit its target of 50 percent
by 2020.

33:18.363 --> 33:23.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these and other renewable
energy efforts
need to be increased, according
to Danish

33:23.401 --> 33:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
climate scientist Sebastian
Mernild.

33:25.303 --> 33:28.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN MERNILD, Climate
Scientist: Regarding
this green development, we can
hardly see

33:28.639 --> 33:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any impact so far, because the
amount of CO2
in the atmosphere is increasing
year by year.

33:34.779 --> 33:38.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are for sure helping the
environment, but
not enough.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we need to speed up this
green development.

33:40.418 --> 33:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The European
Union, whose
environment agency is based in
Copenhagen,

33:44.822 --> 33:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is fully committed to the Paris
climate agreement,
which requires signatories to
tighten up emissions

33:50.194 --> 33:52.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by 2020 and beyond.

33:52.263 --> 33:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its dismayed that the president
may leave
the accord.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Climate change specialist Magda
Jozwicka.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAGDA JOZWICKA, Climate Change
Specialist:
It is, of course, very important
that countries

34:00.371 --> 34:08.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the world stick to the
Paris agreement,
because, overall, we need to
work on our long-term

34:08.513 --> 34:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
de-carbonization goals and the
long-term well-being.

34:12.517 --> 34:17.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
Scandinavians doubt that
environmental arguments will
change the president's

34:17.355 --> 34:22.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mind, but they hope the economic
case for
electric cars will have more
success.

34:22.326 --> 34:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Norway.

34:30.001 --> 34:43.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Decades ago,
China began
a practice that human rights
advocates and

34:43.347 --> 34:48.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medical ethicists condemned:
taking organs,
such as kidneys and livers, from
executed

34:48.653 --> 34:52.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prisoners to transplant into
people who needed
them.

34:52.156 --> 34:54.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Chinese government says it's
reformed
the practice.

34:54.926 --> 34:58.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now they say they only recover
organs from
volunteers.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But some say the practice
continues.

35:00.731 --> 35:04.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan and producer
Dan Sagalyn
have the story.

35:05.002 --> 35:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is when a
life is renewed.

35:10.274 --> 35:15.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A transplant surgeon, seen here,
removes a
kidney from a volunteer donor
and inserts

35:15.346 --> 35:17.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it into someone whose kidneys
are failing.

35:17.882 --> 35:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In most cases, patients who need
a new organ
have to wait months or years
before one is

35:22.019 --> 35:23.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
available.

35:23.788 --> 35:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this man, who told us he had
end-stage
kidney disease 11 years ago,
could wait no

35:27.658 --> 35:29.427 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
longer.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I was
on dialysis
already two years, and I was
constantly going

35:31.596 --> 35:32.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
downhill.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We met him in
Vancouver,
Canada.

35:34.732 --> 35:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He asked that we conceal his
identity by hiding
his face and replacing his voice
to protect

35:39.303 --> 35:40.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his privacy.

35:40.705 --> 35:42.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): They
called these
people the living dead.

35:42.573 --> 35:44.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You just haven't died yet, but
you're gone.

35:44.442 --> 35:48.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Because of his
age and rare
blood type, he says he would
have died before

35:48.746 --> 35:51.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reaching the top of the waiting
list for a
new kidney.

35:51.315 --> 35:57.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, urged by family and friends,
he went to
China's capital, Beijing, in
2006.

35:57.455 --> 36:00.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Within one week, he received a
new kidney.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says he paid $10,000 for the
transplant.

36:03.261 --> 36:06.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Canada, it would have been
free, since
the government pays for health
care.

36:06.931 --> 36:12.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the U.S., the average
hospital charge for
a kidney transplant is $150,000.

36:12.937 --> 36:16.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Traveling to another country for
this kind
of surgery is called transplant
tourism.

36:16.807 --> 36:17.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I went
there dead.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I came back alive.

36:19.777 --> 36:23.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On average, 22
people die
every day in the United States
waiting for

36:23.080 --> 36:24.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a transplant.

36:24.882 --> 36:29.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The median wait time for a lung
here is four
months, a heart almost a year,
and a kidney

36:29.887 --> 36:31.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two years.

36:31.756 --> 36:35.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Transplant tourists
understandably have been
drawn to other countries by
promises of little

36:35.960 --> 36:37.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to no wait.

36:37.528 --> 36:41.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just Canada that
generates transplant
tourists to China.

36:41.499 --> 36:46.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other side of the world,
at about the
same time, an Israeli doctor had
a patient

36:46.070 --> 36:47.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who also needed a transplant.

36:47.805 --> 36:49.574 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:49.607 --> 36:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB LAVEE, Israel Society of
Transplantation:
Back in 2005, a patient of mine
came to me

36:51.442 --> 36:56.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one day and told me, doc, I'm
fed up waiting
here in Israel for a suitable
heart donor

36:56.781 --> 37:01.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to become available, and I was
told -- that's
what he told me -- by my
insurance company

37:01.919 --> 37:07.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I should go to China
because they have
scheduled me to undergo heart
transplantation.

37:07.258 --> 37:12.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he specified a specific date
two weeks
ahead of time.

37:12.096 --> 37:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Heart surgeon
Dr. Jacob
Lavee is president of the Israel
Society of

37:16.701 --> 37:18.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Transplantation.

37:18.569 --> 37:21.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While kidney transplants can
involve obtaining
a kidney from a living donor,
that is not

37:21.606 --> 37:22.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the case with a heart
transplant.

37:22.807 --> 37:24.609 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

37:24.642 --> 37:27.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB LAVEE: If a patient was
promised to
undergo a heart transplant on a
specific date,

37:27.912 --> 37:33.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this could only mean that the --
those who
promised that knew ahead of time
when his

37:33.651 --> 37:35.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
potential donor would be dead.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Human rights
investigator
Ethan Gutmann and lawyer David
Matas have

37:38.756 --> 37:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
testified before Congress about
China's transplant
system.

37:42.126 --> 37:45.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MATAS, Attorney: It is
unconscionable
to kill a healthy, innocent
person so that

37:45.796 --> 37:47.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a sick person can live.

37:47.665 --> 37:51.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: They say they
know how organs
in China become available with
no wait time.

37:52.003 --> 37:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MATAS: They have obviously
got a lot
of people sitting around waiting
to be killed

37:57.141 --> 37:58.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for a transplant.

37:58.943 --> 38:02.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are just picking the
right person
to be killed depending on who
the patient

38:02.280 --> 38:04.181 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

38:04.215 --> 38:07.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Matas and
Gutmann say Chinese
doctors have coordinated with
Chinese prison

38:07.451 --> 38:14.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials, and inmate executions
take place
when patients are in need of
organs.

38:14.725 --> 38:18.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medical professionals and human
rights advocates
say this practice violates the
prisoner's

human rights.

38:20.031 --> 38:24.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, this is how one Chinese
doctor justified
the practice.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This video was produced by the
Chinese government.

HE XIAOSHUN, First Affiliated
Hospital (through
translator): To apply the
traditional Chinese

38:29.373 --> 38:31.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way of thinking, the prisoners
committed sins
in their lives.

38:31.575 --> 38:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we let them donate their
organs, well,
in a sense, they are offering
salvation.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can atone for their crime
with that opportunity.

38:37.815 --> 38:43.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At a press
conference in
2005, China's vice minister of
health, Huang

38:43.120 --> 38:46.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jiefu, admitted the government
took organs
from executed prisoners.

38:46.791 --> 38:52.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in 2014, Huang Jiefu, who
is now leading
the reform efforts in China,
declared that,

38:52.797 --> 38:58.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
starting in 2015, China would
stop using organs
from executed prisoners.

38:59.003 --> 39:03.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Matas and Gutmann believe
they have evidence
that this practice still
continues.

39:03.974 --> 39:09.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say inmates on death row
include prisoners
of conscience, such as
practitioners of Falun

39:09.280 --> 39:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gong who become unwilling
sources for organs.

39:13.584 --> 39:18.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Falun Gong is a form of Chinese
meditation
and exercise with a spiritual
underpinning.

39:18.522 --> 39:24.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Since 1999, the Chinese
government has cracked
down on Falun Gong, charging it
with being

39:24.128 --> 39:27.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an unregistered religion and
cult that aims
to subvert the state.

39:27.832 --> 39:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MATAS: We interviewed
Falun Gong who
got out of prison, got out of
China, systematically

39:32.970 --> 39:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blood-tested, organ-examined,
not for their
health -- they were being
tortured -- and

39:37.341 --> 39:43.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only the types of examinations
relevant to
transplantation.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Wang Chunying
and Yin Liping
practice Falun Gong.

39:45.683 --> 39:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both say they were detained a
number of times
between 1999 and 2009.

39:49.086 --> 39:54.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WANG CHUNYING, Former Prisoner
(through translator):
In 2008, I was forced to take a
blood draw.

39:54.992 --> 39:57.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The atmosphere was very tense
and horrific.

39:57.428 --> 40:01.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought this blood draw must
be related
to looking for matching organs.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Chinese
government might
say, we just needed more blood.

40:03.934 --> 40:04.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is all.

40:04.935 --> 40:05.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We didn't take her organs.

40:05.936 --> 40:07.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We didn't do anything to her
body.

40:07.905 --> 40:11.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just took blood to make sure
there wasn't
an infection in the yard.

40:11.242 --> 40:15.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How do you know that the
government wanted
your blood for any other
reasons?

40:15.379 --> 40:17.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WANG CHUNYING (through
translator): Because
the living conditions were
terrible in the

40:17.915 --> 40:19.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reeducation camp.

40:19.316 --> 40:21.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They didn't care about whether
we lived or
died.

40:21.585 --> 40:25.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YIN LIPING, Former Prisoner
(through translator):
Once, I was forced to take a
blood draw.

40:25.289 --> 40:30.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were multiple times of
other tests,
such as MRI, ultrasound and
chest X-ray.

40:30.928 --> 40:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gutmann says
he's interviewed
ethnic minorities from Tibet and
Xinjiang

40:36.133 --> 40:40.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who all tell similar stories
about medical
examinations while in prison.

40:40.237 --> 40:42.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ETHAN GUTMANN, Human Rights
Investigator:
When you start to hear the same
description

40:42.706 --> 40:46.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of an examination in a
completely different
language from a completely
different group,

40:46.377 --> 40:51.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it's the same examination,
this is one
of the big tipoffs that this is
really directed

40:51.649 --> 40:55.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
towards China's enemies, its
political and
religious enemies.

40:55.653 --> 41:00.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Matas and
Gutmann say there's
another possible motive driving
this practice:

41:00.658 --> 41:02.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
profit.

41:02.626 --> 41:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past, some Chinese
hospitals even advertised
the costs of new organs, $98,000
to $130,000

41:09.166 --> 41:13.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for a liver, $130,000 to
$160,000 for a heart.

41:13.871 --> 41:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By reviewing Chinese medical
publications,
hospital Web site data, and
making calls to

41:19.510 --> 41:26.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospitals, Gutmann and Matas
estimate there
could be 60,000 to 100,000
transplants still

41:26.417 --> 41:28.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taking place each year in China.

41:28.752 --> 41:31.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Chinese government rejects
these accusations.

41:31.222 --> 41:37.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2016, it says there were just
over 13,000
transplants performed in the
country.

41:37.094 --> 41:41.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Compare that to the United
States that had
33,000 transplants last year.

41:41.799 --> 41:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an e-mail to the "NewsHour,"
a spokesman
from the Chinese Embassy in
Washington, D.C.,

41:46.270 --> 41:51.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writes: "The Chinese government
firmly abide
by the internationally
recognized ethical

41:51.242 --> 41:56.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
principles about organ
transplantation, and
adhere to the voluntary organ
donation after

41:56.914 --> 41:59.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the death of Chinese citizens."

41:59.083 --> 42:03.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We asked if political prisoners
were singled
out for execution for their
organs.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The embassy didn't respond to
this question.

42:06.323 --> 42:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chinese officials do say, since
2015, they
no longer recover organs from
prisoners.

42:11.395 --> 42:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Huang Jiefu, who is leading
reform efforts,
acknowledged in an interview
with a Chinese

42:16.433 --> 42:19.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
newspaper progress has been
slow.

42:19.403 --> 42:23.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Our use of death row prisoner
organs before
the establishment of a citizen
organ donation

42:23.974 --> 42:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system was an act of desperation
to save the
lives of patients suffering
organ failure.

42:29.413 --> 42:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the citizen donation system
was set up,
we abolished this source of
organs as quickly

42:33.784 --> 42:35.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as possible."

42:35.719 --> 42:39.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In February of this year, at a
Vatican conference
on organ trafficking, Chinese
medical leaders

42:39.924 --> 42:46.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agreed that using organs from
executed prisoners
is a crime and should be
condemned worldwide.

42:46.330 --> 42:50.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of American doctors who
have been
to China say they believe the
country has

42:50.601 --> 42:55.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken major steps to stop the
practice of
taking organs from executed
prisoners.

FRANCIS DELMONICO, World Health
Organization:
The reports that we get from
Canada or the

42:59.043 --> 43:05.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States or from the Middle
East of individuals
undergoing transplantation,
that's markedly

43:05.249 --> 43:07.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reduced, but it has not
completely stopped.

43:07.985 --> 43:11.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Francis
Delmonico is
an adviser to the World Health
Organization

43:11.789 --> 43:18.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and former president of the
Transplantation
Society.

43:18.429 --> 43:23.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's leading the international
effort to help
China establish a new system of
organ donation.

43:23.901 --> 43:29.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When did you first become aware
that China
might be executing people for
their organs?

43:29.106 --> 43:30.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRANCIS DELMONICO: 2005.

43:31.108 --> 43:32.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How?

43:32.109 --> 43:33.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:33.911 --> 43:38.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCIS DELMONICO: I was invited
to the Peking
Union Medical College by Jiefu
Huang, who

43:38.282 --> 43:40.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was, at the time, vice minister
of health.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was a liver transplant
surgeon.

43:42.620 --> 43:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said to me, "Frank, this
is -- we have
got a horrendous problem, and I
need your

43:48.125 --> 43:49.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
help."

43:49.126 --> 43:51.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Individuals in China were being
executed.

43:51.762 --> 43:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those were the -- they
became the source
of organs for many people from
around the

43:56.734 --> 44:02.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world going to China, as many as
11,000 transplants
being performed, and this is in
2006.

44:02.106 --> 44:06.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: While some
doctors like
Huang Jiefu wanted this practice
stopped,

44:06.977 --> 44:11.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
others who were making money
from organ trafficking
didn't, according to Delmonico.

44:11.348 --> 44:16.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To put pressure on China, a
number of medical
associations and journals
launched a boycott,

44:16.920 --> 44:23.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning in 2006, banning
Chinese research
papers that relied on data from
executed prisoners.

44:23.293 --> 44:27.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, Delmonico and
other doctors
helped China build a new and
legitimate system

44:27.464 --> 44:33.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for organ recovery, similar to
the system
in the U.S., requiring consent
and only from

44:33.037 --> 44:35.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
live or deceased donors in
hospitals.

44:35.973 --> 44:40.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Has China stopped harvesting
organs from people
that they have executed, that
they are executing?

44:40.077 --> 44:41.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:41.145 --> 44:43.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANCIS DELMONICO: I don't know
that for certain.

44:43.380 --> 44:45.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I can say to you that it's
markedly reduced.

44:45.983 --> 44:49.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But can I assure you or the rest
of the world
that it's completely stopped?

44:49.286 --> 44:51.021 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I can't.

44:51.055 --> 44:54.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Delmonico says
there's a
new generation of doctors in
China that want

44:54.591 --> 44:59.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and embrace the reforms that are
taking place
in China's transplantation
system.

44:59.630 --> 45:04.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But human rights investigator
Ethan Gutmann
says China is still killing
prisoners and

45:04.401 --> 45:06.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taking their organs.

45:06.203 --> 45:10.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ETHAN GUTMANN: Our report shows
tremendous
continuity over time, even while
they're -- the

45:10.474 --> 45:13.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chinese are making completely
different statements
about this.

45:13.077 --> 45:16.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Leading
experts to call
for inspections of Chinese
hospitals.

45:16.246 --> 45:17.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:18.015 --> 45:23.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB LAVEE: What needs to be
done now is
an international committees of
transplant

45:23.253 --> 45:28.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experts that will be allowed to
visit China
and verify the source of these
organs.

45:28.392 --> 45:32.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In his
desperation, this
man says he didn't think about
where his new

45:32.396 --> 45:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kidney came from, and, looking
back, that
he has no regrets.

45:35.999 --> 45:38.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It's
given me a
new outlook on life.

45:38.035 --> 45:41.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had an opportunity to see my
children graduate
from universities.

45:41.338 --> 45:43.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have a happy life with my

WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Memorial Day,
of course,
is the traditional kickoff to
summer.

45:58.822 --> 46:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for many of us, that means
time to catch
up on our reading.

46:02.526 --> 46:06.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown brings us some
suggestions from
our "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Some of us go for
lighter fare.

46:09.199 --> 46:13.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some catch up on missed
readings, and others
go for rereadings of old
favorites.

46:13.837 --> 46:18.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We get some summer picks from
two prominent
writers who also own bookstores.

46:18.041 --> 46:22.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Louise Erdrich is author of 15
novels, as
well as nonfiction and poetry.

46:22.246 --> 46:24.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Her most recent novel is
"LaRose."

46:24.114 --> 46:28.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prior to that, "The Round House"
was winner
of the National Book Award for
Fiction.

46:28.485 --> 46:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's the owner of Birchbark
Books in Minneapolis.

46:31.655 --> 46:35.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Emma Straub's novels include
"Modern Lovers"
and "The Vacationers."

46:35.759 --> 46:40.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is co-owner with her husband
of the Brooklyn,
New York bookstore Books Are
Magic.

46:40.631 --> 46:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

46:42.399 --> 46:47.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm guessing that you both are
year-round
readers, but let me start with
you, Louise.

46:47.137 --> 46:51.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does summer reading have a
particular resonance
for you, the things you go
after?

46:51.809 --> 46:53.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LOUISE ERDRICH, Author,
"LaRose": It does.

46:53.944 --> 47:01.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm here in Minnesota, so I go
to the lake,
and I bring a load of books, and
I sink into

47:01.718 --> 47:05.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, and read wherever I am
around a lake.

47:05.856 --> 47:06.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's how we do it.

47:06.990 --> 47:07.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's how you do
it in Minnesota,
huh?

47:08.025 --> 47:10.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LOUISE ERDRICH: And that's how
we do it.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's reading on the dock.

47:11.562 --> 47:14.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's reading if you're floating
in the lake.

47:14.464 --> 47:17.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's reading if it rains,
everything.

47:17.100 --> 47:24.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where you read, and you
can read yourself
into a sort of stupor, which you
then solve

47:24.942 --> 47:27.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a lot of grilled meat.

47:27.744 --> 47:29.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:29.279 --> 47:32.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And Emma Straub,
what do you
do in the summer for reading?

47:32.683 --> 47:35.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA STRAUB, Author, "Modern
Lovers": Well,
starting this summer, I'm just
going to go

47:35.919 --> 47:41.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Louise's house by the lake
with a stack
of books and wait for grilled
meat.

47:41.191 --> 47:42.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LOUISE ERDRICH: It will be
great.

47:42.893 --> 47:44.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yes, it's how it happens.

47:44.294 --> 47:45.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMMA STRAUB: It sounds perfect.

47:45.729 --> 47:47.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It sounds perfect.

47:47.564 --> 47:53.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess I have always thought of
summer reading
as like the stack of books I
would bring with

47:53.770 --> 47:58.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me to summer camp, you know,
when you have
no other options.

47:58.842 --> 48:01.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you have to bring as many as
you will think
you will read.

48:01.211 --> 48:05.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when you read all of
those books
in three days, you have your
parents send

48:05.182 --> 48:06.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you another box and another box.

48:06.917 --> 48:10.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Louise,
you're going to
start us off with a crime
thriller, right?

48:10.687 --> 48:11.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is it?

48:11.688 --> 48:13.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LOUISE ERDRICH: I am.

48:13.090 --> 48:20.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, there are 25 of Donna
Leon's crime
mysteries set in Venice.

48:20.397 --> 48:24.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Venice itself becomes a
character in these
books.

48:24.368 --> 48:30.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's "Eternal," and eternal
fragility is really
encapsulated in the books in an
effortless

48:30.540 --> 48:31.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

48:31.541 --> 48:33.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of the tension of
these books.

48:33.377 --> 48:37.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're Commissario Guido
Brunetti mysteries.

48:37.481 --> 48:43.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You become so wrapped up in
these compelling
characters, that I think you
could go through

48:43.053 --> 48:44.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all 25 this summer.

48:44.588 --> 48:46.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think you could, Jeff.

48:46.690 --> 48:48.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Each one is better than the
last.

48:48.792 --> 48:53.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Alright, Emma,
what do you
want to start off with a --
something comparable?

48:53.263 --> 48:55.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EMMA STRAUB: Well, you know,
it's funny.

48:55.265 --> 49:01.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think my picks are sort of
going in the
opposite direction, which is,
rather than

49:01.772 --> 49:07.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
having like an entire body of
something to
dive into, what I have been
leaning toward

49:07.911 --> 49:12.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recently are things that come in
small packages.

49:12.115 --> 49:19.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that is short stories and
essay collections,
in particular two essay
collections, a woman

49:19.056 --> 49:25.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
named Durga Chew-Bose's "Too
Much and Not
the Mood," which looks like a
work of art

49:25.195 --> 49:27.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and is a work of art.

49:27.364 --> 49:35.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are essays about identity,
and family,
and becoming an adult

49:35.339 --> 49:36.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the other?

49:36.773 --> 49:40.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EMMA STRAUB: It's called
"Sunshine State"
by a woman named Sarah Gerard.

49:40.844 --> 49:43.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's an essay collection
about Florida.

49:43.046 --> 49:53.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a deep dive into
identity and weirdness
and location and family.

49:53.190 --> 50:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that, together,
these books just
point toward a really exciting
and fresh new

50:02.766 --> 50:06.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
corner of American essays in
particular.

50:06.203 --> 50:10.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Louise, you
also had some
other choices on the list you
sent us, a little

50:10.240 --> 50:12.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more serious nonfiction and
poetry.

50:12.442 --> 50:14.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LOUISE ERDRICH: I do.

50:14.277 --> 50:22.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think people usually
take poetry
to the beach to read, but this
book has been

50:22.853 --> 50:25.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sold by its cover for quite some
time.

50:25.555 --> 50:29.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And we should
say, its called
"When My Brother Was an Aztec,"
right, by

50:29.326 --> 50:30.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Natalie Diaz.

50:30.327 --> 50:31.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LOUISE ERDRICH: It is.

50:31.595 --> 50:34.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Natalie Diaz is a powerhouse of
a writer.

50:34.865 --> 50:37.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this book is a wild ride.

50:37.701 --> 50:49.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has headlong rushes of
ecstatic, beautiful
language, small details about
life on Mojave

50:49.212 --> 50:50.147 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Reservation.

50:50.180 --> 50:51.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Natalie Diaz is Mojave.

50:51.982 --> 50:58.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is set in Arizona
mainly, but it's
also, of course, set in her
heart and her

50:58.221 --> 50:59.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
head.

50:59.489 --> 51:04.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's a sensibility that
is so dark,
but so funny.

51:04.694 --> 51:08.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's just such a rich,
compelling piece of
literature.

51:08.799 --> 51:14.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, it's just the kind of
book that
you want to live with each poem
for a while.

51:14.337 --> 51:16.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, Emma, you
gave us some
essay collections.

51:16.606 --> 51:20.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How about a fiction, a beach
fiction escape?

51:20.410 --> 51:23.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA STRAUB: There's a new
collection of short
stories that just came out a
couple of weeks

51:23.847 --> 51:27.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ago by a young woman named
Lesley Nneka Arimah.

51:27.651 --> 51:30.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's called " What It Means When
a Man Falls
from the Sky."

51:30.987 --> 51:34.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's about family and
relationships.

51:34.724 --> 51:36.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's got a gorgeous cover.

51:36.193 --> 51:39.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's been sitting there at
the very front
of my bookstore.

51:39.329 --> 51:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I keep walking past and
fondling it, and
picking it up and waiting for
the right time

51:42.999 --> 51:43.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to bring it home.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm really excited to read that
one.

51:45.469 --> 51:47.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you mentioned
there was
a novel.

51:47.637 --> 51:50.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EMMA STRAUB: It's called "Do Not
Become Alarmed."

51:50.307 --> 51:55.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason that it's almost
cruel to recommend
for vacation reading is because
it is a vacation

51:55.846 --> 51:58.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gone extremely, horribly,
horribly wrong.

51:58.215 --> 51:59.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's about...

51:59.216 --> 52:00.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:00.217 --> 52:02.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Enjoy your
vacation right?

52:02.786 --> 52:04.521 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

52:04.554 --> 52:08.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA STRAUB: If you're going on
a cruise,
I do not recommend that you
bring this book.

52:08.625 --> 52:12.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about two families who go
on a cruise
together.

52:12.295 --> 52:18.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they decide to disembark the
boat one
day and go and go and have a
little adventure.

52:18.869 --> 52:27.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the children get
separated from their
parents, and a lot of things go
really, really

52:27.611 --> 52:28.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
badly.

52:28.678 --> 52:32.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's an incredibly gripping
thriller.

52:32.115 --> 52:36.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's one of those books that you
really will
stay up late to read.

52:36.286 --> 52:39.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're just saying, oh, I
will just read
one more chapter, I will just
read one more

52:39.055 --> 52:42.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chapter, which is, it's so
delicious when
you get one of those books.

52:42.826 --> 52:48.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, let me just
ask you both
very briefly for a re-reading,
some old favorite.

52:48.565 --> 52:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Louise, you first.

52:49.933 --> 52:53.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOUISE ERDRICH: I'm thinking
about all of
Lorrie Moore's books.

52:53.270 --> 52:55.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was such a pleasure to read
them the first
time.

52:55.539 --> 52:59.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought, I just want to
reexperience
them the way I did before.

52:59.676 --> 53:02.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I started "Bark" again,
"Birds of America."

53:02.746 --> 53:04.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have "Who Will Run The Frog
Hospital."

53:04.648 --> 53:13.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, she's known for her
extremely sharp
wit, sharp observations, her
tremendous ability

53:13.089 --> 53:20.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to capture the moments between
couples that
where they grate against each
other or where

53:20.430 --> 53:21.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they come together.

53:21.932 --> 53:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are beautiful moments in
the book.

53:24.034 --> 53:25.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, sometimes, they're very
poignant.

53:25.302 --> 53:28.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, Emma Straub,
briefly, your
re-read?

53:28.171 --> 53:33.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA STRAUB: So, my re-read
choice is Jennifer
Egan's "A Visit from the Goon
Squad."

53:33.877 --> 53:38.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I read it, it just -- I
felt kind of
like I had been hit over the
head with a frying

53:38.548 --> 53:40.417 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pan.

53:40.450 --> 53:45.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just -- you know, I thought
stars were twirling
around my head like a cartoon
character.

53:45.789 --> 53:47.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just was gobsmacked.

53:47.958 --> 53:54.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And every time I have dipped my
toe back in,
I am delighted all over again.

53:54.064 --> 53:57.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, now, we're
going to have
