01:30.023 --> 01:34.161
THE CATHOLIC BISHOP THERE SAID

01:34.161 --> 01:40.267
TODAY EVERYONE IS STILL SHAKEN

01:40.267 --> 01:41.535
BY THE ATTACKS, BUT ONE OF HIS

01:41.535 --> 01:43.170
PARISHIONERS IN THIS

01:43.170 --> 01:44.671
OVERWHELMINGLY CHRISTIAN COUNTRY

01:44.671 --> 01:46.206
SAID SHE RELIED ON HER FAITH TO

01:46.206 --> 01:51.578
EASE HER FEARS.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.180
>> EASTER IS SYMBOLIC, IT IS

01:53.180 --> 01:54.381
TIME THAT YOU REMEMBER HOW JESUS

01:54.381 --> 01:55.582
WENT THROUGH AND HOW HE WAS

01:55.582 --> 01:56.817
TEMPTED.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.085
IT IS NOT THAT WE ARE SAFE BUT

01:58.085 --> 01:59.453
WE TRUST IN HIM AND WE BELIEVE

01:59.453 --> 02:01.021
HE IS GOING TO GIVE US

02:01.021 --> 02:02.723

02:10.564 --> 02:11.932
WISH MY FRIENDS WERE HERE.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.667
I WISH THEY COULD SHARE THIS

02:13.667 --> 02:16.236
MOMENT WITH ME.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.771
>> BUT TODAY, OTHER GRIEVING

02:22.442 --> 02:23.543
THE COUNTRY IS IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:23.543 --> 02:25.012
A THREE-DAY MOURNING PERIOD.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.346
KENYAN PRESIDENT HAS VOWED TO

02:26.346 --> 02:27.447
RESPOND TO THE ATTACKS IN THE

SEVEREST WAY POSSIBLE.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.017
TODAY, ONE OF THE SLAIN

02:30.017 --> 02:31.551
ATTACKERS WAS IDENTIFIED AS A

02:31.551 --> 02:35.055
FORMER LAW STUDENT.

02:35.055 --> 02:35.989
HE WAS THE SON OF A GOVERNMENT

02:35.989 --> 02:37.591
OFFICIAL WHO HAD GONE MISSING.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.792
>> Sreenivasan: AT THE VATICAN

02:38.792 --> 02:40.060
TODAY POPE FRANCIS CALLED

02:40.060 --> 02:41.828
ATTENTION TO RECENT ATTACKS BY

02:41.828 --> 02:43.397
ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS AGAINST

02:43.397 --> 02:44.731
CHRISTIANS TO THE OWN IN

02:44.731 --> 02:51.571
KENYAN BUT IRAQ AND SYRIA.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.407
>> WE ASK JESUS, THE VICTOR OVER

02:53.407 --> 02:54.775
DEATH, TO LIGHTEN THE SUFFERINGS

02:54.775 --> 02:56.209
OF OUR MANY BROTHERS AND SISTERS

02:56.209 --> 02:57.811
WHO ARE PERSECUTED FOR HIS NAME,

02:57.811 --> 03:00.847
AND OF ALL THOSE WHO SUFFER

03:00.847 --> 03:02.983
INJUSTICE AS A RESULT OF ONGOING

03:02.983 --> 03:03.850
CONFLICTS AND VIOLENCE - AND

03:03.850 --> 03:09.456
THERE ARE MANY.

03:09.456 --> 03:10.557
>> Sreenivasan: THE DEBATE OVER

03:10.557 --> 03:12.059
THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED NUCLEAR

03:12.059 --> 03:13.427
DEAL BETWEEN THE WORLD'S LEADING

03:13.427 --> 03:14.795
POWERS AND IRAN PLAYED OUT AGAIN

03:14.795 --> 03:15.896
TODAY ON THE SUNDAY TALK SHOWS.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.064
DURING A SERIES OF APPEARANCES

03:17.064 --> 03:18.331
THIS MORNING, ISRAELI PRIME

03:18.331 --> 03:19.599
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU

03:19.599 --> 03:21.134
REITERATED HIS OPPOSITION TO THE

03:21.134 --> 03:22.436
AGREEMENT WITH THE SHIITE MUSLIM

03:22.436 --> 03:24.137
REGIME IN TEHRAN AND WARNED THAT

03:24.137 --> 03:26.306
THE DEAL WILL PROMPT IRAN'S

03:26.306 --> 03:27.707
SUNNI MUSLIM RIVALS IN THE

03:27.707 --> 03:28.809
REGION TO PRODUCE THEIR OWN

03:28.809 --> 03:30.010
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.344
>> I THINK ONE OF THE

03:31.344 --> 03:32.479
UNFORTUNATE, EVEN TRAGIC RESULTS

03:32.479 --> 03:33.814
OF THIS DEAL, IF IT GOES

03:33.814 --> 03:35.248
THROUGH, IS THAT IT WOULD SPARK

03:35.248 --> 03:37.384
AN ARMS RACE AMONG THE SUNNI

03:37.384 --> 03:38.819
STATES, A NUCLEAR ARMS RACE IN

03:38.819 --> 03:40.687
THE MIDDLE EAST, AND THE MIDDLE

03:40.687 --> 03:42.322
EAST CRISS-CROSSED WITH NUCLEAR

03:42.322 --> 03:43.490
TRIP WIRES IS A NIGHTMARE FOR

03:43.490 --> 03:44.591
THE WORLD.

03:44.591 --> 03:45.759
>> Sreenivasan: ON CBS' "FACE

03:45.759 --> 03:47.160
THE NATION," U.S. ENERGY

03:47.160 --> 03:49.329
SECRETARY ERNEST MONIZ, HIMSELF

03:49.329 --> 03:51.131
A NUCLEAR SCIENTIST AND A KEY

03:51.131 --> 03:52.599
NEGOTIATOR WITH THE IRANIANS,

03:52.599 --> 03:54.634
DEFENDED THE AGREEMENT, ARGUING

03:54.634 --> 03:56.403
THAT INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS

03:56.403 --> 03:57.838
WILL HAVE SUCH BROAD ACCESS TO

03:57.838 --> 03:59.506
IRAN'S FACILITIES THAT THERE'S

03:59.506 --> 04:01.041
LITTLE CHANCE THE IRANIANS COULD

04:01.041 --> 04:02.175
CHEAT AND DEVELOP A BOMB

04:02.175 --> 04:04.344
SECRETLY.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.879
>> WHAT THIS MEANS IS THEY WILL

04:05.879 --> 04:07.147
HAVE ACCESS NOT JUST TO THE

04:07.147 --> 04:08.415
DECLARED FACILITIES, BUT ALSO TO

04:08.415 --> 04:10.283
UNDECLARED SITES, EVEN SITES

04:10.283 --> 04:11.885
THAT DON'T HAVE NUCLEAR

04:11.885 --> 04:13.086
MATERIALS.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.823
ONCE WE ESTABLISH THE SUSPICION.

04:16.823 --> 04:18.258
IRAN WILL HAVE A VERY SHORT TIME

04:18.258 --> 04:19.693
TO GRANT ACCESS TO THAT FACILITY

04:19.693 --> 04:21.161
OR WILL BE JUDGED OUT OF

04:21.161 --> 04:23.096
COMPLIANCE.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.297
>> Sreenivasan: ON THE SAME

04:24.297 --> 04:25.565
BROADCAST, REPUBLICAN SENATOR

04:25.565 --> 04:26.933
LINDSEY GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA

04:26.933 --> 04:28.635
ARGUED THAT CONGRESS MUST HAVE

04:28.635 --> 04:29.803
THE FINAL SAY ON WHATEVER DEAL

04:29.803 --> 04:32.139
IS FINALLY HAMMERED OUT.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.807
>> I THINK CONGRESS WILL REQUIRE

04:33.807 --> 04:35.242
ANY DEAL NEGOTIATED WITH THE

04:35.242 --> 04:36.776
IRANIANS TO COME TO THE CONGRESS

04:36.776 --> 04:38.411
FOR OUR REVIEW BEFORE WE LIFT

04:38.411 --> 04:39.446
CONGRESSIONAL SANCTIONS.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.847
I SUPPORT THE IDEA OF GIVING

04:40.847 --> 04:42.382
THEM TIME TO PUT THE DEAL

04:42.382 --> 04:44.251
TOGETHER BUT I INSIST CONGRESS

04:44.251 --> 04:45.519
REVIEW THE DEAL, DEBATE AND VOTE

04:45.519 --> 04:48.188
ON IT BEFORE IT BECOMES FINAL.

04:48.188 --> 04:54.027
>> Sreenivasan: IRAN STOCK

04:54.027 --> 04:56.029
>> Sreenivasan: THE PROSPECT OF

04:56.029 --> 04:58.031
AN END TO INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC

04:58.031 --> 04:59.766
SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN BECAUSE

04:59.766 --> 05:01.101
OF THE NUCLEAR DEAL HAS SENT

05:01.101 --> 05:02.169
STOCK PRICES SOARING THERE.

05:02.169 --> 05:03.103
STOCKS ON THE TEHRAN STOCK

05:03.103 --> 05:04.437
EXCHANGE WERE UP NEARLY 7% THIS

05:04.437 --> 05:05.705
WEEKEND, THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF

05:05.705 --> 05:06.840
TRADING FOLLOWING NEWS OF THE

05:06.840 --> 05:08.241
TENTATIVE AGREEMENT.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.609
THEY ARE NOW AT AN 18-MONTH

05:09.609 --> 05:11.111
HIGH.

05:11.111 --> 05:12.345
ALL THIS FROM THE OFFICIAL

05:12.345 --> 05:14.114
IRANIAN NEWS AGENCY.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.248
IRAN, OF COURSE, IS WORKING

05:15.248 --> 05:16.516
ALONGSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN

05:16.516 --> 05:17.918
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.119
DESPITE BEING OUSTED RECENTLY

05:19.119 --> 05:20.320
FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN'S HOMETOWN

05:20.320 --> 05:21.354
OF TIKRIT, THE EXTREMIST GROUP

05:21.354 --> 05:22.455
MADE IMPORTANT NEW GAINS THIS

05:22.455 --> 05:23.623
WEEKEND IN SYRIA, TAKING CONTROL

05:23.623 --> 05:24.824
OF AN AREA NEAR DAMASCUS.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.359
PART OF WHAT IS DRIVING ISIS'S

05:26.359 --> 05:27.627
SUCCESS IS THE GROWING ROLE OF

05:27.627 --> 05:28.562
FORMER OFFICIALS FROM SADDAM

05:28.562 --> 05:32.566
HUSSEIN'S MILITARY, MEMBERS OF

05:32.566 --> 05:33.900
THE ONCE DOMINANT BAATHIST

05:33.900 --> 05:35.001
PARTY.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.136
THEY ARE NOW PLAYING A KEY ROLE

05:36.136 --> 05:37.971
WITHIN ISIS.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.406
LIZ SLY OF THE WASHINGTON POST

05:39.406 --> 05:40.674
WROTE ABOUT THIS AND JOINS US

05:40.674 --> 05:41.474
NOW VIA SKYPE FROM BEIRUT

05:41.474 --> 05:45.445
LEBANON.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.279
FIRST OF ALL, HOW ARE THEY

05:46.279 --> 05:46.646
INVOLVED?

05:46.646 --> 05:47.814
WHERE ARE THEY INVOLVED?

05:47.814 --> 05:48.848
AND WHAT ROLE DOES THEY PLAY

05:48.848 --> 05:49.282
IS THIS.

05:49.282 --> 05:50.951
>> WELL, THEY'RE INVOLVED IN

05:50.951 --> 05:52.686
EVERY LEVEL OF THE SENIOR

05:52.686 --> 05:53.653
LEADERSHIP, MOST OF THE

05:53.653 --> 05:56.056
SENIOR LEADERSHIP ARE FARMER

05:56.056 --> 05:57.324
BAATHISTS, OFFICERS IN THE

05:57.324 --> 05:59.526
ARMY, SENIOR LEADERS OF

05:59.526 --> 06:01.361
ISIS SERVED IN SADDAM

06:01.361 --> 06:02.662
HUSSEIN ARMY THEY LEFT THEIR

06:02.662 --> 06:04.231
JOBS AFTER THE

06:04.231 --> 06:05.465
DEBA'ATHIFICATION IN 2003.

06:05.465 --> 06:07.934
THEY WENT TO VARIOUS-- WITH

06:07.934 --> 06:09.236
INSURGENCY, MAYBE THEY LEFT

06:09.236 --> 06:10.570
THE INSURGENCY, MAYBE THEY

06:10.570 --> 06:12.239
WENT BACK BUT IN THE PAST

06:12.239 --> 06:13.840
FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN AN

06:13.840 --> 06:14.808
AGGRESSIVE ATTEMPT BY THE

06:14.808 --> 06:16.476
CURRENT LEADER OF ISIS TO

06:16.476 --> 06:17.777
RECRUIT THEM INTO THE LINKS

06:17.777 --> 06:18.511
OF ISIS.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.946
AND REALLY THE ORGANIZATION

06:19.946 --> 06:22.249
IS RUN AND CONTROLLED BY

06:22.249 --> 06:23.283
IRAQIS.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.317
>> Sreenivasan: NOW THERE

06:24.317 --> 06:27.621
WERE TWO BIG ROUNDS OF

06:27.621 --> 06:28.888
DEBA'ATHIFICATION WE TOOK

06:28.888 --> 06:31.992
THEM OUT IN 200 BY THE U.S.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.394
GOVERNMENT AGAIN IN 2011

06:34.394 --> 06:35.262
BY MALIKI, THE PRIME

06:35.262 --> 06:36.062
MINISTER.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.197
SO WHAT DID THAT DO AND HOW

06:37.197 --> 06:38.665
DID THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE

06:38.665 --> 06:40.700
LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN ISIS

06:40.700 --> 06:42.535
BEING SERVED BY THESE FARMER

06:42.535 --> 06:43.270
BAATHISTS.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.206
>> THE DEBA'ATHIFICATION OF

06:46.206 --> 06:46.840
2003 I THINK THE

06:46.840 --> 06:48.508
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT ARE

06:48.508 --> 06:49.509
QUITE KNOWN.

06:49.509 --> 06:52.579
PEM KNOW THAT ABOUT 700,000

06:52.579 --> 06:54.014
IRAQIS HAVE BEEN SERVING IN

06:54.014 --> 06:55.715
THE ARMY, WERE SENT HOME,

06:55.715 --> 06:57.217
THEY WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR

06:57.217 --> 06:58.218
FUTURE EMPLOYMENT.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.552
THEY KEPT THEIR GUNS BUT

06:59.552 --> 07:01.121
THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO JOIN

07:01.121 --> 07:02.422
IN THE MILITARY AGAIN AND

07:02.422 --> 07:05.759
THAT CREATED A READY POOL OF

07:05.759 --> 07:06.826
RECRUITS.

07:06.826 --> 07:07.727
SO ALL THE DIFFERENT INSURGENT

07:07.727 --> 07:08.628
GROUPS.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.830
THE SECOND IN 2011 IS LESS

07:10.830 --> 07:11.298
WELL-KNOWN.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.333
AFTER THE AMERICANS LEFT,

07:13.333 --> 07:15.135
MALIKI STARTED TO FIRE EVEN

07:15.135 --> 07:16.503
SOME OF THE ONES THAT THEY

07:16.503 --> 07:18.371
HAD TRIED TO REHABILITATE

07:18.371 --> 07:19.306
REALIZING THAT IT WASN'T

07:19.306 --> 07:20.507
SUCH A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE

07:20.507 --> 07:21.775
THESE GUYS OUT THERE WITHOUT

07:21.775 --> 07:22.876
JOBS, WITHOUT CONTRIBUTING

07:22.876 --> 07:23.376
TO SOCIETY.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.945
AND IT MEANT REALLY VERY

07:25.945 --> 07:27.314
EASY FOR THOSE GUYS TO JUST

07:27.314 --> 07:29.082
GO AND SIGN UP WITH ISIS

07:29.082 --> 07:30.150
BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY HAD

07:30.150 --> 07:31.785
NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO FIGHT

07:31.785 --> 07:32.719
FOR THEIR FOUGHT BECAUSE

07:32.719 --> 07:34.087
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER

07:34.087 --> 07:35.789
FUTURE.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.623
>> Sreenivasan: LIZ SLY OF

07:36.623 --> 07:37.791
THE WASH CONTINUE POST

07:37.791 --> 07:40.293
JOINING US VIA SKYPE, THANK

07:40.293 --> 07:40.860
YOU VERY MUCH.

07:40.860 --> 07:45.598
>> THANK YOU.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.267
>> Sreenivasan: SIX UKRAINIAN

07:47.267 --> 07:48.768
SOLDIERS WERE KILLED TODAY, THE

07:48.768 --> 07:49.903
LATEST BREAKDOWN IN THE CEASE-

07:49.903 --> 07:51.504
FIRE BETWEEN PRO-RUSSIAN

07:51.504 --> 07:53.006
SEPARATISTS AND UKRAINIAN

07:53.006 --> 07:54.307
GOVERNMENT FORCES.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.475
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SAID FOUR

07:55.475 --> 07:56.910
OF THE SOLDIERS DIED WHEN THEY

07:56.910 --> 07:58.111
WERE FIRED ON BY THE REBELS NEAR

07:58.111 --> 07:59.279
LUGANSK, AN INSURGENT

07:59.279 --> 08:00.880
STRONGHOLD.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.248
THE OTHER TWO DIED NEAR THE

08:02.248 --> 08:03.516
GOVERNMENT-HELD PORT CITY OF

08:03.516 --> 08:04.951
MARIUPOL, WHEN THEIR VEHICLE HIT

08:04.951 --> 08:06.686
AN ANTI-TANK MINE.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.021
INDIANA HAS IMPLEMENTED A NEEDLE

08:08.021 --> 08:09.222
EXCHANGE PROGRAM TO TRY TO CURB

08:09.222 --> 08:10.657
WHAT IS BELIEVED TO BE THE

08:10.657 --> 08:12.325
LARGEST OUTBREAK OF DRUG-RELATED

08:12.325 --> 08:13.360
HIV TRANSMISSION IN THE STATE'S

08:13.360 --> 08:14.561
HISTORY.

08:14.561 --> 08:15.762
GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE APPROVED THE

08:15.762 --> 08:17.030
PLAN FOR SCOTT COUNTY IN THE

08:17.030 --> 08:18.198
SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE BY

08:18.198 --> 08:19.399
SIGNING AN EMERGENCY EXECUTIVE

08:19.399 --> 08:20.100
ORDER.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.368
IT WILL BE IN EFFECT FOR 30

08:21.368 --> 08:24.471
DAYS.

08:24.471 --> 08:25.905
NEARLY 90 CASES OF HIV AMONG

08:25.905 --> 08:27.107
DRUG USERS HAVE BEEN REPORTED

08:27.107 --> 08:28.742
THERE.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.110
LEGISLATION SIGNED INTO LAW BY

08:30.110 --> 08:31.177
GOVERNOR SAM BROWNBACK WILL

08:31.177 --> 08:32.312
ALLOW KANSANS 21 AND OLDER TO

08:32.312 --> 08:33.346
CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS WITHOUT

08:33.346 --> 08:34.614
GETTING TRAINING OR PERMITS

08:34.614 --> 08:35.415
FIRST.

08:35.415 --> 08:36.149
THE BILL GOES INTO EFFECT JULY

08:36.149 --> 08:37.050
FIRST.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.351
SIX OTHER STATES, ARKANSAS,

08:38.351 --> 08:39.452
ALASKA, ARIZONA, MONTANA,

08:39.452 --> 08:40.787
WYOMING AND VERMONT, HAVE

08:40.787 --> 08:41.554
SIMILAR LAWS ON THE BOOKS.

08:41.554 --> 08:42.822
AND JUST DAYS AFTER INDIANA

08:42.822 --> 08:44.357
FOUND ITSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A

08:44.357 --> 08:45.892
NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT POSSIBLE

08:45.892 --> 08:47.093
GAY DISCRIMINATION, HONEY MAID,

08:47.093 --> 08:48.161
WHICH MAKES GRAHAM CRACKERS,

08:48.161 --> 08:49.729
YESTERDAY BROADCAST A TELEVISION

08:49.729 --> 08:50.830
AD FEATURING TWO GAY MEN AS

08:50.830 --> 08:52.599
PARENTS.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.800
THE AD AIRED DURING THE FINAL

08:53.800 --> 08:55.135
FOUR BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT

08:55.135 --> 08:56.403
SEMIFINALS, WHICH WERE PLAYED IN

08:56.403 --> 08:58.338
INDIANA'S CAPITAL CITY OF

08:58.338 --> 09:06.479
INDIANAPOLIS.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.415
WE WANTED TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES

09:08.415 --> 09:09.883
TONIGHT TALKING ABOUT AN ASPECT

09:09.883 --> 09:11.518
OF THE RECENTLY CONCLUDED

09:11.518 --> 09:12.886
NUCLEAR TALKS WITH IRAN THAT YOU

09:12.886 --> 09:14.587
MIGHT HAVE HEARD MUCH LESS

09:14.587 --> 09:15.588
ABOUT.

09:15.588 --> 09:16.790
WE'RE REFERRING TO THE ROLE

09:16.790 --> 09:18.425
OTHER COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE

09:18.425 --> 09:19.459
TALKS FROM WESTERN EUROPE PLAYED

09:19.459 --> 09:20.560
IN THE NEGOTIATIONS, AND ALSO

09:20.560 --> 09:21.694
THE ROLES PLAYED BY RUSSIA AND

09:21.694 --> 09:23.029
CHINA.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.230
AND ANOTHER QUESTION: WHAT WILL

09:24.230 --> 09:25.598
THE TENTATIVE DEAL MEAN FOR ALL

09:25.598 --> 09:27.734
OF THEM?

09:27.734 --> 09:30.170
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED NOW BY

09:30.170 --> 09:30.937
GARY SICK.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.205
HE SERVED THE NATIONAL SECURITY

09:32.205 --> 09:33.106
COUNCIL STAFF UNDER PRESIDENTS

09:33.106 --> 09:34.174
FORD, CARTER AND REAGAN.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.208
HE WAS THE PRINCIPAL WHITE HOUSE

09:35.208 --> 09:36.476
AIDE FOR IRAN DURING THE IRANIAN

09:36.476 --> 09:37.811
REVOLUTION AND THE HOSTAGE

09:37.811 --> 09:39.012
CRISIS AND IS THE AUTHOR OF TWO

09:39.012 --> 09:40.380
BOOKS ON U.S.-IRAN RELATIONS, HE

09:40.380 --> 09:41.714
NOW TEACHES INTERNATIONAL

09:41.714 --> 09:46.719
AFFAIRS AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.388
IT IS STILL CONSTRUCTED AS A

09:48.388 --> 09:49.289
CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE

09:49.289 --> 09:50.723
UNITED STATES AND IRAN.

09:50.723 --> 09:52.759
AND TODAY THE NEW CYCLE IS

09:52.759 --> 09:53.893
PRIMARILY ABOUT FACT SHEETS

09:53.893 --> 09:55.128
AND WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES

09:55.128 --> 09:56.196
BUT THERE WERE OTHER PARTIES AT

09:56.196 --> 09:57.397
THE TABLE.

09:57.397 --> 09:58.631
AND THEY WERE INTEGRAL TO

09:58.631 --> 09:59.499
THIS HAPPENING.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.167
>> IT'S A FUNNY THING

10:01.167 --> 10:03.403
BECAUSE, WELL, THE REASON

10:03.403 --> 10:04.938
THE U.S. IS SO IMPORTANT IS

10:04.938 --> 10:06.840
THE U.S. HAD VETOED DEALS IN

10:06.840 --> 10:08.408
THE PAST.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.510
SO WITHOUT US, IT WAS NEVER

10:10.510 --> 10:11.277
GOING TO HAPPEN.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.046
BUT AT THE SAME TIME UNITED

10:13.046 --> 10:15.014
STATES AS THE SORT OF LEAD

10:15.014 --> 10:16.049
NEGOTIATORS HAD REALLY A

10:16.049 --> 10:16.850
FOUR-PART NEGOTIATION TO GO

10:16.850 --> 10:17.150
ON.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.253
ONE WITH I RAN, ONE WITH THE

10:20.253 --> 10:21.120
-- HEADS OF THE SECURITY

10:21.120 --> 10:23.423
COUNCIL, RUSSIA, CHINA, SO

10:23.423 --> 10:24.090
FORTH.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.024
ONE WITH THE U.S. CONGRESS

10:25.024 --> 10:26.159
AND ANOTHER ONE WITH

10:26.159 --> 10:27.260
COUNTRIES LIKE ISRAEL AND

10:27.260 --> 10:29.028
SAUDI ARABIA WHO ARE

10:29.028 --> 10:29.963
TERRIBLY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE

10:29.963 --> 10:30.563
WHOLE THING.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.432
AND KEEPING ALL OF THAT

10:32.432 --> 10:33.700
BALANCED AT ALL TIMES WAS

10:33.700 --> 10:35.902
REALLY PRETTY ASTONISHING.

10:35.902 --> 10:36.903
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT DO

10:36.903 --> 10:38.104
THE EUROPEAN COUNTRY, THE

10:38.104 --> 10:39.239
U.K. AND GER MANNY GET OUT

10:39.239 --> 10:40.139
OF THIS DEAL?

10:40.139 --> 10:41.941
>> YOU KNOW, AN A FUNNY

10:41.941 --> 10:44.711
THING, THIS IS KIND OF A

10:44.711 --> 10:46.045
REVENGE ON BENJAMIN

10:46.045 --> 10:46.779
NETANYAHU.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.615
HE HAS FOR YEARS BEEN

10:48.615 --> 10:49.415
SCARING EVERYBODY TO DEATH

10:49.415 --> 10:50.917
THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE

10:50.917 --> 10:51.851
ANOTHER WAR IN THE MIDDLE

10:51.851 --> 10:52.585
EAST.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.720
THAT ISRAEL WAS GOING TO

10:53.720 --> 10:55.255
LAUNCH A UNILATERAL ATTACK

10:55.255 --> 10:56.556
AGAINST A RAN AND SO FORTH,

10:56.556 --> 10:58.157
TO THE POINT WHERE ALL OF

10:58.157 --> 10:59.259
THESE COUNTRIES SAID

10:59.259 --> 11:00.860
ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN

11:00.860 --> 11:01.895
HAVING ANOTHER WAR IN THE

11:01.895 --> 11:02.795
MIDDLE EAST.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.297
SO LET'S ACTUALLY COOPERATE

11:04.297 --> 11:06.099
WITH EACH OTHER, PUT

11:06.099 --> 11:07.133
SOMETHING TOGETHER THAT

11:07.133 --> 11:08.468
WORKS, AND I THINK THAT'S

11:08.468 --> 11:09.102
WHERE WE ARE.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.370
AND THE FACT THAT NETANYAHU

11:10.370 --> 11:12.038
IS UNHAPPY WITH THE RESULT

11:12.038 --> 11:13.673
IS KIND OF IRONIC.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.908
BUT IT'S THE REALITY OF

11:14.908 --> 11:16.142
WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAPPEN TO

11:16.142 --> 11:16.643
BE.

11:16.643 --> 11:17.710
>> I DIDN'T MENTION FRANCE

11:17.710 --> 11:18.578
IN THAT QUESTION.

11:18.578 --> 11:19.846
BUT FRANCE SAID AS SOON AS

11:19.846 --> 11:20.813
THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE OVER,

11:20.813 --> 11:22.081
THEY WERE TOWING A HARDER

11:22.081 --> 11:22.482
LINE.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.182
WHAT DO THEY WANT OUT OF IT

11:23.182 --> 11:23.850
SM.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.218
>> WELL, THEY'VE BECOME A

11:25.218 --> 11:27.220
LITTLE MORE IDEA LOGICAL IN

11:27.220 --> 11:28.588
THE PROCESS IT WASN'T SO

11:28.588 --> 11:29.789
MUCH THAT THEY HAVE ANYTHING

11:29.789 --> 11:31.324
SPECIFIC TO GAIN, THAT

11:31.324 --> 11:33.192
FRANCE WOULD GAIN THAT

11:33.192 --> 11:34.060
GERMANY WOULD NOT OR THAT

11:34.060 --> 11:35.061
THE BRITISH WOULD NOT.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.262
I MEAN BASICALLY THE

11:36.262 --> 11:37.163
EUROPEANS WERE IN THIS

11:37.163 --> 11:38.131
TOGETHER.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.934
IT WAS-- IT WAS, YOU KNOW,

11:40.934 --> 11:42.201
CHAIRED BY THE HEAD OF THE

11:42.201 --> 11:44.170
EU FOREIGN MINISTER,

11:44.170 --> 11:44.671
BASICALLY.

11:44.671 --> 11:45.838
AND SO THIS WAS NOT

11:45.838 --> 11:47.106
SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE IN

11:47.106 --> 11:47.974
IT COMPETING WITH EACH

11:47.974 --> 11:48.474
OTHER.

11:48.474 --> 11:49.609
BUT EACH COUNTRY WAS THERE

11:49.609 --> 11:50.944
BECAUSE OF ITS OWN NATIONAL

11:50.944 --> 11:51.544
INTERESTS.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.246
I THINK THE FIRST THING WAS

11:53.246 --> 11:55.448
THAT THEY ALL REALLY WANTED

11:55.448 --> 11:56.549
TO AVOID ANOTHER WAR IN THE

11:56.549 --> 11:57.984
MIDDLE EAST AND THEY SAW

11:57.984 --> 11:59.752
THIS AS THE WAY TO DO IT.

11:59.752 --> 12:00.853
AND THEY WERE PREPARED TO

12:00.853 --> 12:01.955
PAY A CERTAIN PRICE FOR

12:01.955 --> 12:02.388
THAT.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.656
IN FACT, MOST OF THE

12:03.656 --> 12:04.691
COUNTRIES INVOLVED HAVE PAID

12:04.691 --> 12:06.192
A MUCH HIGHER PRICE THAN WE

12:06.192 --> 12:06.793
HAVE.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.094
AND BECAUSE MANY OF THEM

12:08.094 --> 12:09.696
HAVE MUCH GREATER TRADE WITH

12:09.696 --> 12:10.029
IRAN.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.531
THEY HAD MORE TO LOSE.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.632
THEIR COMPANIES HAD TO PULL

12:12.632 --> 12:13.066
OUT.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.701
AND THEY WEREN'T HAPPY ABOUT

12:14.701 --> 12:15.101
IT.

12:15.101 --> 12:15.802
BUT THEY DID IT.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.537
AND SO THEY HAVE ACTUALLY

12:17.537 --> 12:21.074
PAID A PRICE TO GET TO THIS

12:21.074 --> 12:21.541
POINT.

12:21.541 --> 12:22.842
>> SO WHAT ABOUT RUSSIA AND

12:22.842 --> 12:23.276
CHINA?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.044
>> WELL, RUSSIA DOESN'T

12:25.044 --> 12:28.781
REALLY WANT A NUCLEAR ARMED

12:28.781 --> 12:30.416
IRAN ON ITS SOUTHERN BORDER

12:30.416 --> 12:31.284
I THINK BASICALLY WHEN YOU TALK

12:31.284 --> 12:32.018
ABOUT WHAT COULD BE HIT,

12:32.018 --> 12:34.187
ACTUALLY MOSCOW IS A LOT CLOSER

12:34.187 --> 12:38.291
THAN SAY ROME.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.093
SO IT WAS ACTUALLY-- IN

12:40.093 --> 12:40.927
THEIR SELF-INTEREST TO MAKE

12:40.927 --> 12:42.695
SURE THAT IRAN DIDN'T GET A

12:42.695 --> 12:44.263
NUCLEAR WEAPON.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.965
THOUGH I'M NOT SURE THEY

12:45.965 --> 12:47.033
REALLY THOUGHT THAT IRAN WAS

12:47.033 --> 12:48.134
ABOUT TO GET A NUCLEAR

12:48.134 --> 12:48.501
WEAPON.

12:48.501 --> 12:49.836
THEY ALSO WANTED, BOTH

12:49.836 --> 12:50.937
COUNTRIES, I THINK, WANTED

12:50.937 --> 12:52.505
TO KEEP THE UNITED STATES ON

12:52.505 --> 12:52.972
THEIR SIDE.

12:52.972 --> 12:54.507
THEY HAVE DEALS THAT THEY

12:54.507 --> 12:56.042
WANT TO DO ON OTHER ISSUES

12:56.042 --> 12:57.543
INCLUDING THINGS LIKE THE

12:57.543 --> 12:59.012
CRIMEA AND YOU CRANE AND

12:59.012 --> 13:01.581
WITH CHINA, A SERIES OF

13:01.581 --> 13:02.582
ISSUES ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS

13:02.582 --> 13:04.350
AND THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.785
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO WORK

13:05.785 --> 13:07.120
WITH THE AMERICANS.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.422
AND THEY ALSO KNEW THAT IN

13:09.422 --> 13:10.790
THIS CASE YOU HAD TO WORK

13:10.790 --> 13:12.225
WITH THE AMERICANS OR IT

13:12.225 --> 13:13.359
DIDN'T WORK.

13:13.359 --> 13:14.627
BASICALLY THE UNITED STATES

13:14.627 --> 13:15.795
HAD PUT THIS COALITION

13:15.795 --> 13:16.629
TOGETHER.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.764
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

13:17.764 --> 13:19.198
PRESIDENT OBAMA PERSONALLY,

13:19.198 --> 13:20.600
HAD PUT TOGETHER THE

TOGETHER SANCTIONS ON ONE

13:27.774 --> 13:28.274

13:28.274 --> 13:29.909
AND THAT WAS ALL HELD

13:29.909 --> 13:31.611
TOGETHER BY THE OBAMA

13:31.611 --> 13:32.111
ADMINISTRATION.

13:32.111 --> 13:34.747
AND EVERYBODY KNEW THAT TO

13:34.747 --> 13:36.349
UNDO THAT AND TO ACTUALLY

13:36.349 --> 13:37.984
MAKE ANY PROGRESS YOU HAD TO

13:37.984 --> 13:39.752
HAVE THE AMERICANS ON BOARD.

13:39.752 --> 13:40.853
>> GARY SICK OF COLUMBIA

13:40.853 --> 13:41.454
UNIVERSITY, THANK YOU SO

13:41.454 --> 13:41.954
MUCH.

13:41.954 --> 13:50.029

14:06.379 --> 14:07.680
A PIVOTAL CAST MEMBER SINCE THE

14:07.680 --> 14:08.781

BUT WITH THE SERIES COMING TO AN

14:09.949 --> 14:11.417

14:13.653 --> 14:14.987

14:14.987 --> 14:19.358
SHE SAT DOWN RECENTLY WITH THE

14:19.358 --> 14:20.393
NEWSHOUR'S JEFFREY BROWN.

ELISABETH MOSS, IS A CHARACTER

14:27.166 --> 14:29.202
FROM THE 1960'S WHO SOMEHOW

14:29.202 --> 14:30.503
STILL SPEAKS TO OUR OWN TIME.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.638
>> I ALWAYS TRY TO BE HONEST.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.440
>> Brown: SHE'S HUGELY FLAWED,

14:34.440 --> 14:37.610
VERY INSECURE, ALSO VERY SMART.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.278
DEVELOPS A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR.

14:39.278 --> 14:40.346
REALLY GOOD AT HER JOB.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.482
HORRIBLE AT HER PERSONAL LIFE.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.516
>> THAT'S IT?

14:43.516 --> 14:45.384
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.720
>> THAT YOU GIVE A DAMN.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.821
>> SHE'S-- THERE'S A LOT OF US

14:48.821 --> 14:50.456
IN HER, YOU KNOW?

14:50.456 --> 14:51.758
AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE IDENTIFY

14:51.758 --> 14:53.059
WITH THAT.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.026
>> Brown: PEOPLE SEEM TO BE

14:54.026 --> 14:55.528
IDENTIFYING A LOT WITH ELISABETH

14:55.528 --> 14:57.096
MOSS THESE DAYS: THE 32-YEAR-OLD

14:57.096 --> 14:58.631
ACTRESS IS ON A MAJOR CAREER

14:58.631 --> 15:02.568

15:02.568 --> 15:03.536

PRIZE WINNING PLAY, "THE HEIDI

15:13.780 --> 15:15.915

15:15.915 --> 15:17.350
THE PLAY TAKES US THROUGH

15:17.350 --> 15:19.719
VARIOUS EPISODES IN THE LIFE OF

15:19.719 --> 15:21.587
ONE WOMAN, FROM THE 1960S

15:21.587 --> 15:23.289
THROUGH THE '¡80S, AS SHE MAKES

15:23.289 --> 15:24.624
HER WAY THROUGH THE POLITICAL

15:29.996 --> 15:32.799
DEVASTATION OF AIDS, AND MORE.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.066
>> I MEAN, I PRACTICALLY SAID

15:34.066 --> 15:35.935
YES BEFORE I EVEN READ THE PLAY,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.370
WHICH I HADN'T READ.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.404
>> Brown: WELL, I WAS WONDERING,

15:38.404 --> 15:39.405
DID YOU KNOW IT BEFORE?

15:39.405 --> 15:40.439
>> NO, I KNEW OF IT, BUT I

15:40.439 --> 15:41.741
HADN'T READ IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T

15:41.741 --> 15:42.642
GO TO DRAMA SCHOOL OR ANYTHING.

15:42.642 --> 15:43.810
I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE, WHICH IS

15:43.810 --> 15:45.745
WHERE YOU TEND TO READ THAT KIND

15:45.745 --> 15:46.445
OF THING.

15:46.445 --> 15:47.280
>> Brown: YOU DIDN'T GO TO DRAMA

15:47.280 --> 15:48.247
SCHOOL.

15:48.247 --> 15:52.084
YOU DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.085
>> NO.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.086
>> Brown: WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

15:54.086 --> 15:54.754
>> "THE WEST WING"

15:55.555 --> 15:57.557
>> Brown: PLAYING THE

15:57.557 --> 15:59.292
PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER ON "THE

15:59.292 --> 16:00.393

16:00.393 --> 16:01.828
GIG FOR THE THEN-17-YEAR-OLD

16:01.828 --> 16:02.995
ACTRESS, WHO WAS BORN IN LOS

16:02.995 --> 16:04.363
ANGELES.

16:04.363 --> 16:05.431
>> I DON'T MIND BEING WOKEN UP.

16:05.431 --> 16:06.866
>> Brown: MOSS HAS BEEN GROWING

16:06.866 --> 16:08.501
UP ON SCREEN, APPEARING IN FILM

16:08.501 --> 16:10.269
AND TELEVISION SINCE THE AGE OF

16:10.269 --> 16:11.637
EIGHT, EARLY ROLES INCLUDED

16:11.637 --> 16:13.573

16:21.147 --> 16:23.382
FILM, "GIRL, INTERRUPTED."

16:23.382 --> 16:25.651
>> I FEEL VERY MUSICAL TODAY.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.854
>> PETER, YOU NEED A GIRLFRIEND.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.455
>> Brown: IN "HEIDI," MOSS SAYS,

16:29.455 --> 16:32.458
SHE'S LATCHED ONTO ANOTHER

16:32.458 --> 16:33.559
"EVERY-WOMAN."

16:33.559 --> 16:35.027
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ME

16:35.027 --> 16:35.928
IN HER.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.129
I THINK A LOT OF WOMEN CAN SEE

16:37.129 --> 16:41.434
THEMSELVES IN HER.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.802
SHE'S NOT PERFECT.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.103
SHE'S COMPLICATED.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.271
VERY SELF-AWARE, VERY SELF-

16:45.271 --> 16:46.539
DEPRECATING.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.608
AND SAD A LOT OF THE TIME.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.643
>> Brown: "THE HEIDI CHRONICLES"

16:50.643 --> 16:52.345
ORIGINALLY OPENED OFF-BROADWAY

16:52.345 --> 16:54.013
IN 1988 WITH ACTRESS JOAN ALLEN

16:54.013 --> 16:55.982
IN THE TITLE ROLE.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.683
IT QUICKLY MOVED TO BROADWAY

16:57.683 --> 17:00.486
WHERE IT WENT ON TO WIN THE TONY

17:00.486 --> 17:01.787
AWARD FOR BEST PLAY.

17:01.787 --> 17:03.890
IT'S CONTINUED TO BE A POPULAR

17:03.890 --> 17:05.191
PRODUCTION ON REGIONAL AND

17:05.191 --> 17:06.993
COLLEGE STAGES FOR ITS HONEST

17:06.993 --> 17:08.928
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER WOMEN

17:08.928 --> 17:10.363
CAN "HAVE IT ALL" AS THEY

17:10.363 --> 17:12.732
STRUGGLE TO NAVIGATE PERSONAL

17:12.732 --> 17:14.100
RELATIONSHIPS, PROFESSIONAL

17:14.100 --> 17:15.801
ASPIRATIONS, AND MOTHERHOOD.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.336
JULIE SALAMON IS AUTHOR OF "

17:17.336 --> 17:19.205
WENDY AND THE LOST BOYS", A

17:19.205 --> 17:22.008
BIOGRAPHY OF PLAYWRIGHT WENDY

17:22.008 --> 17:24.143
WASSERSTEIN, WHO DIED IN 2006.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.478
>> EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS IN

17:25.478 --> 17:28.014
THAT PLAY WAS SO CLOSE TO WHAT

17:28.014 --> 17:29.548
WAS GOING ON IN WENDY

17:29.548 --> 17:30.950
WASSERSTEIN'S LIFE, WHICH

17:30.950 --> 17:32.551
HAPPENED TO REFLECT WHAT WAS

17:32.551 --> 17:33.753
GOING ON WITH A WHOLE GENERATION

17:33.753 --> 17:35.021
OF WOMEN.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.956
>> SUSIE, DO YOU EVER FEEL THAT

17:36.956 --> 17:38.324
WHAT MAKES YOU A PERSON IS ALSO

17:38.324 --> 17:40.693
WHAT KEEPS YOU FROM BEING A

17:40.693 --> 17:47.600
PERSON?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.101
>> Brown: CAN A WOMAN HAVE IT

17:49.101 --> 17:50.536
ALL, CAREER, FAMILY, CHILDREN,

17:50.536 --> 17:51.871
MARRIAGE, ETC.?

17:51.871 --> 17:52.738
>> RIGHT.

17:52.738 --> 17:53.873
WELL, SOMEBODY ONCE SAID TO ME,"

17:53.873 --> 17:54.974
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HAVE IT ALL,

17:54.974 --> 17:56.409
BUT NOT ALL AT THE SAME TIME."

17:56.409 --> 17:58.177
AND I THINK AT THE TIME WENDY

17:58.177 --> 18:00.212
WAS WRITING THIS, YOU KNOW, THE

18:00.212 --> 18:02.848
WOMEN'S MOVEMENT HAD GONE FROM,

18:02.848 --> 18:04.216
SAY IN THE '¡70S, WHERE WOMEN

18:04.216 --> 18:06.819
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE VERY FOCUSED

18:06.819 --> 18:08.020
ON THEIR CAREERS AND JOBS AND

18:08.020 --> 18:09.288
EQUALITY, AND THEN ALL OF A

18:09.288 --> 18:10.957
SUDDEN IT FLIPPED IN THE MID-

18:10.957 --> 18:12.391
'80s.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.592
IT'S LIKE, 'YES, YOU'RE SUPPOSED

18:13.592 --> 18:15.394
TO DO ALL THAT AND RAISE PERFECT

18:15.394 --> 18:19.365
CHILDREN WHO GO TO THE BEST

18:19.365 --> 18:20.766
SCHOOLS AND ARE FANTASTIC.'

18:20.766 --> 18:22.601
AND I THINK THOSE WERE THE

18:22.601 --> 18:23.803
THINGS THAT WENDY WASSERSTEIN

18:23.803 --> 18:24.637
WAS GRAPPLING WITH.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.839
>> I DON'T BLAME ANY OF US.

18:26.839 --> 18:27.807
WE'RE ALL CONCERNED,

18:27.807 --> 18:32.878
INTELLIGENT, GOOD WOMEN.

18:32.878 --> 18:34.013
>> Brown: ELISABETH MOSS SAYS IT

18:34.013 --> 18:35.281
WAS A BIG SPEECH IN THE SECOND

18:35.281 --> 18:37.049
ACT, WHEN HEIDI HOLLAND HAS BEEN

18:37.049 --> 18:38.751
ASKED TO SPEAK AT HER HIGH

18:38.751 --> 18:40.619
SCHOOL ALMA MATER THAT HELPED

18:40.619 --> 18:41.921
HER FIND HER WAY INTO THE

18:41.921 --> 18:43.322
CHARACTER.

18:43.322 --> 18:45.558
IT'S A SPEECH QUESTIONING

18:45.558 --> 18:46.926
WHETHER OR NOT SHE MADE THE

18:46.926 --> 18:48.361
RIGHT DECISIONS IN HER PERSONAL

18:48.361 --> 18:50.062
AND PROFESSIONAL LIFE.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.999
>> I THOUGHT THE POINT WAS, WE

18:52.999 --> 18:55.167
WERE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.603
>> IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SPEECH.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.373
I THINK THAT THIS FEELING OF--

19:00.373 --> 19:03.776
AND ESPECIALLY OF THIS

19:03.776 --> 19:05.077
GENERATION OF THAT "I THOUGHT WE

19:05.077 --> 19:06.312
WERE HAVING THIS THING TOGETHER.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.447
I THOUGHT WE WERE NOT MAKING

19:08.447 --> 19:09.815
CHOICES TOGETHER.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.250
AND SO I DID THAT.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.719
AND NOW, I'M ALONE."

19:13.719 --> 19:15.021
AND SHE FEELS, AS SHE SAYS, SHE

19:15.021 --> 19:17.023
FEELS STRANDED.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.224
>> Brown: MOSS, FROM A LATER

19:18.224 --> 19:19.458
GENERATION, SAYS THE "HAVE IT

19:19.458 --> 19:20.693
ALL" ISSUE STILL RESONATES FOR

19:20.693 --> 19:21.927
HER.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.129
>> I MEAN, THE THING THAT I FIND

19:23.129 --> 19:24.664
MOST INTERESTING ABOUT THAT

19:24.664 --> 19:25.831
PHRASE IS THAT MEN ARE NEVER

19:25.831 --> 19:27.867
ASKED IT.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.035
AND BECAUSE MEN ARE NEVER

19:29.035 --> 19:30.236
QUESTIONED WHETHER THEY CAN HAVE

19:30.236 --> 19:31.937
IT ALL, THEY JUST CAN.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.072
>> Brown: AND YET YOU DON'T, DO

19:33.072 --> 19:34.273
YOU THINK THINGS HAVE CHANGED

19:34.273 --> 19:35.975
THAT MUCH, OR NOT SO MUCH?

19:35.975 --> 19:36.976
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT BLACK

19:36.976 --> 19:37.810
AND WHITE.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.712
I THINK IT'S VERY GRAY, AS ALL

19:39.712 --> 19:40.780
THINGS ARE.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.615
THERE'S JUST SO MANY MORE WAYS

19:42.615 --> 19:46.052
THAT YOU CAN GO OR NOT GO, WHICH

19:46.052 --> 19:47.319
IS HOW I THINK WE'VE DEFINITELY

19:47.319 --> 19:50.890
IMPROVED.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.991
BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE STILL

19:51.991 --> 19:53.526
THINGS THAT RESONATE.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.727
THERE IS STILL A CLOCK THAT

19:54.727 --> 19:55.995
STARTS TICKING AS A WOMAN, WHEN

19:55.995 --> 19:57.630
YOU GET TO A CERTAIN AGE.

19:57.630 --> 19:58.798
THERE NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO

19:58.798 --> 20:00.132
ABOUT THAT.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.701
THERE IS STILL TREMENDOUS

20:02.701 --> 20:04.236
PROBLEMS WITH EQUAL PAY FOR

20:04.236 --> 20:05.771
WOMEN.

20:05.771 --> 20:07.006
>> Brown: THOSE SAME ISSUES, OF

20:07.006 --> 20:08.374
COURSE, HAVE PLAYED OUT IN MOSS'

20:08.374 --> 20:09.909
CHARACTER, PEGGY OLSON, IN "MAD

20:09.909 --> 20:11.043
MEN."

20:11.043 --> 20:12.812
>> WHAT THE HELL DO I KNOW ABOUT

20:12.812 --> 20:14.413
BEING A MOM?

20:14.413 --> 20:16.048
I JUST TURNED 30, DON.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.317
>> Brown: DO YOU SEE A

20:18.317 --> 20:19.518
CONNECTION BETWEEN PEGGY AND

20:19.518 --> 20:20.419
HEIDI?

20:20.419 --> 20:21.387
>> ABSOLUTELY.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.221
ABSOLUTELY.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.689
BUT I SEE A CONNECTION BETWEEN

20:23.689 --> 20:25.124
BOTH OF THEM, AND ALL WOMEN, AND

20:25.124 --> 20:26.158
MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

20:26.158 --> 20:27.326
I ALWAYS THOUGHT PEGGY WAS THE

20:27.326 --> 20:28.427
EVERY-WOMAN.

20:28.427 --> 20:30.062
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS

20:30.062 --> 20:32.565
THE ONE WHO IS-- YOU COULD

20:32.565 --> 20:33.599
IDENTIFY WITH, YOU KNOW, AS A

20:33.599 --> 20:35.201
WOMAN OF ANY AGE.

20:35.201 --> 20:36.735
AND I THINK THAT HEIDI IS THE

20:36.735 --> 20:40.005
SAME WAY IN THAT SENSE.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.974
THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT PEOPLE

20:41.974 --> 20:43.142
THOUGH.

20:43.142 --> 20:44.844
>> Brown: HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT

20:44.844 --> 20:45.978
ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

20:45.978 --> 20:46.979
TO HER THROUGH TIME?

20:46.979 --> 20:48.214
>> TO PEGGY?

20:48.214 --> 20:49.048
>> Brown: YEAH.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.349
>> YES.

20:50.349 --> 20:52.451
>> Brown: YEAH, AND?

20:52.451 --> 20:54.520
>> IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY

20:54.520 --> 20:57.990
WITHOUT-- SAYING THINGS THAT I

20:57.990 --> 21:00.025
CAN'T SAY ABOUT THE LAST SEASON.

21:00.025 --> 21:01.127
SPECULATING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

21:01.127 --> 21:03.395
TO HER IS LIKE-- WELL, WE KNOW

21:03.395 --> 21:04.663
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE WOMEN,

21:04.663 --> 21:06.165
YOU KNOW?

21:06.165 --> 21:07.366
THEY CONTINUED TO WORK.

21:07.366 --> 21:08.334
AND SOMETIMES THEY GOT MARRIED.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.169
AND SOMETIMES THEY DIDN'T.

21:10.169 --> 21:11.704
SOMETIMES THEY HAD KIDS.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.905
SOMETIMES THEY DIDN'T.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.173
AND-- THEY BECAME THE WOMEN WHO

21:14.173 --> 21:15.207
WERE OUR BOSSES.

21:15.207 --> 21:17.476
THEY BECAME THE WOMEN WHO FORGED

21:17.476 --> 21:20.446
THE PATH FOR ALL THE OTHER

21:20.446 --> 21:23.816
LADIES IN ADVERTISING NOW.

21:23.816 --> 21:28.921
>> SEE, THIS IS WHY I DON'T LIKE

21:28.921 --> 21:30.189
WORKING WITH WOMEN- YOU HAVE NO

21:30.189 --> 21:30.990
SENSE OF HUMOR.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.424
>> YOU'RE FIRED.

21:32.424 --> 21:33.859
>> Brown: AND WHERE DOES

21:33.859 --> 21:35.561
ELISABETH MOSS HOPE TO SEE

21:35.561 --> 21:37.596
HERSELF, POST-PEGGY OLSON?

21:37.596 --> 21:38.864
>> NO, GET YOUR THINGS.

21:38.864 --> 21:40.566
>> I WOULD LIKE TO JUST BE ABLE

21:40.566 --> 21:41.934
TO KEEP WORKING AND KEEP WORKING

21:41.934 --> 21:44.036
WITH PEOPLE THAT I ADMIRE.

21:44.036 --> 21:45.070
I LOVE FILM, TELEVISION AND

21:45.070 --> 21:46.071
THEATER.

21:46.071 --> 21:46.872
SO I WOULD LOVE TO DO ALL THREE.

21:46.872 --> 21:47.907
IF I COULD JUST KEEP DOING THAT,

21:47.907 --> 21:49.308
THAT WOULD BE A PRETTY GOOD

21:49.308 --> 21:54.680
LIFE.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.881
>> Sreenivasan: THE FINAL SEVEN

21:55.881 --> 21:57.383
EPISODES OF MAD MEN WILL BEGIN

22:09.695 --> 22:10.963

22:10.963 --> 22:19.972
VISIT AT facebook.com/newshour.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.373
>> Sreenivasan: WHEN RIO DE

22:21.373 --> 22:22.641
JANEIRO WAS AWARDED NEXT

22:22.641 --> 22:24.343
SUMMER'S OLYMPIC GAMES BACK IN

22:24.343 --> 22:25.978
2009, THE ORGANIZERS OF THE

22:25.978 --> 22:27.947
GAMES MADE A PROMISE, TO CLEAN

22:27.947 --> 22:29.782
UP THE TRASH AND SEWAGE IN THE

22:29.782 --> 22:31.417
NOTORIOUSLY POLLUTED GUANABARA

22:31.417 --> 22:33.085
BAY, WHERE SAILING AND WIND-

22:33.085 --> 22:34.420
SURFING EVENTS WILL TAKE PLACE.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.688
BUT WITH THE GAMES FAST

22:35.688 --> 22:37.089
APPROACHING, RIO'S MAYOR

22:37.089 --> 22:38.824
ACKNOWLEDGED RECENTLY THAT THE

22:38.824 --> 22:40.092
PROMISED 80% CLEANUP WOULD NOT

22:40.092 --> 22:42.228
BE COMPLETED IN TIME.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.629
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS, RIO HAS

22:43.629 --> 22:44.930
SPENT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE

22:44.930 --> 22:46.632
CLEANUP.

22:46.632 --> 22:48.234
DESPITE THAT, SAILORS WHO

22:48.234 --> 22:49.735
PARTICIPATED IN TEST EVENTS LAST

22:49.735 --> 22:51.604
SUMMER SAID THEY CAME UPON A

22:51.604 --> 22:53.172
FLOATING SOFA AND A DEAD DOG IN

22:53.172 --> 22:54.406
THE WATER.

22:54.406 --> 22:55.941
AND EARLIER THIS YEAR,

22:55.941 --> 22:57.343
INSPECTORS FOUND THOUSANDS OF

22:57.343 --> 22:59.178
DEAD FISH WASHED UP ON ITS

22:59.178 --> 23:00.946
SHORES OF THE BAY, ABOUT SEVEN

23:00.946 --> 23:02.648
MILES FROM WHERE THE SAILING

23:02.648 --> 23:03.716
COMPETITIONS WILL TAKE PLACE.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.618
RIO OFFICIALS ARE INSISTING THAT

23:05.618 --> 23:06.819
THE OLYMPIC EVENT ROUTE, WHICH

23:06.819 --> 23:08.354
WILL TAKE PLACE IN A LESS

23:08.354 --> 23:09.855
POLLUTED AREA OF THE BAY, WILL

23:09.855 --> 23:11.190
BE SAFE.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.758
THE GOAL NOW IS TO HAVE THE

23:12.758 --> 23:14.260
SAILING LANES CLEANED BY AUGUST

23:14.260 --> 23:16.195
FOR THE NEXT TEST EVENT.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.663
AN ART EXHIBITION CALLED ACHADOS

23:17.663 --> 23:26.672
DA GUANABARA WHICH TRANSLATES TO

23:26.672 --> 23:28.774
"FOUND IN GUANABARA" IS TRYING

23:28.774 --> 23:31.243
TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE

23:31.243 --> 23:33.212
PROBLEM, BY PUTTING TRASH FROM

23:33.212 --> 23:34.179
THE BAY ON DISPLAY IN A SHOPPING

23:34.179 --> 23:35.281
MALL.

23:35.281 --> 23:36.515
THE OBJECTS IN THE EXHIBITION

23:36.515 --> 23:37.950
HAVE SYMBOLIC "PRICE TAGS" TO

23:37.950 --> 23:38.717
REPRESENT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COST

23:38.717 --> 23:41.720
OF THE WASTE.

23:41.720 --> 23:42.955
>> (translated): THERE IS A

23:42.955 --> 23:44.323
BIG PROBLEM IN TERMS OF

23:44.323 --> 23:45.624
EDUCATING THE POPULATION THAT

23:45.624 --> 23:47.393
WATER IS NOT RUBBISH.

23:47.393 --> 23:48.560
>> Sreenivasan: IT MAY TAKE SOME

23:48.560 --> 23:49.662
CONVINCING, IT IS ESTIMATED THAT

23:49.662 --> 23:50.896
70% OF UNTREATED SEWAGE FROM

23:50.896 --> 23:51.897
RIO, INCLUDING ITS SURROUNDING

23:51.897 --> 23:53.232
MUNICIPALITIES, FLOWS INTO THE

23:53.232 --> 23:54.500
GUANABARA BAY.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.534
THIS PAST DECEMBER, SPECIALISTS

23:55.534 --> 23:56.835
FROM A RIO HEALTH RESEARCH

23:56.835 --> 23:58.070
INSTITUTE ANNOUNCED THEY FOUND A

23:58.070 --> 23:59.204
DRUG-RESISTANT "SUPER BACTERIA"

23:59.204 --> 24:00.706
IN THE WATERS WHERE THE OLYMPIC

24:00.706 --> 24:02.041
SAILING EVENTS WILL BE HELD.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.409
DESPITE THAT, CARLOS NUZMAN,

24:27.666 --> 24:29.268
MISSION TO YEMEN TOMORROW.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.436
