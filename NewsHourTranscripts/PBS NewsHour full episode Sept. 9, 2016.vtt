JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.305 --> 00:07.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.174 --> 00:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: North
Korea conducts
its biggest nuclear test yet,
creating what

00:12.212 --> 00:19.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
registered as a 5.3-magnitude
earthquake and
sparking swift condemnation from
leaders around

00:19.586 --> 00:21.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

00:21.521 --> 00:28.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Fifteen years after 9/11,
the U.S. struggles
to hand over security to
Afghanistan's military

00:28.395 --> 00:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
force, as the Taliban makes a
resurgence.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.399 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

00:32.432 --> 00:34.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN NICHOLSON, U.S. Commander
in Afghanistan:
We're trying to build an
airplane while in

00:34.701 --> 00:36.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flight, OK?

00:36.036 --> 00:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they're fighting a war while
we're trying
to build an army.

00:38.005 --> 00:38.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is very hard.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:41.141 --> 00:44.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze the
week's news.

00:44.811 --> 00:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.919 --> 00:54.755 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:54.788 --> 01:04.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: North Korea is at
the epicenter
of world attention tonight.

01:04.398 --> 01:10.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It blasted its way there today
with a nuclear
explosion that touched off
shockwaves, both

01:10.037 --> 01:11.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seismic and political.

01:11.972 --> 01:16.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The test drew global criticism,
and raised
fresh questions about what if
anything can

01:17.010 --> 01:18.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be done.

01:18.145 --> 01:20.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have the full story
after the news
summary.

01:20.914 --> 01:26.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. presidential campaign
also echoed
today with talk of the North
Korean blast

01:26.553 --> 01:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with two months to go until
Election Day.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has the story.

01:32.125 --> 01:37.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The North Korea
news forced
both American candidates to
respond, Hillary

01:37.931 --> 01:40.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton after meeting with a
national security
panel in New York.

01:40.834 --> 01:44.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We are not going to let North
Korea pursue

01:44.338 --> 01:49.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a nuclear weapon with the
ballistic missile
capacity to deliver it to the
United States

01:49.776 --> 01:50.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
territory.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is absolutely a bottom
line.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Donald Trump
argued it's
another of what he says were
Clinton's catastrophic's

01:57.818 --> 01:58.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
failures.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He spoke at the Values Voter
Summit in Washington.

02:00.687 --> 02:05.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Just today, it was announced
that North Korea

02:05.492 --> 02:11.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
performed its fifth nuclear
test, its fourth
since Hillary Clinton became
secretary of

02:11.631 --> 02:13.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

02:13.066 --> 02:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just one more massive
failure from a
failed secretary of state.

02:19.306 --> 02:24.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Republican
hit on a different
foreign policy issue last night,
when he spoke

02:24.411 --> 02:28.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Larry king on R.T., a news
channel run
by the Russian government.

02:28.615 --> 02:32.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LARRY KING, R.T.: U.S.
intelligence and law
enforcement agencies reportedly
are investigating

02:32.552 --> 02:36.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether Russia launched a covert
operation
to disrupt the 2016 election.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you make of that?

02:38.725 --> 02:41.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think it's
probably unlikely.

02:41.962 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think maybe -- maybe the
Democrats are putting
that out.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who knows?

02:48.235 --> 02:51.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump's
campaign said later
he didn't mean to go on Russian
state TV.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Manager:
He actually did an interview
with Larry King,

02:53.573 --> 02:57.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he said he was doing it for
his podcast;
he didn't know it would be on
Russia TV.

02:57.077 --> 03:02.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile,
Clinton in Kansas
City last night signaled a shift
in tone away

03:02.182 --> 03:07.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Trump attacks, and toward
her personal
side, addressing the National
Baptist Convention.

03:07.054 --> 03:15.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I still
remember my
late father, a gruff former Navy
man on his

03:15.295 --> 03:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knees praying by his bed every
night.

03:19.866 --> 03:27.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That made a big impression on me
as a young
girl, seeing him humble himself
before God.

03:27.908 --> 03:33.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: This
going-positive push
is multimedia, including this
new TV ad stressing

03:33.580 --> 03:34.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her message.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We have
got to bring
people together.

03:36.316 --> 03:40.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Candidates and
voters will
take a break this weekend.

03:40.053 --> 03:46.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both Trump and Clinton have
agreed to suspend
campaigning Sunday to mark the
15th anniversary

03:46.093 --> 03:47.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of September 11.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

03:50.097 --> 03:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, early
voting began
in North Carolina, the first of
37 states

03:56.203 --> 03:58.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that allow the practice.

03:58.138 --> 04:04.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge today refused to
stop construction
of a hotly contested oil
pipeline near a North

04:04.978 --> 04:07.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dakota Indian reservation.

04:07.114 --> 04:11.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But right after that, three
federal agencies
asked that the pipeline builder
pause the

04:12.018 --> 04:14.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work voluntarily.

04:14.054 --> 04:19.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Standing Rock Sioux say that
the project
harms water supplies and
disturbs ancient

04:19.926 --> 04:21.094 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sites.

04:21.128 --> 04:24.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And thousands of protesters are
supporting
their cause.

04:24.197 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street took a beating today
on fears
of higher interest rates and
lower oil prices.

04:30.070 --> 04:36.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 394
points to close at 18085.

04:36.743 --> 04:42.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 133 points and
the S&amp;P 500
slid 53.

04:42.349 --> 04:49.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. House of
Representatives has given
final approval to letting
families of 9/11

04:49.789 --> 04:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
victims sue Saudi Arabia.

04:52.092 --> 04:58.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers that
day were
Saudis, but Riyadh strongly
objects to the

04:58.865 --> 05:01.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill, and the White House warns
of a veto.

05:01.568 --> 05:05.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, Republican Congressman
Peter King of
New York and others say they're
undeterred.

05:05.972 --> 05:07.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER KING (R), New York: This
is the most
basic constitutional right.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is an obligation.

05:11.878 --> 05:14.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an obligation we in the
Congress have
to not allow foreign lobbyists
or foreign

05:14.948 --> 05:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
countries or anyone else to
intimidate us.

05:17.517 --> 05:18.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Justice must be done.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want to make sure that
there are no
more 9/11s.

05:21.922 --> 05:26.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is one more step we can
take to show
foreign governments they cannot
step aside,

05:26.593 --> 05:30.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they cannot walk away if
something is carried
out where they're sort of
looking the other

05:30.230 --> 05:32.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way making believe it's not
happening.

05:32.098 --> 05:36.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The vote came
after House members
from both parties marked 9/11 on
the steps

05:36.670 --> 05:38.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the Capitol.

05:38.505 --> 05:43.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They paused for a moment of
silence and then
sang "God Bless America" in the
same location

05:43.710 --> 05:49.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they gathered shortly
after the attacks
15 years ago Sunday.

05:49.783 --> 05:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New warnings today on Samsung's
Galaxy Note
7 phone because the batteries
can explode

05:56.556 --> 05:58.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and spark fires.

05:58.325 --> 06:03.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the Consumer Production --
Protection
Safety Commission is telling
people to stop

06:03.363 --> 06:05.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
using the phones and turn them
off.

06:06.032 --> 06:11.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the Federal Aviation
Administration warns
against bringing them on
airplanes.

06:11.771 --> 06:15.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Samsung has issued a global
recall.

06:15.141 --> 06:22.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a NASA probe is off on a
seven-year first-of-its-kind
mission to gather samples from
an asteroid,

06:22.582 --> 06:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and return them to Earth.

06:24.150 --> 06:28.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A rocket launched the probe from
Cape Canaveral,
Florida, on Thursday evening.

06:28.521 --> 06:33.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An hour later, the OSIRIS-REx
spacecraft shot
out of orbit.

06:33.326 --> 06:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's heading for the asteroid
Bennu to bring
back about two ounces of dust.

06:39.399 --> 06:44.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
reevaluating
the global approach to North
Korea after its

06:44.771 --> 06:54.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
latest nuclear test; Mark
Shields and David
Brooks analyze the week's news;
and much more.

06:54.814 --> 07:01.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
latest nuclear test; Mark
Shields and David
Brooks analyze the week's news;
and much more.

07:01.154 --> 07:06.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return to our top story:
North Korea's
latest nuclear test and its
reverberations

07:06.626 --> 07:08.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the globe.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret
Warner, begins our coverage.

07:12.032 --> 07:18.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: North Korea
touted its latest
nuclear test as a major
breakthrough in deliverability.

07:18.538 --> 07:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): The
nuclear test
finally examined and confirmed
the structure

07:23.977 --> 07:29.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and specific features of
movement of a nuclear
warhead standardized to be able
to be mounted

07:29.049 --> 07:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on strategic ballistic rockets.

07:31.985 --> 07:36.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This will enable the nation to
produce at
will and as many as it wants.

07:36.256 --> 07:39.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That claim has
yet to be
substantiated.

07:39.592 --> 07:44.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But today's test was the North's
most powerful
yet.

07:44.664 --> 07:49.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
International observers reported
the underground
blast had a seismic magnitude
larger than

07:49.469 --> 07:52.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any of the four previous tests.

07:52.072 --> 07:57.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Korean officials estimate
the blast
had a yield of 10 kilotons, a
sharp increase

07:57.510 --> 08:02.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the six-kiloton test in
January.

08:02.382 --> 08:07.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just as ominous, North Korea has
demonstrated
growing success with ballistic
missiles.

08:07.454 --> 08:11.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Monday, it fired off three
medium-range
rockets.

08:11.825 --> 08:17.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All flew more than 600 miles
before splashing
down in Japanese waters.

08:17.464 --> 08:22.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last month, Pyongyang also
successfully launched
a submarine-based missile.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today's nuclear test drew swift
condemnation.

08:25.805 --> 08:31.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Seoul, South Korea's
president charged
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un
has gone mad.

08:31.077 --> 08:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PARK GEUN-HYE, South Korea
President (through
translator): North Korea's
nuclear test can

08:34.748 --> 08:37.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only be seen as a challenge to
the international
community.

08:37.917 --> 08:41.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we and the international
community have
reached the limit of our
patience.

08:41.221 --> 08:44.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the mental condition of
Kim Jong-un
is out of control.

08:44.391 --> 08:48.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: China, North
Korea's closest
ally, warned against further
provocations.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUA CHUNYING, Spokeswoman,
Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (through
translator): Any

08:51.030 --> 08:55.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unilateral action that is in the
interest
of its own will not yield
anything.

08:55.635 --> 08:58.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It could only intensify the
situation and
complicate the issue.

08:59.005 --> 09:03.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And President
Obama, who
returned from Asia early today,
said in a

09:03.676 --> 09:08.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statement the U.S. will never
accept North
Korea as a nuclear state.

09:08.448 --> 09:12.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But top Republicans aimed their
criticism
at the White House.

09:12.285 --> 09:17.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A statement from House Speaker
Paul Ryan dismissed
the president's initiatives,
saying: "This

09:17.857 --> 09:23.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
destabilizing activity is also a
consequence
of the administration's failed
policy of strategic

09:23.930 --> 09:27.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
patience and its hollow pivot to
Asia."

09:27.867 --> 09:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's test marks the latest
setback in a
campaign to contain North
Korea's nuclear

09:32.372 --> 09:36.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ambitions, going back decades
and several
presidents.

09:36.476 --> 09:41.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea did agree to halt
its nuclear
weapons program back in 1994.

09:41.281 --> 09:47.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the years since then have
seen an endless
cycle of on-off negotiations,
threats, sanctions

09:47.687 --> 09:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and ever more advanced tests by
the North.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A State Department spokeswoman
was asked what
happens next.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH TRUDEAU, State
Department Spokesperson:
We won't stop our efforts in
working with

09:56.429 --> 10:05.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our international partners to
increase pressure
on this very opaque regime in
reaction to

10:05.638 --> 10:07.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
provocative acts like this.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In New York,
the United Nations
Security Council met yet again
in emergency

10:11.845 --> 10:16.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
session to condemn the North,
and weigh its
options.

10:16.049 --> 10:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But China, which has veto power
on the Council,
stopped short of saying it would
back new

10:20.820 --> 10:22.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sanctions.

10:22.755 --> 10:27.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That prompted Secretary of
Defense Ash Carter
to say that Beijing has an
important responsibility

10:27.527 --> 10:29.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and needs to do more.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

10:32.532 --> 10:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more and to
explore the
world's options, we turn to Gary
Samore.

10:37.871 --> 10:42.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served on the national
security staff during
the first term of the Obama
administration

10:42.976 --> 10:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the coordinator for arms
control and weapons
of mass destruction.

10:47.213 --> 10:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now at Harvard University's
Kennedy School
of Government.

10:51.017 --> 10:56.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Greg Thielmann, he was the
director of
the Strategic, Proliferation and
Military

10:56.055 --> 11:00.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Affairs office at the State
Department from
2000-2002.

11:00.693 --> 11:04.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's now on the board of
directors of the
Arms Control Association.

11:04.531 --> 11:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a pro-arms-control advocacy
group.

11:07.567 --> 11:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Greg Thielmann, to you first.

11:11.704 --> 11:15.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just heard this described as
the North's
most powerful nuclear test yet.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How significant was it?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO / GREG THIELMANN, Former
U.S. State
Department Official: Well, it's
the latest

11:20.046 --> 11:29.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
piece of bad news in terms of
North Korea's
continuing evolution of nuclear
and missile

11:29.088 --> 11:30.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
programs.

11:30.456 --> 11:36.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the most powerful nuclear
test yet, the
second this year.

11:36.329 --> 11:43.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it represents an
acceleration of North
Korea's movement in a very bad
direction.

11:43.937 --> 11:48.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what does
this say about
their nuclear capability, where
they can reach,

11:48.841 --> 11:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how much destruction they can
wreak?

11:50.743 --> 11:54.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG THIELMANN: It's very hard
to answer that
question precisely, because we
really don't

11:54.948 --> 12:01.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know how advanced the North
Koreans are in
being able to miniaturize their
nuclear devices,

12:01.688 --> 12:03.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so they fit on top of a
ballistic missile.

12:03.623 --> 12:06.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there's a lot of guesswork
involved.

12:06.192 --> 12:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it's fair to say
that, at this
point, the North Koreans may
have the about

12:11.297 --> 12:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to put a nuclear warhead on a
medium-range
ballistic missile, and that
missile could

12:18.972 --> 12:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hit Japan, it could hit South
Korea.

12:21.574 --> 12:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are probably that far,
according
to what we hear from South Korea
and U.S.

12:28.147 --> 12:29.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
intelligence sources.

12:29.983 --> 12:34.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gary Samore, what
are the North
Koreans trying to say with this
test, do you

12:34.320 --> 12:36.055 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
believe?

12:36.089 --> 12:38.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY SAMORE, Former Presidential
Adviser on
Arms Control: Well, of course,
the specific

12:38.491 --> 12:46.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
timing was to celebrate the 68th
anniversary
of the foundation of North
Korea.

12:46.165 --> 12:51.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, more broadly, I
think Kim Jong-un
is determined to demonstrate
that he is not

12:51.070 --> 12:57.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be cowed or deterred by
U.N. Security
Council injunctions and the
threat of sanctions,

12:57.910 --> 13:02.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which are demanding the he halt
testing and
eventually give up his nuclear
weapons program.

13:02.882 --> 13:08.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I believe the North Koreans
are trying
to make it clear to the Security
Council and

13:08.121 --> 13:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the big powers, especially
China and the
U.S., that they are determined
to retain and

13:13.159 --> 13:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expand their nuclear weapons
capability.

13:15.294 --> 13:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greg Thielmann,
does this represent
a failure of American policy,
policy of the

13:20.266 --> 13:22.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rest the world toward North
Korea?

13:22.268 --> 13:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG THIELMANN: Well, I think,
almost by definition,
it represents a failure, since
the objective

13:27.273 --> 13:33.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that almost all countries in the
world agree
to which is not to expand the
number of countries

13:33.946 --> 13:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that possess nuclear attack
capability.

13:37.684 --> 13:43.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So -- but what's
been wrong
about that policy?

13:43.289 --> 13:44.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Has it been too tough?

13:44.357 --> 13:45.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Has it been too weak?

13:45.958 --> 13:47.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you size it up?

13:47.894 --> 13:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG THIELMANN: Well, of course,
U.S. nuclear
nonproliferation policy has
scored some impressive

13:54.400 --> 13:58.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successes, and I think the Iran
nuclear agreement
of last year is a good example
of that.

13:58.471 --> 14:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the case of North Korea, it's
one of the
most difficult of all challenges
we have.

14:04.010 --> 14:10.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is certainly reason to
criticize
the North Koreans for being bad
negotiating

14:10.817 --> 14:16.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
partners, and they have not been
willing to
carry out some of the
obligations to which

14:16.956 --> 14:18.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they have agreed.

14:18.491 --> 14:22.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are also problems on
the other side
of the table.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the problems we have
right now is,
there is no table.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are not talking to the North
Koreans.

14:26.899 --> 14:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are no
negotiations going.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG THIELMANN: No.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn to
Gary Samore.

14:31.370 --> 14:36.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you see this question of
flat out that
this means what's been going on
until now

14:36.375 --> 14:37.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has failed?

14:37.744 --> 14:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARY SAMORE: Yes, I think that's
right.

14:40.747 --> 14:47.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, going back to President
Reagan, when
we first suspected that North
Korea was pursuing

14:47.086 --> 14:53.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a nuclear weapons program, the
United States
has tried many different ways to
slow down

14:53.259 --> 14:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or prevent North Korea from
acquiring nuclear
weapons, including nuclear
diplomacy.

14:57.663 --> 15:03.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had three agreements,
threats of preemptive
war, economic sanctions.

15:03.169 --> 15:07.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have tried many different
methods, and
they have all failed.

15:07.273 --> 15:11.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as Greg says, it's
an indication
of how difficult this problem
is.

15:11.677 --> 15:17.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a country that is --
really feels
it has an existential need to
have nuclear

15:17.383 --> 15:23.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapons in order to survive, and
the U.S.
options, whether they're
diplomatic, or coercive,

15:23.322 --> 15:26.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or military, are very limited.

15:27.026 --> 15:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the question will be whether
or not this
test and North Korea's
continuing defiance

15:31.998 --> 15:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will create opportunities, in
particular for
the U.S. and China, to work
together, and

15:37.737 --> 15:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that will be seen in the U.N.,
whether or
not the Chinese are prepared to
support additional

15:42.942 --> 15:44.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sanctions measures.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about
that, because, up until now, the
U.S., as

15:47.180 --> 15:50.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we know, has said there are
preconditions.

15:50.183 --> 15:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea has to meet certain
conditions
before the U.S. will sit down at
the table

15:55.521 --> 15:57.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and talk.

15:57.156 --> 15:58.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Should that policy go away?

15:58.724 --> 16:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Should there now be talks
without preconditions?

16:01.160 --> 16:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY SAMORE: Well, just to be
clear, the U.S.
is prepared to meet with the
North Koreans,

16:08.301 --> 16:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the North Korean diplomats
without any
conditions.

16:11.170 --> 16:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, what are the
conditions for
nuclear negotiations, for formal
negotiation?

16:16.609 --> 16:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for me, a minimum condition
has to be
an agreement that the purpose of
nuclear negotiations

16:23.916 --> 16:26.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is to achieve eventual
disarmament.

16:26.853 --> 16:32.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody expects that to happen in
the near-term,
but in some kind of sequence,
series of steps,

16:32.158 --> 16:37.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, secondly, that while the
talks are going
on, North Korean refrain from
nuclear and

16:37.997 --> 16:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
long-range missile testing.

16:39.866 --> 16:44.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, that's a reasonable
minimal requirement,
and I think you could get the
Chinese and

16:44.971 --> 16:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other major powers involved
in the talks
to agree to that.

16:48.407 --> 16:51.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the Obama administration
has been asking
for more.

16:51.744 --> 16:57.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been asking for
restraints on North
Korean fissile material
destruction as a precondition

16:57.483 --> 16:59.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- or as a condition for
starting negotiations.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARY SAMORE: I think that hasn't
worked.

17:02.054 --> 17:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we have to look at
trying to come
to an agreement with China on
conditions that

17:07.960 --> 17:09.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are more realistic.

17:09.128 --> 17:10.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greg Thielmann,
how do you
see that?

17:10.796 --> 17:12.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think needs to
happen now?

17:12.665 --> 17:18.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG THIELMANN: I mostly agree
with what Gary
said, but I think that we could
make a mistake

17:18.471 --> 17:25.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in even trying to get North
Korea to go back
to its previous commitment to a
denuclearized

17:25.878 --> 17:27.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Korean Peninsula.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, right now, that's
putting the bar
too high.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to negotiate with the
North Koreans.

17:32.652 --> 17:39.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even if the objective -- the
only objective
we can agree to is a freeze on
North Korean

17:39.158 --> 17:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear and ballistic missile
testing, I think
that, too, would have value.

17:43.162 --> 17:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that doesn't mean we have to
abandon our
objective to ultimately get rid
of all nuclear

17:48.200 --> 17:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
weapons in the Korean Peninsula.

17:50.303 --> 17:56.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But to require the North
Koreans, before entering
negotiation, to accept that as
the ultimate

17:56.442 --> 17:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
objective of the negotiations I
think is asking
too much.

17:58.945 --> 18:01.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you're saying,
what, tell
the North Koreans what?

18:01.414 --> 18:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will sit down with you --
what?

18:03.282 --> 18:10.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG THIELMANN: We will sit down
and negotiate
the terms of a freeze on nuclear
and ballistic

18:10.189 --> 18:12.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
missile testing.

18:12.058 --> 18:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will make very clear that
our objective
is to ultimately get rid of all
nuclear weapons

18:18.664 --> 18:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Korean Peninsula, as the
North Koreans
had previously agreed to.

18:22.301 --> 18:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gary Samore, does
that sound
like the right path?

18:25.171 --> 18:29.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY SAMORE: Right now, the
North Koreans
are not prepared to talk about
nuclear disarmament,

18:29.909 --> 18:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nor are they prepared to accept
any restriction
on their testing activity.

18:34.313 --> 18:39.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And unless you establish, it
seems to me,
a basic premise for the talks,
then -- or

18:39.952 --> 18:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the negotiations, then
you're not going
to get anywhere if you don't at
least with

18:43.389 --> 18:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have an agreement on what it's
all about.

18:45.024 --> 18:48.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's a
moment when a
lot of questions are being
asked.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we know that it's --
certainly, what North
Korea has done has certainly
gained everyone's

18:52.965 --> 18:54.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attention.

18:54.367 --> 18:55.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gary Samore, we thank you.

18:55.701 --> 18:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Greg Thielmann, we thank you.

18:56.902 --> 18:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREG THIELMANN: You're welcome.

18:57.903 --> 19:02.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY SAMORE: Thank you.

19:02.975 --> 19:17.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
continuing coverage
of the upcoming 15th anniversary
of the September

19:17.156 --> 19:18.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
11 attacks.

19:18.891 --> 19:23.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin with a look at the
country where
the attacks were planned,
Afghanistan.

19:23.529 --> 19:31.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. and NATO deposed the
Taliban government
in the fall of 2001, but 15
years later, American

19:31.504 --> 19:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troops continue to fight and die
there, while
trying to help the Afghans stand
up an army

19:37.510 --> 19:40.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to take on a resurgent Taliban.

19:40.079 --> 19:44.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Kabul, special
correspondent Jennifer
Glasse reports.

19:44.083 --> 19:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: At the Regional
Corps Battle
School in Laghman Province in
Eastern Afghanistan,

19:50.056 --> 19:54.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these Afghan soldiers, many with
years of
battlefield experience, have
been learning

19:54.627 --> 19:57.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leadership skills from coalition
forces.

19:57.930 --> 20:03.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an Afghan-run school with
U.S. soldiers
and NATO troops serving as
advisers.

20:03.269 --> 20:08.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Part of the lesson plan,
U.S.-style military
organization.

20:08.808 --> 20:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After completing seven weeks of
training,
these men become noncommissioned
officers,

20:12.812 --> 20:16.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a rank that had been exclusive
to the United
States military.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Adam Weiner is an adviser.

20:18.384 --> 20:19.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2ND.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.220 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

20:21.253 --> 20:24.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM WEINER, Military Adviser:
We have a strong
leadership in the officer and
NCO side, and

20:24.323 --> 20:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we see the benefits that that
has for our
Army.

20:27.093 --> 20:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have tried to instill
that into
their training as well to
empower their noncommissioned

20:32.465 --> 20:37.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officers to take a bigger role
in leading
soldiers alongside their officer
counterparts

20:38.003 --> 20:39.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in their units.

20:39.972 --> 20:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Some of these
Afghan soldiers
fought alongside U.S. forces in
Eastern Afghanistan.

20:45.511 --> 20:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With only a few American special
forces still
in the country, Afghans must
rely on U.S.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
airpower when things get tough.

20:53.052 --> 20:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): When
the air support
comes, every soldier, every
fighter has better

20:59.725 --> 21:01.026 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
morale.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are refreshed and fight
with new energy
against the enemy.

21:04.530 --> 21:09.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, in some districts, there
are high mountains,
and we can not go there.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we need the airplanes to
target the enemy.

21:11.904 --> 21:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: But after 15
years of U.S.
and coalition efforts on the
ground and least

21:15.674 --> 21:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$65 billion, Afghan security
forces are still
a development project.

21:22.148 --> 21:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The task of building a military
here didn't
start until 2009, with a
commitment from President

21:27.286 --> 21:32.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama to do the hard work needed
to help Afghanistan
stand on its own, and reducing
the need for

21:32.691 --> 21:34.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. troops.

21:34.860 --> 21:38.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General John Nicholson is the
commander of
U.S. and NATO forces in
Afghanistan.

21:38.531 --> 21:43.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's served here before, but now
commands
an international force far
smaller than years

21:43.903 --> 21:44.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
past.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.672 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

21:46.705 --> 21:47.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN NICHOLSON, U.S. Commander
in Afghanistan:
We're trying to build an
airplane while in

21:47.439 --> 21:48.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flight, OK?

21:48.774 --> 21:50.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they're fighting a war while
we're trying
to build an army.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is very hard.

21:52.611 --> 21:57.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when you look at the
histories of any
of our Western coalition force
members who

21:57.416 --> 22:01.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are here, they have had a
similar long journey
to build the professional armies
that we have

22:01.687 --> 22:03.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

22:03.656 --> 22:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is primarily the
challenge, casualties,
the need to develop leaders, the
need to develop

22:08.661 --> 22:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
systems where none previously
existed.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, it does take time.

22:13.465 --> 22:18.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Sergeant 1st
Class Philip
Nixon is serving a second tour
here.

22:18.470 --> 22:22.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 2010, he was fighting in
Southern Afghanistan.

22:22.208 --> 22:27.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now he's the platoon leader of
the Guardian
Angels, a mix of U.S. and NATO
troops charged

22:27.613 --> 22:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with protection of the military
advisers and
their bases across the country.

22:30.849 --> 22:34.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS PHILIP NIXON,
Guardian Angels:
Compared to when I was here in
Afghanistan

22:34.653 --> 22:40.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
six years ago, the Afghan army,
the ANA have
come a long way.

22:40.726 --> 22:44.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are -- the facilities are
much better.

22:44.363 --> 22:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their soldiers seem to be doing
a lot.

22:47.299 --> 22:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we're able to do
here with the
train, advise, and assist
mission has improved

22:55.608 --> 22:57.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drastically from the last time I
was here.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: A lot has
changed in six
years.

23:00.012 --> 23:05.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. policy in Afghanistan
remains focused
on counterterrorism, but now
they're relying

23:05.551 --> 23:08.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the Afghans to execute most
of that mission.

23:08.621 --> 23:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American troops on this base are
part of the
main mission of U.S. forces here
in Afghanistan

23:12.391 --> 23:15.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to train, advise and assist
Afghan security
forces.

23:15.961 --> 23:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's an Afghan base just next
door, and
there are bases like this all
over Afghanistan,

23:22.101 --> 23:27.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
like Shorabak in Helmand
Province, Southern
Afghanistan, where Afghan
trainers and U.S.

23:27.539 --> 23:32.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advisers are putting the Afghan
215 Corps
through their paces.

23:32.411 --> 23:36.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American and British forces left
Helmand in
2014.

23:36.248 --> 23:40.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After the Taliban made
considerable gains
in the absence of coalition
forces, hundreds

23:40.286 --> 23:43.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of U.S. troops have returned.

23:43.322 --> 23:48.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, with new leaders in the
Afghan corps,
the coalition is teaching them
new tactics

23:48.560 --> 23:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to fight a resurgent Taliban.

23:50.929 --> 23:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within the past year, the
Taliban briefly
captured Kunduz city in the
North this summer,

23:54.933 --> 24:00.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this summer besieged Lashkar Gah
in the south,
and this week threatened Tirin
Kot in Central

24:00.539 --> 24:01.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Afghanistan.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

24:03.409 --> 24:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN NICHOLSON: When you look at
the population
and district control, the
Afghans control

24:05.778 --> 24:11.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about 68 percent of the
population and about
62 percent of the districts.

24:11.150 --> 24:17.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Taliban control about 10
percent of the
population and 10 percent of the
districts;

24:17.256 --> 24:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
25 percent of the country is
contested.

24:19.558 --> 24:20.859 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's in play.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: And the fight
isn't just
on the battlefields.

24:23.329 --> 24:25.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Taliban strikes wherever it
can.

24:25.597 --> 24:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just behind me is the Ministry
of Defense.

24:27.766 --> 24:32.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few minutes ago, there were
two explosions,
the police and security forces,
you can see,

24:32.137 --> 24:33.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out in full force.

24:33.339 --> 24:34.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're moving the people back.

24:34.506 --> 24:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a very busy market area.

24:37.076 --> 24:41.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is one of the busiest
parts of the
day, as businesses let out, as
offices let

24:41.747 --> 24:43.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out, so the streets were very,
very full.

24:43.582 --> 24:47.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police say some suspicious
men went over
there, so they're moving
everybody as far

24:47.786 --> 24:49.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back as they can.

24:49.288 --> 24:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the kind of security
problem that
Afghans face on a daily basis.

24:54.026 --> 24:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This Taliban attack in Kabul was
particularly
brutal and deadly.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, a remote-controlled bomb
went off.

24:59.832 --> 25:06.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, as help arrived for the
wounded, a suicide
bomber dressed in an Afghan army
uniform detonated

25:06.338 --> 25:08.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
himself in the crowd of helpers.

25:08.507 --> 25:14.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 35 people were killed,
including
an army general and three senior
police officers.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
More than 90 were wounded.

25:16.014 --> 25:18.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Taliban aren't the only
threat in
Afghanistan.

25:18.550 --> 25:20.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

25:20.419 --> 25:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN NICHOLSON: Of the 60
designated terrorist
organizations that the U.S. has
identified,

25:24.323 --> 25:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
10 of them reside in this
region.

25:27.259 --> 25:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, our presence here enables us
to keep pressure
on those organizations and
prevent another

25:31.764 --> 25:33.232 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
9/11.

25:33.265 --> 25:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER GLASSE: Both al-Qaida
and the Islamic
State are in Afghanistan.

25:36.335 --> 25:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. commander got expanded
authorities
this year to fight both ISIS and
the Taliban

25:41.273 --> 25:42.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
directly.

25:42.775 --> 25:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, again, U.S. forces are
fighting here,
supported by American planes.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the Afghans remain on the
front line.

25:49.948 --> 25:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have a new air force, but
it will take
years before its at full
strength and capacity,

25:56.188 --> 26:00.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and Afghan ground forces
continue to take
punishing casualties.

26:00.793 --> 26:05.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, more than 5,500 died
and 14,000
were wounded.

26:05.998 --> 26:11.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Casualties this year are up an
estimated 20
percent, the price of defending
a country

26:11.103 --> 26:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they got back from the Taliban
15 years ago.

26:13.839 --> 26:20.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jennifer Glasse
in Kabul.

26:20.579 --> 26:28.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:28.654 --> 26:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what the 9/11
memorials mean to victims'
families in their

26:34.393 --> 26:35.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own words.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first: the analysis of
Shields and Brooks.

26:39.531 --> 26:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

26:44.670 --> 26:45.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

26:45.671 --> 26:47.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's good to see you again.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's talk about the
presidential campaign.

26:50.175 --> 26:55.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, we saw the two candidates
together
at the same place this week, but
not at the

26:55.314 --> 26:59.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same time, at this televised
forum that NBC
sponsored.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What did you make of it, of
their performance
and what they had to say?

27:02.387 --> 27:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I thought they
both lost.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I thought America lost.

27:05.757 --> 27:06.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Humanity lost.

27:06.725 --> 27:08.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A little piece of my soul died.

27:08.727 --> 27:09.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I thought they...

27:09.728 --> 27:10.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That bad?

27:10.762 --> 27:12.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I thought they
both did poorly.

27:12.598 --> 27:18.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought she was evasive and
cross and looked
like she was imperious and was
angry to be

27:18.937 --> 27:20.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
challenged.

27:20.672 --> 27:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She had plenty of information,
but not a lot
of relatability and not a lot of
humanity

27:25.444 --> 27:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and not a lot of vision for
foreign policy.

27:27.746 --> 27:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He, if anything, was a little
worse.

27:30.549 --> 27:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is, and as he has wont to do,
said about
six ridiculous things.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The admiration for Putin is of
long standing.

27:36.755 --> 27:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to me, the thing that really
made me think
was his claim that in Iraq we
should have

27:41.627 --> 27:44.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left a core of people to take
the oil.

27:44.096 --> 27:49.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that is -- first of all,
it's impractical,
but it's also moral idiocy.

27:49.768 --> 27:52.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe you're selfish and you
think, oh, I
got some oil and I got some
guns, I should

27:52.738 --> 27:54.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
take it.

27:54.573 --> 27:58.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you go through any realm
of education,
which is what we try to do with
people, you

27:58.076 --> 28:01.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
learn that that's called
imperialism, that's
called plunder.

28:01.313 --> 28:02.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's morally wrong.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It ruins your credibility.

28:04.349 --> 28:08.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea that a big country is
going to go
out and send troops into some
country to take

28:08.453 --> 28:12.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their resources, and then the
rest of the
world is going to somehow trust
us is just

28:12.491 --> 28:14.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a ridiculous notion.

28:14.259 --> 28:18.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he says things that are
just plainly
ridiculous.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But -- so that's why was so
depressed.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:22.034 --> 28:25.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark,
humanity lost as
a result of this encounter or
this performance

28:25.470 --> 28:26.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this week?

28:26.705 --> 28:27.906 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:27.940 --> 28:31.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, I wasn't --
it wasn't
Lincoln-Douglas.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:33.378 --> 28:38.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: And most
importantly of all,
I think David's point about the
oil is well-taken.

28:38.216 --> 28:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's valid and I think
it's true.

28:42.921 --> 28:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is not the United States.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is pillaging.

28:47.125 --> 28:51.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the worst form of
imperialism that
he's describing.

28:51.063 --> 28:56.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would mean leaving thousands
of Americans
there to protect the oil
drilling.

28:56.201 --> 29:03.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it just is -- it's
indefensible on
logistical, moral and political
grounds.

29:03.141 --> 29:06.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that aside, I think what it
did -- and
you have moderated debates.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have never moderated a debate,
Judy, for
good reason.

29:09.281 --> 29:15.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it's raised this --
Wednesday
night, partially because of the
unflattering

29:15.420 --> 29:21.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
press reaction to Matt Lauer's
performance,
has raised the stakes for the
moderator, who

29:21.827 --> 29:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is now put on notice, all of
them, that they
are not entitled in 2016 to sit
there while

29:30.002 --> 29:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody makes a statement that
is factually
untrue and is -- can be proven
false, as Mr.

29:37.409 --> 29:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump did when he, in fact, said
that he had
always opposed the United
States' war in Iraq.

29:43.949 --> 29:47.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just think that -- it's
tough to be
a moderator.

29:47.119 --> 29:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that, given this
campaign and
the questions about the
integrity and honesty

29:53.091 --> 29:56.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the candidates, and the great
doubts about
them, I think that is now part
of the job

29:56.928 --> 29:58.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
description.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
that question
about the role of the moderator,
David?

30:00.132 --> 30:01.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I watched the debate, and I
didn't think Matt
Lauer did that terribly.

30:03.435 --> 30:06.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought a lot of people who
were Clinton
partisans saw that she did bad,
and they decided

30:06.171 --> 30:09.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to blame him, which is what
normally happens
when one candidate does badly.

30:09.708 --> 30:13.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As for the role of the
moderator, I guess
I would say in moderation.

30:13.278 --> 30:16.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the moderator corrects a fact
or two, that
would be fine.

30:16.882 --> 30:21.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it turns into an argument
between the moderator
and the candidate, that is not
what we want.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the final point to be made,
just in terms
of cognitive science, the idea
that when you

30:25.390 --> 30:30.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correct a fact, you erase that
fact from people's
memories is the reverse of the
truth.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you correct a fact, what
you do is you
further lodge that fact into
people's minds,

30:33.765 --> 30:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and they remember the error.

30:35.701 --> 30:40.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have had all these
fact-checking services
on TV in the print, three
Pinocchios, liar,

30:40.505 --> 30:45.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liar, pants on fire award, and
we have not
entered a more factual era of
American politics.

30:45.243 --> 30:46.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have entered a less factual
era.

30:46.878 --> 30:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's just that blunt fact
that it doesn't
work.

30:49.081 --> 30:54.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mark, is this
really all
about the fact that Hillary
Clinton didn't

30:54.619 --> 30:57.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do as well as her supporters
wanted her to
do?

30:57.889 --> 31:00.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

31:00.158 --> 31:03.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think there are
people, obviously,
who criticized Matt Lauer on
that basis.

31:03.895 --> 31:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm not trying to pile on
Matt Lauer.

31:06.498 --> 31:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the difference,
Judy, between
a debate and what we saw
Wednesday night is

31:11.970 --> 31:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a debate, as you know and
our viewers
know, is a simultaneous
occurrence, when the

31:17.509 --> 31:22.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two are there at the same time,
and they can
respond in real time to each
other.

31:22.848 --> 31:27.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that, you know, we
get 90 million
people at a presidential debate.

31:27.285 --> 31:33.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no question that, in
1980, Ronald
Reagan had been portrayed as a
war-monger,

31:34.025 --> 31:36.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
somebody who couldn't do
anything off a script.

31:36.361 --> 31:41.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the one debate with
President Jimmy Carter,
he stood toe-to-toe and
reassured people that

31:41.733 --> 31:46.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wasn't bound and determined
to start World
War III on the spot and could
make a coherent

31:46.872 --> 31:48.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
statement.

31:48.540 --> 31:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I mean, there is a lot more
to a debate
than there was on Wednesday
night.

31:54.613 --> 32:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in 2004, I think it's
pretty obvious
that John Kerry won the three
debates on debating

32:02.154 --> 32:08.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
terms, but in the final
analysis, George Bush
was reelected because voters
chose "I like"

32:08.593 --> 32:09.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over "I.Q."

32:09.594 --> 32:11.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

32:11.429 --> 32:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And that's what
one gets, is
a sense of their personality,
the character,

32:15.200 --> 32:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how they treat each other, how
they treat
the moderator.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that's why -- I think
it upped
the audience for the next
debate.

32:20.972 --> 32:24.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, what about
-- in this
race, the polls have tightened.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you attribute that to?

32:26.278 --> 32:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I don't know.

32:28.814 --> 32:32.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the stock market drops 300
points, then
the stock market analysis
invents some story

32:32.617 --> 32:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to go along with it, oh, there
was a correction.

32:35.220 --> 32:39.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what we tend to when the
polls tighten
is, we invent a story to go back
for it.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they have tightened.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have tightened from maybe a
seven-point
Clinton lead to a maybe a two-
or three-point

32:43.829 --> 32:44.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Clinton lead.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so they have tightened.

32:46.064 --> 32:48.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have not seen Donald Trump
run a better
campaign.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have not seen Hillary Clinton
run a worse
campaign.

32:51.369 --> 32:55.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it could just be -- and one
-- as one
travels around the country, one
is just constantly

32:55.807 --> 32:57.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
barraged with the upsetness.

32:57.943 --> 33:00.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People are just dispirited.

33:00.078 --> 33:04.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it could be in that general
air of dispiritedness,
you settle toward parity,
because they're

33:04.482 --> 33:05.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dispirited about everybody.

33:06.017 --> 33:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that would be my only
theory.

33:07.786 --> 33:11.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have not noticed one
candidate or the
other radically altering their
performance

33:11.389 --> 33:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that explain a loss or a rise.

33:13.491 --> 33:16.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It should finally be said,
Trump's numbers
are pretty flat.

33:16.761 --> 33:19.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The variation tends to be in the
Clinton numbers.

33:19.497 --> 33:20.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, how do you
see that?

33:20.599 --> 33:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you have an explanation for
what's going
on?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I do.

33:23.802 --> 33:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have an explanation, because I
think that's
part of our responsibility, to
come up with

33:27.138 --> 33:28.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explanations, whether they're
valid or not.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:30.609 --> 33:35.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, I think, Judy,
Americans
don't like powerful figures who
punch down,

33:36.014 --> 33:42.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is, who pick on someone
less powerful
and less able to speak for
themselves than

33:42.354 --> 33:44.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they are.

33:44.155 --> 33:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Donald Trump was
guilty of that
on a sustained basis after the
convention,

33:48.727 --> 33:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time of the Democratic
Convention, on
his abuse of a federal judge
whose parents

33:54.532 --> 34:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had emigrated from Mexico, and
in particular
his picking on and really
abusing Mr. and

34:03.541 --> 34:06.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star
parents.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He hasn't done that recently.

34:08.847 --> 34:13.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that reaches the bar of
presidential in
behavior.

34:13.952 --> 34:16.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the problem is, this is a
change election.

34:16.554 --> 34:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans don't like the way
Washington operates.

34:18.957 --> 34:20.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't like Washington.

34:20.825 --> 34:22.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't like the way things
are going.

34:22.894 --> 34:26.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They like the president, but
they do not like
Washington, D.C.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton has become
the status
quo.

34:29.067 --> 34:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By a 2-1 margin, voters believe
that Donald
Trump would change business as
usual in Washington,

34:35.807 --> 34:39.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but by almost as large a margin,
they believe
that Hillary Clinton would be
better in a

34:39.544 --> 34:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crisis and less of a decisive
margin she cares
about people like them.

34:43.982 --> 34:50.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have got this change
election where
he is a change -- represents
change that is

34:50.388 --> 34:53.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really unappealing, that is
threatening to
people.

34:53.124 --> 34:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think that's the election.

34:54.893 --> 35:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's no question that she
has not come
across, as thus far -- she
started to open

35:00.999 --> 35:03.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up this week with the press and
letting them
in.

35:03.635 --> 35:08.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you think about personal
Hillary Clinton,
you have got to go back to the
primary day

35:08.206 --> 35:13.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2008, when she showed such
vulnerability,
appealing vulnerability, and
when she reached

35:13.478 --> 35:17.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out to the girl who was being
bullied during
the Iowa caucuses this year.

35:17.315 --> 35:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other than that, she's been a
private sort
of issues paper and position
paper.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't think that's going
to be enough.

35:24.622 --> 35:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, just
quickly, character
issues or questions, David,
thrown back and

35:30.762 --> 35:34.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
forth between these two
candidates almost
on an hour-by-hour basis.

35:34.332 --> 35:39.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, The Washington Post
editorialized
it's time for the press to lay
off Hillary

35:39.704 --> 35:41.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton's e-mails.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What about that, A?

35:43.541 --> 35:47.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, quickly, B, the story this
week about
Donald Trump's foundation giving
money to

35:47.312 --> 35:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Florida attorney general
that was looking
at whether to investigate Trump
University?

35:52.617 --> 35:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do we assess all of this?

35:54.552 --> 35:57.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, for him,
there is a virtue
in shamelessness.

35:57.389 --> 35:59.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He admits that he's in the
influence-buying
game.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was clearly trying to buy
influence.

36:01.159 --> 36:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, at some level, since he's so
shameless,
he gets less of a rap than
Clinton, who denies

36:04.529 --> 36:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she's in the game, though she
clearly is.

36:06.965 --> 36:10.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I happen to think those -- the
e-mail story
and the other stories are sort
of baked in

36:10.702 --> 36:12.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the cake.

36:12.570 --> 36:15.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It actually would be interesting
at this point
if they actually talked about
something that

36:15.173 --> 36:19.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the next president is going to
do, like health
care reform will have to be
done.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are actually a whole
series of policy
issues.

36:21.780 --> 36:25.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be interesting if one
of them came
out and said, well, the health
care, the Obamacare

36:25.817 --> 36:29.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has to be fixed, and here's
exactly how I'm
going to do that, and they made
that an emphasis.

36:29.888 --> 36:33.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually think that would go
over big because
people are -- as I said, are so
dispirited

36:33.992 --> 36:38.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the contentless post-policy
tone that has
marked this campaign.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Would that make a
difference,
Mark?

36:40.331 --> 36:45.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidates have been talking
-- they have
been giving a speech here and
there about

36:45.603 --> 36:48.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policy and putting some papers
out.

36:48.540 --> 36:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I certainly -- I know Secretary
Clinton has.

36:52.444 --> 36:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, Secretary
Clinton has, Judy.

36:54.512 --> 36:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Mr. Trump's are in the
works, and
we can look for them before
Halloween.

36:58.983 --> 37:04.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, I mean, David put his
finger on it when
she said Donald Trump is
shameless about it.

37:04.556 --> 37:10.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said -- he was asked why he
contributed
to both Democrats and
Republicans, said, when

37:10.061 --> 37:17.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want something, I get it, and
when I call
them, they kiss my ass, which is
not found

37:17.102 --> 37:22.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Bartlett's under most
presidents' famous
quotations.

37:22.073 --> 37:27.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just think that does belie
a cynicism
and probably comports with the
cynicism that

37:27.912 --> 37:29.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
voters feel right now.

37:29.814 --> 37:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't believe Washington.

37:31.983 --> 37:36.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's not being punished for
it or paying
a penalty for it.

37:36.221 --> 37:41.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, I think that
remains a problem.

37:41.159 --> 37:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whoever wins, you have got to
give a sense
of what two things you're going
to do specifically

37:47.899 --> 37:49.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make things better.

37:49.834 --> 37:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think even the
partisans of both
candidates could say right now
what two specific

37:54.172 --> 37:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things their president would do
in his or
her first 90 days.

37:58.176 --> 38:02.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just in the last
45 seconds,
David, a passing this week of
someone who

38:02.714 --> 38:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was an icon in the conservative
movement,
Phyllis Schlafly, 92 years old.

38:08.219 --> 38:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She left an important mark,
didn't she?

38:10.522 --> 38:12.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She came of age and personified
the era when
the cultural war and the Sexual
Revolution

38:15.693 --> 38:20.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues rose up and dominated
American politics,
whether it was issues of gay
rights or gay

38:20.532 --> 38:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
marriage, abortion.

38:22.367 --> 38:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she sort of exemplified that
and created
a new right that really fueled
the Republican

38:26.204 --> 38:28.039 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party.

38:28.072 --> 38:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I happen to think she passes at
a time when
those cultural wars, Sexual
Revolution issues

38:32.210 --> 38:36.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are fading from the scene, and
the coming
generation has basically settled
them, and

38:36.748 --> 38:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not necessarily in a Phyllis
Schlafly direction.

38:38.816 --> 38:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, in
10 seconds
a word about Phyllis Schlafly?

38:42.253 --> 38:48.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, she --
Phyllis Schlafly
was that, and she was more.

38:48.226 --> 38:50.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She almost became a political
kingmaker.

38:50.428 --> 38:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, her endorsement, her
support was sought
eagerly and coveted by the
leading Republican

38:58.136 --> 38:59.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential candidates.

38:59.704 --> 39:01.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And she had an enormous
influence.

39:01.439 --> 39:04.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
thank you very
much.

39:04.842 --> 39:11.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Brooks, have a great
weekend, both of
you.

39:11.082 --> 39:22.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we return to
the months-long
stand-off over the building of a
controversial

39:22.794 --> 39:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pipeline in North Dakota.

39:25.096 --> 39:30.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's intended to carry oil from
the state's
Bakken region across South
Dakota and Iowa

39:30.969 --> 39:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to an existing pipeline in
Illinois, which
is on hold after conflicting
government rulings.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has the story.

39:39.077 --> 39:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The protests
began in April,
when members of the Standing
Rock Sioux Tribe

39:43.281 --> 39:48.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complained that a spill from the
pipeline
would contaminate the Missouri
River and lakes

39:48.186 --> 39:49.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
near their lands.

39:49.654 --> 39:53.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Sioux also have said
construction would
harm sacred tribal grounds.

39:53.825 --> 39:58.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In recent weeks, they have been
joined by
other Native American tribes and
environmental

39:58.162 --> 39:59.931 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
groups.

39:59.964 --> 40:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company and some local
officials have
said the pipeline will create
jobs and boost

40:02.934 --> 40:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
energy production in the U.S.

40:05.236 --> 40:08.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our William Brangham is
reporting near the
Standing Rock Reservation.

40:08.539 --> 40:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke to him a short time ago
and asked
him what the immediate reaction
was like today.

40:13.611 --> 40:17.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yes, this has
been a day
that nobody here really wanted
to see happen.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know if you can see
behind me, but
this is the camp.

40:19.584 --> 40:22.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the main area where
people have been
gathering for weeks, and this is
the worst

40:22.954 --> 40:24.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
possible news initially.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Interestingly, the word is
slowly starting
to trickle out.

40:27.892 --> 40:31.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, in fact, many people I
talked to this
afternoon, I was the one telling
them the

40:31.863 --> 40:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news about the hearing, because
the cell phone
service here is really bad, and
so people

40:35.600 --> 40:38.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not getting the news as
quickly as some
of us are.

40:38.970 --> 40:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the general sense was that
people were
really disappointed.

40:42.273 --> 40:44.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's been a sense of
resignation.

40:44.175 --> 40:47.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people feared that this
would be the
judge's ruling, that they
thought that the

40:47.845 --> 40:51.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Corps would be allowed to do
this and that
the energy company would be
allowed to put

40:51.049 --> 40:52.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the pipeline in.

40:52.984 --> 40:57.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the news also came that the
Justice Department
is considering stepping in and
putting a stop

40:57.255 --> 41:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to this, that only gave people a
certain level
of hope.

41:00.591 --> 41:05.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people that I talked to said
they think
this is going to be an ongoing,
protracted

41:05.263 --> 41:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
battle for weeks, months, maybe
years to come.

41:08.399 --> 41:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: William,
specifically, what
is the tribe's complaint?

41:11.469 --> 41:16.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The principal
argument the
Standing Rock Tribe has is that
the construction

41:16.974 --> 41:22.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this pipeline is going to do,
one, it's
going to destroy a lot of very,
very important

41:22.046 --> 41:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cultural sites to them, burial
grounds, historic
meeting places for their people,
and, number

41:28.353 --> 41:33.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two, that the pipeline, which,
although it
is not going to go through
tribal lands, it

41:33.725 --> 41:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is just a short distance away.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The pipeline will go underneath
the river.

41:38.129 --> 41:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many people are concerned
that if a pipeline
that is carrying hundreds of
thousands of

41:41.999 --> 41:46.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gallons of oil goes underneath
the river,
that there could be some sort of
a rupture

41:46.270 --> 41:51.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, if that happens, that might
spill oil
into their primary source of
drinking water.

41:51.409 --> 41:54.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's been the main
concern, that
the construction of the pipeline
is going

41:54.579 --> 41:59.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to destroy lands that are very,
very important
to them and that the potential
for contamination

41:59.217 --> 42:01.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is enormous.

42:01.085 --> 42:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This would be a
very significant
pipeline, carrying about half of
current Bakken

42:05.189 --> 42:06.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
oil production.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How is the industry responding?

42:08.025 --> 42:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The company
that is building
the pipeline has argued all
along that they

42:11.295 --> 42:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
followed the rules, they filled
out the right
permits, they got all the right
permissions,

42:15.600 --> 42:18.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they did the proper surveys, and
that they
have broken no laws whatsoever.

42:19.003 --> 42:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, that's not really been
the allegation
thus far.

42:21.439 --> 42:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The tribe's main concern has
been with the
Army Corps of Engineers, who
granted one of

42:25.543 --> 42:27.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the main permits for the
pipeline to go in.

42:27.478 --> 42:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Corps says too that they
did all the
proper consultations.

42:30.615 --> 42:36.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the oil company argues also
that they
think this is an important
economic engine

42:36.921 --> 42:38.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the area.

42:38.823 --> 42:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say there will be jobs in
construction
of the pipeline, jobs in
maintaining the pipeline,

42:42.593 --> 42:47.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that they say, look, we
still live in
an oil-based society, and if oil
needs to

42:47.231 --> 42:52.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get from the Bakken oil fields
to market,
this pipeline is the delivery
device for that.

42:52.904 --> 42:56.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It seems there
are really
two parts to this fight, the
court battle

42:56.641 --> 42:58.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and on-the-ground protests.

42:58.309 --> 43:00.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William, explain what happens
now in each.

43:00.278 --> 43:03.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Obviously,
with regards
to the courts, who knows how
that's going

43:03.714 --> 43:04.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to play out.

43:04.882 --> 43:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Justice Department may step
in forcefully
on this.

43:06.651 --> 43:08.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have to wait and see on
that.

43:08.586 --> 43:13.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as what happens here on
the ground,
we have heard from some people
who've said,

43:13.157 --> 43:17.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regardless of what happens with
the courts,
with the rulings, with the Army
Corps, there

43:17.128 --> 43:21.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a certain group of people
here who argue
they will do everything that
they can to not

43:21.065 --> 43:22.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
let this pipeline go forward.

43:22.967 --> 43:28.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard people talking
about the possibility
of physically putting themselves
in the way

43:28.272 --> 43:31.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the construction equipment,
in the way
of the workers' camps.

43:31.742 --> 43:34.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And how widespread that
sentiment is, I don't
really know.

43:34.745 --> 43:39.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will see in the next days
and weeks,
if the construction really does
take off,

43:39.217 --> 43:40.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether or not those actions
come true.

43:41.018 --> 43:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a minority of
people here, at
least, that will do everything
they possibly

43:45.490 --> 43:47.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can to try to stop this from
going forward.

43:47.458 --> 43:51.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Our William
Brangham, speaking
with us from North Dakota, thank
you.

43:51.963 --> 44:01.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we look forward to seeing
your reports
in coming days.

44:01.038 --> 44:14.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
some thoughts
as we approach, on Sunday, the
15th anniversary

44:14.785 --> 44:16.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the 9/11 attacks.

44:16.621 --> 44:21.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are national memorials at
three sites.

44:21.526 --> 44:26.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In New York City, the World
Trade Center Memorial
attracts millions of visitors.

44:26.631 --> 44:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two reflecting pools inscribed
with the names
of the nearly 3,000 people who
died in all

44:32.970 --> 44:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the attacks sit in the
footprint of the
original Twin Towers.

44:37.575 --> 44:40.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's also a museum and a
park.

44:40.244 --> 44:46.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon Memorial is off the
beaten path,
located directly behind the
building.

44:46.150 --> 44:53.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has small benches poised
above lighted
pools to remember the 184 people
who died

44:53.424 --> 44:59.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the Pentagon and on American
Airlines Flight
77 that crashed into it.

44:59.630 --> 45:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Shanksville, Pennsylvania,
the memorial
is in a remote field, set upon
the crash site

45:05.836 --> 45:08.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Flight 93.

45:08.205 --> 45:14.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a collection now of
voices, including
family members, visitors and
writers, who

45:14.412 --> 45:18.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
share their thoughts on the
meaning of these
memorials.

45:18.182 --> 45:25.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY CONOVER: I think it's a
memory that
all of us will carry with us all
of our lives.

45:25.222 --> 45:29.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know my parents' generation,
they thought
of Pearl Harbor.

45:29.126 --> 45:31.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was kind of a signal moment
for them.

45:31.662 --> 45:37.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For my generation, it was this
tragic event
that happened here on 9/11.

45:37.134 --> 45:46.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LORETTA VARGAS: From the
devastation, to how
it looks right now, it just --
it's a meditation

45:46.110 --> 45:47.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for me.

45:47.478 --> 45:51.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm just in my space of
gratitude that
I'm here.

45:51.849 --> 45:55.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL GOLDBERGER, "Vanity
Fair®MD-BO /": The
most powerful thing of all about
the site

45:55.620 --> 46:04.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the void, the sense that
there, where these
incredibly tall, strong
buildings stood, is

46:04.128 --> 46:06.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just emptiness now.

46:06.697 --> 46:07.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there are also the names.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The names are a remembrance.

46:09.900 --> 46:16.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are a sign that those
people who are
gone will be remembered
permanently.

46:16.307 --> 46:20.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there is water, which
is a sign of
renewal and nature.

46:20.945 --> 46:27.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sound of the waterfall
drowning out the
sounds of the city is also very,
very important,

46:27.752 --> 46:31.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because it helps take you into
another place
when you're there.

46:31.288 --> 46:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANA ORR: I'm so proud of the
city for not,
you know, putting something new,
like, right

46:36.427 --> 46:37.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this spot.

46:37.928 --> 46:41.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, I understand that the fact
that there
needed to be another building.

46:41.132 --> 46:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I understand that life goes on.

46:44.001 --> 46:49.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I am just -- I'm so proud
that this memorial
is not only here, but it's as
big.

46:49.874 --> 46:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL GOLDBERGER: In New York,
the memorial
at Ground Zero had a particular
challenge,

46:55.813 --> 47:01.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to allow that entire 16 acres to
have been
a memorial.

47:01.752 --> 47:08.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While it might seem, on the
surface, to be
a way to honor the dead even
more by giving

47:08.259 --> 47:13.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them and their memory all 16
acres, it would
have actually have been a
terrible mistake,

47:13.364 --> 47:18.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it would have carved a
huge hole in
the heart of America's largest
city.

47:18.969 --> 47:23.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And restoring the life of the
city was an
important part of the mission.

47:23.607 --> 47:28.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM LAYCHAK, President, Pentagon
Memorial
Fund: I view the memorial as a
place that

47:28.212 --> 47:29.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
family members can come.

47:30.014 --> 47:35.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whenever they need to reflect or
gain some
hope or some renewal, they can
come any time.

47:35.386 --> 47:36.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Jim Laychak.

47:36.854 --> 47:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm president of the Pentagon
Memorial Fund.

47:38.756 --> 47:42.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I lost my brother Dave here
in the Pentagon
on 9/11.

47:42.293 --> 47:43.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think about Dave a lot.

47:43.527 --> 47:46.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't have to be somewhere
to think
of him.

47:46.597 --> 47:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A song will come on, or I will
see my kids
or his kids doing something that
reminds me

47:51.368 --> 47:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of him, or I will have a memory
of something
when we were growing up that
helped me remember

47:56.607 --> 47:58.342 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

47:58.375 --> 48:02.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think this is more for
those who lost
friends here and really need it
when they

48:02.646 --> 48:04.415 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
need it.

48:04.448 --> 48:07.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Last year, we went to New
York and saw
the 9/11 memorial for the first
time, so we

48:07.985 --> 48:13.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
felt that we needed to come here
to almost
complete the journey to see
exactly what happened

48:13.224 --> 48:14.925 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

48:14.959 --> 48:16.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP KENNICOTT, The Washington
Post: It
was a challenge to make in some
ways, because

48:16.861 --> 48:21.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it included both people who were
at the Pentagon,
including military personnel,
and people who

48:21.432 --> 48:23.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were civilians on the plane who
died.

48:23.734 --> 48:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they had to look for a
way to memorialize
both groups of people.

48:27.671 --> 48:30.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM LAYCHAK: I'm actually
sitting on my brother
Dave's bench.

48:30.941 --> 48:38.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the significance of it for
me is that
it's on 1961 age line, the year
that Dave

48:38.149 --> 48:39.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was born.

48:39.917 --> 48:43.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you come up to the bench,
and you read
his name, you will see the
Pentagon in the

48:43.220 --> 48:46.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
background, which signifies that
he was working
in the Pentagon.

48:46.557 --> 48:51.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDON FELT: The plane that went
down at Shanksville
had passengers on it who
actually resisted.

48:51.729 --> 48:53.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They chose to act.

48:53.164 --> 48:54.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They fought back.

48:55.032 --> 49:01.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They breached the cockpit and
fought for control
of that flight, and in doing so,
they saved

49:01.105 --> 49:04.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countless other lives and they
perhaps saved
the Capitol Building.

49:04.909 --> 49:10.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHILIP KENNICOTT: It was one of
the very powerful
moments of 9/11, because it was
perhaps the

49:10.080 --> 49:14.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only moment in that day in which
the terrorists
weren't writing the narrative.

49:14.318 --> 49:18.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the passengers on that
plane are remembered
quite heroically.

49:18.289 --> 49:22.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet I think, very much to
the credit of
the design of Shanksville, it's
not a bombastic

49:22.760 --> 49:24.495 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
memorial.

49:24.528 --> 49:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not about exaggerating the
importance
of that heroism, as important
that it is.

49:29.166 --> 49:35.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really about the loss of
the people and
a sense, truly a sense of
healing, more than

49:35.406 --> 49:37.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most of the memorials, because
it's in a rural
landscape.

49:37.408 --> 49:39.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN NACKE, Brother of September
11 Victim:
This is where my brother is.

49:39.710 --> 49:46.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is where I choose to
remember his last
moments on this world and talk
to him, tell

49:46.884 --> 49:52.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him, you know, how proud -- you
know, that
he's missed and that he's loved.

49:52.823 --> 49:57.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PHILIP KENNICOTT: What's
happened, I think,
is the natural progression, as
the event recedes

49:57.094 --> 50:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
farther into history, there is a
tendency
to divide those people who were
personally

50:01.632 --> 50:07.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
connected from the events from
the rest of
us who remember them now
increasingly as historical

50:07.071 --> 50:09.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
events.

50:09.039 --> 50:13.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see people who wander
through, who look,
who are looking at it as an
object, as a historical

50:14.011 --> 50:15.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
marker.

50:15.846 --> 50:20.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you see people who
really engage,
who touch, who feel, who sit,
who contemplate.

50:20.050 --> 50:26.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL GOLDBERGER: There will be
more people
who were not around on 9/11, who
didn't experience

50:26.690 --> 50:33.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, who will come there to learn
about it,
and, we hope, to feel some
emotion that is

50:33.530 --> 50:39.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not connected to their own
memories, but to
what this place brings to them,
what it confers,

50:39.637 --> 50:42.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what it inspires inside them.

50:42.306 --> 50:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The great things speak to those
of us who
weren't there then and transcend
time.

50:48.312 --> 50:54.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One postscript to
all of this:
An American flag that was part
of an iconic

50:54.852 --> 51:02.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
photo taken on September 11,
2001, and then
went missing for years is being
returned.

51:02.559 --> 51:07.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three New York firefighters
grabbed the flag
from a nearby yacht in Lower
Manhattan after

51:07.865 --> 51:09.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the attacks.

51:09.366 --> 51:13.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The picture of them raising it
at Ground Zero
was seen around the world.

51:13.671 --> 51:19.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For reasons that are still
unclear, it disappeared
from the site within days.

51:19.043 --> 51:21.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has been found in Everett,
Washington.

51:21.211 --> 51:27.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A man who said he was a retired
Marine turned
it over to a local fire station
after saying

51:27.184 --> 51:29.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it was given to him as a
gift.

51:30.020 --> 51:35.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many questions remain, but
forensic scientists
say that they have confirmed it
is indeed

51:35.459 --> 51:37.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the missing flag.

51:37.227 --> 51:40.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Online, we continue our
remembrance.

51:40.331 --> 51:45.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One woman whose high school is
just blocks
from Ground Zero explains how
she teaches

51:45.602 --> 51:50.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a new generation of students
about the attacks.

51:50.407 --> 51:53.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a quick news update before
we go tonight.

51:53.377 --> 51:58.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry and his
Russian counterpart, Sergei
Lavrov, have announced

51:58.882 --> 52:04.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a cease-fire to halt the
violence in Syria,
after multiple failed attempts
to reach a

52:04.455 --> 52:06.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
similar deal.

52:06.290 --> 52:10.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new plan is scheduled to go
into effect
on Monday, and it aims to reduce
the bloodshed

52:10.761 --> 52:13.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after more than five years of
war.

52:13.998 --> 52:19.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Republican vice presidential
nominee and
Indiana Governor Mike Pence has
released 10

52:19.803 --> 52:21.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
years of tax returns.

52:21.605 --> 52:27.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They show that he earned an
adjusted income
of $113,000 last year, and paid
an effective

52:27.945 --> 52:31.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tax rate of 12.4 percent.

52:31.281 --> 52:35.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His running mate, Donald Trump,
has not released
his own returns.

52:35.352 --> 52:40.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Have a wonderful weekend.

53:33.177 --> 53:46.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
