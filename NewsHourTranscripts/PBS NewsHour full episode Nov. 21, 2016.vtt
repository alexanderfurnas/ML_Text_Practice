JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.407 --> 00:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a
look at what
we know about president- elect
Trump's plans

00:11.178 --> 00:14.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to move from campaigning to
governing.

00:14.414 --> 00:19.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Bernie Sanders on his new
book, the
new president and how he's going
to keep his

00:19.853 --> 00:21.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
political revolution alive.

00:21.421 --> 00:23.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:23.290 --> 00:26.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont: I
think what
we have to be, going to the
streets, protesting

00:26.860 --> 00:29.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in any and every way, makes
sense.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we need a strategy.

00:30.931 --> 00:35.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And "The
Atlantic" magazine's
Jeffrey Goldberg shares what
Henry Kissinger

00:35.736 --> 00:41.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinks of how President Obama
has handled
foreign policy and what he
expects of president-elect

00:41.675 --> 00:43.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG, National
Correspondent,
"The Atlantic": Obviously, Henry
Kissinger

00:45.145 --> 00:48.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a person, even at 93, who
doesn't like
to be out of the game, doesn't
like to be

00:48.448 --> 00:55.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the limelight, and so
he's basically
saying, "I'm here for you, Don,
and I want

00:55.255 --> 00:56.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to give you some sound advice."

00:56.990 --> 01:05.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:05.065 --> 01:07.968 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:08.001 --> 01:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President-elect
Donald Trump
continued his very visible
process of meeting

01:17.411 --> 01:21.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with people who may play top
roles in his
administration.

01:21.415 --> 01:25.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The auditions weren't public,
but the comings
and goings were.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

01:27.654 --> 01:31.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The planning for
president-elect
Trump's White House was back at
Trump Tower

01:31.825 --> 01:36.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Manhattan today after a
weekend at a Trump
golf course in New Jersey.

01:36.596 --> 01:41.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some are hoping to hear, "You're
hired," like
former Massachusetts Senator
Scott Brown,

01:41.601 --> 01:43.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who wants to be veterans affairs
secretary.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT BROWN (R), Former U.S.
Senator: I think
he's obviously going to take my
application

01:46.974 --> 01:49.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or interest under consideration.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm glad that he called.

01:50.777 --> 01:53.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think I'm the best person, but
there are
some tremendous people out
there.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't look at it as a
competition.

01:55.849 --> 01:59.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anybody who takes that job,
which I believe
is the toughest job in the
Cabinet because

01:59.786 --> 02:03.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has really so many problems,
in that it's
so visible.

02:03.857 --> 02:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Some, like Oklahoma
Governor Mary
Fallin, were early allies.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is mentioned as a candidate
for interior
secretary.

02:11.264 --> 02:12.599 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY FALLIN (R), Oklahoma: No, I
not was not
offered a position.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just an initial meeting
to discuss
a wide range of topics.

02:16.837 --> 02:21.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Others, like former
Texas Governor
Rick Perry, were former rivals.

02:21.775 --> 02:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He once referred to Trumpism as
a toxic mix
of demagoguery and nonsense.

02:27.681 --> 02:31.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now he's talked about as a
possible defense
or energy secretary.

02:31.651 --> 02:37.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump also sat down with a
prominent House
Democrat, Hawaii's Tulsi
Gabbard.

02:37.157 --> 02:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a Bernie Sanders supporter
who has been
critical of both President Obama
and Hillary

02:41.228 --> 02:42.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

02:42.596 --> 02:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement, she said they
discussed foreign
policy issues.

02:46.266 --> 02:52.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With visitors coming and going
at a rapid
clip, top Trump adviser
Kellyanne Conway made

02:52.105 --> 02:55.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clear not every meeting is a job
interview.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Manager:
You have people flying in from
all over the

02:57.444 --> 03:01.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country meeting with him to give
their advice,
their counsel, share their
experience and

03:01.448 --> 03:05.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their vision for the country,
some of which
will result in appointments to
his administration,

03:05.619 --> 03:07.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and some who just wish to be
helpful.

03:07.554 --> 03:11.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Network TV news
executives and
anchors also met with the
president-elect

03:11.658 --> 03:13.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in an off-the-record session.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:16.329 --> 03:21.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On a personal
note, president-elect
Trump said Sunday that he will
move into the

03:21.234 --> 03:26.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House come January, but
that his wife
and young son will wait for the
school year

03:26.206 --> 03:29.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to finish in New York before
joining him.

03:29.209 --> 03:34.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Several
cities are
on edge after a series of
attacks on police.

03:34.581 --> 03:39.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In San Antonio, Texas,
authorities hunted
a man who ambushed an officer in
his cruiser

03:39.953 --> 03:41.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Sunday.

03:41.455 --> 03:45.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The suspect visited police
headquarters just
hours before the shooting.

03:45.492 --> 03:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The police chief says it's "the
worst nightmare"
for the members of his force.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM MCMANUS, San Antonio
Police Chief:
Absolutely feel targeted.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I feel we were targeted.

03:54.101 --> 03:57.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that the uniform was the
target.

03:57.504 --> 04:02.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And anyone who happened -- the
first person
who happened along was the
person that he

04:02.542 --> 04:04.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
targeted.

04:04.377 --> 04:07.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another officer
in Saint Louis
was critically wounded in a
similar attack.

04:07.614 --> 04:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And two more officers were shot
and wounded
in Missouri and Florida.

04:11.418 --> 04:17.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overall, the National Law
Enforcement Memorial
Fund reports that 60 officers
have died by

04:17.190 --> 04:19.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gunfire this year.

04:19.126 --> 04:22.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's up 67 percent from 2015.

04:22.996 --> 04:27.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been more trouble near a
North Dakota
camp where people are protesting
the Dakota

04:27.467 --> 04:29.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Access oil pipeline.

04:29.736 --> 04:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, police used tear gas
and water
cannon in subfreezing weather
when a crowd

04:35.142 --> 04:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tried to cross a blocked bridge.

04:37.811 --> 04:41.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say protesters threw
rocks and burning
logs.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Protesters gathered again today.

04:43.216 --> 04:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say the pipeline will
threaten water
supplies and desecrate land
sacred to the

04:48.088 --> 04:50.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Standing Rock Sioux.

04:50.423 --> 04:55.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The death toll has hit 146 after
Sunday's
train disaster in Northern
India.

04:55.428 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 220 people were
injured.

04:58.098 --> 05:03.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It happened in a village
southeast of New
Delhi as most of the train's
passengers were

05:03.270 --> 05:05.105 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
asleep.

05:05.138 --> 05:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the rescue effort was
officially called
off, and cranes and bulldozers
cleared the

05:09.476 --> 05:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mangled wreckage from the
tracks.

05:12.112 --> 05:15.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Investigators are now trying to
determine
what caused the accident.

05:15.282 --> 05:21.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, no respite today in
the fierce new
bombing of rebel-held Eastern
Aleppo.

05:21.555 --> 05:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dan Rivers of Independent
Television News
reports that hospitals are now
high on the

05:26.860 --> 05:28.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hit list.

05:28.795 --> 05:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: After a four-week
pause the bombing
of Aleppo has resumed and this
last week has

05:35.135 --> 05:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been more intense than ever.

05:37.938 --> 05:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, once again, there
were repeated
attacks, fear and confusion in
the east of

05:47.981 --> 05:53.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, once again, there
were repeated
attacks, fear and confusion in
the east of

05:53.420 --> 05:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this city, the streets cloaked
in a manmade
cloud into which rescuers ran,
unable to make

05:59.926 --> 06:05.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out anything.

06:05.198 --> 06:11.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hospitals were apparently
frequently the target,
the dust permeating every ward
and every bed,

06:11.838 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaving the dwindling number of
doctors dazed
in the horror.

06:16.977 --> 06:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, not a single major
trauma facility
is left open in Eastern Aleppo.

06:22.782 --> 06:27.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Friday, CCTV captured an
airstrike on a
pediatric hospital.

06:27.754 --> 06:32.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From multiple angles, it shows
the moment
a busy reception room was
suddenly plunged

06:32.225 --> 06:37.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into darkness as patients and
staff then tried
to escape.

06:37.130 --> 06:42.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a ward in Aleppo's M1
Hospital last
Tuesday full of injured
children.

06:42.969 --> 06:47.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is same ward today
after it was hit
by an airstrike.

06:47.040 --> 06:53.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: You can see there is big
remains all
apparent, all the rooms smashed.

06:53.246 --> 06:59.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: In a city where it
seems there
is nothing left to bomb, the
planes are still

06:59.085 --> 07:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finding targets, a concerted
effort to deny
people the most basic medical
care when they

07:05.225 --> 07:07.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have lost everything else.

07:07.093 --> 07:12.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Turkey's
President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan urged the U.S. today to
set up a no-fly

07:12.265 --> 07:14.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
zone over Syria.

07:14.534 --> 07:19.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Afghanistan, the Islamic
State group has
claimed a suicide bombing that
rocked a Shiite

07:19.673 --> 07:21.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mosque in Kabul today.

07:21.241 --> 07:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At least 32 people died and
scores more were
injured.

07:25.211 --> 07:28.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attacker struck as a large
crowd of worshipers
had gathered.

07:28.648 --> 07:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the second major attack on
the country's
minority Shiites in just over a
month.

07:34.688 --> 07:40.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pope Francis is extending a
policy that lets
rank-and-file Catholic priests
offer forgiveness

07:40.327 --> 07:41.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for abortions.

07:41.728 --> 07:46.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will continue beyond the Holy
Year of Mercy,
which ended Sunday.

07:46.166 --> 07:51.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A papal letter today says
abortion remains
a -- quote -- "grave sin" under
Roman Catholic

07:51.905 --> 07:53.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doctrine.

07:53.673 --> 07:58.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he goes on to say: "There is
no sin that
God's mercy cannot reach and
wipe away."

07:58.244 --> 08:01.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A top Vatican official says
that's all-encompassing.

08:01.781 --> 08:07.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARCHBISHOP RINO FISICHELLA,
Vatican (through
translator): Technically,
everyone who is

08:07.320 --> 08:12.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involved in an abortion, that is
the woman,
nurses, the doctor, whoever
supports this

08:12.058 --> 08:14.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
matter, the sin of abortion
involves all.

08:14.728 --> 08:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thus, the pardon of the sin of
abortion equally
covers everyone, involves
everyone who has

08:19.366 --> 08:21.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
played a part in this sin.

08:21.234 --> 08:26.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Until last year,
only a bishop
could grant absolution for
abortion or allow

08:26.773 --> 08:29.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
priests to do so.

08:29.042 --> 08:33.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama has reaffirmed
his backing
of the Trans-Pacific trade deal
as it faces

08:33.580 --> 08:35.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an uncertain future.

08:35.815 --> 08:39.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump has called
it a job
killer and campaigned on a
promise to pull

08:39.919 --> 08:41.554 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of it.

08:41.588 --> 08:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president spoke Sunday
evening in Lima,
Peru, as an Asia-Pacific summit
ended.

08:46.559 --> 08:51.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said retreating from global
trade is not
the answer, and other leaders
vowed to push

08:51.464 --> 08:53.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ahead.

08:53.533 --> 08:59.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some 500 workers are going on
strike at Chicago's
O'Hare Airport, but not until
after Thanksgiving.

08:59.806 --> 09:05.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their union announced today the
walkout will
start on November 29 to avoid
messing up travelers'

09:05.745 --> 09:07.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
holiday plans.

09:07.113 --> 09:11.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The workers are looking for
union rights and
a $15-an-hour wage.

09:11.951 --> 09:17.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're mainly baggage handlers,
cabin cleaners,
janitors and wheelchair
attendants.

09:17.323 --> 09:23.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, oil prices
surged amid
talk that OPEC will cut output,
and that,

09:23.296 --> 09:27.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in turn, sent all of the major
stock indexes
to record highs.

09:27.567 --> 09:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 88
points to close at 18956.

09:32.372 --> 09:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 47, and the S&amp;P
500 added
16.

09:38.144 --> 09:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
outlining
priorities on the Trump agenda;
what's next

09:44.117 --> 09:50.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Senator Bernie Sanders under
a Trump presidency;
our regular Monday duo on the
week ahead in

09:50.557 --> 10:02.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
politics; and much more.

10:02.702 --> 10:07.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a closer look at what we
know at this
moment about the Trump
transition with two

10:07.474 --> 10:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporters following the process,
Jennifer
Jacobs, who is with Bloomberg
Politics, and

10:12.879 --> 10:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Schmidt of The New York
Times.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the "NewsHour."

10:17.517 --> 10:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jennifer, let me start with you.

10:19.319 --> 10:24.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been a parade of people
over the weekend
to the golf club in New Jersey,
today back

10:24.791 --> 10:26.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at Trump Tower.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Whom are we seeing?

10:27.660 --> 10:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is every one of these people a
serious contender?

10:29.863 --> 10:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER JACOBS, Bloomberg
Politics: Probably
not every single one, but the
Trump aides

10:33.800 --> 10:38.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have told me that they are
really bringing
forward as many people of
different perspectives

10:38.304 --> 10:40.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as possible.

10:40.106 --> 10:42.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're very serious about
getting people
with a range of different
conservative views

10:42.675 --> 10:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in front of Mr. Trump so that he
has all these
options to pursue, instead of
maybe just turning

10:48.147 --> 10:51.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to his inner circle of people
who were with
him during the campaign, those
people who

10:51.417 --> 10:52.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are probably part of his comfort
zone.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They wanted to bring in some
fresh perspective.

10:54.954 --> 11:00.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you have got everybody from
Michelle Rhee,
who is Asian, coming in for
possible Education,

11:01.027 --> 11:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to -- he's a variety of various
people coming
in, men, women, black, white.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know that that's part of
their strategy
is to really to present him a
diverse set

11:11.538 --> 11:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of people to choose from.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Schmidt,
what would
you add to that?

11:14.607 --> 11:19.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are we to make of this
steady stream
of people from diverse
backgrounds and frankly

11:19.979 --> 11:21.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from both parties?

11:21.748 --> 11:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT, The New York
Times: Well,
I had the chance this weekend to
be at the

11:24.217 --> 11:27.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country club in New Jersey where
Mr. Trump
was.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was a pretty cold event
as we stood
outside.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he really did turn it into a
spectacle.

11:32.492 --> 11:37.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would bring folks in, greet
them, take
pictures with them in front of
an American

11:37.163 --> 11:42.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flag, address the press, go
inside, interview
them, come outside, see them
away, talk to

11:42.902 --> 11:43.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the press.

11:43.903 --> 11:45.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This went on all weekend.

11:45.071 --> 11:47.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it did have sort of an
"Apprentice" feel
to it.

11:47.140 --> 11:51.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what do you
mean by that,
because "Apprentice" is a
reality television

11:51.477 --> 11:52.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show.

11:52.478 --> 11:53.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is for real.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's the president-elect.

11:55.281 --> 11:58.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does your reporting tell you
that most of
these people are under serious
consideration?

11:58.818 --> 12:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Well, look, he
has got 4,000
positions to fill and he's got a
lot of stuff

12:03.156 --> 12:04.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to learn.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It does seem like there is a lot
of policy
that he doesn't understand and
he really wants

12:07.427 --> 12:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get different people in front
of him.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least that's what their aides
say.

12:11.097 --> 12:15.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But previous presidents haven't
had a such
a public spectacle for the way
that they have

12:15.068 --> 12:16.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
interviewed people.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
An SUV would drive up.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It would drop Mitt Romney off.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney would walk up.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There would be a photo-op.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was just a real sort of
scene.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Obviously, unlike "The
Apprentice," we're
not in the room.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But at the same time, it was
kind of entertaining.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Mr. Trump would answer
questions.

12:30.550 --> 12:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He answered about "SNL," about
"Hamilton,"
about whether he was concerned
about Rudy

12:35.221 --> 12:37.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Giuliani's finances and his
business dealings.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He said he wasn't.

12:39.826 --> 12:43.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, although it was really cold,
it sort of
-- it went on and on.

12:43.229 --> 12:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jennifer, we're
trying to understand
how much of this is a learning
process, as

12:47.800 --> 12:53.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael was just referring to,
and how much
of it is maybe to throw us off
either in the

12:53.072 --> 12:54.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
public, in the media?

12:54.674 --> 12:59.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because, as you say, it's
diverse, it's deliberately
diverse.

12:59.412 --> 13:02.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're trying to sort out
here what is
real and what isn't.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER JACOBS: Some people
called it speed
dating.

13:04.350 --> 13:08.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then Kellyanne Conway, one
of his strategists
today, said that he has a
voracious appetite

13:08.988 --> 13:11.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get more and more people in
to see him.

13:11.057 --> 13:14.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He just -- it's like his craving
for his rallies.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's got that same appetite now.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants more and more meetings
so that he
can hear from people.

13:18.898 --> 13:21.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's also so that he can hear
ideas.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are very smart people,
very plugged-in
people.

13:23.870 --> 13:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now is his opportunity to
grill them,
to get various counsel and
various ideas for

13:29.542 --> 13:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his administration that he can
maybe steal
or use.

13:33.613 --> 13:36.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's partly about vetting people
and it's
partly just about tapping ideas.

13:36.916 --> 13:40.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in fact,
Michael Schmidt,
we saw -- I guess we learned
this today -- the

13:40.319 --> 13:48.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kansas secretary of state, Kris
Kobach, who
was interviewed, went to New
Jersey to the

13:48.795 --> 13:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
golf club, was carrying a sheath
of papers
under his arm, and I guess the
television

13:53.332 --> 13:58.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- we have got some images of it
here -- television
cameras that were there zoomed
in.

13:58.638 --> 14:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We think Mr. Kobach is being
vetted for secretary
of homeland security.

14:03.976 --> 14:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was some language in there
about doing
away with all Syrian immigrants.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Yes.

14:09.782 --> 14:13.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, the language in there was
some pretty
conservative views on sort of
homeland security

14:13.653 --> 14:18.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues and really tracking
foreigners in the
country sort of in ways that we
did in years

14:18.591 --> 14:20.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after September 11.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what that sort of shows us
and what we
have seen so far from Mr. Trump
is that he's

14:23.763 --> 14:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really following what he said on
the campaign
trail.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has not tacked to the middle.

14:28.334 --> 14:34.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has stayed very sort of far
to the right,
tough on these national security
issues, relying

14:34.173 --> 14:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on someone like Mike Flynn, who
has been harshly
critical of the Muslim religion,
and even,

14:40.179 --> 14:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, talking to a lot of
generals, talking
to a lot of guys in uniform, and
taking Mike

14:45.017 --> 14:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pompeo to run the CIA, you know,
somebody
who has gone along with the
really harsh tactics

14:51.424 --> 14:53.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the CIA used in the past
few years.

14:53.793 --> 14:57.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the Trump
transition folks
have just in the last few
minutes released

14:57.530 --> 15:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this video of Mr. Trump speaking
about his
priorities.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about two-and-a-half
minutes long and
we have got about a minute we
want to share

15:04.971 --> 15:06.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with all of you.

15:06.839 --> 15:11.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: On trade,
I am going to issue a
notification of intent

15:11.344 --> 15:17.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to withdraw from the
Trans-Pacific Partnership,
a potential disaster for our
country.

15:17.049 --> 15:22.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, we will negotiate fair
bilateral
trade deals that bring jobs and
industry back

15:22.421 --> 15:24.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
onto American shores.

15:24.357 --> 15:30.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On energy, I will cancel
job-killing restrictions
on the production of American
energy, including

15:30.563 --> 15:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shale energy and clean coal,
creating many
millions of high-paying jobs.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what we want.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what we have been waiting
for.

15:39.972 --> 15:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On regulation, I will formulate
a role which
says that, for every one new
regulation, two

15:45.511 --> 15:49.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
old regulations must be
eliminated.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So important.

15:51.284 --> 15:55.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On national security, I will ask
the Department
of Defense and the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs

15:55.755 --> 16:01.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Staff to develop a
comprehensive plan to
protect America's vital
infrastructure from

16:01.194 --> 16:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cyber-attacks and all other form
of attacks.

16:04.831 --> 16:08.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Jennifer
Jacobs, you have
been covering Donald Trump for a
while.

16:08.434 --> 16:09.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How much of this is new?

16:09.769 --> 16:12.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does this flesh out what he has
been saying
before?

16:12.071 --> 16:13.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER JACOBS: No.

16:13.906 --> 16:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were -- remember his
Gettysburg speech,
his big Gettysburg address where
he laid out

16:17.977 --> 16:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what he would do in the first
100 days?

16:19.445 --> 16:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he had 28 points there that
he pledged
to do.

16:21.314 --> 16:25.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He called his contract with the
American people
and he said, I will do all these
28 of these

16:25.585 --> 16:26.552 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a handful of those 28
things.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Michael
Schmidt, what are
we to make of this?

16:30.323 --> 16:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are these the first things he's
going to do?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you read that?

16:34.427 --> 16:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: Well, even
though he lost
the general popular vote by 1.7
million voters,

16:40.132 --> 16:43.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he clearly thinks he has a
mandate, and he's
clearly going to go after the
issues that

16:43.870 --> 16:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he thinks are important and that
he campaigned
on and that his hard-core base
really wants.

16:49.876 --> 16:53.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To some members of the
Republican Party towards
the center, they're really not
going to like

16:53.913 --> 16:55.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

16:55.715 --> 16:59.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And certainly Democrats, I can't
see Chuck
Schumer going along with a lot
of things that

16:59.252 --> 17:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Trump laid out in that
video.

17:00.987 --> 17:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you could see some real
gridlock because,
in the Senate, Mr. Schumer has a
way with

17:04.991 --> 17:07.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the filibuster of really
stopping some things.

17:07.526 --> 17:11.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it looks like he's going to
be sort of
heading in the direction of his
campaign.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other thing I
want to ask
the two of you about is
questions, concerns

17:14.600 --> 17:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have been raised about
Donald Trump meeting
in recent days with
businesspeople he's doing

17:19.906 --> 17:20.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
business with.

17:20.907 --> 17:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He met with a group of Japanese
businessmen.

17:24.543 --> 17:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's met with -- and we're
learning today
his new Washington hotel
soliciting business

17:31.684 --> 17:33.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from foreign diplomats.

17:33.819 --> 17:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jennifer, is the transition team
answering
questions about this?

17:38.491 --> 17:39.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are they saying?

17:39.492 --> 17:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JENNIFER JACOBS: Not really.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard reports too about
an envoy from
the Philippines being in on
meetings -- or

17:44.664 --> 17:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least in the room as he was
discussing
who he would choose for various
Cabinet posts.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there does seem to be some
strange conflicts
of interests here.

17:51.837 --> 17:56.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Kellyanne Conway, again, one
of his strategists,
just assures us that he has the
best interests

17:56.542 --> 18:01.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Americans at heart and we
just need to
trust that he will do what he
says, and that

18:01.814 --> 18:04.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to follow through on these
pledges that
he laid out on the campaign
trail and that

18:04.984 --> 18:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's not going to try to enrich
himself by
passing legislation that is
specifically meant

18:08.487 --> 18:09.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to line his own pockets.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just about trust.

18:11.457 --> 18:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Schmidt,
just quickly,
finally, what are you learning
about that?

18:15.227 --> 18:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SCHMIDT: There is some
notion out
there that he could put all this
in a blind

18:19.365 --> 18:21.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trust.

18:21.167 --> 18:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the same time, his
businesses, and
his hotels and his golf courses
are everywhere.

18:24.003 --> 18:26.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And sort of a blind trust, it is
not really
that blind.

18:26.839 --> 18:31.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, he knows where these
things are
and foreign leaders know that as
well.

18:31.277 --> 18:35.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is a real movement out
there for
him to divest of everything that
he owns.

18:35.214 --> 18:40.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that would take a very long
time and
have a considerable impact on
his bottom line.

18:40.519 --> 18:44.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But people say, for there
absolutely to be
no conflict, he would have to do
that, so

18:44.123 --> 18:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that would be a huge step.

18:45.691 --> 18:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Schmidt,
Jennifer Jacobs,
we thank you both.

18:55.735 --> 19:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Schmidt,
Jennifer Jacobs,
we thank you both.

19:03.642 --> 19:08.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This weekend, Jeffrey Brown sat
down with
Senator Bernie Sanders at the
Miami Book Fair

19:08.214 --> 19:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk about his new book, "Our
Revolution,"
to discuss the presidential
election, and

19:13.319 --> 19:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get his take on the future of
American
politics.

19:16.389 --> 19:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff began by asking the senator
why he thought
Donald Trump's message attracted
so many voters.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont: I
think he understood
that there are many millions of
people in

19:26.899 --> 19:29.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this country, the working middle
class, who
are really hurting.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are in pain.

19:31.604 --> 19:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are working longer hours
for lower wages,
can't afford child care, scared
to death of

19:36.208 --> 19:38.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
retirement because they have no
money in the
bank.

19:38.778 --> 19:42.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have seen decent-paying
jobs leave their
community, go to China and
Mexico.

19:42.615 --> 19:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said: I, Donald Trump,
yes, I am going
to take on the entire
establishment.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm going to take on the
political establishment.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I am going to take on the
economic establishment.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to take on the media
establishment.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think a lot of people
responded positively
to that message.

19:57.396 --> 20:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I was telling you
I was in
Iowa, North Carolina seeing a
lot of the things

20:02.301 --> 20:06.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I think you were seeing of
people around
the country and the desperate
shape that they

20:06.238 --> 20:07.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
were in.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But why then would Donald Trump
become that
champion?

20:10.643 --> 20:12.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:12.144 --> 20:15.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Now, how many
hours do we
have to discuss that issue?

20:15.314 --> 20:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the question that needs a
lot of discussion.

20:16.982 --> 20:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it speaks to a large
degree to
the failure of the Democratic
Party.

20:20.753 --> 20:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The failure?

20:21.754 --> 20:23.289 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:23.322 --> 20:25.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, which is
something I'm
trying to deal with right now.

20:25.357 --> 20:30.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democratic Party has been
very strong
in a lot of areas, in fighting
to make our

20:30.529 --> 20:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country a less discriminatory
country.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is enormously
important.

20:35.468 --> 20:39.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, on that issue,
there cannot
be any compromise.

20:39.905 --> 20:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's language has been
atrocious, his behavior
toward women.

20:46.312 --> 20:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We cannot go back to a racist,
sexist, homophobic,
Islamophobic type of society.

20:54.520 --> 21:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on economic issues, I think
there are
many people in the working class
who say,

21:00.059 --> 21:01.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know what?

21:01.827 --> 21:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, maybe we are better off
than we were
eight years ago, but I am still
working two

21:05.498 --> 21:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or three jobs, my kid can't
afford to go to
college, I can't afford child
care, my real

21:10.169 --> 21:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wages have been going down for
40 years.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The middle class is shrinking.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who's standing up for me?

21:15.207 --> 21:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Democratic Party there for
me?

21:17.576 --> 21:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are they going to take on Wall
Street?

21:18.911 --> 21:21.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they going to take on the
drug companies
that rip me off?

21:21.881 --> 21:23.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the perception was, no, they
will not.

21:23.682 --> 21:27.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But when you look
at the election,
and you think about those issues
as drivers

21:27.253 --> 21:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the election, did you feel --
do you feel
that you could have won if it
was you against

21:31.724 --> 21:32.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump?

21:32.725 --> 21:34.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:34.226 --> 21:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: I have been
asked that question
about 48 million times.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I know, so make
it 48 million,
plus one.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: There you go.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the answer is, who knows?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think what we can say
is that the
polling when I was running
against Secretary

21:42.701 --> 21:46.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton during the process,
primary process,
had me doing better against
Trump.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some recent polls suggest
that I would
have won.

21:49.275 --> 21:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, you don't know
what a three-
or four-month campaign is about.

21:52.378 --> 21:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I will say, I would very
much have loved
the opportunity.

21:58.517 --> 22:03.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What's your
reaction to his
first nominations of Jeff
Sessions as attorney

22:03.289 --> 22:04.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
general, General Flynn?

22:04.290 --> 22:05.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: It's not good.

22:06.292 --> 22:07.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not good.

22:07.293 --> 22:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Not good, and not surprising,
but not good.

22:09.128 --> 22:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, at best, we would have
hoped that he
would be a center-right
president.

22:15.201 --> 22:20.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But at least his initial
appointments are
moving very, very far to the
right.

22:20.072 --> 22:23.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Bannon comes from the
extreme right in
American politics.

22:24.009 --> 22:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not comfortable at all
that a person
with this politics, with these
beliefs is

22:31.183 --> 22:34.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sitting right next to the
president as his
adviser.

22:35.020 --> 22:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I think, before
election night,
most people thought it would be
the Republican

22:39.858 --> 22:44.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party in disarray trying to
figure what's
next for it.

22:44.096 --> 22:49.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Democrats have lost not only
the presidency,
but -- and not only in
Washington, right,

22:49.068 --> 22:50.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but throughout the country.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.036 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:51.070 --> 22:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: That's right.

22:52.972 --> 22:57.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bottom line, Jeffrey, to me
is, you cannot
be a party which takes money
from Wall Street,

22:57.710 --> 23:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is not strong on the
pharmaceutical
industry, which is ripping us
off every day,

23:04.250 --> 23:09.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is not strong on health
care in taking
on the insurance companies,
which has not

23:09.989 --> 23:17.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shown a desire to stand up and
fight the economic
establishment, and then tell
working families

23:17.263 --> 23:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that you are on their side.

23:18.464 --> 23:19.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People see through that.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think the Democratic Party
has got to
make fundamental choices.

23:22.268 --> 23:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It goes back to the old Woody
Guthrie song.

23:25.638 --> 23:27.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Which side are you on?

23:27.506 --> 23:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe the Democratic
Party has got
to be firmly on the side of
working families,

23:32.845 --> 23:37.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
taking on the big money
interests, who today,
to a very significant degree,
control our

23:37.216 --> 23:38.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economic and political life.

23:39.018 --> 23:42.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the immediate
term, though,
what should be the stance
vis-a-vis Donald

23:42.821 --> 23:44.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump?

23:44.189 --> 23:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have said that you can work
with him in
some areas, perhaps.

23:46.191 --> 23:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you have also said you're
ready just to
fight against him.

23:49.795 --> 23:51.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:51.297 --> 23:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Well, of course
we're going
to be fighting against him.

23:53.065 --> 23:57.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, on the issue of
climate change,
Donald Trump believes that
climate change

23:57.836 --> 23:59.338 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a hoax.

23:59.371 --> 24:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this is not just a stupid
expression,
but it is incredibly dangerous.

24:06.178 --> 24:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other area where there is no
compromise
is on bigotry.

24:09.815 --> 24:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have struggled too much, too
long as a
country trying to overcome
racism and sexism

24:15.054 --> 24:16.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and homophobia.

24:16.188 --> 24:19.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We cannot go back to a more
discriminatory
society.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, those are issues where there
is no compromise.

24:21.627 --> 24:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, as somebody
who has talked
my entire political life about a
disastrous

24:25.964 --> 24:31.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trade policy, if Mr. Trump wants
to work with
us to make sure that trade works
for the American

24:31.870 --> 24:35.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
worker, not just CEOs of
corporate America,
you have got a partner, partner.

24:35.107 --> 24:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you say
now to protesters
who are in the street, including
some saying,

24:39.845 --> 24:41.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"Not my president"?

24:41.146 --> 24:42.915 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:42.948 --> 24:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Well, we can say
what we want
to say, but he is going to be
inaugurated.

24:46.185 --> 24:52.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we have to be,
going to the streets,
protesting in any and every way,
makes sense.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we need a strategy.

24:54.259 --> 24:58.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the goal is to bring
millions of people
together.

24:58.630 --> 25:04.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the end of the day, if
millions of people
come together and say, we are
not going to

25:04.870 --> 25:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a xenophobic society, we are
not going
to be throwing millions of
Latinos out of

25:09.475 --> 25:14.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this country, we are not going
to be a racist
society, we're not going to be a
sexist society,

25:14.546 --> 25:16.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we will prevail.

25:16.281 --> 25:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But our job is not just to raise
our voices.

25:20.386 --> 25:21.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And that's fine.

25:21.920 --> 25:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is to bring millions of
people together
around a progressive agenda.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But he won.

25:26.592 --> 25:29.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, he comes in saying, "I won.

25:29.828 --> 25:32.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here's what I said I was going
to do.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to go ahead and do
it."

25:33.732 --> 25:35.534 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:35.567 --> 25:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Well, he won,
and so do 100
of us who are in the United
States Senate.

25:38.771 --> 25:39.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We also won elections.

25:39.772 --> 25:42.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so do 435 people in the
House.

25:42.508 --> 25:45.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so do governors all over
this country.

25:45.043 --> 25:48.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How can you still
feel that
you have the vast number of -- a
vast majority

25:48.680 --> 25:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Americans with you if Donald
Trump won
the election?

25:51.717 --> 25:53.552 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:53.585 --> 25:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Well, first of
all, as you
know, Hillary Clinton got a
million-and-a-half

25:55.454 --> 25:57.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more votes than Donald Trump.

25:57.856 --> 26:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second of all, 46 percent of the
American
people didn't vote.

26:00.659 --> 26:05.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thirdly, on every issue that I
mentioned,
whether it's raising the minimum
wage, pay

26:05.230 --> 26:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
equity, making public colleges
and universities
tuition-free, dealing with
climate change,

26:09.868 --> 26:15.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yes, on all of those issues and
far more,
the majority of American people
are with us,

26:15.641 --> 26:17.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
absolutely.

26:17.042 --> 26:19.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you
personally, what is
your role going forward?

26:19.545 --> 26:24.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you see yourself as the de
facto leader
of this opposition, or one of
them?

26:24.416 --> 26:26.218 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: I am going to
work with people
who hold similar views to me
inside Congress,

26:29.621 --> 26:36.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outside of Congress to make
certain that we
come together to stop Trump from
doing some

26:36.328 --> 26:40.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the very ugly things that he
has talked
about doing.

26:40.232 --> 26:44.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when he is prepared to work
with us -- and
we can work together on raising
the minimum

26:44.603 --> 26:50.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
wage, taking on the drug
companies, changing
our trade policies, rebuilding
the infrastructure.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump talked about taking on
Wall Street.

26:52.544 --> 26:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, we are going to hold him
accountable.

26:54.480 --> 26:58.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says he wants to reestablish
-- bring forth
Glass-Steagall legislation.

26:58.383 --> 26:59.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a good thing.

26:59.384 --> 27:00.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Will he do it?

27:00.385 --> 27:01.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who knows.

27:01.753 --> 27:05.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we are going to -- we have a
list of everything
that he said.

27:05.958 --> 27:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we going to bring forth
legislation around
those issues and say, Mr. Trump,
this is what

27:10.562 --> 27:12.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you promised the American
people.

27:12.197 --> 27:13.398 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Keep your word.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is "Our
Revolution."

27:15.467 --> 27:16.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Bernie Sanders, thank
you very much.

27:16.935 --> 27:17.903 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:17.936 --> 27:19.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you for
having me.

27:19.771 --> 27:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow, we look
at the future
of the Democratic Party with
Ohio Congressman

27:22.608 --> 27:28.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tim Ryan, who is challenging
Nancy Pelosi
to be minority leader in the
House of Representatives.

27:28.514 --> 27:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can also watch many other
authors Jeff
talked to this week at the Miami
Book Fair.

27:33.051 --> 27:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You will find that at our Web
site, bookviewnow.org.

27:40.292 --> 27:54.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:54.606 --> 27:59.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Henry Kissinger's
view of foreign policy in the
age of Donald

27:59.645 --> 28:05.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump; and a female entrepreneur
finds success
in an unexpected business.

28:05.617 --> 28:09.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first, it's time for
Politics Monday.

28:09.087 --> 28:14.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined by Tamara Keith of
NPR and Amy
Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

28:14.993 --> 28:16.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Thank
you.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Thank
you.

28:19.131 --> 28:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we just a few
minutes ago
saw this video the Trump
transition team released,

28:22.501 --> 28:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
telling us what Donald Trump
plans to do in
the first -- in the early part
of his administration

28:27.406 --> 28:28.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after he's inaugurated.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He talked about trade.

28:30.375 --> 28:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He talked about energy and
investigating people
who abuse their visas, trying to
make sure

28:36.114 --> 28:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people aren't here taking jobs
away from Americans.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Amy, this is unusual, isn't it?

28:41.486 --> 28:45.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, the election is almost
two weeks ago.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has not had a news conference
yet.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's done some tweeting.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen him greeting people
coming to
Trump Tower, and now this.

28:51.830 --> 28:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And now a video,
where, obviously,
you cannot do questions and
answers.

28:55.067 --> 28:58.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The only thing he --
interestingly he said
in the video is the things he
was going to

28:58.337 --> 29:02.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do by executive order, not
things that he
would -- here is what I'm going
to work on

29:02.541 --> 29:04.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Congress in my first three
days.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here are the things that I'm
going to do as
president.

29:06.445 --> 29:12.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, each president has
come in with
the ability for executive orders
to roll back

29:12.384 --> 29:15.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the previous administration's
executive orders,
right, because they're not a
rule of law in

29:16.021 --> 29:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the same way as if they were
passed by Congress.

29:18.724 --> 29:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, to your other point
about this
being unusual, we have to stop
treating Donald

29:24.830 --> 29:29.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump like this is just a
traditional, normal,
political candidate who's now
going to be

29:29.601 --> 29:32.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a traditional, normal president.

29:32.104 --> 29:38.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that he did tweet out
this weekend,
get in something of a fight with
the cast

29:38.477 --> 29:42.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of "Hamilton," as well as the
cast of "Saturday
Night Live," this now as
president-elect,

29:42.914 --> 29:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just as a candidate, the
fact that he's
just using video, instead of
having an actual

29:47.085 --> 29:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
press conference, so the role
that Donald
Trump carved out as a candidate
is the same

29:52.991 --> 29:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
role that he's going to play as
president.

29:54.826 --> 29:58.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What does it tell
us, Tam,
about how he relates to the
public and to

29:58.764 --> 29:59.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the news media?

29:59.765 --> 30:00.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

30:00.866 --> 30:03.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he hasn't held a press
difference since
July.

30:03.201 --> 30:07.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This goes way, way, way back to
the campaign.

30:07.873 --> 30:14.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has not related to the
press or the
public in a traditional way
ever.

30:14.079 --> 30:23.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's had an incredible skill
at distracting,
at creating -- there was this
movie "Up" and

30:23.789 --> 30:27.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
there was a dog who gets
distracted, and,
squirrel, squirrel.

30:27.292 --> 30:29.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what happens.

30:29.094 --> 30:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time there is a story that
is not favorable
to him, like settling the Trump
University

30:35.333 --> 30:39.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lawsuit for $25 million,
suddenly, there is
a Twitter fight.

30:39.771 --> 30:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, he has skillfully
avoided sort
of the type of environment that
a press conference

30:45.477 --> 30:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creates, the environment where
you get asked
a question, and then somebody
else asks a

30:51.216 --> 30:55.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question, then somebody else
asks a question,
it builds on it, and you really
can't escape.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so there is nothing like a
press conference.

30:59.825 --> 31:04.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his transition team is
saying, well, you
know, don't tell him what's
traditional and

31:04.763 --> 31:06.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what is conventional.

31:06.331 --> 31:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is Donald Trump.

31:08.100 --> 31:11.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, Amy, a
million eyes
are on him, a million pairs of
reporters'

31:11.903 --> 31:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eyes and the public paying
attention here,
not knowing what's next.

31:15.974 --> 31:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's keeping us on the edge of
our seats.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And he loves doing
that.

31:18.844 --> 31:23.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, this is a candidate
who said, I
like being unpredictable.

31:23.415 --> 31:27.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a candidate who said,
you are going
to have to wait and see if I
accept the results

31:27.285 --> 31:29.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this election during the
debate.

31:29.588 --> 31:33.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this isn't surprising to me
at all that
he's continuing this as
president.

31:33.525 --> 31:38.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this is what we learned
during the
course of the campaign is that
just, every

31:38.263 --> 31:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day, we would come in and we
would say, well,
maybe now is the time that he's
going to pivot.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe now he's going to look
more like a traditional
candidate.

31:43.969 --> 31:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That just is not going to
happen.

31:46.204 --> 31:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so as he's parading these
people through,
you can argue that he's bringing
a lot of

31:51.276 --> 31:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different faces and voices, but
the people
that he's picked are the people
we should

31:54.846 --> 31:56.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be focusing on.

31:56.648 --> 32:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And right now the people that
he's chosen
in his administration are very
much out of

32:00.318 --> 32:08.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cloth, the Trump cloth, I
guess, that
he has -- you know, these are
his acolytes.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are not a team of rivals
that he's putting
together.

32:11.329 --> 32:14.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They support everything he stood
for in that
campaign.

32:14.132 --> 32:16.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are we to
make of these
choices so far?

32:16.368 --> 32:23.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, personnel is
policy, especially
in his case, because he doesn't
have really

32:23.141 --> 32:27.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well-defined policy positions
that he campaigned
on.

32:27.045 --> 32:30.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He doesn't have strong positions
on a lot
of things and he doesn't have
the government

32:30.916 --> 32:32.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

32:32.517 --> 32:39.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what we have so far are
people who
are very much of the Trump
party.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are not traditional
Republicans.

32:41.893 --> 32:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, he's met with people like
Mitt Romney
or General Mattis, people who
would be considered

32:46.565 --> 32:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more traditional, but he hasn't
picked them
yet.

32:49.501 --> 32:55.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, at this point, it's
really not clear
-- aside from who he has picked,
like a Steve

32:55.073 --> 32:57.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bannon or a Mike Pompeo.

32:57.642 --> 32:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jeff Sessions.

32:58.643 --> 32:59.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Jeff Sessions.

32:59.678 --> 33:00.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jeff Sessions for
attorney
general.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Exactly.

33:02.581 --> 33:06.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other than those names, we know
who he's taking
to, but we don't know who he's
actually listening

33:06.918 --> 33:08.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to or choosing.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it's giving
us -- these
names, though, Amy, have given
us something

33:11.623 --> 33:12.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to look at.

33:12.624 --> 33:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The names the he's
picked.

33:13.658 --> 33:14.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The names he's
picked.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeff Sessions has a record.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Bannon has
a private
sector record.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Certainly...

33:21.066 --> 33:23.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And it aligns with
the Donald
Trump that we saw on the
campaign trail.

33:23.602 --> 33:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their views and vision align
with what he
talked about on the campaign
trail.

33:27.405 --> 33:32.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of them were active for
him on the
campaign trail and as
surrogates.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, you're right.

33:34.045 --> 33:38.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you bring in a General
Mattis, who is very
well-respected both in the
traditional military

33:38.350 --> 33:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
establishment, as well as the
political establishment,
that's bringing in a new voice.

33:43.288 --> 33:49.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it's unclear whether he
wants to have
new voices giving him new advice
or he's just

33:49.761 --> 33:53.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more comfortable surrounded by
the kinds of
people that he has been
surrounded by for

33:53.064 --> 33:54.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the last year.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And so far, the
people he picked
were very loyal to him in the
campaign.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's rewarded that loyalty
by bringing
them into his administration.

34:00.272 --> 34:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he's talking
to people
like Mitt Romney, who the two
men didn't have

34:04.276 --> 34:05.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a single kind word.

34:05.610 --> 34:08.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, they were very tough on
each other
during the campaign.

34:08.647 --> 34:12.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now they're saying he's under
very serious
consideration to be secretary of
state.

34:12.884 --> 34:17.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And Tulsi Gabbard,
the congresswoman,
Democratic congresswoman from
Hawaii, who

34:17.222 --> 34:20.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
endorsed Bernie Sanders.

34:20.258 --> 34:23.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just a wide range of people
who he's
talking to.

34:23.862 --> 34:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just -- it's not clear
at this point
what philosophy is guiding
Trump's choices,

34:30.101 --> 34:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other than loyalty, thus far in
the picks
that he's made.

34:33.338 --> 34:36.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that -- Amy,
do we just
get used to this?

34:36.741 --> 34:37.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

34:37.742 --> 34:38.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:38.877 --> 34:40.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hanging on the
edge of our
seats?

34:40.245 --> 34:44.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, is that you
have to just
get used to all of this.

34:44.816 --> 34:47.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I think Tam said perfectly,
there is a
lot of distraction here.

34:48.019 --> 34:51.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what I'm trying to do is
spend all
of my time focused on what he's
actually done

34:52.023 --> 34:55.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and doing, as opposed to all the
other stuff
that is sort of floating out
there.

34:55.860 --> 35:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he picks a Tulsi Gabbard, a
General Mattis,
a Mitt Romney, then we are going
to have a

35:02.067 --> 35:05.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different conversation, because
we also know
that there is part of Donald
Trump that does

35:05.937 --> 35:10.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like to have internal tension
around him,
that he likes to have people
around him competing

35:10.175 --> 35:11.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for his attention.

35:11.710 --> 35:14.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we may see something like
that.

35:14.846 --> 35:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the team of rivals sort of
idea doesn't
seem to be something that Donald
Trump likes.

35:20.185 --> 35:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we need to
talk about
the Democrats, too.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We just heard from Bernie
Sanders.

35:24.489 --> 35:26.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And next Monday, that's what we
will talk
about.

35:26.925 --> 35:29.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

35:29.294 --> 35:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, thank
you.

35:35.567 --> 35:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

35:38.703 --> 35:41.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Thanks.

35:41.039 --> 35:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier this
year, we reported
on "Atlantic" magazine editor
Jeffrey Goldberg's

35:48.279 --> 35:50.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
article "The Obama Doctrine."

35:50.148 --> 35:55.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The lengthy piece gained
widespread attention,
including that of former
Secretary of State

35:55.653 --> 35:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Henry Kissinger, who quietly let
it be known
that he'd like to share some
thoughts of his

36:00.025 --> 36:02.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own about President Obama's
foreign policy.

36:02.594 --> 36:06.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, Jeffrey Goldberg and
Kissinger sat down
to talk.

36:06.898 --> 36:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a report on part of an
ongoing partnership
between the "NewsHour" and "The
Atlantic."

36:11.669 --> 36:15.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG, National
Correspondent,
"The Atlantic": He's still
really the most

36:15.740 --> 36:19.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
influential foreign policy
thinker in America
in a lot of ways.

36:19.611 --> 36:24.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, in my experience with
him, there's
always something to learn, even
at the age

36:24.282 --> 36:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of 93, maybe especially at the
age of 93.

36:26.651 --> 36:28.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's always something to
learn from him.

36:28.286 --> 36:32.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we wound up spending
hours talking
about not just the Obama
doctrine.

36:32.223 --> 36:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked about the order of the
world currently,
and we talked a lot about the
election.

36:38.363 --> 36:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He, like a lot of people,
thought Hillary
Clinton was going to win.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We talked about both candidates.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And, well, here we are.

36:44.502 --> 36:47.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the news
right now is the
election of Donald Trump, and
we're going

36:47.472 --> 36:48.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to talk about that.

36:49.007 --> 36:53.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's go back to how your
conversation
with Henry Kissinger came about.

36:53.545 --> 36:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does he think about the
legacy of Barack
Obama's foreign policy?

36:58.116 --> 37:02.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: He thinks that
the president
is too passive in his approach
to foreign

37:02.053 --> 37:06.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy, that the American
president has a
responsibility to make more
order in the world,

37:06.491 --> 37:10.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially as it relates to the
other great
powers, Russia and China in
particular.

37:10.595 --> 37:16.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He also thinks that the
president is too burdened
by the alleged sins of the past
-- Kissinger

37:16.167 --> 37:20.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would think of them more as
alleged sins -- of
American behavior during the
Cold War in various

37:20.638 --> 37:23.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
places, including Vietnam and
Cambodia.

37:23.308 --> 37:29.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, mainly, it has to do with a
passivity
that he sees in the present, a
lack of strategic

37:29.581 --> 37:31.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thinking, a lack of assertion.

37:31.416 --> 37:37.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, the president,
when I was
interviewing him on these
subjects, Kissinger

37:37.055 --> 37:41.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was almost sort of a specter in
the room at
various points, because the
president would

37:41.359 --> 37:46.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk about the red line in
Syria, for instance,
and talk about how one of the
worst reasons

37:46.131 --> 37:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to bomb someone is to prove that
you're willing
to bomb someone.

37:48.967 --> 37:55.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I felt as if he were
addressing Henry
Kissinger and Kissinger's role
in Cambodia,

37:55.974 --> 38:00.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
using bombing to enhance
American credibility
at the negotiating table.

38:00.478 --> 38:05.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I found -- it was a totally
fascinating
process for me, because I was
moderating,

38:05.950 --> 38:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
non-chronologically, an argument
between President
Obama and the most important and
most controversial

38:13.224 --> 38:16.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foreign policy statesman of the
modern era.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so -- and so there was that
piece.

38:18.663 --> 38:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other piece is that Obama,
in some ways,
resembles Henry Kissinger.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kissinger recognizes this to
some degree.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the president recognizes
it to some
degree.

38:28.173 --> 38:34.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Neither man particularly
obsesses about human
rights as a key issue in the way
America organizes

38:35.013 --> 38:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its relationship with other
countries.

38:36.814 --> 38:40.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But when it comes
to Cambodia
and the bombing and during the
Vietnam War

38:40.652 --> 38:43.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and connecting that to what's
happening...

38:43.555 --> 38:45.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: And Syria,
yes.

38:45.356 --> 38:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... right now in
Syria, Kissinger
is still defending the decisions
that were

38:48.826 --> 38:53.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made during the early part of
the Nixon administration
in the Vietnam War.

38:53.865 --> 38:54.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't think he will stop
defending them.

38:56.801 --> 39:03.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He feels as if his
decision-making is misunderstood
in the country, and he wants to
make his point.

39:03.408 --> 39:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the interesting thing, if I
may, is, on
Syria, he noted to me that John
Kerry, the

39:10.949 --> 39:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary of state, guy who had
-- who has
the job that Henry Kissinger
had, who started

39:16.254 --> 39:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his public career as a Vietnam
protester,
had been arguing to the
president that we

39:21.626 --> 39:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to bomb the Assad regime,
in order to
focus their attention on the
necessity of

39:28.099 --> 39:29.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
negotiation.

39:30.001 --> 39:34.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you see these very
interesting echoes
throughout history, these
unsolvable problems,

39:34.639 --> 39:37.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these challenges that are in
front of policy-makers.

39:37.642 --> 39:42.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a feeling that John Kerry
and Barack
Obama today have slightly more
understanding

39:42.614 --> 39:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the decisions that Nixon and
Kissinger
made in Vietnam.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They might not agree with them,
but they have
a little bit more understanding.

39:48.720 --> 39:53.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other point
that you make
where you see some connection
between Kissinger

39:53.524 --> 39:57.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Obama is the fact that human
rights is
not at the top of their list of
priorities.

39:57.762 --> 39:59.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right.

39:59.163 --> 40:01.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One wouldn't
expect that to
be the case, would you?

40:01.566 --> 40:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: In Obama's
case.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Obama's case.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, that's
one of the
interesting things.

40:05.670 --> 40:13.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, hope and change is limited
to within
American borders in a lot of
cases.

40:13.444 --> 40:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is -- this is -- you know, I
don't think
that President Obama would
appreciate being

40:17.448 --> 40:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called a neo-Henry Kissinger,
but Obama's
view is: I, as president, have
to manage my

40:23.888 --> 40:28.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationship with China, and me
spending a
lot of time lecturing them, and
"punishing

40:28.126 --> 40:31.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them" -- quote, unquote -- for
their human
rights violations, that's not
going to advance

40:31.195 --> 40:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my immediate and long-term
national security
interests and economic
interests.

40:36.200 --> 40:40.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in fact, you
spent a good
bit of time with Henry Kissinger
talking about

40:40.638 --> 40:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama's approach to
China, what
is right about it and what
Kissinger finds

40:46.244 --> 40:47.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
falls short.

40:47.245 --> 40:49.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right.

40:49.080 --> 40:51.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, I asked him what
grade he gives
Obama for managing the China
portfolio, and

40:51.215 --> 40:52.283 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he said B-plus.

40:52.317 --> 40:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I said, that's a pretty high
grade.

40:54.752 --> 40:56.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not a bad grade.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, yes, it's a B-plus
on tactics.

40:58.990 --> 41:03.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's lower probably on strategy,
on thinking
through strategy.

41:03.127 --> 41:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kissinger's focus in global
affairs has always
been, what are the needs of the
great powers,

41:08.466 --> 41:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how do those needs align with
our needs, how
do we organize that?

41:11.369 --> 41:14.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The opening to China, of course,
was the apogee
of this theory.

41:14.839 --> 41:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You really
cannot, I think,
overstate the importance that
Kissinger places

41:19.510 --> 41:23.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on China and on China-U.S.
relations in the
world going forward, can you?

41:23.748 --> 41:24.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: No.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.217 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was his greatest achievement,
and it was
a world historical achievement.

41:28.119 --> 41:33.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In 1971, when
Kissinger was
national security adviser to
President Richard

41:33.925 --> 41:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nixon, he made a secret trip to
the People's
Republic of China, which had not
had relations

41:39.297 --> 41:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the U.S. in over 20 years.

41:42.266 --> 41:49.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kissinger's diplomacy paved the
way for Nixon's
so-called opening to China in
1972.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was the beginning of China's
emergence
as a world power.

41:52.543 --> 41:57.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: China is going
to be the
world's biggest economy, if
things keep going

41:57.115 --> 41:59.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the way they're going.

41:59.984 --> 42:04.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our future, our economic future,
the American
economic future, is in Asia.

42:04.255 --> 42:08.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China believes itself to be the
most powerful
country in the world, the
central kingdom.

42:08.126 --> 42:11.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so he's saying that
presidents have to
have a strategic view and
understand how to

42:11.629 --> 42:16.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
manage that aspect of Chinese
relationships
without coming to war.

42:16.834 --> 42:22.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stability of the entire
world depends
on a constructive relationship
between the

42:22.774 --> 42:24.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
United States and China.

42:24.609 --> 42:29.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If that relationship
deteriorates it's bad
for the U.S., it's bad for the
entire world.

42:29.680 --> 42:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it should be the number one
priority of
American foreign policy.

42:33.384 --> 42:35.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there's chaos in the world,
too.

42:35.787 --> 42:38.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And American presidents have to
deal with
the chaos at the same time that
they're thinking

42:39.023 --> 42:42.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about 10, 20, 30 years out how
they're going
to deal with China.

42:42.760 --> 42:47.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how does he
view Donald
Trump and Donald Trump's
approach to...

42:47.632 --> 42:53.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, in our
most recent
conversation, I said, so do you
think that

42:53.171 --> 42:55.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has matured?

42:55.273 --> 42:58.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Do you think he's become
smarter, or more
studious.

42:58.543 --> 43:01.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, I'm not having that
conversation.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's the president-elect of the
United States.

43:03.748 --> 43:08.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what we should do is,
essentially -- I'm
paraphrasing now -- but we
should wish him

43:08.653 --> 43:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, and be available to help
him study,
and help him understand the
challenges before

43:15.793 --> 43:17.595 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

43:17.628 --> 43:20.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, Henry Kissinger is a
person, even
at 93, who doesn't like to be
out of the game,

43:20.998 --> 43:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't like to be out of the
limelight, and
so he's basically saying: I'm
here for you,

43:25.803 --> 43:30.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don, and I want to give you some
sound advice.

43:30.141 --> 43:35.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And last Thursday
afternoon,
Kissinger was able to do just
that in a meeting

43:35.213 --> 43:40.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Trump, after which the
president-elect
said in a statement, "I have
tremendous respect

43:40.785 --> 43:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Dr. Kissinger and appreciate
him sharing
his thoughts with me."

43:44.889 --> 43:48.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Kissinger's
basic rule,
I think, is that, you know, know
what you

43:48.960 --> 43:52.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to do, and know what things
are unacceptable
to you.

43:52.497 --> 43:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to know going into the
presidency
what things you cannot accept as
the leader

43:58.503 --> 44:02.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States, and you
have to reverse-engineer
the problem.

44:02.673 --> 44:07.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What could China do in the South
China Sea
that is not acceptable to U.S.
national security

44:07.912 --> 44:09.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interests?

44:09.213 --> 44:11.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What could happen in the Middle
East that
is not acceptable?

44:11.148 --> 44:17.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, first, you have to decide
what your -- to
borrow a phrase, what your red
lines are,

44:17.488 --> 44:19.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then you work back from
there.

44:19.290 --> 44:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does he believe
that someone
who hasn't had experience in
world affairs

44:24.128 --> 44:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and foreign policy can make a
determination
like that about what the red
line should be

44:28.799 --> 44:29.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before they come...

44:29.800 --> 44:31.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:31.602 --> 44:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: He doesn't --
he was very
assiduous about not providing
his opinion

44:35.039 --> 44:39.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on where Donald Trump is on the
learning curve
right now.

44:39.076 --> 44:48.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's a universal truth
that, if you're
not willing, or able, to take on
board new

44:48.419 --> 44:52.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information, new analysis, have
long, involved
conversations about these
important issues,

44:52.456 --> 44:54.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
then you're going to be
operating at a real
deficit.

44:54.392 --> 45:01.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Much, if not most
of the foreign
policy establishment in the
United States

45:01.165 --> 45:03.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has not been on board with
Donald Trump.

45:03.734 --> 45:04.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Right.

45:04.735 --> 45:06.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Quite the opposite.

45:06.571 --> 45:09.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How can he move
ahead making
decisions that are good for the
country, when

45:09.273 --> 45:11.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he hasn't had these
relationships with people?

45:11.108 --> 45:13.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Well, he's
going to have
to do something that might be
out of character

45:13.444 --> 45:19.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Donald Trump, which is to
say bygones
are bygones, pick up the phone,
and say to

45:19.116 --> 45:24.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colin Powell, say to Madeleine
Albright, say
to to all these people come in
and talk to

45:24.255 --> 45:26.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
me about what you know.

45:26.357 --> 45:33.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at the lower level, he's
going to have
to be open to the idea that
people who disagreed

45:33.831 --> 45:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with him, disagreed with his
candidacy, that
they should come back into
government and

45:39.303 --> 45:41.138 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
help.

45:41.172 --> 45:45.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the flip side of that is
that all of these
people who were so nervous about
Donald Trump

45:45.076 --> 45:50.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
becoming president now might
have to say to
themselves, well, Donald Trump
is president,

45:50.715 --> 45:55.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president-elect, and so I better
make myself
available to go back into
government, because

45:55.353 --> 46:01.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better me than some guy nobody
ever heard
of with no experience, because
these are not

46:01.559 --> 46:03.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unserious challenges.

46:03.828 --> 46:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are life-and-death issues.

46:05.596 --> 46:12.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want people who understand
the global
ISIS threat really well to be
sitting next

46:12.403 --> 46:14.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Donald Trump when he actually
has to make
decisions.

46:14.572 --> 46:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are you
worried about
right now?

46:16.407 --> 46:21.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you -- do you have
expectations for
this administration, or not?

46:21.045 --> 46:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: I'm worried
about everything,
for starters.

46:23.981 --> 46:27.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Mr. Trump, do you feel
ready to
be president, sir?

46:27.251 --> 46:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY GOLDBERG: I'm worried
about a willingness
to hire the best people.

46:32.056 --> 46:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm worried about temperament.

46:33.190 --> 46:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm worried about his attention,
his focus.

46:36.160 --> 46:41.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am not entirely worried that
he's actually
going to carry out all of the
things he said

46:41.298 --> 46:43.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he would do.

46:43.134 --> 46:45.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm worried about accidents.

46:45.302 --> 46:51.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who do you want in the White
House when the
CIA director comes over and says
the North

46:51.208 --> 46:58.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Koreans now have the ability to
deliver one
of their nuclear weapons by
intercontinental

46:58.749 --> 47:01.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ballistic missile to the
American mainland?

47:01.952 --> 47:05.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you want to do about it,
Mister or
Madame President?

47:05.456 --> 47:10.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want somebody in that job,
obviously,
who can make reasonable,
rational decisions,

47:10.728 --> 47:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and take in the best advice.

47:15.700 --> 47:28.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The number of
female-owned
businesses in New York City is
growing at

47:28.045 --> 47:33.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
four times the rate of
male-owned businesses,
becoming a key part of the
city's expanding

47:33.317 --> 47:35.019 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

47:35.052 --> 47:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many of these companies are
beginning
to stand out for work being done
in fields

47:38.756 --> 47:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that have historically been
dominated by men.

47:41.692 --> 47:46.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan tells the story
of how one
female entrepreneur has built
success in an

47:46.797 --> 47:48.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unlikely place.

47:48.232 --> 47:50.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's just
not many women
on construction sites?

47:50.935 --> 47:54.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NELLIE TORRES, CEO, ProjectSpan:
There's not
too many women, though you will
find more

47:54.438 --> 47:56.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now than you would have when I
first started.

47:56.774 --> 48:01.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Nellie Torres
was just 17
when she got her first job in
construction

48:01.545 --> 48:03.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as an accounting intern.

48:03.447 --> 48:08.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, more than 20 years later,
she's the
CEO of ProjectSpan, a
Brooklyn-based construction

48:08.686 --> 48:10.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
company that she started in
2003.

48:10.855 --> 48:12.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NELLIE TORRES: When do you think
the lights
will be ready to be installed?

48:12.990 --> 48:16.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Torres is
known for her
work on some of the city's most
sought-after

48:16.494 --> 48:23.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
projects, West Manhattan's new
subway station,
New York's first in 25 years,
the electrical

48:23.267 --> 48:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work for Yankee Stadium's center
field, and
her current job, lighting the
massive Kosciuszko

48:27.772 --> 48:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bridge that connects Brooklyn
and Queens.

48:29.573 --> 48:31.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It couldn't have been easy
getting here.

48:31.475 --> 48:33.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NELLIE TORRES: It wasn't easy
getting here.

48:33.310 --> 48:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The most
difficult part
for Torres?

48:36.113 --> 48:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Breaking into construction's old
boys club,
and overcoming stereotypes that
women like

48:40.751 --> 48:42.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her don't belong.

48:42.553 --> 48:47.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a woman of color, did you
feel like you
had to do twice as much work, be
twice as

48:47.758 --> 48:50.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
good just to be kind of
considered equally?

48:50.227 --> 48:51.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NELLIE TORRES: Absolutely.

48:51.228 --> 48:54.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had -- in my view, I had to be
better.

48:54.632 --> 48:55.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I had to be earlier.

48:55.966 --> 48:58.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I had to be on point.

48:58.169 --> 49:03.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My numbers had to be perfect,
maybe not perfect
all the time, but most of the
time, definitely

49:03.307 --> 49:04.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than my male counterparts.

49:04.308 --> 49:05.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was a
different bar.

49:05.509 --> 49:07.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NELLIE TORRES: It was a much
higher bar.

49:07.478 --> 49:11.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Torres grew up
in a rough
section of East New York, the
sixth of seven

49:11.182 --> 49:13.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
children of Puerto Rican
immigrants.

49:13.184 --> 49:17.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She put herself through college
and earned
a master's degree by working
days, studying

49:17.288 --> 49:19.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nights all while raising a son.

49:19.223 --> 49:20.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NELLIE TORRES: East New York has
made me what
I am.

49:20.958 --> 49:28.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I spent a long time trying
to pretend
that I wasn't from there and
pretend that

49:28.065 --> 49:31.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my childhood wasn't in the
ghetto growing
up.

49:31.936 --> 49:36.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, eventually, I have noticed
that, no,
that that made me exactly who I
am.

49:36.907 --> 49:42.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's made me have the ability to
knock on
walls and break down walls.

49:42.813 --> 49:45.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Otherwise, I don't think I would
have been
where I'm at.

49:45.916 --> 49:49.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Where Torres
is at is starting
to become more common.

49:49.653 --> 49:54.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nationally, according to the
latest census
data, there are nearly 10
million women-owned

49:54.291 --> 49:58.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
businesses, an increase of more
than 25 percent
since 2007.

49:58.362 --> 50:04.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a recent report by the
Center for an Urban
Future found women started more
than 60 percent

50:04.034 --> 50:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all new businesses in New
York City between
2002 and 2012, according to
Jonathan Bowles,

50:10.274 --> 50:12.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who authored the report.

50:12.042 --> 50:13.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN BOWLES, Executive
Director, Center
for an Urban Future: Well, we
actually did

50:13.143 --> 50:16.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an analysis for the 25 largest
cities.

50:16.347 --> 50:22.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there has been major growth
across the
board.

50:22.386 --> 50:27.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The number of women
entrepreneurs are growing,
not just in New York, but in all
major cities

50:27.391 --> 50:28.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the U.S.

50:28.993 --> 50:33.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: However,
construction remains
an industry that lags behind.

50:33.163 --> 50:37.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only 15 percent of all private
construction
firms in New York City are owned
by women.

50:37.434 --> 50:39.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN BOWLES: There's a lack
of role models.

50:39.603 --> 50:43.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's really changed, but, a
lot of times,
women didn't see people in their
families

50:43.040 --> 50:45.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or in their friendship networks
that had started
businesses.

50:45.843 --> 50:48.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fortunately, that really is
changing.

50:48.712 --> 50:53.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But getting access to those role
models and
mentors is a big deal.

50:53.417 --> 50:58.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Torres, who
oversees a team
of 17 full-time employees, is
trying to set

50:58.389 --> 51:03.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an example for female staffers
on how to best
climb the ladder in an industry
that has not

51:03.861 --> 51:05.629 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been very open.

51:05.663 --> 51:10.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NELLIE TORRES: You have to be
very, very,
very tough, have very tough
skin, and not

51:10.167 --> 51:12.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be willing to take no for an
answer.

51:12.369 --> 51:13.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You will hear no a lot.

51:13.370 --> 51:14.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You will hear you can't a lot.

51:14.738 --> 51:17.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You will hear, you don't belong
here.

51:17.908 --> 51:21.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you just need to recognize
that, yes,
you do belong here.

51:21.679 --> 51:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need to get educated, you
need to get
experience, and you need to
forge ahead.

51:25.449 --> 51:30.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even now,
despite being
the boss for years, her
employees see discrimination

51:30.454 --> 51:31.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
outside.

51:31.522 --> 51:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Willie Grullon is ProjectSpan's
safety manager.

51:33.824 --> 51:38.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIE GRULLON, Safety Manager,
ProjectSpan:
When we go to job sites, and
sometimes she

51:38.095 --> 51:39.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shows up.

51:39.930 --> 51:44.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And electricians and
construction workers,
when they first see her and she
starts asking

51:44.635 --> 51:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questions, they assume she's a
project manager.

51:46.937 --> 51:49.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when they come over, you
guys got a new
project manager?

51:49.940 --> 51:53.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm like, no, she's the
owner of the company.

51:53.143 --> 51:57.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I get a kick of their
expression, the
surprise they get.

51:57.614 --> 52:02.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Successful
women in construction
may still be a rare sight, but
Torres is participating

52:02.720 --> 52:07.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a New York City program to
mentor minority
and female-owned businesses, and
pave the

52:07.791 --> 52:09.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way for similar entrepreneurs.

52:09.626 --> 52:15.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan
in New York.

52:15.933 --> 52:27.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A news update
before we go.

52:27.177 --> 52:32.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Police in Chattanooga,
Tennessee, are reporting
multiple deaths in an elementary
school bus

52:32.316 --> 52:35.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crash, but didn't confirm an
exact number.

52:35.386 --> 52:40.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They did confirm that 23 were
sent to the
hospital with injuries after the
bus overturned.

52:40.391 --> 52:44.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Authorities are questioning the
driver about
what went wrong.

52:44.328 --> 52:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in San Antonio, Texas,
police have arrested
