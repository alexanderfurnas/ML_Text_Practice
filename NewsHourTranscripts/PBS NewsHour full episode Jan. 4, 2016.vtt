JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.774 --> 00:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
deep Gulf grows
wider. Saudi Arabia and its
allies break diplomatic

00:14.448 --> 00:20.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ties with Iran as the crisis
between longtime
rivals intensifies.

00:20.754 --> 00:26.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: It's 2016, and the
race for the
White House is heating up. Bill
Clinton hits

00:26.593 --> 00:31.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the trail for Hillary, while
Donald Trump
releases his first TV ad.

00:31.798 --> 00:38.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, on the home front: why
injured veterans
who want children can't get help
with in vitro

00:38.505 --> 00:40.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fertilization treatments.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CPL. JASON HALLETT (RET.), U.S.
Marine Corps:
It's very angering and it brings
a lot of

00:43.377 --> 00:48.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resentment towards my active
service and stuff.
I don't regret joining the
Marine Corps. But

00:48.248 --> 00:52.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the simple fact is that they
told us that
we'd be taken care of us if we
got injured.

00:52.619 --> 00:56.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:56.156 --> 01:00.627 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.661 --> 01:14.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Persian Gulf
powers Saudi Arabia
and Iran stared each other down
today in a

01:14.374 --> 01:20.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
full-scale diplomatic
confrontation. The struggle
pitted Sunnis against Shiites,
Persians against

01:20.948 --> 01:26.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Arabs, and had other nations
choosing sides.

01:26.153 --> 01:33.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anti-Saudi protests brought
thousands of Shiite
Iraqis into the streets of
Baghdad today outside

01:33.560 --> 01:40.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the heavily fortified Green Zone
that's home
to the U.S. Embassy. But the
Saudis were undeterred,

01:40.367 --> 01:44.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as Foreign Minister Adel
Al-Jubeir made clear
in an interview with Reuters.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADEL AL-JUBEIR, Saudi Arabian
Foreign Minister:
We decided to cut off all
diplomatic relations

01:47.674 --> 01:52.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Iran. We will also be
cutting off all
air traffic to and from Iran. We
will be cutting

01:52.879 --> 01:58.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off all commercial relations
with Iran and
we will have a travel ban
against people traveling

01:58.685 --> 02:00.487 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to Iran.

02:00.520 --> 02:05.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, Saudi
allies followed
suit. Sunni-dominated
governments in Bahrain

02:05.459 --> 02:11.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Sudan announced they, too,
are cutting
diplomatic ties with Iran. And
the United

02:11.498 --> 02:16.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Arab Emirates said it's
recalling its ambassador
from Tehran.

02:16.570 --> 02:23.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of this was sparked by Saudi
Arabia's
execution of Sheik Nimr al-Nimr,
a prominent

02:23.977 --> 02:30.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shiite cleric, on Saturday. He'd
been a major
critic of the Saudi government
and a central

02:30.984 --> 02:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
figure of protests in 2012
before he was arrested.

02:36.857 --> 02:42.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His execution touched off
widespread protests
in largely Shiite Iran, and
Supreme Leader

02:42.929 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned
the Saudis.

02:46.466 --> 02:50.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, Supreme
Leader of
Iran (through translator):
Killing a knowledgeable

02:50.170 --> 02:54.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man, who promoted virtue and
prevented vice,
and had religious zeal, is
certainly a crime,

02:54.641 --> 02:59.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great crime. It is also a
mistake, because
the spilled blood will
undoubtedly bring divine

02:59.413 --> 03:01.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
retribution.

03:01.281 --> 03:06.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Manmade
retribution came quickly.
Crowds ransacked Saudi Arabia's
embassy in

03:06.386 --> 03:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tehran and set it ablaze early
yesterday.
That triggered the Saudis'
decision to end

03:13.160 --> 03:16.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
diplomatic relations

03:16.696 --> 03:22.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran is getting support from
Shiite protesters
in large numbers across the
region, including

03:22.769 --> 03:29.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Bahrain, Pakistan and
Lebanon. And two
Sunni mosques were destroyed in
Iraq.

03:29.943 --> 03:36.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The spike in tensions has the
U.S., the U.N.
and others urging both sides to
step back.

03:36.116 --> 03:40.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the White House also bluntly
criticized
the Saudis today.

03:40.253 --> 03:44.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
There have been direct concerns
raised by

03:44.257 --> 03:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
U.S. officials to Saudi
officials about the
potential damaging consequences
of following

03:52.899 --> 03:56.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through on mass executions, in
particular
the execution of al-Nimr.

03:56.269 --> 03:58.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, this is a
concern that
we raised with the Saudis in
advance, and,

03:58.738 --> 04:04.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unfortunately, the concerns that
we expressed
to the Saudis have precipitated
the kinds

04:04.177 --> 04:06.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of consequences that we were
concerned about.

04:06.246 --> 04:11.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's still
unclear what the
consequences will be for ongoing
Saudi Iranian

04:11.651 --> 04:18.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proxy wars. In Yemen, Saudi
Arabia has led
an air campaign against Shiite
militants backed

04:18.425 --> 04:25.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Iran. And, in Syria, the
Saudis and other
Gulf Arab states are backing
rebel groups

04:25.132 --> 04:31.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against President Bashar Assad,
a longtime
ally of Iran.

04:31.171 --> 04:36.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late tonight, in Tehran, the
government of
Iran voiced regret over the
attacks on Saudi

04:36.143 --> 04:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missions and vowed to arrest
those responsible.
We will delve more deeply into
their confrontation

04:41.882 --> 04:43.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

04:44.017 --> 04:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street started the year in
a rout over
the Persian Gulf tensions and a
7 percent

04:49.356 --> 04:55.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sell-off in China. At the end of
the day,
the Dow Jones industrial average
lost 276

04:55.529 --> 05:05.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
points to close below 17150. It
had been down
450. The Nasdaq fell 104 points,
and the S&amp;P

05:05.205 --> 05:07.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
500 slipped 31.

05:07.440 --> 05:13.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. government is taking
Volkswagen to
court over emissions-cheating
software used

05:13.513 --> 05:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in diesel vehicles. A civil
lawsuit filed
in Detroit charges the cheating
led to greenhouse

05:19.386 --> 05:26.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gas emissions far beyond federal
standards.
Some 600,000 Volkswagen-made
vehicles are

05:26.259 --> 05:28.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
affected in the U.S.

05:28.995 --> 05:34.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama today defended
his plans to
tighten gun control restrictions
without congressional

05:34.901 --> 05:40.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approval. He said his executive
action would
fall within both his legal
authority and the

05:40.507 --> 05:45.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right to bear arms enshrined in
the Second
Amendment. The president spoke
in the Oval

05:45.312 --> 05:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Office, after a meeting with his
Attorney
General Loretta Lynch and FBI
Director James

05:50.917 --> 05:52.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Comey.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Although we have to be very
clear that this

05:54.521 --> 05:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not going to solve every
violent crime
in this country, it's not going
to prevent

05:58.592 --> 06:04.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every mass shooting, it's not
going to keep
every gun out of the hands of a
criminal,

06:04.564 --> 06:09.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it will potentially save lives
in this country.

06:09.269 --> 06:14.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama will
make the announcement
tomorrow. He's expected to
broaden background

06:14.741 --> 06:17.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
checks on gun sales.

06:17.177 --> 06:22.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An armed anti-government group
stood their
ground today at a wildlife
refuge in Oregon.

06:22.649 --> 06:27.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They seized the place over the
weekend to
protest what they see as federal
overreach

06:27.487 --> 06:32.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on public lands. The FBI said
it's seeking
-- quote -- "a peaceful
resolution to the

06:33.026 --> 06:37.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standoff." We will explore the
story in full
later in the program.

06:37.797 --> 06:43.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The flood tide along the
Mississippi River
is moving on, putting towns in
southernmost

06:43.169 --> 06:49.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Illinois at risk. The water has
largely receded
in the Saint Louis region,
revealing widespread

06:49.109 --> 06:55.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
damage and leaving a series of
towns to clean
up. Meanwhile, near record
crests are expected

06:55.081 --> 06:58.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
along the Illinois River this
week.

06:58.618 --> 07:04.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And starting tomorrow, local
governments across
New York state will have to move
the homeless

07:04.057 --> 07:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off the streets and out of the
cold, by force,
if necessary. Governor Andrew
Cuomo signed

07:09.863 --> 07:15.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an order yesterday to transport
people to
shelters when temperatures dip
below freezing.

07:15.902 --> 07:21.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, in New York City, he said
he will defend
the policy against any legal
challenges.

07:21.174 --> 07:25.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), New York:
And they
say, well, why are we doing this
or why should

07:25.445 --> 07:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we do this? I said because it's
not right
to leave brothers and sisters on
the street

07:33.853 --> 07:38.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
corner. It's not right to leave
children on
the street corner.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

07:40.493 --> 07:47.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO: It's not
right to have
shelter system that is so dirty
and unsafe

07:47.367 --> 07:50.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people have to stay on the
street corner.
That's the only reason. It's not
right.

07:50.470 --> 07:55.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The mayor of New
York City,
Bill de Blasio, said he supports
Cuomo's intent,

07:55.375 --> 07:59.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he argued it would take a
state law to
do what the governor wants.

07:59.913 --> 08:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In India, the military spent a
third day clearing
an air force base near the
Pakistani border.

08:05.819 --> 08:11.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pro-Pakistani gunmen stormed the
compound
in Punjab state on Saturday
morning, killing

08:11.624 --> 08:18.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seven Indian soldiers. Search
operations resumed
around the base today as
security remained

08:18.531 --> 08:24.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tight. So far, five militants
have been killed
with at least one other still on
the loose.

08:24.170 --> 08:29.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The incident could endanger a
recent thaw
in India's relations with
Pakistan.

08:29.743 --> 08:34.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An Indian consulate in Northern
Afghanistan
was attacked overnight, and it
took all day

08:34.981 --> 08:40.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to end the siege. Soldiers fired
rockets and
artillery at insurgents who
holed up in a

08:40.453 --> 08:45.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearby building after they
failed to break
into the consulate in
Mazar-e-Sharif. No group

08:45.892 --> 08:51.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
claimed responsibility, but the
Taliban has
carried out similar attacks
before.

08:51.765 --> 08:57.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And authorities in Southern
Mexico are investigating
the murder of a mayor,
apparently by drug

08:57.604 --> 09:04.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gangs. Gisela Mota was killed on
Saturday,
just one day after taking
office. The regional

09:04.411 --> 09:10.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governor says the gangs mean to
stop officials
from calling in the state
police. Mourners

09:10.183 --> 09:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gathered yesterday to pay their
respects,
and some complained the
government had failed

09:15.255 --> 09:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to protect Mayor Mota. She was
33 years old.

09:19.692 --> 09:24.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what the
Iran-Saudi conflict means for
diplomacy in

09:24.464 --> 09:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Middle East; on the 2016
campaign trail
with new tactics and new ads;
why armed protesters

09:32.172 --> 09:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say they took over a national
wildlife refuge;
much more.

09:42.215 --> 09:49.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say they took over a national
wildlife refuge;
much more.

09:49.789 --> 09:54.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we return to the tensions
between Saudi
Arabia and Iran.

09:54.060 --> 10:00.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined by Vali Nasr, dean of
the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies,

10:00.500 --> 10:05.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Randa Slim of the Middle
East institute.
And we welcome you both.

10:05.638 --> 10:11.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Randa Slim, to you first, why
did the Saudis
execute this cleric whom they
had imprisoned

10:11.211 --> 10:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
already for several years?

10:12.946 --> 10:16.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANDA SLIM, Middle East
Institute: This is
a crisis that needs to be looked
at through

10:16.950 --> 10:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the context of an ongoing
rivalry for power
between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

10:24.257 --> 10:31.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this execution is a message
from the Saudis
to Iran, but also it's a message
to its own

10:31.097 --> 10:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
domestic constituency. But I
think the crisis
that has been caused by this
execution is

10:37.670 --> 10:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
primarily driven by domestic
factors.

10:40.640 --> 10:45.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have two regimes in this case
in Saudi
Arabia and Iran that are acting
out of fear

10:45.311 --> 10:50.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and out of feelings of
insecurity about the
long-term stability of the
regime. And they

10:50.683 --> 11:00.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are using this crisis as a way
to consolidate
power and support internally and
to send messages

11:00.560 --> 11:02.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also regionally.

11:02.362 --> 11:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Vali Nasr,
the Saudis had
to know that this would inflame
and anger

11:06.799 --> 11:08.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iran.

11:08.668 --> 11:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALI NASR, School of Advanced
International
Studies, Johns Hopkins
University: Yes, they

11:08.935 --> 11:10.837 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
did.

11:10.870 --> 11:14.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this came after another
crisis which followed
the death of several hundred
Iranian pilgrims

11:14.807 --> 11:21.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during a tragedy in Mecca last
year. The relations
got very tense. Both sides
accused one another

11:21.314 --> 11:28.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of bad intentions. And Iran had
also warned
about the killing of this
cleric, and so had

11:28.588 --> 11:30.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

11:30.356 --> 11:35.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the killing of a cleric,
particularly
Shia Islam, is not a trivial
matter. And the

11:35.461 --> 11:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudis knew that this -- killing
a Shia cleric
is not like killing any other
Shia activist.

11:41.634 --> 11:46.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Randa is absolutely
correct that
there was a domestic factor.
This execution

11:46.906 --> 11:51.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case came a few days after the
Saudis announced
their first austerity package
internally as

11:51.444 --> 11:53.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a consequence of reduction of
oil prices.

11:53.980 --> 11:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also came regionally right
after the United
States first included Iran in
the Vienna process.

11:59.452 --> 12:04.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the Shia government in
Iraq, with
American and Iranian support,
recaptured Ramadi.

12:04.524 --> 12:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It looked like the Iranians were
actually
on much of an upswing in the
region than the

12:10.897 --> 12:14.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudis were. So, it's also a
signal. In addition
to the domestic policy, it's a
signal to the

12:14.467 --> 12:16.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
United States as well.

12:16.235 --> 12:20.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Randa Slim, fair
to say there
is more animosity on the part of
the Saudis

12:20.306 --> 12:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
toward Iran than the other way
around?

12:22.609 --> 12:31.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDA SLIM: I think, look, the
Iranian threat
has all been prioritized by the
Saudi political

12:31.584 --> 12:33.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
establishment.

12:33.353 --> 12:39.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And anti-Iran feelings,
anti-Shia feelings
are also prevalent among large
segments of

12:39.158 --> 12:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Saudi population. But I hate
to disagree
with my friend Vali, but there
is also -- on

12:45.331 --> 12:52.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Iranian side, there are
certain hard-liners
inside the Iranian regime that
have approved

12:52.105 --> 12:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the attacks against the Saudi
Embassy and
the Saudi Consulate.

12:55.475 --> 13:02.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these are the members of the
Iranian regime
that are feeling very, how to
say, concerned,

13:02.448 --> 13:08.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scared about the consequences of
the Iran
deal, about Iran opening to the
outside world,

13:08.621 --> 13:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how this is going to affect
their own
hold on political and economic
power. And

13:13.893 --> 13:21.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are using this crisis as a
way to ramp
up support and consolidate their
camp ahead

13:21.701 --> 13:25.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the upcoming elections in
Iran in February.

13:25.071 --> 13:31.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Vali, some
elements in
Iran using this to bolster their
own case

13:31.444 --> 13:37.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against normalizing or even
coming close to
normalizing relations with the
U.S.?

13:37.183 --> 13:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALI NASR: No, actually, I agree
with Randa.
There is a faction in Iran which
is not happy

13:41.754 --> 13:47.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the nuclear deal, is not
happy with a
change of Iran's status in the
global affairs,

13:47.093 --> 13:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and also wants to defeat
President Rouhani
and his moderates in the
upcoming elections.

13:53.099 --> 13:59.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the Saudi action is
much like
when Republicans in Congress
posture with

13:59.939 --> 14:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new sanctions against Iran. The
conservatives
immediately take advantage of it
in order

14:04.777 --> 14:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to muddy the water, embarrass
the president
and try to prove that opening to
the West

14:09.348 --> 14:13.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has actually been a mistake and
that Iran
would do a lot better by taking
a hard-line

14:13.953 --> 14:15.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

14:15.788 --> 14:19.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Having all said
this, Randa
Slim, what are the consequences?
We know there

14:19.058 --> 14:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the war in Syria. There is
the nuclear
deal between the Iran and the
U.S. What happens

14:24.831 --> 14:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to that nuclear deal going
forward?

14:27.834 --> 14:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDA SLIM: Look, this is
happening at a time
when tensions, especially
sectarian tensions

14:33.239 --> 14:38.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the region, as they are, are
already at
a high pitch. So it's like
pouring gasoline

14:39.011 --> 14:40.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on a fire.

14:40.947 --> 14:47.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fallout, for example, in
terms of
the implications for the
negotiations in Syria

14:47.086 --> 14:50.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or the U.N.-sponsored
negotiations that were
to be launched at the end of the
month in

14:50.990 --> 14:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria, as well as the U.N.
attempts to establish
a permanent defense in Yemen, I
think we can

14:57.663 --> 15:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say that these efforts have now
been dealt
a very severe blow.

15:02.935 --> 15:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're on life support. And I
don't know
whether the upcoming
negotiations in Syria

15:07.840 --> 15:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will take place now. Neither
Saudi Arabia
nor Iran are incentivized to
make concessions,

15:15.114 --> 15:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pressure their Syrian proxies
to make concessions.
But then there is also broader
regional fallout.

15:20.620 --> 15:26.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm very concerned about whether
Bahrain will
follow Saudi Arabia too and ramp
up its security

15:26.325 --> 15:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach in dealing with its own
Shia opposition,
the fallout with the security in
Lebanon,

15:33.866 --> 15:40.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where, if Iran or Saudi Arabia
tries to pressure
their respective proxies in
Lebanon to take

15:40.173 --> 15:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sides, how this will impact
already high regional
sectarian tension.

15:44.410 --> 15:48.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Vali Nasr,
how do you
see the repercussions going
forward?

15:48.281 --> 15:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALI NASR: Well, I agree with
everything that
Randa said, but also it's
important to know

15:53.786 --> 15:58.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the United States and its
international
allies have their own interests
in the region,

15:58.224 --> 16:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is fighting ISIS, ending
the war in
Syria, making the Iranian
nuclear deal successful.

16:03.729 --> 16:08.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's very clear that the
hard-liners in Iran
and the Saudi regime have a
different agenda

16:08.367 --> 16:14.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here. And sectarianism serves
that agenda.
Saudi Arabia didn't want Iran to
be included

16:14.073 --> 16:21.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the regional processes. It
doesn't want
Iran to normalize relations with
the West.

16:21.280 --> 16:26.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the very early on, it
rejected the nuclear
deal and it tied the nuclear
deal to regional

16:26.052 --> 16:27.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, Saudi Arabia is much
more interested
in saying the problem in the
Middle East is

16:31.657 --> 16:35.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran, not ISIS, whereas, for the
West, it's
now ISIS.

16:35.127 --> 16:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going forward, in 2016, if the
United States
wants to get ahead of the ISIS
issue, if it

16:40.600 --> 16:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants to find a way to end the
war in Syria,
which, I agree with Randa, it's
now very difficult

16:45.204 --> 16:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see how the Vienna process
will get us
there -- it has to essentially
be very clear

16:52.278 --> 16:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what it expects of both
sides in terms
of cooperation.

16:55.481 --> 16:58.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Serious
repercussions everywhere
you look.

16:58.284 --> 17:08.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vali Nasr, Randa Slim, we thank
you both.

17:08.394 --> 17:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vali Nasr, Randa Slim, we thank
you both.

17:14.500 --> 17:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have talked about it for
months. Now we
are here, 2016.

17:19.305 --> 17:24.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins explains
how the presidential race has
quickly hit

17:24.043 --> 17:26.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
another gear.

17:26.145 --> 17:33.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Just try and
take it all
in. The many candidates are
scrambling, as

17:33.719 --> 17:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months of buildup are over, and
the actual
2016 is here. It means a
mounting frenzy of

17:40.893 --> 17:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rallies and big-time surrogates.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But today's biggest move came
over the airwaves.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: The politicians can
pretend it's
something else.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A provocative
new Donald
Trump ad stressing security.

17:53.372 --> 17:56.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: That's why he's
calling for a temporary
shutdown of Muslims entering the
United States,

17:56.709 --> 17:59.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until we can figure out what's
going on.

17:59.578 --> 18:04.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's Trump's
first TV ad
of the campaign, and it's
raising the intensity

18:04.317 --> 18:09.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the race. At the same time,
his rivals
are revving up their opposition
to him.

18:09.655 --> 18:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In New Hampshire today, New
Jersey Governor
Chris Christie called Trump's
security promise

18:14.093 --> 18:15.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an empty one.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate:
These are the most dangerous and
perilous

18:17.830 --> 18:23.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times in our country's recent
history. Showtime
is over, everybody. We are not
electing an

18:23.169 --> 18:25.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entertainer in chief.

18:25.071 --> 18:29.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, on
the Democratic
side, something new from the
Clinton campaign:

18:29.342 --> 18:35.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first solo appearances from
former President
Bill Clinton this cycle. He
stuck mostly to

18:35.181 --> 18:36.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his wife's biography.

18:36.983 --> 18:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, Former President
of the United
States: I do not believe, in my
lifetime,

18:42.388 --> 18:48.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anybody has run for this job at
a moment of
great importance who was better
qualified,

18:48.561 --> 18:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by knowledge, experience and
temperament to
do what needs to be done now.

18:53.699 --> 18:57.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He stayed
positive and ignored
recent attacks from Donald Trump
about his

18:57.903 --> 19:04.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
infidelity. The candidate
herself, Hillary
Clinton, in Iowa, did attack
Trump and Republicans.

19:04.510 --> 19:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),

... negatively to what I hear
coming from

19:09.882 --> 19:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other side is because not
only are -- what
they are saying about Muslims,
wrong and shameful,

19:19.658 --> 19:21.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's dangerous.

19:21.560 --> 19:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Her main rival,
Vermont Senator
Bernie Sanders, was in New
Hampshire. Sanders'

19:24.997 --> 19:30.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
message? That his grassroots
campaign has
a real shot at wresting the
nomination away

19:30.102 --> 19:31.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Clinton.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),

We can win in Iowa, and we can
win in New

19:33.039 --> 19:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

19:46.652 --> 19:48.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our country back.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Rubio in New Hampshire.

19:51.257 --> 19:56.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for rival Republican Ben
Carson, his move
was online. Carson released a
new tax plan

19:56.996 --> 20:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calling for a flat tax of 14.9
percent on
most Americans. But the numbers
that may matter

20:03.235 --> 20:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
most on the trail are dates.

20:05.404 --> 20:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iowa caucuses on February 1,
and the New
Hampshire primary eight days
later.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

20:12.912 --> 20:18.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now that it's
2016, it's the
perfect time for Politics Monday
with Tamara

20:18.350 --> 20:23.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Keith and Amy Walter. Both are
in New Hampshire,
and I spoke with them a short
time ago.

20:23.556 --> 20:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy
Walter of The
Cook Political Report, 2016 is
finally here.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're both in New Hampshire.

20:33.966 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tamara, let me start with you.
And you were
with Bill Clinton when he spoke
today earlier

20:39.472 --> 20:44.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New Hampshire. It was thought
he might
respond to some of what Donald
Trump has been

20:44.543 --> 20:46.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking about lately, but he
didn't.

20:46.479 --> 20:51.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: He certainly
didn't. He was there to be the
supportive

20:51.550 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spouse mostly.

20:53.419 --> 20:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He started out talking about
news articles
that he's read and maybe made
some veiled

20:58.924 --> 21:04.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
references to some of Donald
Trump's language
on Muslims. But he didn't go
there on some

21:04.763 --> 21:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the other things Donald Trump
has been
going after him on.

21:09.535 --> 21:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he really sang the
praises of his
wife and told a series of
anecdotes about

21:15.674 --> 21:21.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her going back to when they
first met in law
school. And many of the people
in the audience

21:21.247 --> 21:25.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there I talked to afterwards
said that they
learned new things about Hillary
Clinton.

21:25.417 --> 21:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he was doing the proud
husband thing,
and not really hitting hard
against other

21:32.925 --> 21:34.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidates.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, the
Hillary Clinton
campaign views him purely as an
asset?

21:37.496 --> 21:39.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: I think
so.

21:39.331 --> 21:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, listen, he brings
right now in
a Democratic primary a very good
track record.

21:47.573 --> 21:52.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic voters like him. They
respond to
him, and I think we will see him
on the trail

21:52.111 --> 21:57.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much more in the coming months.
Again, you
can't have Hillary Clinton
everywhere. She

21:57.516 --> 22:02.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has somebody who knows what it's
like to run
a presidential campaign going
out into all

22:02.655 --> 22:04.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of these early primary state.

22:04.490 --> 22:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another thing, it's just -- it's
such a striking
contrast between what Hillary
Clinton can

22:08.894 --> 22:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do with her husband former
president, and
what Jeb Bush can't do with his
brother former

22:15.267 --> 22:20.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president. Bringing him on the
road, there
has been a lot of talk about
that early on,

22:20.139 --> 22:24.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we haven't seen it quite
yet, and the
last name, of course, of Bush
more problematic

22:24.443 --> 22:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Jeb in a Republican primary.
The Clinton
name still gold in a Democratic
primary.

22:28.781 --> 22:33.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of course, the
reason Bill
Clinton is there, Tamara, is the
fact that

22:33.786 --> 22:42.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders happens to be
running a little
bit ahead in the polls. How
worried are they

22:42.428 --> 22:46.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about Bernie Sanders? How strong
a race is
he putting out there?

22:46.932 --> 22:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: He, as you say, is
leading in
the polls here, has a strong
organization

22:52.004 --> 22:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here, both in New Hampshire and
in Iowa.

22:55.107 --> 23:02.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's working hard in Iowa to
build his organization
there, because the Clintons can
sort of write

23:02.047 --> 23:07.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off New Hampshire. And they keep
putting out
these lines like, well, you
know, he is from

23:07.820 --> 23:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a neighboring state, and people
don't tend
to lose in their neighboring
state of New

23:12.024 --> 23:13.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hampshire.

23:13.759 --> 23:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they are definitely setting
expectations,
though it's unclear whether they
actually

23:19.231 --> 23:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that he could win in New
Hampshire or
whether they're just trying to
lower the bar.

23:24.336 --> 23:28.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy, the
other thing we're
watching today, as we mentioned,
is Donald

23:28.073 --> 23:34.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump out with his first
television ad. The
word fear is being associated
with it. The

23:34.647 --> 23:39.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump campaign has waited until
now to put
this out. What's the strategy
here?

23:39.184 --> 23:43.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Judy, I always have
a hard time
understanding the strategy of
the Trump campaign.

23:43.055 --> 23:49.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I don't know if it's
strategy, as much
as the fact that he is doubling
down on what

23:49.061 --> 23:58.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has gotten him so far thus far,
which is this
idea that he is the strongest
and the toughest

23:58.037 --> 23:59.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the most resolute in the
field.

23:59.972 --> 24:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the more that we
hear about trouble
in the Mideast, the more now
that we're hearing

24:04.977 --> 24:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about problems coming from all
sectors when
it relates to ISIS, et cetera,
this just makes

24:14.053 --> 24:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump look even better in
the eyes
of many Republican primary
voters, who are

24:20.259 --> 24:23.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
frustrated, anxious, ready to
turn the page.

24:23.762 --> 24:30.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this ad just reminds them of
what they
like in him in the first place.
Of course,

24:30.035 --> 24:34.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it also reminds a lot of
moderate voters,
independent-leaning voters about
what they

24:34.606 --> 24:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't like about Donald Trump.
And I think
this is always going to be the
trouble for

24:38.944 --> 24:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, is what works very well
in a Republican
primary cuts against him among
the general

24:46.185 --> 24:48.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
electorate.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is, I think,
the understanding
of a lot of people that, when
you talk about

24:49.888 --> 24:57.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism, Democrats feel that
that's not
their strongest issue, that
Republicans are

24:57.363 --> 25:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just naturally going to be in a
better place
on that.

25:00.265 --> 25:05.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Though Hillary
Clinton would
say that she is strong on those
issues, as

25:05.170 --> 25:09.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a former secretary of state. I
think that's
the case that she would
certainly make.

25:09.074 --> 25:15.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, what was striking with
the Donald Trump
ad is the imagery of
undocumented immigrants,

25:15.647 --> 25:20.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presumably, grainy footage
running across
the border. I think that's what
it's supposed

25:20.219 --> 25:26.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be. It takes me back to the
1990s in California.
And Governor Pete Wilson's
reelection campaign

25:26.291 --> 25:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had an ad with similar footage
of people flooding
over the borders.

25:31.897 --> 25:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that ad and some other
things that he
ran on in that campaign
ultimately hurt the

25:37.102 --> 25:41.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Party in California
in a way that
some Republicans are concerned
could hurt

25:41.640 --> 25:47.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the national party, with this
Trump ad and
the language about immigrants,
because the

25:47.246 --> 25:49.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
demographics are changing in
this country.

25:49.882 --> 25:55.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And appealing to Latino voters
and Asian voters
is going to be critical, many
believe, for

25:55.053 --> 25:57.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the future of the Republican
Party in this
country.

25:57.222 --> 26:00.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, the other
candidate I
want to ask you about is Chris
Christie. You

26:00.292 --> 26:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are going to be seeing him at an
event later
today.

26:04.196 --> 26:10.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has three events in New
Hampshire today.
What's going on with Chris
Christie in the

26:10.269 --> 26:12.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Granite State?

26:12.070 --> 26:14.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's going to be
very interesting
to see what Chris Christie does
and whether

26:15.007 --> 26:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's able to coalesce what has
at this point
been a very fractured primary up
here in New

26:21.447 --> 26:25.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire, Donald Trump leading
the pack with
about 25 percent of the vote,
and then the

26:25.918 --> 26:28.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rest of it is really splintered
about.

26:28.253 --> 26:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Chris Christie wants to be
the establishment
candidate. Right now, he's
competing for that

26:33.659 --> 26:40.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lane, for that anti-Trump lane,
with Jeb Bush,
Marco Rubio, John Kasich. He had
a speech

26:40.399 --> 26:45.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today right here at Saint Anselm
College,
where he made the case that, you
know what?

26:45.771 --> 26:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand you're angry,
America. I get
it. I'm with you on that. But
you need somebody

26:50.609 --> 26:55.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who's actually been tested. I,
he said, have
been tested at the executive
level. The others

26:55.881 --> 27:01.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
haven't. Anybody can do
showmanship. It takes
somebody else to have real
executive experience.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we are going to hear a
lot more about
that in the days and weeks to
come.

27:05.023 --> 27:07.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the pace
has quickened.
It is 2016.

27:07.326 --> 27:08.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're looking at
those days
on the calendar.

27:10.062 --> 27:24.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're both in New Hampshire. We
thank you,
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith.

27:24.610 --> 27:26.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

27:26.445 --> 27:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
refugee crisis
threatens Europe's open borders;
why injured

27:31.517 --> 27:38.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
veterans can't get help for in
vitro fertilization;
and the winner of the Man Booker
Prize explores

27:38.357 --> 27:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a dangerous time in Jamaica's
history.

27:41.627 --> 27:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, the latest in a
three-day standoff
in Oregon pitting a small band
of self- styled

27:48.166 --> 27:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
militiamen against the U.S.
government and
its land management policies.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

27:55.140 --> 27:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Malheur
Wildlife Refuge
sits in the snowy high desert of
Southeastern

27:59.244 --> 28:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oregon, with just a few small
buildings for
park staff and visitors. It's
now occupied

28:04.449 --> 28:08.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Ammon Bundy and other armed
protesters
who are against federal control
of Western

28:08.887 --> 28:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ranch lands and the treatment of
two Oregon
ranchers, Dwight and Steven
Hammond.

28:13.492 --> 28:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMMON BUNDY, Armed Protester:
They want to
pass on the ranching heritage to
their children

28:19.331 --> 28:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to their grandchildren. And
because of
that refusal to sell their
ranch, these federal

28:29.241 --> 28:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agencies began an attack on this
family.

28:34.346 --> 28:38.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Hammonds
were due to
report for additional jail time
in California

28:38.383 --> 28:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today for a 2012 conviction of
committing
arson on public lands.

28:43.221 --> 28:46.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Hammonds have distanced
themselves
from Ammon Bundy, who, along
with his father,

28:46.959 --> 28:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cliven Bundy, staged an armed
protest back
in 2014 in Nevada against
federal land management

28:53.398 --> 28:54.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
officials.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week, Bundy issued an
emotional call
to help the Hammonds in Oregon.

28:57.603 --> 29:03.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMMON BUNDY: I feel that this is
every bit
and maybe in many ways more
important than

29:03.742 --> 29:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Bundy ranch. I feel and know
that the
abuses that this family has
endured is much

29:09.648 --> 29:15.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greater than even the Bundy
family, and this
is something that cannot be
ignored.

29:15.420 --> 29:19.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On Saturday, a
crowd did
protest the Hammonds' five-year
jail sentence.

29:19.791 --> 29:24.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They marched peacefully in
Burns, Oregon,
which is just 30 miles from the
Malheur Wildlife

29:24.062 --> 29:25.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Refuge.

29:25.831 --> 29:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Malheur's 187,000 acres are home
to more than
320 bird species. It was created
in 1908 by

29:33.538 --> 29:37.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Theodore Roosevelt
from what were
then called -- quote --
"unclaimed government

29:37.376 --> 29:43.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lands." Now members of the
self-described
militia, the newly named
Citizens for Constitutional

29:43.548 --> 29:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Freedom, want the land returned.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LaVoy Finicum is an Arizona
rancher in the
group.

29:47.786 --> 29:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAVOY FINICUM, Citizens for
Constitutional
Freedom: Now here we are,
control without

29:51.156 --> 29:57.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
representation, one-third of our
land mass.
It's an empire within our own
country, unaccountable,

29:57.929 --> 30:00.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unelected. The real power is in
the bureaucracy.

30:00.966 --> 30:04.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So far, law
enforcement
hasn't taken any action at the
refuge, but

30:04.936 --> 30:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the FBI is monitoring the
situation.

30:07.372 --> 30:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this story, I'm now
joined on
the phone by Amanda Peacher of
Oregon Public

30:12.177 --> 30:14.012 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Broadcasting.

30:14.046 --> 30:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Amanda, I understand you
were in the compound
yesterday, and you have been
outside this

30:17.449 --> 30:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compound all day today. Can you
just tell
us a little bit about what is
the scene like

30:20.886 --> 30:22.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there?

30:22.154 --> 30:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMANDA PEACHER, Oregon Public
Broadcasting:
Absolutely.

30:24.022 --> 30:28.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a cold winter day and
this compound
is situated in just kind of a
sea of sagebrush

30:28.126 --> 30:33.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and range land, really. It's
very isolated.
There are 15, I would estimate,
buildings

30:33.832 --> 30:36.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
within the complex. And it's
very quiet here.

30:36.802 --> 30:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see a few of the protesters
walking between
buildings. There are some women
in the kitchen

30:43.475 --> 30:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making grilled cheese sandwiches
for the protesters.
But it's very calm. It's very
quiet. There

30:49.081 --> 30:54.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a press conference earlier
today in which
the protesters spoke a little
bit more about

30:54.753 --> 30:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why they're here, but, at the
scene, it's
quite calm.

30:57.589 --> 31:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean,
obviously, we can't
call this a standoff, because
there is no

31:01.093 --> 31:06.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one standing in opposition to
these guys.
Is it really true that there is
no sign of

31:06.064 --> 31:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
law enforcement there?

31:07.866 --> 31:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA PEACHER: I have seen zero
law enforcement
vehicles and -- that are marked
at least.

31:12.337 --> 31:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have heard nothing from
law enforcement
about their intentions to come
near the area.

31:16.608 --> 31:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say that the protesters
here are very
peaceful, and law enforcement
has indicated

31:23.882 --> 31:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they would like it to
remain peaceful
here.

31:25.684 --> 31:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, Ammon
Bundy and
his supporters say that they are
there supporting

31:29.788 --> 31:33.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Hammonds, who reported to
prison in Southern
California today, although the
Hammonds have

31:33.625 --> 31:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
distanced themselves a bit from
that.

31:35.961 --> 31:40.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is that the Bundys and his
supporters,
what do they want?

31:40.332 --> 31:44.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANDA PEACHER: Well, what they
would say
is that they would like to see
federal lands

31:44.736 --> 31:48.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like this refuge turned over to
local control.

31:48.073 --> 31:53.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said that they would like
to start working
the land here. And although it's
not exactly

31:53.178 --> 31:58.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear what that means at this
point, I think
many of them feel that the way
that federal

31:58.784 --> 32:03.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lands are managed is not
appropriate and,
in some cases, unconstitutional.

32:03.388 --> 32:07.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What sense
have you gotten
of what the locals' reaction to
all of this

32:07.392 --> 32:08.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has been?

32:08.093 --> 32:09.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMANDA PEACHER: It's been mixed.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that there has been a
lot of fear
about what this could look like
from the local

32:13.198 --> 32:18.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community, in part because you
hear the words
occupation and protest, and
people assume

32:18.570 --> 32:20.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that there could be some
violence here.

32:20.372 --> 32:25.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I did see some local
residents come by
and take a tour. They were
welcomed into the

32:25.143 --> 32:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complex. And they thought that
they were very
welcomed by the protesters and
not threatened

32:31.716 --> 32:35.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
at all. And they were --
appreciated seeing
what was actually happening on
the ground.

32:35.754 --> 32:40.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, I know that many in
Harney County
are uncomfortable with having
this protest

32:40.425 --> 32:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here in this area and are wary
of what it
could become.

32:44.462 --> 32:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Amanda Peacher,
Oregon Public Broadcasting,
thank you very

32:48.066 --> 32:48.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMANDA PEACHER: You're welcome.

32:50.602 --> 32:55.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And moments ago,
the Hammonds
officially turned themselves in
to serve that

32:55.173 --> 33:05.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
additional jail time.

33:05.283 --> 33:10.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
additional jail time.

33:10.856 --> 33:16.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to the refugee crisis in
Europe, where
two more countries have
tightened their borders.

33:16.962 --> 33:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Denmark announced today that it
is instituting
I.D. checks on its frontier with
Germany,

33:22.133 --> 33:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this after Sweden enacted a
strict new border
policy.

33:26.004 --> 33:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The moves further erode the
20-year old Schengen
agreement, which is supposed to
guarantee

33:30.909 --> 33:35.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
free movement of people and
goods across most
of mainland Europe.

33:35.447 --> 33:40.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
From the Danish capital,
Copenhagen, special
correspondent Malcolm Brabant
reports.

33:40.752 --> 33:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Midnight at
Copenhagen airport
station, the last stop before
Sweden, and

33:46.524 --> 33:51.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security guards began to check
the identities
of those traveling across the
bridge linking

33:51.096 --> 33:53.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the two countries.

33:53.131 --> 33:59.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sweden insisted on new controls,
warning transport
companies they risked heavy
fines if undocumented

33:59.704 --> 34:05.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
travelers were allowed through.
Passengers
dismount from Sweden-bound
trains to have

34:05.777 --> 34:10.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their papers scanned. There is a
long fence
between the tracks to stop
people from trying

34:10.682 --> 34:12.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to escape the checks.

34:12.584 --> 34:17.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREAS, Swedish Tourist: I
trust my government.
We have taken a huge
responsibility within

34:17.222 --> 34:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Europe and with the refugees, so
that we cannot
take any more.

34:21.459 --> 34:26.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX FUNKE, Swedish Tourist:
It's a huge backward
step, because Sweden is a free
country and

34:26.398 --> 34:32.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everyone should come. And even
if they need
help, they should be getting it
here or where

34:32.137 --> 34:33.905 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they can.

34:33.939 --> 34:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It's just as if you were
living in a
foreign country now. Yes, no
free movement.

34:41.713 --> 34:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It really two steps backwards.

34:45.617 --> 34:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Precisely 12
hours later,
Denmark's prime minister Lars
Lokke Rasmussen,

34:52.991 --> 34:57.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responded by announcing controls
along the
border with Germany. The Danish
measures will

34:57.595 --> 35:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
initially be in place for 10
days, but the
government warned the procedures
could be

35:02.500 --> 35:03.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
extended.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Malcolm Brabant from the "PBS
NewsHour," Prime
Minister.

35:05.570 --> 35:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think that you are going
to contribute
to a crisis further down the
line in other

35:09.474 --> 35:11.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries in the rest of Europe
and perhaps
beyond?

35:11.876 --> 35:16.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARS LOKKE RASMUSSEN, Danish
Prime Minister:
I think it's pretty obvious that
we are in

35:16.114 --> 35:22.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a situation, if the European
Union can't protect
the external borders, you will
see more and

35:22.787 --> 35:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more countries which will be
forced into introducing
temporary internal border
control.

35:31.629 --> 35:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is something we need to
take very seriously,
because it will have a negative
impact on

35:39.004 --> 35:47.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prosperity. I'm a true believer
of the freedom
of movement. This is not a happy
moment at

35:47.312 --> 35:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all. We have invested billions
in infrastructure
between Sweden and Denmark. We
have invested

35:54.419 --> 36:01.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millions in international
branding of the
greater Copenhagen region. So,
this is a step

36:01.459 --> 36:03.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
backwards.

36:03.294 --> 36:07.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Trine
Christensen, a senior
official at the human rights
group Amnesty

36:07.165 --> 36:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
International, is concerned that
other nations
along the refugee trail back to
Greece will

36:11.536 --> 36:16.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now follow suit at a time when
migrants who
aren't from Syria, Iraq and
Afghanistan are

36:16.975 --> 36:18.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stranded.

36:18.710 --> 36:22.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRINE CHRISTENSEN, Amnesty
International:
What we're seeing today is that
Sweden is

36:22.080 --> 36:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desperately trying to get the
rest of Europe
to actually face up to its
responsibilities.

36:27.719 --> 36:34.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there is a European response
to this crisis,
there can be a solution. There
can be at least

36:34.125 --> 36:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way of distributing the
burdens and to help
people who are in desperate need
of protection.

36:41.499 --> 36:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Christensen is
particularly
worried about the long-term
impact on Turkey,

36:46.838 --> 36:51.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lebanon and Jordan, which have
taken in many
more refugees than the one
million or so who

36:51.776 --> 36:53.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have entered Europe in the past
year.

36:53.745 --> 36:58.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TRINE CHRISTENSEN: If we
continue to see what
is happening today, and that is
the majority

36:58.483 --> 37:04.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of countries trying to shirk
that responsibility,
trying to avoid helping, then we
will see

37:04.422 --> 37:11.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a buildup of more and more
problems and more
and more refugees. And the
pressure on the

37:11.196 --> 37:15.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
local areas, on the neighboring
countries,
which they are not able to bear
in any way,

37:15.967 --> 37:21.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shape or form. As that happens,
and those
countries start to implode,
that's when we

37:21.739 --> 37:26.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will see a refugee problem that
will make
what we have today look like
nothing at all.

37:26.144 --> 37:30.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But the most
pressing concern
for Michael Randropp is an
economic one. He

37:30.882 --> 37:36.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
represents 15,000 people who
live and work
in the cross-border region and
commute between

37:36.254 --> 37:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Denmark and Sweden. Their lives
have suddenly
become more complex and
disruptive.

37:40.892 --> 37:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL RANDROPP, Government
Official: Some
of the passengers say that this
is a new Iron

37:44.062 --> 37:47.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Curtain. And other passengers
say that this
is a new Berlin Wall.

37:47.832 --> 37:53.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: For the past 20
years, businessman
Ture Ertmann has lived in
Sweden, where homes

37:53.638 --> 37:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cars are cheaper, and worked
in Copenhagen.
But he's now contemplating
moving to Denmark.

37:59.777 --> 38:11.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Gentlemen, next stop, first
stop in Sweden.
In Sweden, we have border
control, so please

38:11.589 --> 38:13.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have your passports or other
identification
cards ready.

38:13.391 --> 38:15.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TURE ERTMANN, Businessman: The
whole idea
of the Schengen is that we have
external border

38:15.693 --> 38:20.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
controls. And now, suddenly,
that seems to
be breaking down. And each
country is raising

38:20.165 --> 38:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the inner borders. So, suddenly,
the whole
European community, the whole
cooperation

38:26.671 --> 38:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across borders seems to be
challenged a lot.
So, that's -- I think that's
worrisome.

38:31.543 --> 38:36.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The impact of
the changes
is also being felt north of
Copenhagen on

38:36.481 --> 38:41.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the main ferry route lining
Denmark and Sweden,
which is in competition with the
bridge. The

38:41.553 --> 38:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ferry company fears the cost of
implementing
the new measures will cost at
least $3 million

38:46.124 --> 38:47.926 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a year.

38:47.959 --> 38:53.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chief executive Henrik Rorbaek
has complained
to the European Union about
Sweden's action

38:53.097 --> 38:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and wants Stockholm to pay
compensation.

38:55.099 --> 38:59.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HENRIK RORBAEK, Chief Executive:
It means
like, for example, if you're in
New York,

38:59.304 --> 39:05.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants to pass the Brooklyn
Bridge, then you
have to show an I.D. I'm quite
sure that every

39:05.610 --> 39:07.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American would consider that as
a mess.

39:07.545 --> 39:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It's another
nail in Schengen's
coffin.

39:10.181 --> 39:16.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARS LOKKE RASMUSSEN: Hopefully
not. What
we need now is European leaders
who should

39:16.888 --> 39:22.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
respond to this. We have been
pushing and
pushing for a European solution.
So, this

39:23.027 --> 39:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a clear signal that your
Europe now needs
to take decisions which can
protect the external

39:31.869 --> 39:33.705 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
borders.

39:33.738 --> 39:36.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Denmark's
actions have been
greeted with disappointment in
Germany, which,

39:36.374 --> 39:40.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
along with Sweden, has welcomed
most refugees
during this crisis.

39:40.545 --> 39:44.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The German Foreign Ministry
spokesman described
freedom of movement as the
European Union's

39:44.882 --> 39:49.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greatest achievement, but he
warned that the
Schengen area was in danger. He
said it was

39:49.187 --> 39:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crucial that common solutions
were found to
the migrant flow.

39:53.658 --> 39:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But throughout this crisis,
national interest
has taken priority over European
unity. Today's

39:59.597 --> 40:01.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
developments reinforce that
trend.

40:01.933 --> 40:08.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Copenhagen.

40:08.406 --> 40:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For thousands of
young veterans
in America, putting the wars in
Afghanistan

40:20.318 --> 40:26.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Iraq behind them remains a
constant challenge.
For some, starting a family is
an important

40:26.424 --> 40:28.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of the healing process.

40:28.059 --> 40:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as the "NewsHour"'s William
Brangham
reports, even that can be a
struggle.

40:33.331 --> 40:38.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All newlyweds
face challenges,
but Jason and Rachel Hallett
have more challenges

40:38.936 --> 40:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than most. Jason is a triple
amputee. Back
in 2010, at age 19, this young
Marine lost

40:45.410 --> 40:49.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two legs and an arm when he
stepped on an
IED while on patrol in
Afghanistan.

40:49.547 --> 40:53.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CPL. JASON HALLETT (RET.), U.S.
Marine Corps:
When 9/11 and everything
happened, I was -- I

40:53.251 --> 40:57.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a little bit of interest to
join the military.
But, as soon as that happened,
it just became

40:57.188 --> 41:00.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- everything was circling
around me joining
the military.

41:00.558 --> 41:05.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After his
injury, barely
clinging to life, and riddled
with infections,

41:05.163 --> 41:10.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jason was cared for at U.S.
military facilities
in Germany, Maryland and
California.

41:10.268 --> 41:13.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hadn't been in touch with
Rachel since
they dated back in eighth grade.
But, in the

41:13.871 --> 41:15.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hospital, he found her again on
Facebook.

41:15.673 --> 41:19.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL HALLETT, Wife of Jason
Hallett: He
sends me this friend request a
couple years

41:19.243 --> 41:26.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after I had kind of given up.
And when I saw
what had happened, I just
started crying.

41:26.684 --> 41:33.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hadn't posted, like, what
happened. But
he had, like -- his picture
obviously was

41:33.291 --> 41:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different than last time I
remembered him,
and said that he worked for the
Marine Corps,

41:38.296 --> 41:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so I kind of put two pieces
together.

41:40.231 --> 41:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Facebook led
to phone calls,
which led to a visit, and then a
wedding day.

41:49.140 --> 41:55.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They now live in Windsor,
Colorado. Jason's
studying to be a certified
financial planner.

41:55.780 --> 42:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rachel baby-sits to make extra
money, but
her full-time job now really is
caring for

42:00.752 --> 42:04.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jason, and she gets a small
stipend from the
VA for that work.

42:04.522 --> 42:09.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the Halletts want most is
to start a
family. But there's a problem.

42:09.093 --> 42:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL HALLETT: We had just kind
of been told
that it would probably be a
problem because

42:12.764 --> 42:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of some of his injuries and
where his shrapnel
is. There's tons of shrapnel
everywhere throughout

42:19.704 --> 42:20.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his body.

42:20.671 --> 42:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Still in your
body today?

42:22.440 --> 42:25.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CPL. JASON HALLETT: Yes. So,
basically, one
of the pieces had actually
connected itself

42:25.109 --> 42:28.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to one of my testicles. And so I
now have
to take testosterone injections
basically

42:29.013 --> 42:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get me back to normal. And
with that, one
of the side effects is, it
basically kills

42:34.519 --> 42:36.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the sperm off.

42:36.387 --> 42:41.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In order to
conceive a child,
the Halletts have to go through
lengthy in

42:41.225 --> 42:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vitro fertilization treatments.
In vitro is
an expensive process. It
typically costs about

42:46.297 --> 42:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$12,000 to $13,000 per try, and
the first
try often doesn't work, nor does
the second.

42:53.971 --> 42:59.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the bills can stack up. But,
unlike all
the other medical treatment
related to Jason's

42:59.210 --> 43:04.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
injuries, the VA doesn't cover
IVF treatment
for wounded vets, and so the
young couple

43:04.182 --> 43:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are paying for this themselves.

43:06.851 --> 43:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress passed a law in 1992
that led to
the Veterans Administration
banning coverage

43:11.155 --> 43:16.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of any in vitro fertilization
services. That
means that for an estimated
1,800 veterans

43:16.661 --> 43:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Jason, they will also have
to spend tens
of thousands of dollars to get
pregnant and

43:21.432 --> 43:23.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
start a family.

43:23.234 --> 43:27.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Patty Murray wants that
to change.
This Democrat from Washington
state sits on

43:27.171 --> 43:31.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Senate Veterans Affairs
Committee, and
she wrote a bill that would lift
the VA's

43:31.742 --> 43:35.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVF ban. But for six years, her
efforts have
been blocked.

43:35.279 --> 43:38.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. PATTY MURRAY (D),
Washington: To me,
when someone goes off to fight a
war for us,

43:39.016 --> 43:44.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a man or a woman, we have an
obligation as
the country to make them whole
again, as whole

43:44.322 --> 43:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we can. And, certainly,
having a family,
having children, having that
kind of quality

43:49.861 --> 43:53.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of life that a lot of Americans
want is something
that we should make sure they
get.

43:53.798 --> 43:57.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why is it that
the VA doesn't
pay for these services now?

43:57.268 --> 44:03.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. PATTY MURRAY: I have been
told that it
is because of the cost. I
believe that that

44:03.307 --> 44:08.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shouldn't be an issue. This is
something that
is a cost of war and that, as
Americans, we

44:08.379 --> 44:15.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should do what we can for the
people who served
our country. So, the stated
reason is money,

44:15.486 --> 44:16.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but I'm skeptical.

44:16.787 --> 44:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What do you
think the issue
it really is?

44:18.923 --> 44:24.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. PATTY MURRAY: It is hard to
get anyone
to say anything past cost. I
would say to

44:24.562 --> 44:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them, let's get over the cost.
If there's
another issue, tell us what it
is.

44:28.299 --> 44:32.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, what is
the cost? One
estimate says covering IVF and
other fertility

44:32.670 --> 44:39.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treatments for veterans for five
years would
be $578 million. Some IVF
advocates say that

44:39.210 --> 44:40.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
estimate is inflated.

44:40.978 --> 44:44.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We reached out to the two
Republicans who
run the Veterans Affairs
Committees in the

44:44.382 --> 44:48.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House and the Senate. Neither
would speak
with us. Republican Congressman
Jeff Miller

44:48.486 --> 44:53.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Florida, chairman of the
House VA Committee,
gave us a statement saying he
was trying to

44:53.057 --> 44:57.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
balance the needs of veterans
with the concerns
over IVF.

44:57.295 --> 45:02.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Several sources told the
"NewsHour" that these
concerns over IVF apparently
come from pro-life

45:02.133 --> 45:06.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organizations who object to the
treatments.
These groups argue that, because
some of the

45:06.604 --> 45:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
embryos created or stored during
IVF sometimes
get destroyed, IVF is then
similar to abortion.

45:13.044 --> 45:16.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We reached out to the main
pro-life groups
to talk about their concerns,
but they all

45:16.447 --> 45:18.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
declined our requests.

45:18.215 --> 45:22.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. PATTY MURRAY: What I would
answer to
that is that this is a decision
each one of

45:22.253 --> 45:26.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these men and woman have to make
on their
own. And if they decide this is
the way that

45:26.724 --> 45:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can have a family and
become whole again,
that decision should be up to
them.

45:30.995 --> 45:38.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But our country shouldn't be
deciding for
one philosophy, if it's a
religious philosophy,

45:38.369 --> 45:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a ban on all Americans who
served our country
in having the ability to have a
child.

45:44.108 --> 45:48.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It appears
unlikely Congress
will change the VA's policy
before the next

45:48.546 --> 45:53.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election. But for young veterans
and their
families who struggle to afford
IVF, time

45:53.317 --> 45:55.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is very short.

45:55.052 --> 45:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. GILBERT MOTTLA, Shady Grove
Fertility:
We're really talking about some
1,800 Iraq

45:58.055 --> 46:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Afghanistan veterans who are
now aging.
This one group of war injured,
we really need

46:06.330 --> 46:11.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to move this legislation forward
and get these
individuals the coverage they
need before

46:11.802 --> 46:13.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they lose their own reproductive
potential.

46:13.971 --> 46:17.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Doctor Gilbert
Mottla is
a fertility doctor in Maryland
who works with

46:17.508 --> 46:22.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military families. He's pushing
the VA to
change its policy, which he says
is driven

46:22.446 --> 46:27.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in part by misconceptions about
IVF, like
the concern that IVF causes
multiple pregnancies

46:27.885 --> 46:29.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at once, leading to selective
abortions.

46:29.854 --> 46:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. GILBERT MOTTLA: I think it
really is a
misunderstanding of what the
procedure is

46:34.558 --> 46:40.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about. And it generates -- goes
back to the
early '90s, when in vitro was
very, very new.

46:40.498 --> 46:45.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a 34-year-old procedure
now that has
come of age tactically.

46:45.970 --> 46:50.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And back in the early '90s, when
Congress
was looking at this, it was a
new procedure,

46:50.241 --> 46:55.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not very successful, fraught
with some problems
of multiple pregnancy, which
really are over

46:55.413 --> 46:57.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in many ways.

46:57.314 --> 46:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There's no
sign Jason Hallett
is at all frustrated with the
injuries he's

46:59.717 --> 47:03.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suffered and what they have done
to his life,
but the same isn't true for the
way he feels

47:03.888 --> 47:05.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about Congress.

47:05.656 --> 47:08.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think about the
people who have
been holding this piece of
legislation up?

47:08.592 --> 47:13.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CPL. JASON HALLETT: It's very
angering. And
it brings a lot of resentment
towards my active

47:13.764 --> 47:17.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
service and stuff. I don't
regret joining
the Marine Corps. But the simple
fact is that

47:17.935 --> 47:21.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they told us that we'd be taken
care of us
if we got injured.

47:21.338 --> 47:25.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I guarantee that, if it was
a congressman's
kid or them themselves that
wanted IVF, and

47:26.010 --> 47:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they had to go through the same
process and
the same hoops, that they would
be doing everything

47:29.947 --> 47:31.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they can to make it happen.

47:31.716 --> 47:35.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL HALLETT: It's hard to
know that he
would protect them and he would
give up all

47:35.853 --> 47:42.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this for them, and they will
not take just
a little bit of time to try to
fix this issue

47:42.326 --> 47:45.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we are having.

47:45.062 --> 47:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rachel is
undergoing the
first steps of her fertility
treatment. If

47:49.400 --> 47:54.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all goes well, she could be
pregnant as early
as February. If it doesn't, they
will probably

47:54.305 --> 47:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need loans for any additional
treatment.

47:56.874 --> 48:06.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Windsor, Colorado.

JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the most
prestigious
international literary awards is
the annual

48:15.960 --> 48:18.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Man Booker Prize.

48:18.195 --> 48:23.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marlon James, a professor of
English at Macalester
College in Minnesota, is the
first Jamaican

48:23.634 --> 48:28.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
writer to win for his novel "A
Brief History
of Seven Killings."

48:28.272 --> 48:31.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown talked to him at
the Miami Book
Fair in November.

48:31.976 --> 48:36.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This novel is set
in a Jamaica
you grew up in, right, in the
1970s, '80s?

48:36.547 --> 48:37.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A violent time.

48:37.915 --> 48:40.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARLON JAMES, Author, "A Brief
History of
Seven Killings": Yes.

48:40.651 --> 48:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a violent time, but it
was also a time
of a huge explosion in Jamaican
culture. And,

48:48.826 --> 48:54.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funny enough, 1976 is in some
ways responsible
-- or the 1970s is in some way
responsible

48:54.198 --> 49:01.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for my writing career, because
the whole idea
of writing in the voice of the
people, writing

49:01.338 --> 49:05.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the voice that comes out of
my own mouth
is a reggae concept. And it's
something that

49:05.943 --> 49:11.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also came out of the 70s, which
is not to
turn a blind eye. It was a
horrible time a

49:11.382 --> 49:13.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lot of the time.

49:13.184 --> 49:18.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But pick up on
that. Reggae
influenced so many people in
terms of music,

49:18.122 --> 49:20.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it influenced your ear, the
voice?

49:20.391 --> 49:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARLON JAMES: Yes, not just --
there's quite
a few Caribbean writers, the
poets first,

49:26.964 --> 49:34.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly, but the idea that you
-- the voice
of -- the voice that was in your
mouth, which

49:34.438 --> 49:38.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has always been called broken
English, as
if it needs to be fixed, could
be used to

49:38.609 --> 49:45.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell very complicated things,
stories that
have no resolution, characters
that you can't

49:45.416 --> 49:52.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
just dismiss or outright
condemn, not falling
into this kind of Stepin Fetchit
kind of comedy.

49:52.423 --> 49:56.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was something that reggae
did. And that
was also something that came out
of the '70s.

49:56.293 --> 49:59.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's sort of taking cultural
ownership of
your own voice.

49:59.630 --> 50:04.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The plot revolves
around an
attempted assassination of Bob
Marley, but

50:04.869 --> 50:06.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's not a fictional biography
of Marley.

50:06.937 --> 50:07.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARLON JAMES: No.

50:07.905 --> 50:09.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's just in the
background.

50:09.807 --> 50:12.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You didn't want to do that. You
wanted to
set it with him in the center,
but then everything

50:12.676 --> 50:14.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

50:14.478 --> 50:16.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARLON JAMES: Him in the center,
but spinning
-- but the story is really about
what's going

50:16.614 --> 50:18.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on around him.

50:18.415 --> 50:21.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You like that
sense of being
in history, but not right in the
history that

50:21.185 --> 50:22.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we read in the history books?
Yes.

50:22.987 --> 50:27.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARLON JAMES: Yes, and it's been
something
that has been a concern of mine
from my first

50:27.091 --> 50:34.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
novel, this sort of interior
history of Jamaica,
because it starts off being
about a bunch

50:34.465 --> 50:38.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of men and women in the whole
periphery of
Marley, but then it goes on to
talk about

50:38.969 --> 50:44.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Cold War and how the '70s
created the
'80s, and then how we're still
reeling from

50:44.508 --> 50:46.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that and making sense of that.

50:46.510 --> 50:52.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You talked about
writing for
a sense of sight, for a sense of
smell, that

50:52.616 --> 50:58.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of sensory perception that
comes -- you
feel that in your writing?

50:58.289 --> 51:00.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARLON JAMES: Yes.

51:00.190 --> 51:04.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I feel that it's something that
I teach and
something that I have been very
sort of deliberate

51:04.595 --> 51:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, because I think we overly
on sight,
and there's more to it than
that. A writer

51:10.234 --> 51:15.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is really good at invoking
all the details
is Sebastian Junger. And he will
sometimes

51:15.806 --> 51:20.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nail all five senses in the
first 50 words.
I don't even know if he is doing
it consciously.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, when...

51:21.211 --> 51:22.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. But you're
doing it consciously.

51:23.013 --> 51:27.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARLON JAMES: I do it
consciously, because
I do -- I am a very -- it's
funny, because

51:27.618 --> 51:31.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm actually a very -- I'm not a
mechanical
writer, but I'm a mechanical
writing teacher.

51:31.422 --> 51:32.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes?

51:32.823 --> 51:35.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARLON JAMES: And you know when
people say,
I felt like I was there?

51:35.759 --> 51:40.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they are saying is, you
unlocked all
five senses. And I think, for
example, smell

51:40.698 --> 51:46.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carries memories, smell carries
nostalgia.
When was the last time a book
made you taste

51:46.637 --> 51:51.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something? And I think this is
really, really
important for this sort of
immersive feel,

51:51.175 --> 51:56.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially, in my case, where I
am taking
them into really negative
territory and really

51:56.213 --> 51:57.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dark areas.

51:57.948 --> 52:02.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So it's not just
paint a portrait
that I can see. It's put me in
there.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARLON JAMES: It's putting you
in there.

52:04.555 --> 52:08.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're going to have food,
cook it or at
least let me -- to smell it.
What does the

52:08.625 --> 52:13.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paint smell like? I was speaking
to the Royal
Society for the Blind in
England. And they

52:13.864 --> 52:22.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were giving me a special sort of
recognition
for the book, because it focuses
on all other

52:22.806 --> 52:24.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
senses.

52:24.541 --> 52:27.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Someone who is visually impaired
can still
get a full sense of the novel,
as opposed

52:27.544 --> 52:32.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to so much of it being locked
out from them
because we're writing so much on
sight. A

52:32.649 --> 52:35.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person who has been blind all
his life has
no idea what red means.

52:35.619 --> 52:38.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. So how do
you write red,
right?

52:38.288 --> 52:42.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARLON JAMES: That's a question
I ask my class.
Tell somebody who has been blind
all their

52:42.359 --> 52:44.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life what red is. What is --
describe red.

52:44.194 --> 52:47.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. So do you
know the impact
of winning the Booker?

52:47.231 --> 52:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARLON JAMES: Man, I have no
idea.

52:50.034 --> 52:54.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's nice seeing it on the
bestseller list.
I'm not complaining.

52:54.204 --> 52:55.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:56.006 --> 53:00.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARLON JAMES: I really hope it
makes people
more curious about Caribbean
lit, and beyond

53:00.611 --> 53:01.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Caribbean lit.

53:01.378 --> 53:02.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

53:02.746 --> 53:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which is very
rich in a way
that we don't know.

53:03.447 --> 53:05.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARLON JAMES: It is very rich.

53:05.315 --> 53:08.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even when we talk about rich
Caribbean
lit, we tend to talk just about
English-speaking.

53:08.786 --> 53:15.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cuban lit has never needed
anybody's help.
There's great literature coming
out of Puerto

53:15.059 --> 53:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rico. There's always been great
literature
coming out of Haiti, Suriname.
The Dutch Caribbean

53:22.466 --> 53:27.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also writes, and, also, some
great new novelists
coming out of Barbados and
Jamaica.

53:27.204 --> 53:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, "A
Brief History
of Seven Killings."

53:30.307 --> 53:35.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marlon James, thank you. And,
again, congratulations.

53:35.446 --> 53:41.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARLON JAMES: Thanks for having
me.

53:41.752 --> 53:46.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A news update
before we go.

53:46.323 --> 53:51.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late this evening, the White
House released
some details of the president's
executive

53:51.095 --> 53:56.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actions on guns. He will call
for background
checks on online sales and gun
shows, have

53:56.900 --> 54:04.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FBI hire 230 new people to
process those
checks, and ask Congress for a
$500 million

54:04.408 --> 54:10.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investment in mental health. Mr.
Obama will
make the formal announcement
tomorrow.

54:10.481 --> 54:13.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

54:13.050 --> 54:18.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank

54:18.122 --> 54:18.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you, and good night.
