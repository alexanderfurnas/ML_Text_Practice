JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
release of Otto Warmbier from
captivity in North Korea.

00:04.566 --> 00:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The American college student
was arrested almost 18 months
ago during a trip to the

00:09.466 --> 00:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reclusive nation, and he was
sentenced to 15 years in prison.

00:13.700 --> 00:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This morning came word suddenly
that the United States had
secured his release, but under

00:18.500 --> 00:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
apparently desperate
circumstances.

00:21.466 --> 00:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Warmbier is comatose,
and has been for a year.

00:24.733 --> 00:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An American delegation in
Pyongyang petitioned for his
immediate release yesterday.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our chief foreign
affairs correspondent,
Margaret Warner, reports.

00:33.666 --> 00:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: At the president's
direction, the Department

00:35.633 --> 00:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of State has secured
the release of Otto
Warmbier from North Korea.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: The
announcement came from
Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson at a Senate

00:43.633 --> 00:45.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
budget hearing.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 22-year-old University of
Virginia student was finally
free, after being jailed by the

00:51.133 --> 00:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
North's repressive
regime for 17 months.

00:54.900 --> 00:58.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Anna Fifield has been
reporting the story for
The Washington Post.

00:58.566 --> 01:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She spoke via Skype from Tokyo.

01:00.733 --> 01:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA FIFIELD, The Washington
Post: What I have been told
is that, last Monday, June

01:04.933 --> 01:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 5th, the North Koreans
actually approached Americans
who they talk to, and they said

01:08.900 --> 01:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Otto Warmbier was in
a coma and had been in a
coma for more than a year.

01:15.433 --> 01:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that started the
ball rolling to have
him medically evacuated.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The North Koreans said
that he came down with
a case of botulism soon
after his sentencing,

01:26.000 --> 01:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that he was given a sleeping
pill and fell into a coma,
and he didn't wake up from

01:30.900 --> 01:33.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

01:33.300 --> 01:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Warmbier's
parents confirmed their
son is in a coma, and
had been medically

01:35.533 --> 01:37.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evacuated.

01:37.466 --> 01:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement to the Associated
Press, they also said: "We
want the world to know how

01:41.933 --> 01:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we and our son have been
brutalized and terrorized
by the pariah regime."

01:49.066 --> 01:53.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Warmbier was arrested
after he allegedly took
a propaganda poster from
the wall of a Pyongyang

01:54.166 --> 01:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hotel on New Year's Eve, 2015.

01:57.066 --> 02:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He'd been in North Korea
as part of a tour group.

02:00.300 --> 02:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In March last year,
he was sentenced to
15 years hard labor.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OTTO WARMBIER, Released North
Korean Prison: I have made
the worst mistake of my life.

02:07.133 --> 02:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In the past,
Pyongyang has used detained
American citizens to try to

02:11.933 --> 02:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exert leverage over the U.S.

02:14.500 --> 02:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Anna Fifield says, this
time, the North had appeared
unwilling to bargain.

02:21.433 --> 02:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It didn't respond to U.S. offers
to send a high-level envoy
to discuss Warmbier and three

02:25.800 --> 02:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other Americans
held by the North.

02:28.133 --> 02:31.033 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
One was arrested
just last month.

02:31.033 --> 02:33.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Pyongyang's attitude
changed in May.

02:33.400 --> 02:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It agreed to let Swedish
diplomats visit the prisoners,
and with news of Warmbier's dire

02:40.400 --> 02:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condition, Pyongyang urgently
requested a meeting with a
top U.S. official at the U.N.

02:44.266 --> 02:45.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last week.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At that point, Fifield said,
President Trump got involved.

02:48.733 --> 02:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA FIFIELD: Once Otto
Warmbier's condition was known,
I'm told that the president did

02:53.100 --> 02:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
become involved, that he was
informed, that he personally
gave the order to do everything

02:57.700 --> 03:01.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they could to
get Otto Warmbier out.

03:01.433 --> 03:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The release
comes at a time of heightened
tensions between Washington

03:05.933 --> 03:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the regime of Kim Jong-un.

03:09.466 --> 03:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pyongyang has ramped up its
nuclear and missile programs.

03:13.300 --> 03:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In response, the U.S. has taken
a tough tack, and recently
began deploying the advanced

03:19.733 --> 03:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anti-missile defense known
as THAAD to South Korea.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Fifield says another
motivation may have
driven the North Koreans.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA FIFIELD: I think the North
Koreans have probably realized
that they did need to get

03:30.933 --> 03:35.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rid of Otto Warmbier
at some stage, that he
wasn't recovering, and
they needed to hand

03:35.466 --> 03:37.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him back.

03:37.566 --> 03:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The release
also coincides with former NBA
player Dennis Rodman's latest

03:40.900 --> 03:42.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
visit to Pyongyang.

03:42.966 --> 03:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fifield says she was told
Rodman's visit had nothing to
with the freeing of Warmbier.

03:49.800 --> 03:54.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Warmbier was flown first
to an American military
medical facility in
Japan, then flown on to

03:55.500 --> 03:57.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Cincinnati, near
his family's home.

03:57.566 --> 04:00.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
