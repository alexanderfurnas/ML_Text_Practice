04:11.017 --> 04:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FAR FROM IT.

04:15.555 --> 04:18.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVENTUALLY, THEY ASSUME THAT

04:18.191 --> 04:20.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WILL BE SOME KIND OF TAX

04:24.831 --> 04:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE

04:27.533 --> 04:28.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PARTICIPATING IN THE PARIS

04:33.840 --> 04:35.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:35.908 --> 04:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PERSON THAT CAN MAKE THAT

04:36.876 --> 04:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECISION.

04:37.543 --> 04:38.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT A UNILATERAL ONE.

04:38.811 --> 04:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TAKES QUITE A BIT OF TIME.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, IT'S REALLY INTERESTING

04:43.850 --> 04:45.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE OVER WHAT

04:45.018 --> 04:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO ON THE PARIS ACCORDS.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST BECAUSE, FOR PRESIDENT

04:49.222 --> 04:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP, THAT WAS A SIGNATURE

04:50.690 --> 04:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN PROMISE.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS EXACT WORDS WERE HE WOULD

CANCEL THE PARIS CLIMATE CHANGE

ACCORD.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S TECHNICALLY NOT POSSIBLE

04:58.298 --> 04:59.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN'T RIP UP A MULTILATERAL

05:01.401 --> 05:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCORD THAT'S BEEN LEGALLY

05:03.336 --> 05:06.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATIFIED AND SIGNED BY OVER 190

COUNTRIES.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE U.S. COULD WITHDRAW,

05:09.609 --> 05:10.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD LEGALLY WITHDRAW, AND THAT

05:10.943 --> 05:12.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE A HUGE BLOW TO THE

05:12.779 --> 05:14.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCORD.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW,

05:15.181 --> 05:16.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGH, A LOT OF PRESIDENT

URGED HIM TO GO AHEAD AND ACT ON

THAT, TO ANNOUNCE HE'S GOING TO

05:23.456 --> 05:24.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHDRAW.

05:24.090 --> 05:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S GOT ANOTHER SET OF ADVISERS

05:28.294 --> 05:31.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO ARE SAYING, LOOK, THE

BROKER OF THE PARIS ACCORD, IT

05:41.874 --> 05:43.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD SEND A MESSAGE TO THE REST

05:43.609 --> 05:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE WORLD THAT THE U.S.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T KEEP ITS WORD, AND THAT

05:46.279 --> 05:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN

AND AGAIN.

05:48.648 --> 05:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
