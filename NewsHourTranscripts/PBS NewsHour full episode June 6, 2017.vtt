JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.933 --> 00:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: As
the Trump White House juggles
political battles on multiple

00:11.133 --> 00:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fronts, its GOP allies
in Congress confront
a packed agenda and a
limited summer calendar.

00:18.566 --> 00:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: separating fact from
fiction -- why some school
teachers are focusing on giving

00:25.566 --> 00:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
younger generations the
tools to navigate today's
complex media landscape.

00:28.300 --> 00:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE BEACH, Media Literacy
Advocate: When they're using
their phones, they may know

00:32.666 --> 00:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how to make something
work, but they don't have
the ethical piece, the
emotional intelligence

00:38.233 --> 00:39.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
piece.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a wilderness out
there for some kids.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a
new Broadway hit with
a message -- how the
musical "Dear Evan Hansen"

00:48.000 --> 00:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is giving teens hope for getting
through high school's isolation
in a social media world.

00:54.633 --> 00:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN PLATT, Actor: The
chance to sort of connect
and realize that nobody's
experience of loneliness

00:57.533 --> 01:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is unique and that everybody
at some time or another feels
on the outside looking in

01:01.533 --> 01:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a really powerful
thing right now.

01:03.166 --> 01:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:10.833 --> 01:13.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:13.700 --> 01:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia is denying
that it tried to hack U.S.
voting computer software and

01:23.700 --> 01:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
equipment before last year's
presidential election.

01:26.933 --> 01:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The online magazine
The Intercept reported
the allegation, based
on a National Security

01:32.600 --> 01:34.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Agency document.

01:34.733 --> 01:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Kremlin spokesman dismissed
it today, saying - - quote --
"This assertion has absolutely

01:39.933 --> 01:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nothing to do with reality."

01:42.066 --> 01:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Washington, the U.S.
secretary of homeland
security, John Kelly,
was asked about it at

01:46.133 --> 01:47.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Senate hearing.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:49.633 --> 01:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D),
Missouri: Are you deferring
the investigation of
this to the FBI, or is

01:52.600 --> 01:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the department actually actively
engaged in investigating
the penetration or attempts

01:59.633 --> 02:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to penetrate the voter files in
this country immediately before
the election by the Russian

02:02.000 --> 02:03.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government?

02:03.966 --> 02:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary:
I share your concern.

02:05.933 --> 02:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't disagree with anything
you said relative to the
sanctity of our voting process.

02:08.333 --> 02:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, it's an interagency
-- it should be an
interagency investigation.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that is taking place.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DHS will be part of that.

02:16.333 --> 02:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
ranking Democrat on
the Senate Intelligence
Committee, Virginia's

02:20.800 --> 02:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Warner, told USA Today
that the Russian cyber-attacks
were even more extensive.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he said he doesn't think
that actual votes were changed.

02:30.333 --> 02:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Reality Winner, the Georgia
woman charged, apparently, with
leaking the NSA report, remained

02:36.633 --> 02:37.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in jail.

02:37.633 --> 02:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her mother called her a patriot.

02:40.733 --> 02:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump today waded into
the political conflict over the
Persian Gulf nation of Qatar,

02:46.900 --> 02:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where the U.S.
has 10,000 troops.

02:48.966 --> 02:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain
and the UAE all broke ties
with the kingdom on Monday and

02:55.100 --> 02:58.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accused it of supporting
terror groups and Iran.

02:58.066 --> 03:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jordan scaled back ties today.

03:00.800 --> 03:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Mr. Trump appeared to
endorse the move in a tweet
that said: "Perhaps this will be

03:07.233 --> 03:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the beginning of the end to
the horror of terrorism."

03:09.900 --> 03:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This in contrast to yesterday,
when the White House said the
president wanted to work with

03:14.200 --> 03:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the parties to
de-escalate the situation.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
British police have identified
the third suspect in Saturday's
deadly knife and van attack

03:24.000 --> 03:25.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in London.

03:25.966 --> 03:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was 22-year-old Youssef
Zaghba, an Italian national
of Moroccan descent.

03:30.633 --> 03:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All three attackers were
shot dead by police.

03:33.700 --> 03:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also today, hundreds across the
country gathered for a minute
of silence to remember those

03:38.300 --> 03:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who died or were wounded.

03:40.833 --> 03:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the mayor of
London, Sadiq Khan, brushed off
criticism from President Trump.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has written a
series of tweets ridiculing the
mayor since Saturday's attack.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, Khan said he's
much more concerned about the
invitation extended last year to

03:57.000 --> 03:59.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump to come
to Great Britain.

03:59.066 --> 04:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SADIQ KHAN, Mayor of London:
I really couldn't be bothered
about what Donald Trump tweets.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm not -- I don't how
to tell you this, but
I really don't care.

04:05.033 --> 04:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the important issue is
that, you know, Prime Minister
Theresa May offered Donald

04:09.900 --> 04:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump a state visit moments
after he was elected president.

04:12.100 --> 04:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I said at the time,
I don't think a state
visit was appropriate,
and my views haven't

04:17.566 --> 04:19.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
changed.

04:19.066 --> 04:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
didn't respond directly to Khan.

04:21.166 --> 04:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, a spokesman said
the president appreciates
the queen's invitation.

04:24.600 --> 04:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In France, a man swinging a
hammer attacked police outside
Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris

04:31.466 --> 04:34.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

04:34.033 --> 04:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He allegedly shouted
"This is for Syria" and
struck one officer before
being shot and wounded.

04:39.466 --> 04:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dozens of police took over the
scene, and blocked at least
600 people from leaving the

04:43.200 --> 04:44.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cathedral.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were slowly being
released later in the evening.

04:47.900 --> 04:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's word that ride-sharing
giant Uber has fired 20 people
after an internal investigation

04:54.566 --> 04:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into sexual harassment
and other complaints.

04:57.366 --> 05:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Various news outlets report
that the moves were announced
today at a staff meeting in

05:02.033 --> 05:04.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
San Francisco.

05:04.133 --> 05:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A law firm investigated more
than 200 allegations of sexual
harassment going back to 2012.

05:10.433 --> 05:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost
47 points to close at 21136.

05:16.766 --> 05:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq fell 20, and
the S&amp;P 500 dropped six.

05:23.666 --> 05:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Republican leaders in Congress
struggle to their to-do

05:28.833 --> 05:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
list before the August recess;
the fight begins in the ISIS
stronghold of Raqqa; teaching

05:34.200 --> 05:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students to tell the
difference between fact
and fiction; and much more.

05:50.433 --> 05:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Members of Congress returned
to Washington today for what
could be a make-or-break few

05:54.633 --> 05:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weeks for Republicans' packed
agenda, that as the Russia
investigations and the upcoming

06:01.633 --> 06:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
testimony of former FBI Director
James Comey continue to add
complications for the party.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins reports.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: The Senate
will come to order.

06:11.133 --> 06:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: From
the Senate floor...

06:12.333 --> 06:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Good morning.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This hearing will come to order.

06:15.333 --> 06:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: ... to
committee rooms, to Capitol Hill
hallways, congress is back from

06:20.500 --> 06:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
recess, and facing big
issues with little time.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Republicans are at
a pivotal point, trying to
write their health care bill.

06:27.366 --> 06:29.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:29.366 --> 06:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: We had another of
our ongoing discussions about

06:31.400 --> 06:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the way forward on health care.

06:33.400 --> 06:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're getting closer to having
a proposal that we will be
bringing up in the near future.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They would
like a vote this month, but
Democrats point out Republican

06:43.000 --> 06:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
senators don't yet have a plan
with enough votes on their own.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: I have a message for
our Republican colleagues.

06:51.066 --> 06:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very simple: Abandon
repeal, stop sabotaging
our health care system,
and you will find

06:56.366 --> 07:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Democrats waiting to
work with you to improve
the health care system.

07:00.900 --> 07:05.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The White
House, meanwhile, stressed the
will on health care, but not

07:05.166 --> 07:07.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the way.

07:07.166 --> 07:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House
Press Secretary: By and large,
every elected Republican in

07:08.833 --> 07:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the House and the Senate
campaigned on this for
the last seven years.

07:11.400 --> 07:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But with health
care still unfinished, that
means a backed-up GOP agenda,

07:18.333 --> 07:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with infrastructure, tax reform,
spending bills, not to mention
raising the debt ceiling,

07:22.900 --> 07:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all needing attention
soon in order to pass.

07:24.966 --> 07:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: What a great team
this is, what an unbelievable

07:27.500 --> 07:29.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All of that
brought the GOP's key leaders,
House and Senate, to the White

07:32.033 --> 07:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
House to meet with
President Trump today.

07:34.066 --> 07:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: So we're working
very hard on massive tax
cuts, and we're working very,

07:38.433 --> 07:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very hard on the health care.

07:41.666 --> 07:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we're going
to have some very pleasant
surprises for a lot of people.

07:44.500 --> 07:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But even this
meeting had a nod to fired
FBI Director James Comey's

07:49.000 --> 07:50.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
big hearing this week.

07:50.366 --> 07:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I wish him luck.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, everybody.

07:53.866 --> 07:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And the cloud
that continues to hang over
the president's own agenda.

07:56.266 --> 07:58.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
Lisa joins me now.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She is joined by
our own John Yang.

08:01.066 --> 08:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Great to have both of you here.

08:02.333 --> 08:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, John, I'm going
the start with you.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just heard Lisa's
reporting about what
they're doing on the hill.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is the White House
trying to do right now?

08:08.766 --> 08:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, right now,
they're pushing infrastructure
this week, yesterday, airways,

08:15.366 --> 08:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tomorrow, waterways, Thursday,
highways and streets,
Friday, permitting process.

08:18.433 --> 08:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you might think that
means they have got an
infrastructure bill ready to go.

08:21.766 --> 08:23.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

08:23.466 --> 08:26.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is concepts,
it's proposals, it's
broad policy ideas.

08:26.766 --> 08:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They really don't have
a timeline yet of when
they think they will
have an infrastructure

08:30.233 --> 08:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bill ready to
introduce in Congress.

08:32.466 --> 08:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't even know yet
whether it will be one bill or a
series of legislative packages.

08:38.633 --> 08:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're still on
the drawing board.

08:39.900 --> 08:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sounds
like it's still early.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Lisa, talk specifically
about the time crunch.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is Congress
dealing with here?

08:45.233 --> 08:48.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think
Congress is looking at
essentially a 60-yard
field goal to try

08:48.500 --> 08:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and get everything
done that it has to.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It has to be perfect.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look at the calendar, what
Congress and Republicans
hoped to do this year.

08:55.766 --> 08:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is what they wanted to
happen, have health care passed
in February and March and then

08:59.833 --> 09:01.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tax reform.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We should be talking
about a bill right now.

09:02.766 --> 09:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what they wanted.

09:04.466 --> 09:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's look at what's
actually happened instead.

09:06.666 --> 09:09.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The calendar now instead
has health care now.

09:09.666 --> 09:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obviously, that wasn't
passed until May.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then Senate is
dealing with it now.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So what's happened
to tax reform?

09:15.833 --> 09:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that's been kicked back
because we see the debt ceiling
and the spending bill coming

09:19.666 --> 09:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up this summer, further jamming
the calendar, meaning tax
reform might be pushed back to

09:24.500 --> 09:26.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the fall, Judy.

09:26.533 --> 09:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as John said, this is
one reason there's not a
timeline for infrastructure.

09:29.866 --> 09:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It simply doesn't fit, and
it's not clear that all
these things fit either.

09:33.933 --> 09:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're never seen Congress
be able to get this much
done in that amount of time.

09:38.066 --> 09:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, as Lisa
is suggesting, in addition to
infrastructure, there is more

09:41.800 --> 09:43.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that the White House
wants to get through.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's right.

09:45.266 --> 09:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want -- they have got two
things on their wish list, one
thing on their must-do list.

09:47.633 --> 09:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the wish list, they want
to get a health care vote
before the August recess.

09:51.433 --> 09:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They of course had hoped
to have that done by now.

09:54.866 --> 09:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, as Lisa has pointed
out, they want the tax bill
introduced after Labor Day.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were hoping to have
that passed by August.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The must-do list, they
have got to raise the
debt ceiling, big debate
inside the administration,

10:07.833 --> 10:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you do that clean with
nothing attached to it, or do
you have spending cuts and other

10:14.800 --> 10:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spending reforms in order
to get conservatives, fiscal
conservatives to vote for it?

10:18.400 --> 10:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
Lisa, again, back to the
Hill, when Republican
leaders hear all this,

10:23.100 --> 10:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how do they think they can get
it done, or do they really?

10:25.566 --> 10:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes,
reality is a tricky concept
right now on Capitol Hill.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is what I have gotten
from sources that I trust.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They believe there will
be a Senate vote on
health care before August.

10:34.933 --> 10:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there's big questions over
whether the House and Senate
will come together on a health

10:38.966 --> 10:40.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care package after that.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's very much in question.

10:42.800 --> 10:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tax reform, people are openly
talking now that they're not
sure that they can actually

10:47.066 --> 10:48.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get that done.

10:48.633 --> 10:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm hearing voices in the
Republican Party saying...

10:49.733 --> 10:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This year or...

10:51.800 --> 10:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This year,
and maybe not in the next
cycle, because there's so much

10:54.933 --> 10:57.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
heavy lifting.

10:57.100 --> 11:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're now even starting to
say maybe that becomes a tax
cut, instead of sweeping tax

11:00.733 --> 11:02.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reform.

11:02.766 --> 11:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meantime,
John, at the White House,
the president is saying some

11:05.900 --> 11:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things, his aides and
spokespeople are sometimes
- - in fact, often saying
something different.

11:12.866 --> 11:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Well, on the
legislative process,
he keeps talking as if
health care is ready

11:15.766 --> 11:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a vote in the Senate.

11:17.833 --> 11:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talks about it as if the
tax reform, the tax cut bill is
ready for a vote in the Senate,

11:21.933 --> 11:23.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and everything is
just two weeks.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In two weeks, we're going
to have a great plan.

11:25.633 --> 11:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this is put off
well into the future.

11:27.966 --> 11:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, in fact,
Lisa, we were talking about
this earlier, what the president

11:32.433 --> 11:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is saying, John is reporting
in some of these expectations
that he's putting out there and

11:39.400 --> 11:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tweeting about, including
about other subjects, that then
members of Congress, leadership

11:44.566 --> 11:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to react to, all of that is
having an effect on the agenda.

11:46.866 --> 11:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

11:48.933 --> 11:51.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, until now, many
Republicans have been able to
shrug it off, as much as they

11:51.100 --> 11:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
themselves were
frustrated by it.

11:53.166 --> 11:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But today, Judy, Senator Bob
Corker, generally a Trump ally,
was literally speechless when

11:59.533 --> 12:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was told about the
president's tweet about Qatar.

12:01.733 --> 12:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, I also have to say,
though, even though I
think these distractions
are actually affecting

12:06.133 --> 12:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the agenda now, something
bigger than that still is
that Republicans can't agree.

12:10.733 --> 12:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's still the basic problem.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans in the House and
Senate and in the White House
have not come up with plans

12:16.166 --> 12:17.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on these items.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's still the
essential problem.

12:19.433 --> 12:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's a
lot of moving parts, and I
know the two of you are going

12:24.766 --> 12:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to continue to report it.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as we speak, there's more
news coming out of the White
House and the Hill tonight

12:29.566 --> 12:31.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on all this.

12:31.033 --> 12:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you very much, Lisa
Desjardins, John Yang.

12:49.133 --> 12:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For three years, the Islamic
State group has held the Syrian
city of Raqqa, which it made

12:55.333 --> 12:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the capital of its
so-called caliphate.

12:57.500 --> 13:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now U.S.-backed Syrian groups
with the help of American and
coalition troops and airpower

13:03.366 --> 13:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have begun the battle
to retake the city.

13:06.266 --> 13:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown reports.

13:08.333 --> 13:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They are called
the Syrian Democratic Forces,
and they have fought their

13:13.600 --> 13:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way to the outskirts of Raqqa.

13:16.566 --> 13:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now the fighters of the
SDF say they're ready
for the main assault.

13:20.133 --> 13:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TALAL SILO, Syrian
Democratic Forces Spokesman
(through translator):
Morale is high and military

13:24.033 --> 13:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
readiness to implement the
military plan is complete and in
coordination with the U.S.-led

13:28.833 --> 13:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coalition to fight terrorism.

13:31.333 --> 13:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Backed by
U.S. coalition airstrikes,
the Kurdish militias
of the SDF and their

13:37.100 --> 13:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Arab allies reached
the city's northern and
eastern gates last week.

13:41.233 --> 13:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the U.S. military says
the battle for the city itself
will be "long and difficult."

13:48.333 --> 13:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In neighboring Iraq, by
comparison, the fight
to retake Mosul from is
has raged since October.

13:56.766 --> 14:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the fight for Raqqa may
be complicated further by the
crisis between the Persian

14:01.233 --> 14:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gulf state of Qatar
and other Arab nations.

14:04.700 --> 14:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Twitter today, President
Trump sided with Saudi
Arabia and others today
in the confrontation.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. has about 10,000
troops in Qatar, and a major
air base used to launch strikes

14:15.800 --> 14:17.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against ISIS.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Pentagon says its posture
in there won't change.

14:20.933 --> 14:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State Department
spokesman Heather Nauert:

14:23.033 --> 14:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BHEATHER NAUERT, State
Department Spokeswoman: We
continue to cooperate with

14:25.033 --> 14:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Qatar and other countries
in the region in the
fight against terrorism.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Meanwhile, Turkey
is keeping a nervous eye on
the fighting at Raqqa, less

14:34.866 --> 14:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than 60 miles from its border.

14:36.900 --> 14:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States is now
supplying heavy weapons to
the Syrian Kurds of the SDF.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are allied with
Turkish Kurdish militants,
whom Ankara and the U.S.
consider terrorists.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BINALI YILDIRIM, Turkish Prime
Minister (through translator):
Despite our many warnings, our

14:51.033 --> 14:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ally, our friend the United
States has unfortunately
entered into a cooperation
with a terrorist

14:56.600 --> 14:58.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organization.

14:58.666 --> 15:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will immediately retaliate
if there's a threat to our
nation, our country and to the

15:00.400 --> 15:02.433 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
safety and lives
of our citizens.

15:02.433 --> 15:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The U.S.-led
coalition also announced today
that it had bombed what it

15:06.633 --> 15:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said were pro-Syrian regime
forces in Southern Syria.

15:10.933 --> 15:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The pro-government elements had
reportedly entered a restricted
zone near what is known

15:15.400 --> 15:19.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be a U.S. and British
special forces base.

15:19.866 --> 15:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we look at the fight that
lies ahead in Raqqa with Joby
Warrick, national security

15:23.900 --> 15:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporter for The Washington
Post, author of a
Pulitzer Prize-winning
history of the Islamic

15:28.766 --> 15:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State entitled "Black
Flags: The Rise of ISIS."

And Andrew Exum, a former Army
Ranger who served as deputy
assistant secretary of defense

15:37.100 --> 15:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for Middle East policy
from 2015-2016, he's now
a contributing editor
at "The Atlantic."

15:45.100 --> 15:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Andrew Exum, let
me start with you.

15:47.633 --> 15:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How significant is
the Raqqa offensive?

15:49.866 --> 15:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are the stakes here?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense:
Well, I think it's significant,

15:53.966 --> 15:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
although we shouldn't overstate
the degree to which this
will really herald the end of

15:58.000 --> 16:00.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Islamic State.

16:00.100 --> 16:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you rewind the clock two
years ago to when the Islamic
State was still spreading across

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria and Iraq and threatening
our allies in Turkey and
Jordan, we came up with a plan

16:10.966 --> 16:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try to squeeze the
Islamic State from multiple
different directions.

16:15.700 --> 16:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of what we have
been trying to do is apply
simultaneous pressure.

16:19.066 --> 16:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The idea was to eventually get
to kind of the dual capitals
of the Islamic State in

16:23.566 --> 16:25.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Raqqa and Mosul.

16:25.033 --> 16:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obviously, the fight for
Mosul began last year.

16:28.633 --> 16:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We weren't able to get to Raqqa
by the time that President
Obama left office, in part

16:35.566 --> 16:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because we were still waiting
on some pretty big policy
decisions, including arming the

16:40.066 --> 16:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian Kurds, who have borne
the brunt of the fight in Syria.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we now appear to be
knocking on the doors of Raqqa.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The fight should be --
should last several months.

16:50.433 --> 16:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's going to be
extremely difficult.

16:53.833 --> 16:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But once this is over, it really
-- it heralds perhaps the end
of the Islamic State as an

16:58.300 --> 17:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actual quasi-state, but we
should expect it to exist for
quite some time as a terrorist

17:04.766 --> 17:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
organization, as insurgents.

17:06.800 --> 17:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Joby, fill
in a little bit more about
the practical difficulties,

17:10.033 --> 17:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially vis-a-vis
what's happening in Mosul,
where it's dragging on.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOBY WARRICK, The
Washington Post: Right.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff, remember, this is the
capital, this is the true
capital of the Islamic State.

17:18.133 --> 17:20.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're going to
fight to the last man.

17:20.166 --> 17:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is really the sort of
endgame for them in terms of
keeping this caliphate alive.

17:24.133 --> 17:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we have seen what
they have done to Mosul,
their other capital.

17:26.433 --> 17:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They held on for eight
months, and the place
still hasn't fallen.

17:29.666 --> 17:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we can expect all kinds of
complications in the battlefield
itself, everything from

17:33.500 --> 17:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tunnels and the
sniping and sophisticated
defensive techniques.

17:36.433 --> 17:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're not going to
let this go easily.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the
U.S. role here is airborne.

17:40.166 --> 17:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Mostly airborne.

17:41.466 --> 17:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's a critical role.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We do have allies that we're
relying on to do the fighting
on the ground, although we

17:46.333 --> 17:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do have advisers and people
on the forward positions doing
artillery work and that sort

17:50.066 --> 17:51.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of thing.

17:51.733 --> 17:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But it really is a fight
for our allies and not
for us on the ground.

17:53.800 --> 17:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Andrew, if you
allow yourself to think ahead,
assuming a defeat of ISIS,

18:00.200 --> 18:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what would be next?

18:01.533 --> 18:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where are they being pushed to?

18:03.566 --> 18:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: Well, first off,
I think the defeat of ISIS
looks different in Iraq than

18:08.700 --> 18:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it does in Syria.

18:10.166 --> 18:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Iraq, we have worked by,
with and through an Iraqi state.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That state is flawed.

18:14.966 --> 18:17.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's weak.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's grown in some ways more
federalized as the war has
gone on and as the Kurds have

18:22.933 --> 18:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really been able to flex
their muscles in the north.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, nonetheless, it is a state.

18:27.366 --> 18:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Syria, by contrast, the
conflict, which may not involve
the Islamic State past next

18:34.700 --> 18:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year, the conflict should
be expected to last
for quite some time.

18:38.633 --> 18:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Turks are obviously
going to be very concerned
about who controls Northern
Syria, who controls

18:44.166 --> 18:45.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Raqqa.

18:45.633 --> 18:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it going to be the Kurds
with their Arab allies?

18:47.833 --> 18:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That might be unpalatable,
to say the least, to
President Erdogan in Ankara.

18:52.500 --> 18:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think we should expect
Syria to remain, unfortunately,
quite a bit of a mess for the

18:58.366 --> 19:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
foreseeable future.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, this, Joby
Warrick, gets very confusing,
I think, for people watching,

19:03.000 --> 19:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for all of us watching
at different times, all
the different players.

19:05.933 --> 19:08.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

19:08.000 --> 19:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You think about the race to
defeat ISIS and the potential
aftermath and the chaos that

19:12.666 --> 19:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could be there as well.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOBY WARRICK: Right.

19:14.600 --> 19:16.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

19:16.700 --> 19:19.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you think about just
the oddity of this, that
we are arming a nonstate
actor, essentially

19:19.100 --> 19:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Kurdish militia, against
-- who is arrayed one of
our NATO allies, Turkey.

19:26.133 --> 19:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these two see each other as
mortal enemies, and yet we're
all on the same side in a sense

19:28.733 --> 19:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of trying to reclaim the
city from the Islamic State.

19:32.233 --> 19:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What happens afterward,
we just don't know.

19:34.366 --> 19:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does Turkey allow a
Kurdish entity to control
this part of Syria?

19:38.600 --> 19:40.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't think so.

19:40.166 --> 19:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're going to be
very insistent on
driving out these Kurds.

19:43.566 --> 19:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does that mean another war
breaks out after ISIS is gone?

19:47.033 --> 19:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's very complicated
and very dangerous.

19:49.033 --> 19:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about,
Andrew, the role of the Syrian
government itself at this point?

19:52.366 --> 19:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: Well, this is where
it gets complicated, especially
down in the south, where you're

19:56.900 --> 20:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
starting to see some
Syrian government forces
push up against some
rebels that we have been

20:03.266 --> 20:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supporting to try to
defeat the Islamic State.

20:05.733 --> 20:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After Raqqa, over the which the
Syrian government really hasn't
tried to make a claim, the next

20:10.566 --> 20:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big ISIS stronghold is Deir
el-Zour, where there is a small
toehold of the regime, where

20:17.533 --> 20:20.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the regime does want
to project forces.

20:20.633 --> 20:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so U.S. forces and
U.S.-backed forces are
going to start bumping
up the Syrian regime's

20:27.566 --> 20:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coalition, which, of
course, includes Russia and
Hezbollah, as well as Iran.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the geography is just going
to get more complicated after
the Islamic State's capitals

20:38.033 --> 20:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fall in both Mosul and Raqqa.

20:40.066 --> 20:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Joby,
we referred in our setup to
this dust-up involving Qatar.

20:46.166 --> 20:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Does that have any
particular impact on
the fight against ISIS?

20:48.866 --> 20:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: What's interesting
to me is to see the role
the Trump administration has

20:52.400 --> 20:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken in that fight, with
the president himself
getting involved in
this new sort of Twitter

20:57.066 --> 21:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
blast over the last 24 hours,
basically taking the Saudis'
side against the Qataris, who

21:02.000 --> 21:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are our ally as well, and
also the host to one of our
major military facilities.

21:06.833 --> 21:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Andrew,
explain the role that Qatar
plays and why it might have some

21:11.166 --> 21:13.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
implications.

21:13.233 --> 21:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: The U.S. military
is running the entire air
campaign for the fight against

21:16.566 --> 21:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Islamic State out of Qatar.

21:18.566 --> 21:20.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have several
thousand troops there.

21:20.600 --> 21:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's one of
the reasons why, after the
president's tweets, which really

21:24.566 --> 21:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
echoed not only the Saudi, but
the Emirati frustrations with
Qatar, that's why you have

21:31.033 --> 21:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seen the State Department try
to clean that up a little bit.

21:33.033 --> 21:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I'm sure that Secretary of
Defense Mattis and the secretary
of state were frustrated,

21:39.766 --> 21:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say the least, to see the
president get so far out there
with his tweets this morning.

21:45.300 --> 21:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Joby Warrick, Andrew Exum,
thank you both very much.

21:48.033 --> 21:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW EXUM: Sure thing.

21:55.500 --> 22:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:00.133 --> 22:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
the dangers that arise when aid
workers start to pick sides;

22:07.166 --> 22:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

22:15.233 --> 22:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Helping children
distinguish between
false information and
fact-based news, it's

22:21.633 --> 22:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a distinction increasingly
a problem for adults.

22:24.166 --> 22:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, to be clear, we're
referring to false information
disguised as a legitimate news

22:31.200 --> 22:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story, not reporting that
people dislike for political
reasons and label fake news.

22:41.466 --> 22:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to address the problem.

STUDENT: Notice how they're
wording it Japanese, instead
of Japanese-Americans?

23:23.066 --> 23:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NIAMH O'CONNELL: What
was the purpose of that?

23:25.100 --> 23:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why do they do that?

23:27.133 --> 23:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: The purpose was to
say, oh, we're not imprisoning
American citizens, or, as

23:30.833 --> 23:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they put it, we're not
evacuating American citizens.

23:35.133 --> 23:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're evacuating Japanese.

23:36.666 --> 23:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NIAMH O'CONNELL: And why do
they use the word evacuate?

23:40.133 --> 23:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Another student
also notices the language.

23:42.933 --> 23:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILL PARSONS, Student: I saw
some fake advertising for the
Japanese internment camps.

23:49.766 --> 23:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They said they were
assembly centers.

23:51.800 --> 23:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIAMH O'CONNELL: So they kind
of made it seem really cool,
and, actually, it wasn't?

23:55.200 --> 23:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILL PARSONS: Yes.

23:57.233 --> 24:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: O'Connell
uses examples from the past, so
these kids can become smarter

24:00.700 --> 24:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about media messages in
the present, even though
they're only 8 years old.

24:05.500 --> 24:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I want to learn how
to like analyze it myself
and have my own opinion.

24:12.266 --> 24:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NIAMH O'CONNELL: They soak
up everything around them.

24:14.833 --> 24:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's important for
kids to be able to control the
interpretations that they hear

24:21.800 --> 24:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and see every day, instead
of the interpretations
maybe controlling them.

24:24.566 --> 24:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Recognizing
bias in news stories is
one form of media literacy.

24:29.533 --> 24:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Spotting when the news
is entirely fabricated,
like these stories, is
something else entirely.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Often, these stories are
designed to look as if
they come from legitimate
news organizations,

24:41.966 --> 24:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and are meant to be
easily shared on social
media, resulting in
confusion over what's

24:45.866 --> 24:47.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
real.

24:47.900 --> 24:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
During the recent election
season, there have been reports
of a concerted effort to spread

24:51.133 --> 24:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fake news, in a bid to
influence public opinion.

24:54.766 --> 24:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A recent Stanford University
study of almost 8,000 students
showed they were easily duped

25:00.533 --> 25:02.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
online.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Researchers found, overall,
young people's ability to
reason about the information on

25:07.900 --> 25:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Internet can be summed
up in one word: bleak.

25:13.033 --> 25:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been working on
media literacy for how long?

25:14.533 --> 25:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAIRE BEACH, Media Literacy
Advocate: About 40 years.

25:16.566 --> 25:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Claire
Beach is a media literacy
advocate and former teacher.

25:19.466 --> 25:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says just because kids are
comfortable with social media
doesn't mean they're savvy

25:23.133 --> 25:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about the information
they're consuming.

25:25.133 --> 25:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE BEACH: When they're using
their phones, they may know
how to make something work,

25:31.866 --> 25:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they don't have the
ethical piece, the emotional
intelligence piece.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a wilderness out
there for some kids.

25:36.600 --> 25:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: She's worked
with lawmakers like Democratic
state Senator Marko Liias

25:43.000 --> 25:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to encourage media literacy
classes in grades K through 12.

25:45.100 --> 25:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARKO LIIAS (D), Washington
State Senator: I was reading a
stunning statistic that, just

25:48.300 --> 25:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since 2003 to today, humanity
has created more information
than we created in all of

25:54.800 --> 25:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
human history up until 2003.

25:56.966 --> 26:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the pace of information, the
pace of data, the pace of what
our students are being exposed

26:01.933 --> 26:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to is rising exponentially.

26:03.966 --> 26:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: How do you
convince people that this is not
about politics, this is about

26:07.900 --> 26:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
critical thinking?

26:09.900 --> 26:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARKO LIIAS: Both of the
bills that I have passed
have had bipartisan support.

26:12.666 --> 26:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether you're a Democrat or
a Republican, right or left,
we want people to go into the

26:16.166 --> 26:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voting booth educated and
prepared to make the best
decision for our communities.

26:23.133 --> 26:26.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if people can't
discern fake information
from real information,
that really corrodes

26:27.733 --> 26:29.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the basic institutions
of our democracy.

26:29.866 --> 26:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The
law in Washington state
encourages educators to
develop policies around

26:36.000 --> 26:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
media literacy and
to share resources.

26:37.866 --> 26:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It also allows districts access
to federal technology funding.

26:42.333 --> 26:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This new law in Washington
is being used as a model by
about a dozen other states.

26:48.933 --> 26:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Advocates want to see
media literacy taught
in all 50 states.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER, Founder and CEO,
Common Sense Media: There's
clearly growing momentum to

26:54.766 --> 26:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pass this kind of legislation.

26:56.766 --> 27:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Jim Steyer
founded Common Sense, one of
several organizations dedicated

27:01.733 --> 27:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to media literacy.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Here are five
ways to spot fake news.

27:05.433 --> 27:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: They have also
worked with Harvard University
to create free lesson plans

27:09.800 --> 27:11.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and online resources.

27:11.700 --> 27:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: The essence
of media literacy is
critical thinking.

27:15.100 --> 27:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every child in America needs
those skills, particularly when
they live in this 24/7 media

27:21.900 --> 27:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and technology world,
where they're just
bombarded with information.

27:25.133 --> 27:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Oftentimes, it's inaccurate.

27:27.233 --> 27:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: These students
are in Catherine Sparks' English
class at Edmonds-Woodway High

27:31.766 --> 27:33.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
School.

27:33.366 --> 27:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It's crazy how
many people actually
trust these sources.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: You can't distinguish
the difference anymore.

27:39.233 --> 27:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It can
get 1,000 retweets.

27:41.166 --> 27:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is not even true.

27:42.866 --> 27:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Sparks
uses the play "Hamlet"
to talk about fake news.

27:46.166 --> 27:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE SPARKS, Teacher: It's
about spying and lying and how
that creates a ripe environment

27:52.233 --> 27:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the proliferation
of fake news.

27:54.433 --> 27:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Sparks
has created untrue
stories based on the play.

27:58.166 --> 28:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE SPARKS: In act one,
scene two, when he says oh,
but this too, too solid flesh

28:02.766 --> 28:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would melt, thaw and resolve
itself into a dew, sure, it
could be a metaphor, but Hamlet

28:08.833 --> 28:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has a shocking
flesh-eating illness.

28:09.733 --> 28:11.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:11.766 --> 28:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE SPARKS: Could you
actually support that with
evidence from the text?

28:14.433 --> 28:17.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Good luck.

28:17.100 --> 28:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Fake news is not news
you disagree with.

28:20.300 --> 28:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Fake news is fabricated news.

28:22.333 --> 28:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Sparks believes
letting her students create
their own fake news will teach

28:26.566 --> 28:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them how to critically
think through some of the
information they receive.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What words are used?

28:31.566 --> 28:32.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who benefits?

28:32.566 --> 28:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is there any truth to the story?

28:34.500 --> 28:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: It's got to be
dramatic, like, absurd things
that you're like, what?

28:38.833 --> 28:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CATHERINE SPARKS: This is
a juicy story right here.

28:41.833 --> 28:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It's
entirely fabricated.

28:45.466 --> 28:50.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CATHERINE SPARKS: What
would be the outcome of
producing this story?

28:52.533 --> 28:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: If the public
saw this, they're like,
oh, my gosh, there's so
much drama and scandal

28:54.900 --> 28:57.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CATHERINE SPARKS: What's
been the most painful
about the proliferation
of fake news in the

29:02.600 --> 29:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
media is to watch my students
start to distrust everything.

29:06.500 --> 29:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: That's
exactly why state Senator Marko
Liias says media literacy is

29:11.466 --> 29:13.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so important.

29:13.966 --> 29:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARKO LIIAS: At its
bedrock, when our founding
fathers created this
country, the reason why

29:16.833 --> 29:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were so committed to public
education was to make sure that
we had an educated citizenry.

29:23.800 --> 29:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CATHERINE SPARKS: Anything that
starts with "share if you're
outraged," that's a bad sign.

29:28.866 --> 29:31.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And outrage is just the
lifeblood of fake news.

29:31.566 --> 29:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: For the "PBS
NewsHour" and Education Week,
I'm Kavitha Cardoza in Seattle,

29:39.133 --> 29:41.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

29:41.933 --> 29:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Aid
organizations, especially
those working in conflict
zones like Yemen,

29:52.200 --> 29:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say it's crucial that they
remain politically neutral.

29:55.766 --> 29:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say it's the only way
they can safely do their jobs.

29:59.133 --> 30:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a recent investigation by
The New York Times reveals how
one company may have endangered

30:05.266 --> 30:07.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that neutrality for many
humanitarian groups.

30:07.966 --> 30:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that story.

30:10.100 --> 30:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: UNICEF and
the Red Cross are two of the
humanitarian groups working

30:13.333 --> 30:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Yemen, where a brutal civil
war has killed or injured
at least 12,000 people.

30:20.300 --> 30:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Times today revealed that
a logistics company known
as Transoceanic Development

30:23.133 --> 30:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't only helping those aid
groups get their supplies into
Yemen, but the company was also

30:28.000 --> 30:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
secretly helping U.S.
special forces do the same.

30:31.766 --> 30:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Times reports how this
dual relationship could drive
suspicion that the aid groups

30:36.333 --> 30:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were somehow acting as agents
of the U.S. government.

30:39.433 --> 30:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Eric Schmitt.

30:41.133 --> 30:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's one of The Times'
reporters who broke this story.

30:43.966 --> 30:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And by Daryl Grisgraber.

30:46.533 --> 30:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a senior advocate
at Refugees International,
which is an aid group
that operates in the

30:49.966 --> 30:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Middle East, Africa,
and Southeast Asia.

30:52.466 --> 30:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She previously worked for
Amnesty International.

30:54.933 --> 30:56.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

30:56.733 --> 30:58.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Eric Schmitt, I would
like to start with you.

30:58.466 --> 31:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's just go over some
of these details again.

31:01.100 --> 31:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this logistics company,
Transoceanic Development,
is working to deliver
and help deliver aid

31:07.266 --> 31:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supplies to Yemen for these
aid groups, while they're also
doing some work for U.S. special

31:14.166 --> 31:15.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forces.

31:15.666 --> 31:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you explain those two
relationships a little bit?

31:16.866 --> 31:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ERIC SCHMITT, The New
York Times: Right.

31:18.333 --> 31:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Transoceanic is this giant
global logistics company.

31:21.333 --> 31:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And its job is really to ferry
materials and shipments all over
the world for various customers.

31:28.266 --> 31:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a couple of its customers,
as you mentioned, are the
Red Cross and for UNICEF.

31:31.600 --> 31:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in this case, they did
some warehousing, they did some
basic bringing materials and

31:38.633 --> 31:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shipments of supplies into Yemen
that would then be delivered to
-- through other humanitarian

31:45.533 --> 31:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organizations to the needy
in that strife-torn country.

31:50.266 --> 31:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So that's one of their jobs.

31:51.533 --> 31:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they were very
open about this.

31:53.566 --> 31:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when Mr. Darden was
kidnapped, his story became
quite public, because...

31:57.300 --> 32:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This
is the main, the central
character in your story,
who was sort of organizing

32:03.166 --> 32:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this organization in Yemen.

32:05.133 --> 32:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was kidnapped by some
rebels there, and then was
released after several years.

32:08.833 --> 32:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC SCHMITT: That's right.

32:10.333 --> 32:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scott Darden was the country
director for Transoceanic.

32:12.400 --> 32:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he was responsible kind of
at the front end for getting
these shipments of aid into

32:18.733 --> 32:19.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yemen.

32:19.733 --> 32:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that story is quite public.

32:21.700 --> 32:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's new here is that it
turned out that Transoceanic
and Mr. Darden were also working

32:28.833 --> 32:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on secret contracts
involving shipping similar
types of materials into
Yemen for the military,

32:34.566 --> 32:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specifically for the very
specialized special operations
forces, the commandos, who are

32:39.900 --> 32:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
operating in Yemen today.

32:41.833 --> 32:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And just
for the record, there's no
evidence that the aid groups had

32:45.533 --> 32:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any idea that the company they
were hiring to do work for
them was also doing this work

32:50.133 --> 32:51.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the U.S. government.

32:51.266 --> 32:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC SCHMITT: That's right.

32:53.400 --> 32:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Spokesmen for both UNICEF and
for the Red Cross said they
had no idea that Transoceanic

33:00.833 --> 33:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was carrying out these kind of
contracts with the military on
the logistics side of things.

33:05.733 --> 33:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And had they known, they may
have opted for another company.

33:09.033 --> 33:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I must say, there aren't a
lot of companies that get into
these kind of very dangerous

33:14.766 --> 33:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
war zone type of places.

33:16.833 --> 33:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's not unusual to find
a company like Transoceanic
dealing with multiple kinds of

33:22.133 --> 33:23.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
customers.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
So, Daryl Grisgraber,
what is your reaction?

33:25.433 --> 33:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You read this story.

33:26.566 --> 33:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What was your response?

33:29.166 --> 33:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARYL GRISGRABER, Refugees
International: Initially,
we were all quite
dismayed as humanitarians,

33:31.300 --> 33:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because there's meant to be a
very strict separation between
military assistance, political

33:37.266 --> 33:39.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
assistance, and
humanitarian assistance.

33:39.300 --> 33:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is quite a lively
debate that goes on right now
in the humanitarian world about

33:42.566 --> 33:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
keeping those separate
and when and how is it
possible to combine them.

33:47.300 --> 33:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the initial reaction
then is, because these got
combined, it's going to look bad

33:51.266 --> 33:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for humanitarians everywhere.

33:53.833 --> 33:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Humanitarians tend to
be a little bit under
suspicion anyway, just
because they're foreigners

34:00.500 --> 34:02.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
often in a country,
where we talk about
the U.N. or big INGOs.

34:02.566 --> 34:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they operate very
significantly on trust,
building trust with
the people they serve,

34:07.966 --> 34:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as well as the governments
that allow them to operate.

34:10.433 --> 34:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to know now that the
humanitarian principle
of neutrality in
particular has potentially

34:17.533 --> 34:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been compromised or
even perceived to be
compromised is going to
affect all humanitarians.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, the
concern, just to spell it out
even more clearly, is that if

34:25.933 --> 34:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a government or groups operating
in a certain country somehow
thought that you were receiving

34:32.933 --> 34:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shipments from a company that
was also working for a partisan
group in that nation as well,

34:37.900 --> 34:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the humanitarian aid
workers might come under attack.

34:39.866 --> 34:41.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DARYL GRISGRABER:
Oh, for sure, yes.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Organizations could be banned
from operating in a country.

34:44.066 --> 34:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The humanitarian individuals
could come under attack.

34:46.800 --> 34:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in general, it's really
important to remember that
this just erodes the trust that

34:51.166 --> 34:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allows humanitarians to do
work everywhere and get access
to the people who really need

34:55.633 --> 35:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them the most, because
that often involves
really emphasizing the
fact that you are neutral

35:00.633 --> 35:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not on the side of a
conflict, and so it's OK for
you to be serving people.

35:04.700 --> 35:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Eric Schmitt,
in your piece you remind us
that there was a more notorious

35:09.300 --> 35:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incident where the CIA
was operating in Pakistan,
and it literally did
blur these very lines

35:15.166 --> 35:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we're talking about.

35:16.366 --> 35:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can you tell us what
happened in that story?

35:17.300 --> 35:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ERIC SCHMITT: Sure, absolutely.

35:19.366 --> 35:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In an effort to try and
determine whether Osama
bin Laden was actually
hiding in a walled

35:25.800 --> 35:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compound in Abbottabad, in this
town in Pakistan, they devised
a system where they would go

35:31.900 --> 35:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
door-to-door in that city and
do inoculations, and hoping
that somebody would come to the

35:37.566 --> 35:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
door, they would be able to
come inside, take inoculations
from presumably family members,

35:40.533 --> 35:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and then get some type
of DNA readout on this.

35:45.266 --> 35:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, this all came to
light, of course, after
the death of bin Laden, and
it very much jeopardized

35:52.500 --> 35:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not only the doctors that were
involved, but it basically
turned much of that community

35:57.433 --> 35:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Pakistan against
polio vaccinations.

35:59.800 --> 36:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it became -- actually,
it was very counterproductive
for public health
reasons in that country.

36:04.733 --> 36:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the CIA has said
it won't do that again.

36:06.866 --> 36:10.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Daryl
Grisgraber, what do you
-- what is your sense
of what revelations

36:10.766 --> 36:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like this could do for the
effort in Yemen right now?

36:13.166 --> 36:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARYL GRISGRABER: Well, there
are very few aid groups,
relatively speaking, operating

36:16.966 --> 36:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Yemen as it is because
of the security situation.

36:19.933 --> 36:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many U.N. agencies
and INGOs, international
non-governmental
organizations, that had to

36:25.666 --> 36:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
withdraw their staff.

36:27.700 --> 36:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so compared to the need
in Yemen, there are really
very few groups addressing it.

36:31.200 --> 36:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if this breaks trust or
puts humanitarian under fire in
some way, it will be completely

36:36.200 --> 36:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
comprehensible that
organizations pull their
staffs out of there.

36:39.466 --> 36:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that means even less
help for -- what are we
talking at, at this point?

36:43.166 --> 36:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Potentially, 17 million
people might begin starving
to death in a few weeks.

36:46.133 --> 36:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Daryl Grisgraber, Eric Schmitt,
thank you both very much.

36:50.100 --> 36:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DARYL GRISGRABER: Thank you.

36:54.233 --> 36:58.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC SCHMITT: Thank you.

36:58.333 --> 37:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As the 2007 Tony
Awards approach this Sunday,
we look at one of this season's

37:07.233 --> 37:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
biggest Broadway hits and
the impact it's having.

37:10.733 --> 37:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is back with
the story from New York.

37:13.866 --> 37:18.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Dear
Evan Hansen" is a high
school musical, but one
in which the loneliness

37:24.433 --> 37:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pain of teen life is front
and center, and the sense
of isolation intensified in

37:30.300 --> 37:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
today's social media world.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the famed Sardi's Restaurant
recently, star Ben Platt
said audiences are clearly

37:37.566 --> 37:39.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
finding a connection.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN PLATT, Actor: People that
come to the show feel, right
now, especially with sort

37:43.000 --> 37:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of hyperconnectivity online
and with people feeling sort
of instantaneously judged all

37:46.466 --> 37:51.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the time, I think people
kind of recede into
these sort of bubbles.

37:51.166 --> 37:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The chance to sort of connect
and realize that nobody's
experience of loneliness is

37:58.966 --> 38:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unique and that everybody at
some time or another feels
sort of on the outside looking

38:02.533 --> 38:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in, or feels that they can't
really fully be present, or
that they aren't sort of one

38:07.333 --> 38:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the whole, but rather
on their own, is a really
powerful thing right now.

38:14.266 --> 38:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The
23-year-old Platt grew up
around movies and theater.

38:20.533 --> 38:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His father, Marc, is a
major producer of hits,
including "Wicked."

38:25.000 --> 38:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before this production, Ben
was known for roles in the
"Pitch Perfect" films and in

38:34.633 --> 38:38.866 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the musical "The
Book of Mormon."

38:38.866 --> 38:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He plays Evan Hansen as
a young man so insecure,
he can barely speak.

38:43.433 --> 38:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's an acclaimed performance
of teenage awkwardness
and vibrant singing.

38:50.333 --> 38:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN PLATT: This role is
certainly the biggest challenge
I have had so far in my life.

38:55.766 --> 38:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a huge blessing in that
way, too, because I feel like
I'm using all of the proverbial

38:58.833 --> 39:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tools that I have in my belt,
which is all you want as an
actor, is to feel like you're

39:01.533 --> 39:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really being able to show
everything you have got.

39:04.966 --> 39:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, vocally and physically
and emotionally and all of
that, it requires a lot.

39:08.233 --> 39:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When a classmate
commits suicide, Evan Hansen
is mistakenly seen as his one

39:13.700 --> 39:15.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
friend.

39:15.733 --> 39:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Evan is suddenly a subject
of interest to his classmates
and the other boy's family.

39:21.433 --> 39:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gains a girlfriend and even
a kind of instant celebrity when
a speech he gives about suicide

39:25.200 --> 39:26.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
goes viral.

39:26.966 --> 39:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's all a misunderstanding,
destined to come crashing
down around him.

39:31.766 --> 39:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Steven Levenson wrote the story.

39:33.833 --> 39:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN LEVENSON, Author, "Dear
Evan Hansen": It's very much
this singular story of this

39:35.866 --> 39:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
person in the world that we
know very well, but struggling
with these things that hopefully

39:41.700 --> 39:43.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are things that we all
know and experience.

39:43.833 --> 39:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we never wanted it to feel
like learning or didactic.

39:50.833 --> 39:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We never wanted to teach
the audience a lesson or
to talk about technology.

39:53.733 --> 39:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We just wanted to tell
this story and hopefully
illuminate something
about the world in doing

39:57.500 --> 39:59.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GREIF, Director: Yes,
and like in all the -- in all
great theater writing, those

40:01.200 --> 40:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
themes get expressed
through that story.

40:03.933 --> 40:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And those things become
a part of Evan's story
and a part of his world.

40:10.933 --> 40:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Director Michael
Greif previously staged two
Pulitzer Prize-winning musicals,

40:13.933 --> 40:18.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"Rent" and "Next to
Normal," that took on
complex contemporary
issues, such as drug

40:18.833 --> 40:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
addiction and bipolar disorder.

40:21.166 --> 40:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You clearly feel that musicals
can tell difficult stories.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GREIF: Yes, certainly.

40:26.900 --> 40:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I grew up seeing a lot of
different kinds of musicals.

40:29.633 --> 40:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the musicals I was always
particularly drawn to were --
"Man of La Mancha," I think

40:34.233 --> 40:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was the first
musical I ever saw.

40:36.533 --> 40:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Talk about a musical with
serious purpose and dark themes
that are expressed, you know,

40:43.633 --> 40:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
musicals that really do say
something real and authentic
about "The Times" that they

40:47.966 --> 40:50.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were made in.

40:50.533 --> 40:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Dear Evan
Hansen" has certainly
struck a chord with
audiences, and many have

40:53.600 --> 40:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shared their gratitude
and their own stories via
e-mails and social media.

40:58.166 --> 41:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: "I brought our
15-year-old daughter and
13-year-old son to the show.

41:02.266 --> 41:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Their older sister, our
16-year-old daughter,
died by suicide a
little over a year ago.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are still devastated.

41:10.100 --> 41:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it helps us when people
talk about mental illness with
understanding and compassion,

41:13.233 --> 41:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as you did in your show."

41:14.833 --> 41:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: "The 'Dear
Evan Hansen' soundtrack
has saved my life."

41:18.200 --> 41:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: "Last night, I
found out my dear high school
friend had taken his own life

41:22.766 --> 41:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Thursday afternoon.

41:24.800 --> 41:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am devastated by this loss,
but grateful for having a
show like 'Dear Evan Hansen'

41:28.633 --> 41:30.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to turn to.

41:30.700 --> 41:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just wanted to thank you
for getting me through this
incredibly difficult time.

41:33.666 --> 41:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
#Youwillbefound."

41:35.133 --> 41:38.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ben Platt hears
such stories every night.

41:38.366 --> 41:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN PLATT: When I get to met
-- the opportunity to meet fans
after the show or hear from them

41:41.333 --> 41:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
online or via letters, they
feel really comfortable
divulging really personal
things and opening

41:47.233 --> 41:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up about their own struggles.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh,
really, to you?

41:50.600 --> 41:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN PLATT: Certainly, with
anxiety and with self-harm and
with inability to connect and

41:53.833 --> 41:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all sorts of things.

41:55.866 --> 41:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's an incredibly
beautiful thing, and I want
nothing more than for the show

41:57.900 --> 42:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to encourage that and to be able
to receive things like that.

42:01.666 --> 42:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's no spoiler
alert to say that the show
does end on an upbeat note.

42:06.633 --> 42:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is about finding
your way through pain.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN LEVENSON: Just as a
writer, just philosophically,
I want to leave the
audience feeling some

42:15.733 --> 42:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of hope and some kind of --
I'm not interested in grim, and
I'm not interested in torture,

42:20.766 --> 42:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
watching things that just make
you feel awful, because we have
enough of that in the world.

42:24.300 --> 42:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Evan, I think, ultimately
in the story, what was so
exciting was finding that the

42:28.466 --> 42:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story really wasn't about
a suicide, but more about a
character saving his own life.

42:35.400 --> 42:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As for the actor
playing that character, as
Broadway's hottest young star,

42:40.733 --> 42:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his life will never be the same.

42:42.866 --> 42:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, is all this pretty
heady stuff, all this?

42:45.233 --> 42:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BEN PLATT: It's
incredibly heady.

42:47.333 --> 42:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been my dream since I was
a really little kid to just be
in the Broadway community at

42:53.133 --> 42:55.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all, and to do musical
theater as a job.

42:55.733 --> 42:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so now for that to be
true and to be doing it
in a show that's making
this big of a mark,

42:59.200 --> 43:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and in a role that comes
around not ever, is,
like, very hard to fathom.

43:05.533 --> 43:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's wonderful
beyond my wildest dreams.

43:07.566 --> 43:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ben Platt, Steven
Levenson, and Michael Greif
all received Tony nominations,

43:14.233 --> 43:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among the nine garnered by
"Dear Evan Hansen," including
one for best musical.

43:17.533 --> 43:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown on Broadway.

43:21.500 --> 43:26.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's
gratifying to know that
show is having an effect
around the country.

43:28.500 --> 43:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be back shortly with
our continuing Student Reporting
Labs series Limitless about

43:34.300 --> 43:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people living with
disabilities, tonight focusing
on a high school student
who overcomes a speech

43:37.966 --> 43:39.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
impairment.

43:39.533 --> 43:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, first, take a
moment to hear from
your local PBS station.

43:42.533 --> 43:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which helps keep
programs like ours on the air.

43:49.366 --> 43:52.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

43:52.566 --> 43:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now
we continue our series
Limitless, stories filmed
and edited by middle

44:04.466 --> 44:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and high school students about
people in their communities
living with disabilities.

44:11.933 --> 44:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we meet a teenager
who worked through his
speech impediment to become
a gifted communicator

44:16.533 --> 44:18.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and leader.

44:18.600 --> 44:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The video was produced
by the Student Reporting
Lab at Communications
Arts High School in

44:30.966 --> 44:32.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
San Antonio, Texas.

44:32.900 --> 44:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The student correspondent
is graduating senior
Alexandria Gonzalez.

44:34.433 --> 44:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEXANDRIA GONZALEZ: Trevor
Acord seems to have it all.

44:36.933 --> 44:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although some students
may have trouble being
seen in high school,
everyone knows who Trevor

44:45.166 --> 44:47.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

44:47.133 --> 44:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His peers selected him as
homecoming king and watched
him be crowned as Mr. Taps (ph)

44:53.100 --> 44:55.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in his school's
(INAUDIBLE) pageant.

44:55.133 --> 44:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He even has crowds of people,
family and friends, cheering
for him at his swim meets.

45:01.933 --> 45:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When Trevor was 3 years old, he
was officially diagnosed with
a speech impediment, also known

45:06.666 --> 45:08.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as stuttering.

45:08.666 --> 45:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARISSA MONTANO, Speech Language
Pathologist: Stuttering is a
communication disorder that

45:12.433 --> 45:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is interrupted by disfluencies.

45:14.466 --> 45:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We may sometimes see
unusual facial movements
or body movements that
are associated with

45:23.866 --> 45:26.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stuttering.

45:26.266 --> 45:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the Stuttering
Foundation, there are
about three million
Americans who stutter,

45:32.366 --> 45:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is about 1 percent
of the general population,
and it is more common
in males than females.

45:42.333 --> 45:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREVOR ACORD, Communications
Arts High School: Some of the
downsides of having a stutter,

45:53.533 --> 45:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
though, for me is that,
sometimes, it just makes it
really hard to speak and to just

46:00.666 --> 46:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
really put yourself --
and hard to just really
sort of put yourself out
there, because you're

46:15.066 --> 46:19.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
afraid of what
others will think.

46:19.033 --> 46:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, with me, I love to
speak, and I just love
talking with all these people.

46:26.600 --> 46:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I guess it seems sort
of ironic that someone
with a stutter would be
going to a communications

46:34.433 --> 46:36.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

46:36.566 --> 46:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHELLIE MALIK, Teacher:
I think part of Trevor's
success has come because
he is so comfortable

46:42.966 --> 46:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with everybody here.

46:44.666 --> 46:49.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's very involved in
things, and so he's used
to everybody around him.

46:52.300 --> 46:57.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEXANDRIA GONZALEZ:
Trevor is a proud member
of the Peer Assistance
and Leadership Program,

46:59.866 --> 47:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
otherwise known as PALS.

47:02.266 --> 47:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Watching him sprint down
the track next to a special
needs student really is where

47:09.766 --> 47:11.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think he shines.

47:11.666 --> 47:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's when he amazes me and
all the PALS, for that matter.

47:24.800 --> 47:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXANDRIA GONZALEZ: In addition
to being a leader and role
model to many at his school,

47:35.500 --> 47:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trevor has also been a great
asset to the Communication
Arts recruiting team.

47:42.400 --> 47:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEANNA YOUNG, Vice Principal,
Communications Arts High
School: Trevor is the very, very

47:50.200 --> 47:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
best recruiter I have ever seen.

47:51.933 --> 47:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He wins every crowd over
within about 10 seconds.

47:54.533 --> 47:59.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he's so sweet and
so engaging that every
middle school student
just loves him and wants

48:12.033 --> 48:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to listen to him,
wants to be his friend,
wants to talk to him.

48:20.700 --> 48:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREVOR ACORD: I would
say that me going to Comm
Arts was probably one

48:48.233 --> 48:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the best things, because
it just forced me to go and to
speak and to just really put

49:18.333 --> 49:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
myself out there.

49:21.566 --> 49:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh, Trevor.

49:31.100 --> 49:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What an inspiring
series this is.

49:57.733 --> 50:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can see more of
these stories from young
journalists across the country

50:20.900 --> 50:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also online: Go-go music was
born and bred in Washington,
D.C., but changes in

51:05.300 --> 51:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the city have put the funky
music genre in danger.

51:23.366 --> 51:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can go-go keep up its
national following of fans?

And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

54:12.533 --> 54:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wednesday, we talk
with vice president of the
United States, Mike Pence.

54:17.266 --> 54:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

Join us online and again
right here tomorrow evening.

54:20.800 --> 54:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
