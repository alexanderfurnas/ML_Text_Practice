JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a new
national voice for poetry.

00:03.633 --> 00:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a tradition dating back to
1937, the Library of Congress
selects a prominent writer to

00:10.433 --> 00:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
serve as the country's poet
laureate for terms that have
ranged from one to three years.

00:16.766 --> 00:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal, according to
the library, to raise the
national consciousness
to a greater appreciation

00:21.233 --> 00:23.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the reading and
writing of poetry.

00:23.366 --> 00:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The new laureate was revealed
today, and our Jeffrey Brown
had a chance to talk with her

00:27.866 --> 00:29.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
earlier this week.

00:29.866 --> 00:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Empathy and
self-awareness through language,
that is the creed that comes

00:36.800 --> 00:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through in talking with 45 year
old Tracy K. Smith, writer,
teacher, spouse and mother

00:43.566 --> 00:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of three, including 4-year-old
twins, and now taking on a very
public role as the nation's

00:48.733 --> 00:50.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
poet laureate.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH,ÑMD-BOÑ U.S.
Poet Laureate: This is a
position that allows me to kind

00:52.766 --> 00:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of profess publicly all that
I really hold true privately,
that, if we can listen actively

01:01.333 --> 01:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough, if we can put
enough pressure on
ourselves and our thought
process, language can be a

01:07.066 --> 01:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
real tool of revelation.

01:09.266 --> 01:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I love being able to do
that with my students
and my little seminars.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I love the idea that maybe
there's a way that this position
allows me to do that with

01:20.233 --> 01:22.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
my fellow Americans.

01:22.366 --> 01:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Smith is
author of three books
of poetry, including the
Pulitzer Prize-winning

01:28.500 --> 01:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Life on Mars," in part an elegy
for her father, who served in
the Air Force before leaving

01:33.166 --> 01:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to work on the Hubble telescope.

01:35.800 --> 01:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her 2015 memoir titled
"Ordinary Light," she
writes of growing up in
a tight-knit middle-class

01:43.100 --> 01:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family in Northern California,
a coming-of-age tale exploring
love and loss, race and faith,

01:50.733 --> 01:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a theme that
suffuses her poetry.

01:52.933 --> 01:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: I wasn't even
aware that that's what I was
doing until after my last book

01:59.966 --> 02:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of poems came out, and
I realized, wow, there's
a -- these poems are
thinking about space,

02:01.900 --> 02:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but they're also searching
for God, in a way.

02:05.500 --> 02:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it comes back to
that sense that I grew up with
that there is something large

02:09.033 --> 02:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that we can cleave
to, if we choose to.

02:12.166 --> 02:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wanted to figure out if
there was a way that the artist
in me and the 21st century

02:23.633 --> 02:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
academic in me could
find something like a
plausible version of God
or a plausible version

02:31.566 --> 02:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the afterlife that I would
be willing to claim publicly.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that language
facilitated that.

02:40.033 --> 02:43.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another
big area that you're
often exploring is race.

02:43.966 --> 02:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in your memoir,
you talk explicitly
about sort of comparing
your upbringing to your

02:50.933 --> 02:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parents and your grandparents,
the differences there, but
also things that have remained.

02:56.900 --> 03:00.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TRACY K. SMITH: A lot
of my awareness of how
race had imprinted by
my parents, who grew

03:02.100 --> 03:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up in the segregated South,
a lot of that was shaped by a
sense of sadness and a sense

03:08.066 --> 03:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of anxiety on my part that made
me not want to talk about it.

03:12.733 --> 03:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there were a lot of silences
that I was drawn to explore
in writing about that time

03:19.566 --> 03:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I had never felt capable
of bringing into speech
when I was growing up.

03:25.933 --> 03:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I get older, I realize the
history that felt so ancient
when I was growing up is so

03:29.800 --> 03:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - so close to us and present
in ways that I had never
imagined, or didn't want to let

03:37.233 --> 03:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
myself imagine
when I was a child.

03:39.466 --> 03:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, writing about it, I think,
is a way of reckoning with
what is yet to be resolved

03:46.333 --> 03:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the present moment, about
how we are willing to love
each other, even though we

03:53.533 --> 03:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
look different from one another.

03:55.566 --> 04:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Smith has
been a professor at Princeton
since 2005 and now heads its

04:02.666 --> 04:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
creative writing program,
teaching small seminars to
young poets in the making.

04:07.533 --> 04:10.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here especially, she
says, the emphasis is
on how we use language.

04:10.833 --> 04:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: Yes, this
is our library and one of
our favorite classrooms.

04:15.666 --> 04:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want them to start thinking
that a poem isn't just an
expression of all these things

04:20.233 --> 04:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you're feeling, but
it's a set of choices that
you're making in language.

04:27.166 --> 04:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, every description, every
question, every statement, every
turn is a choice that opens

04:32.800 --> 04:35.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up or closes off
certain possibilities.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you don't always think
about that when you're sitting
down to write in the flush

04:38.800 --> 04:39.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of emotion.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But thinking about...

04:41.233 --> 04:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, the
feelings are part of it, right?

04:42.433 --> 04:43.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TRACY K. SMITH: The
feelings are part of it.

04:43.900 --> 04:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the
expression is part of it.

04:45.133 --> 04:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But you're saying the
language choices...

04:47.600 --> 04:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: Beyond
that, yes, the language
can help you get some
traction in those feelings.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"One of the women greeted me.

04:52.733 --> 04:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
'I love you,' she said.

04:55.433 --> 05:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She didn't know me, but I
believed her, and a terrible new
ache rolled over in my chest."

05:02.466 --> 05:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To hear some of
her language, Smith read part
of a new poem titled "Wade

05:07.533 --> 05:09.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the Water."

05:09.633 --> 05:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: "I love you
throughout the performance in
every hand clap, every stomp.

05:15.700 --> 05:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love you in the rusted iron
chains someone was made to drag
until love let them be unclasped

05:23.433 --> 05:25.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and left empty in the
center of the ring."

05:25.766 --> 05:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now Tracy K.
Smith will have a prominent
voice, a very public national

05:31.900 --> 05:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
platform, to reach
new audiences.

05:34.666 --> 05:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you think about the
tumultuous times we're
in technologically, all
kinds of changes around

05:39.433 --> 05:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us, if you think about
the divisions politically
at this moment, it seems
like an appropriate

05:46.500 --> 05:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
moment to say, why poetry?

05:48.700 --> 05:49.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why bother?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why bother being a poet?

05:51.300 --> 05:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What kind of impact could you
possibly have, amidst all that?

05:53.966 --> 05:56.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRACY K. SMITH: Mm-hmm.

05:56.033 --> 06:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say that a poem
allows or requires you to
submit to something else.

06:03.433 --> 06:04.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Often...

06:04.433 --> 06:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Submit means?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: That's one of
the things we don't want to
do, to say, OK, I'm not the

06:08.533 --> 06:09.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
expert.

06:09.533 --> 06:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're the expert.

06:10.533 --> 06:12.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let me listen.

06:12.900 --> 06:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me respond to
something that's completely
counterintuitive for
me, that pulls me toward

06:18.333 --> 06:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a different sense
of what's valuable.

06:20.666 --> 06:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, when we do that with
a work of art, we're learning
how to do that in real time

06:28.700 --> 06:30.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with other people.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Does that mean
even making us better citizens?

06:32.700 --> 06:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRACY K. SMITH: I think so.

06:34.933 --> 06:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Poems remind us of that.

06:36.533 --> 06:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Poems remind us that someone
is saying, come here.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This has happened to me.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is how it made me feel.

06:43.900 --> 06:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is who I am in
the wake of this thing.

06:47.133 --> 06:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we all have
stories like that.

06:50.600 --> 06:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're important to honor,
and they're important also
to say, maybe my story helps

06:57.766 --> 07:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me listen and cherish this
other person's story, too.

07:04.766 --> 07:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Smith says a key
goal for her as laureate will
be to bring poetry into places

07:09.066 --> 07:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where it's not often heard.

07:10.700 --> 07:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeffrey Brown in
Princeton, New Jersey.

07:14.833 --> 07:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, online,
you can watch Tracy K.
Smith read two new poems.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site
at PBS.org/NewsHour.
