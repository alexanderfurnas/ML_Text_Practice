JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.672 --> 00:06.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.673 --> 00:07.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:09.643 --> 00:12.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
powerful earthquake
hits Central Italy, toppling
towns and leaving

00:12.946 --> 00:17.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 150 dead, as rescuers
scramble to
save those stuck under the
rubble.

00:17.751 --> 00:22.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
a look at the inner workings of
the Clinton

00:22.389 --> 00:27.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Foundation with its president,
and why it's
become so controversial for the
Democratic

00:27.127 --> 00:28.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Party's nominee.

00:28.829 --> 00:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And a popular
destination
for tourists, Iceland is
becoming home to

00:32.299 --> 00:36.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees fleeing wars -- how the
close-knit
island is adapting to an influx
of outsiders.

00:36.970 --> 00:41.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTIN ISLEIFSDOTTIR, Iceland:
I think of
our country as just a part of
the global village.

00:41.775 --> 00:45.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody can decide where they're
born, and
I think everyone should have a
fair chance.

00:45.812 --> 00:53.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:53.420 --> 00:56.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:56.189 --> 01:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In today's early
morning hours,
Italy's countryside was jolted
awake by an

01:06.566 --> 01:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
earthquake, striking just
beneath the surface
and wreaking terrible havoc.

01:11.605 --> 01:18.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The official number of deaths
has reached
159, but that number is expected
to grow.

01:18.845 --> 01:24.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An army of rescue workers
quickly descended
on three small Italian towns
that were leveled

01:24.952 --> 01:26.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the quake.

01:26.586 --> 01:30.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were able to pull some
people from the
rubble, but others remain
trapped.

01:31.024 --> 01:36.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
heard people asking
for help, people calling out,
asking for help,

01:36.196 --> 01:37.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but in this condition, what
could I do?

01:37.864 --> 01:40.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been to the center, and
it's all in
rubble.

01:40.567 --> 01:46.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
came out to the
piazza, and it looked like
Dante's Inferno,

01:46.173 --> 01:48.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people crying for help, help.

01:48.575 --> 01:53.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The 6.2-magnitude
earthquake
hit in the middle of the night,
just after

01:54.014 --> 01:55.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
3:30 a.m.

01:55.816 --> 02:02.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was felt across Central
Italy, but the
tiny towns of Amatrice,
Accumoli, and Pescara

02:02.522 --> 02:05.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
del Tronto were hardest-hit.

02:05.392 --> 02:11.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Italian Prime Minister Matteo
Renzi arrived
in Amatrice late today after
promising the

02:11.965 --> 02:13.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
area his full support.

02:13.900 --> 02:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTEO RENZI, Italian Prime
Minister (through
translator): This is a time when
we're allowed

02:17.904 --> 02:19.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to shed tears.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the faithful, it is a moment
to say a
prayer.

02:21.375 --> 02:24.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For everyone, it is a moment of
respect and
pain.

02:24.811 --> 02:31.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's slow going
for the rescue
workers who are combing the
wreckage for survivors,

02:31.184 --> 02:33.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
oftentimes using only their
hands.

02:33.186 --> 02:39.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREA GENTILI, Rescue Worker
(through translator):
We need chain saws, shears to
cut iron bars,

02:39.059 --> 02:40.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and jacks to remove beams.

02:40.827 --> 02:41.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Everything.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We need everything.

02:43.764 --> 02:49.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The hard work
paid off in Accumoli,
where a 65-year-old man was
pulled out of

02:49.202 --> 02:52.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the rubble after nine hours.

02:52.873 --> 02:57.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Applause followed the man as he
was loaded
into an ambulance.

02:57.844 --> 03:02.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get an on-the-scene report
now from special
correspondent Christopher
Livesay, who is

03:02.716 --> 03:04.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Amatrice, Italy.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We spoke just a short time ago.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Chris Livesay, welcome.

03:08.088 --> 03:11.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, you have been
there all day
long.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you seeing?

03:13.160 --> 03:15.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: Well, I'm
seeing what
looks like the aftermath of a
war zone.

03:15.295 --> 03:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The imagery all around me is
much more similar
to what we're used to seeing
come out of places

03:19.599 --> 03:25.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Aleppo and Syria, not the
idyllic hillside
town of Amatrice.

03:25.138 --> 03:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Normally, this is a place where
tourists go
to escape the heat during the
summer, especially

03:30.444 --> 03:34.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the month of August, which in
Italy is the
national month of vacations.

03:34.981 --> 03:40.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So a town of normally 2,000
people had twice
the population this time of
year, only increasing

03:40.854 --> 03:43.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the amount of injuries and
fatalities, unfortunately.

03:43.190 --> 03:47.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When people think
of Italy,
of course they think of history.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just how widespread was the
damage?

03:49.396 --> 03:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: The damage
stretches
all the way from the west coast
to the east

03:54.468 --> 03:56.203 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coast.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if you want a sense of
history and
culture, just look behind me at
the Church

03:59.172 --> 04:00.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of St. Augustine.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It dates back to the 14th
century.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Half of it is collapsed right
before your
eyes.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only the belfry is really
standing.

04:08.215 --> 04:13.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's rather indicative of
the damage
that stretches all across
Central Italy, not

04:13.453 --> 04:18.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just here in the region of Lazio
around Rome,
but also the nearby region of
Umbria, which

04:18.792 --> 04:22.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has a number of artistic
heritage sites.

04:22.796 --> 04:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking not just in that
region, but
all across Central Italy,
buildings that range

04:28.435 --> 04:31.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the Middle Ages to the
Renaissance.

04:31.304 --> 04:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's going to be all types of
loss, not
just of life, but, of course,
that is the

04:35.242 --> 04:38.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most important thing that
everyone is rushing
to save.

04:38.445 --> 04:44.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People all around me, volunteers
and professionals
likewise, are working around the
clock to

04:44.317 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see if there are any survivors
still underneath
this rubble.

04:47.354 --> 04:51.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do they have the
resources
they need, Chris, to get this
done?

04:51.224 --> 04:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: They seem
to have all
the resources they need,
especially in terms

04:54.694 --> 04:56.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of manpower.

04:56.630 --> 05:03.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been overwhelmed by the
amount of volunteers
and other rescue agencies from
firefighters

05:03.270 --> 05:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to ambulance drivers to civil
protection agents,
you name it.

05:08.108 --> 05:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even the military is chipping in
at this point.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're all working around the
clock to help
people.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.650 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You have tents.

05:16.683 --> 05:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have cots that have been set
up in parks.

05:19.819 --> 05:24.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a sports center that has
been converted
into a makeshift dormitory.

05:24.691 --> 05:32.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, just in this town of
Amatrice, there are
temporary beds set up for
hundreds of people,

05:32.666 --> 05:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's the case all across
Italy right
now.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of temporary beds and
housing have
been set up.

05:38.305 --> 05:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the people do appear to have
all the help
they need.

05:42.742 --> 05:48.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they have working against
them is perhaps
the very thing that makes this
part of Italy

05:48.181 --> 05:53.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so picturesque, and that's the
fact that these
are small hilltop towns with
twisting and

05:53.253 --> 05:54.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
winding roads.

05:54.988 --> 06:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those roads were not made for
heavy vehicles,
lots of ambulances, one after
another.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're having to negotiate the
road.

06:03.663 --> 06:07.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oftentimes, there's just not
enough space
for everyone to go in and out of
these place,

06:07.767 --> 06:12.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so they're relying heavily on
helicopters
to air evac people into nearby
hospital, but

06:12.939 --> 06:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also hospitals as far afield as
Rome, which
is almost 100 miles from here.

06:17.978 --> 06:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chris Livesay in
Amatrice,
thank you.

06:21.448 --> 06:25.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Five thousand
miles away
from Italy, another powerful
earthquake rocked

06:25.652 --> 06:27.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Myanmar today, killing at least
four people.

06:27.687 --> 06:32.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 6.8-magnitude quake struck
near the town
of Chauk, 20 miles from the
former capital

06:32.859 --> 06:34.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Bagan.

06:34.661 --> 06:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials estimated almost 200
of Bagan's
centuries-old Buddhist pagodas
were damaged.

06:39.799 --> 06:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The devastation could have been
worse, had
the quake not hit so deep
underground.

06:43.570 --> 06:49.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Militants
attacked the American
University of Afghanistan in
Kabul, the capital,

06:49.309 --> 06:50.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At least one person was killed
and 18 more
were wounded.

06:53.446 --> 06:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Foreign staff and dozens of
students were
reportedly trapped inside the
compound.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Student witnesses said the
shooting lasted
for more than an hour.

07:02.289 --> 07:06.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZIAUCOIN, Survivor (through
translator): First,
an explosion happened, and then
we heard the

07:06.726 --> 07:08.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sound of gunfire.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Twenty of us were in the class.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two bullets hit on the door of
our classroom.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the boys escaped through the
window of
the class.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There was no
immediate claim
of responsibility.

07:17.904 --> 07:22.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the second time this
month that the
university or its staff have
been targeted.

07:22.208 --> 07:27.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In South
Sudan, at least
275 people have died in fighting
between government

07:27.113 --> 07:28.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
troops and rebel forces.

07:28.948 --> 07:33.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each side blamed the other today
for launching
attacks in a northeastern town
less than a

07:33.386 --> 07:35.221 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
week ago.

07:35.255 --> 07:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those reports came after word
that opposition
leader Riek Machar, who'd
recently fled the

07:39.693 --> 07:42.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, is now in Sudan for
urgent medical
attention.

07:42.429 --> 07:48.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: North Korea's
successful launch
of a ballistic missile triggered
swift condemnation

07:48.501 --> 07:50.370 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

07:50.403 --> 07:54.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was fired from a submarine,
and flew over
300 miles within range of
hitting South Korea

07:54.874 --> 07:56.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and parts of Japan.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the farthest distance the
North has
successfully fired such a
weapon.

08:00.914 --> 08:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The foreign ministers of China,
Japan, and
South Korea denounced the launch
today in

08:06.353 --> 08:08.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tokyo, in a rare show of unity.

08:08.755 --> 08:13.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WANG YI, Chinese Foreign
Minister (through
translator): China opposes North
Korea's nuclear

08:13.893 --> 08:18.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missile program, and opposes any
words or
deeds that could cause tensions
on the Korean

08:18.198 --> 08:19.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Peninsula.

08:19.966 --> 08:23.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
China will adhere to its
consistent and firm
stand of making persistent
efforts towards

08:23.703 --> 08:25.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
denuclearization on the
peninsula.

08:25.705 --> 08:30.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. State
Department echoed
that sentiment, saying its
commitment to protecting

08:30.210 --> 08:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its allies in the region from
North Korean
aggression was -- quote --
"iron-clad."

08:34.214 --> 08:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And stocks
slipped on Wall
Street today, led by drops in
the health care

08:38.752 --> 08:40.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and materials sectors.

08:40.387 --> 08:44.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly
66 points to close at 18481.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 42 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
dropped 11.

08:48.027 --> 08:52.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
Vice President Biden's visit to
Turkey amid

08:52.432 --> 08:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a major military push into
Syria; the Clinton
Foundation's president addresses
the recent

08:58.505 --> 09:09.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
charges of a conflict of
interest; refugees
finding a new home in the Arctic
Circle; and

09:09.883 --> 09:15.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

09:15.855 --> 09:22.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish military forces launched
a major operation
inside Syria today to retake the
strategic

09:22.095 --> 09:25.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border town of Jarabulus from
ISIS.

09:25.398 --> 09:30.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish and American jets
attacked from above,
as Turkish tanks and special
forces moved

09:30.637 --> 09:32.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into the town.

09:32.338 --> 09:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian rebel groups were also
part of the
operation.

09:35.608 --> 09:40.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beyond ousting ISIS from the
area, Turkey
has another motive for attacking
on Jarabulus,

09:40.213 --> 09:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to stem the ambitions of the
main U.S.-backed
Syrian Kurdish militia, known as
the YPG,

09:48.388 --> 09:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which has been taking over
territory from
ISIS.

09:50.824 --> 09:56.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Vice President Biden was
visiting Turkey today,
and he called upon the Kurds to
limit their

09:56.663 --> 09:58.398 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
advances.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: We have made it
absolutely clear to

10:00.533 --> 10:06.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the elements that were part of
the Syrian
democratic forces, the YPG that
participated,

10:06.940 --> 10:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they must move back across
the river.

10:11.277 --> 10:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They cannot, will not and under
no circumstances
get American support if they do
not keep that

10:20.820 --> 10:22.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
commitment, period.

10:22.522 --> 10:26.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We examine the
significance
of all of this now with Aaron
Stein.

10:26.726 --> 10:32.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a senior fellow at the
Atlantic Council's
Rafik Hariri Center for the
Middle East.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aaron Stein, thank you for being
here.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON STEIN, Atlantic Council's
Rafik Hariri
Center for the Middle East:
Thank you for

10:35.235 --> 10:37.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
having me.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is the
significance
of this incursion across the
border into Syria?

10:38.872 --> 10:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON STEIN: I think the biggest
one is, it
denies ISIS one of its last
major crossing

10:42.909 --> 10:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points across the Turkish-Syrian
border.

10:44.777 --> 10:48.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jarabulus has historically been
a place where
they have moved men and material
across.

10:48.314 --> 10:53.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, by Turkey moving in
alongside of its host
of Arab groups, ISIS loses
territory along

10:53.586 --> 10:55.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
its border, ISIS goes weaker.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is a good thing for the
U.S. and
Turkey.

10:57.090 --> 11:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But if it hadn't
been for this
move, it's possible that the
Syrian Kurds

11:01.761 --> 11:04.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would have been in that
territory sooner or
later, is that not right?

11:05.031 --> 11:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON STEIN: Yes, I think that's
the issue
here, is that the United States
is having

11:07.634 --> 11:09.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to thread a very fine needle.

11:09.235 --> 11:11.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's having to thread the needle
very finely
here.

11:11.070 --> 11:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it has to, one, prosecute
the war against
ISIS, where the Syrian Kurds
have become the

11:15.375 --> 11:20.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most prominent ground force and
the one capable
of taking the most territory,
while managing

11:20.113 --> 11:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ties with a NATO ally who is
very wary of
the Syrian Kurds moving up to
its border.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I know, for
many people,
some of these terms are hard to
follow.

11:27.587 --> 11:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mentioned the YPG, this
particular Syrian
Kurdish group.

11:31.558 --> 11:36.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let me ask you about the
U.S. interest
here, because until now it seems
the U.S.

11:37.030 --> 11:42.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been careful to respect the
role of the
Kurds in that region, despite
the tensions

11:42.168 --> 11:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Turkey's government.

11:43.937 --> 11:44.971 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What's changed?

11:45.004 --> 11:46.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AARON STEIN: I don't think
anything has changed.

11:46.806 --> 11:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I think is going on is
that, in this
previous operation, the one for
the city of

11:50.076 --> 11:54.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manbij, which is just a few
miles south, they
had Turkish buy-in for heavy
Turkish presence

11:54.981 --> 11:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in there, contingent upon the
larger, broader
deal that the Kurds, as the vice
president

11:59.452 --> 12:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said, would move back across the
river.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's what the vice
president
was saying today, is that the
Kurds have got

12:04.924 --> 12:06.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to uphold their end of the
bargain.

12:06.693 --> 12:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United States essentially
told Turkey
that they would make the Kurds
move back.

12:09.862 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then concurrent to that, you
have Turkey
moving into Jarabulus.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria is a very complicated
place with a lot
of moving parts.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is just one of them.

12:17.203 --> 12:21.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But let's back up
and look
at the larger political --
geopolitical picture

12:21.107 --> 12:26.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, and that has to do with
the coup attempt
in Turkey just a month or so
ago.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's really changed the
dynamic, hasn't
it, between the U.S. and Turkey?

12:29.682 --> 12:31.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AARON STEIN: Right.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think anybody was
planning for a coup
on July 15, a coup attempt in
Turkey on July

12:34.621 --> 12:36.389 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
15.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's obviously complicated
relations
largely because the person that
Turkey accuses

12:39.926 --> 12:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of being the mastermind of the
coup, Fethullah
Gulen, is a U.S. green card
holder who lives

12:44.497 --> 12:45.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Pennsylvania.

12:45.898 --> 12:48.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's been some back and
forth about
the extradition process.

12:48.801 --> 12:52.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey just wishes we would hand
him over,
and the U.S., for very obvious
reasons, if

12:52.271 --> 12:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you ask me, is making Turkey
follow all the
legal steps, because, if you
really violate

12:56.376 --> 13:00.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those legal steps, and if you
take special
measures, even for an ally, it
sends the wrong

13:00.546 --> 13:03.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
message that the U.S. will just
simply turn
people over.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And sometimes an ally doesn't
ask to turn
people over.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, connect the
dots.

13:07.120 --> 13:12.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Between Turkey's nervousness and
asking to
get Fethullah Gulen back
extradited from the

13:12.725 --> 13:19.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States, and then Turkey
being anxious
to put a stop to any potential
Kurdish move

13:19.132 --> 13:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria, connects the two
things.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AARON STEIN: Well, so this is
where the politics
become very important.

13:24.037 --> 13:28.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the United States has an
incentive to
support Turkey, a NATO ally, as
it moves into

13:28.641 --> 13:29.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Syria, particularly in
Jarabulus.

13:30.009 --> 13:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, moving forward,
that's where
the questions will be.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how long does Turkey plan to
stay in Jarabulus?

13:35.615 --> 13:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does it have plans to move
farther?

13:38.584 --> 13:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what is the U.S. role in
this?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we're still figuring
that out,
as outsiders, and I would even
say that the

13:42.989 --> 13:46.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
U.S. government is still
figuring that out,
because this operation does seem
to have kind

13:46.125 --> 13:50.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of come together relatively
quickly on the
Turkish side, even if their
plans have been

13:50.229 --> 13:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the shelf for a little over
-- for the
past year or so.

13:53.066 --> 13:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Aaron Stein,
remind us why
Turkey is an important ally for
the United

13:56.703 --> 13:58.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AARON STEIN: Well, they have
been an ally
in the NATO alliance since 1952.

14:00.506 --> 14:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's always hard to point to why
breaking
such an alliance is a big deal,
other than,

14:05.945 --> 14:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a time when transatlantic
relations and
the NATO alliance has come under
pressure

14:09.649 --> 14:16.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Republican presidential
candidate
for the presidency, you want to
keep the transatlantic

14:16.556 --> 14:18.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alliance in place.

14:18.324 --> 14:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look beyond ISIS, the
threat from
the Islamic State, Turkey is in
a part of

14:23.096 --> 14:25.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world where the U.S. likes
to play a role
in.

14:25.932 --> 14:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And obviously we would like to
have as many
friends as possible.

14:28.334 --> 14:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this is
clearly -- or in
part, at least, a case of the
United States

14:31.871 --> 14:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
placating, wanting to make sure
it stays on
good terms with Turkey, as
Turkey deals with

14:37.810 --> 14:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its insecurity when it comes to
the Kurds.

14:40.847 --> 14:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON STEIN: I think we do have
an incentive
to try and reach back out to
Turkey, even

14:44.717 --> 14:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though, within Turkey, there has
been, in
my opinion, sort of an
overplaying of the

14:49.055 --> 14:53.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anti-American card to deflect
from what really
has been a very traumatic past
month in Turkey.

14:53.593 --> 14:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have a failed coup attempt,
over 200 people
killed.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Parliament was bombed.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the military was really
fractured.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is a big problem, and
the Turkish
leaders have leaned on
anti-American sentiment

15:03.903 --> 15:05.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to explain it away.

15:05.705 --> 15:09.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, just bottom
line here,
it's a reminder that, yes, ISIS
is a big enemy,

15:09.909 --> 15:13.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but ISIS is not the only
complicating factor
in that part of the world.

15:13.813 --> 15:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a lot going on between
the Turks and
the Kurds.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AARON STEIN: Absolutely.

15:19.519 --> 15:23.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For Turkey, the Kurdish
sub-state actor problem
is always number one.

15:23.289 --> 15:28.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS, I would say, is 1-A, and
now you have
to add Fethullah Gulen, who
Turkey also claims

15:28.194 --> 15:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a sub-state actor, who they
say carried
out a coup attempt on July 15
and now lives

15:33.132 --> 15:34.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the United States.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All three things came together.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a very difficult time
for U.S.-Turkey
relations because of it.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there are a
lot of threads
to follow here.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we thank you for helping us
understand
what's going on.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Aaron Stein, we appreciate it.

15:46.879 --> 15:51.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AARON STEIN: My pleasure.

15:51.751 --> 15:56.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

15:56.622 --> 16:02.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to the
2016 presidential
race, and the growing scrutiny
over Bill and

16:02.929 --> 16:05.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's namesake
foundation.

16:05.097 --> 16:10.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
It's impossible to tell where
the Clinton

16:10.236 --> 16:13.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Foundation ends and the State
Department begins.

16:13.272 --> 16:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That was
Republican nominee
Donald Trump today in Tampa,
Florida.

16:18.144 --> 16:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Clinton Foundation, a
nonprofit, was started
back in 1997, and in less than
two decades,

16:24.383 --> 16:27.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has grown into a philanthropic
giant.

16:27.220 --> 16:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2014, the foundation took in
$338 million
and had $250 million in
expenses, geared toward

16:36.629 --> 16:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
improving global access to AIDS
drugs, speaking
out on women's rights, and more.

16:42.869 --> 16:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some of the countries that
contribute
to the Clinton Foundation
struggle with human

16:46.739 --> 16:53.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights issues of their own, like
Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates, Qatar,
and Kuwait.

16:53.379 --> 16:59.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a recent Associated Press
analysis found
that about half of the 150
people from outside

16:59.552 --> 17:04.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government who met with or spoke
by phone
with Hillary Clinton while she
was secretary

17:04.423 --> 17:09.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of state either donated or
pledged donations
to the Clinton Foundation.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This morning, Clinton campaign
manager Robby
Mook responded.

17:11.998 --> 17:15.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBBY MOOK, Hillary Clinton
Campaign Manager:
By our count, there were 1,700
other meetings

17:15.701 --> 17:16.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that she had.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, she was secretary of
state.

17:18.237 --> 17:21.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was meeting with foreign
officials and
government officials constantly.

17:21.307 --> 17:28.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to pull all of them out of
the equation,
cherry-pick a very small number
of meetings,

17:28.648 --> 17:30.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is pretty outrageous.

17:30.416 --> 17:33.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And in a
statement posted
on Monday, Bill Clinton said
that, if Hillary

17:33.653 --> 17:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is elected, the foundation would
-- quote
-- "accept contributions only
from U.S. citizens,

17:39.258 --> 17:44.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
permanent residents and
U.S.-based independent
foundations, and not foreign or
corporate

17:45.031 --> 17:46.565 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
entities."

17:46.599 --> 17:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also said he would step down
from its board,
and stop fund-raising for it.

17:50.469 --> 17:56.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The amounts
involved, the favors
done, and the significant number
of times

17:56.709 --> 18:05.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was done require an expedited
investigation
by a special prosecutor
immediately, immediately,

18:05.151 --> 18:06.953 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immediately.

18:06.986 --> 18:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still, the
Republican ticket
has seized on the Clinton
Foundation as a

18:10.923 --> 18:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
line of attack in recent days.

18:12.892 --> 18:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as Trump's campaign stop
today made clear,
the questions swirling around
the philanthropic

18:17.997 --> 18:23.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group could keep on swirling as
the campaign
moves into the final stretch.

18:23.369 --> 18:27.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We dig into the details now,
with Doug White,
former director of Columbia
University's graduate

18:27.606 --> 18:32.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fund-raising management program,
and an adviser
to nonprofit groups and
philanthropists, and

18:32.545 --> 18:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Grimaldi, investigative
reporter for
The Wall Street Journal.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Doug White, let me start with
you.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the core critique of how
the foundation
operates?

18:39.752 --> 18:44.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG WHITE, Columbia University:
Well, right
now, the core critique should be
what its

18:44.223 --> 18:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mission is accomplishing around
the world.

18:47.126 --> 18:51.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know the specifics on
that, but they
are doing a lot of good work
around the world,

18:51.097 --> 18:52.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from my estimation.

18:52.999 --> 18:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And so is
there an appearance
of impropriety or a conflict of
interest in

18:57.503 --> 19:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how the foundation works or
whether or not
it increased access to Secretary
of State

19:02.942 --> 19:04.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUG WHITE: There is most
definitely an appearance
of impropriety.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no question about that
at all.

19:09.281 --> 19:16.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My concern is what kind of
influence prior
to now that has been into
Secretary Clinton's

19:16.622 --> 19:22.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
office, and then, as -- if she
becomes president,
what will the influence be then?

19:22.328 --> 19:32.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't want to have a president
who is that
enhanced by the donors of other
-- by another

19:32.538 --> 19:38.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charity, so that when we have
questions that
are dealing with the issue of
international

19:38.811 --> 19:43.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationships, we have to
separate that from
what a foundation is all about.

19:43.382 --> 19:47.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James
Grimaldi, what are
the meetings that Secretary of
State Clinton

19:47.219 --> 19:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
took that are raising these
concerns?

19:49.055 --> 19:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES GRIMALDI, The Wall Street
Journal: Well,
there was a recent Associated
Press report

19:52.358 --> 19:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that analyzed the calendars of
Secretary Clinton.

19:55.428 --> 20:00.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they looked at all the
private meetings
for the first half of her tenure
at the State

20:00.633 --> 20:04.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department, because that's all
that's been
released under the lawsuit they
have under

20:04.870 --> 20:06.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Freedom of Information Act.

20:06.839 --> 20:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were 145 meetings, and
about 85, I believe,
of those meetings were with
Clinton Foundation

20:13.579 --> 20:15.314 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
donors.

20:15.347 --> 20:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that raised the question
about whether
those meetings meant that if you
paid money

20:20.119 --> 20:24.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the donation or gave some
sort of gift
that you were going to get
expedited treatment

20:24.690 --> 20:26.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the State Department.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even if this
is a limited
cross-section of all the
meetings that she

20:29.628 --> 20:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took, is there evidence or are
there issues
where she advocated on behalf of
companies

20:36.268 --> 20:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that might have contributed to
the foundation?

20:37.470 --> 20:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES GRIMALDI: Yes, so I took a
look at that
question.

20:40.072 --> 20:44.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We broke down all of the donors
for the Clinton
Foundation.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We categorized them by size.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we looked at the
largest corporation.

20:49.548 --> 20:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of those corporations, we then
compared them
with lobbying records that are
filed with

20:53.819 --> 20:55.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the United States Congress.

20:55.654 --> 21:00.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we did that, we found that
60 corporations
that were lobbying the State
Department while

21:00.292 --> 21:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton was secretary of
state had
given $26 million to the Clinton
Foundation.

21:06.832 --> 21:11.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In addition, they had
participated in commitments,
they call them, charitable
projects, with

21:11.537 --> 21:16.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Clinton Foundation, valued
by the foundation
at more than $2 billion.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are sort of big numbers in
terms of
that.

21:19.044 --> 21:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The billions didn't go to the
Clinton Foundation.

21:21.514 --> 21:26.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They went to charities and
charitable activities,
but the Clinton Foundation
rightly takes some

21:26.886 --> 21:28.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
credit for those.

21:28.654 --> 21:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the question is, when these
favors that
Hillary is doing for certain
companies or

21:32.925 --> 21:37.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these companies are seeking
favors from Secretary
Clinton, were they giving
because they were

21:37.963 --> 21:40.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hoping she was going to help
them out?

21:40.065 --> 21:44.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, in certain cases, we know
that she actually
did help certain companies out.

21:44.103 --> 21:49.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in those cases, they were
probably for
logical, rational reasons any
secretary of

21:49.175 --> 21:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state, for example, lobbying the
Russians
to buy jets from Boeing,
lobbying Algeria

21:55.848 --> 22:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to buy $2 billion worth of
generators from
General Electric.

22:01.554 --> 22:06.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also know that both of
those companies,
as well as others like
Microsoft, Wal-Mart

22:07.026 --> 22:12.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who had asked for favors and
gotten them,
also had given gifts to the
Clinton Foundation,

22:12.398 --> 22:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either before, during or after
those favors
were performed by Secretary
Clinton.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Doug White,
how do we sort
out intent?

22:19.471 --> 22:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If a Boeing or Microsoft comes
in and says,
well, look, this is in our best
interest,

22:23.542 --> 22:27.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were not trying to curry
favor to gain
access to her, we believe in the
causes that

22:27.713 --> 22:30.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Clinton Foundation is
working on?

22:30.349 --> 22:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG WHITE: I think what Jim
said is absolutely
correct. and you can't really
parse out intent.

22:36.622 --> 22:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as a result of that, that's
why we have
the larger question of really
separating the

22:40.893 --> 22:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clintons from the foundation.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not just that there is
a conflict
of interests.

22:45.798 --> 22:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the execution of conflict
of interests.

22:48.334 --> 22:56.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as long as she has the
ability to be perceived
as having a favor or a favorite
place or person,

22:56.141 --> 23:00.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then the public is going to be
very excited
about that and very upset about
that.

23:00.613 --> 23:04.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think that's the
kind of anchor
she needs going into her
presidency, should

23:04.783 --> 23:06.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she be elected.

23:06.585 --> 23:09.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James
Grimaldi, what about
the steps that President Bill
Clinton and

23:09.288 --> 23:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the foundation said that they
are planning
to take going forward if Mrs.
Clinton is elected

23:14.660 --> 23:15.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the White House?

23:15.661 --> 23:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES GRIMALDI: Well, that's
interesting.

23:16.662 --> 23:18.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They seem to be almost in flux.

23:18.564 --> 23:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you just reported, they will
stop taking
corporate and foreign government
gifts.

23:24.169 --> 23:29.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, we found out recently,
just in the
last couple of days, there is a
major exception

23:29.141 --> 23:30.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to that.

23:30.943 --> 23:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's possible and perhaps even
likely that
the Clinton Global Health Access
Initiative,

23:37.149 --> 23:43.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which has a separate board, may
actually continue
to take foreign government
contributions and

23:43.789 --> 23:45.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
corporate gifts.

23:45.190 --> 23:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was revealed to us today in
our questioning.

23:48.761 --> 23:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While we found out that Bill
Clinton will
leave the Clinton Foundation
board, we now

23:52.631 --> 23:58.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know that Chelsea Clinton, their
daughter,
is going to remain on the board.

23:58.203 --> 24:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we don't know, because they
haven't said
or apparently have not decided.

24:02.741 --> 24:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She may actually be raising
money for the
Clinton Foundation going
forward.

24:07.279 --> 24:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's a possibility that we
will have
a president of the United States
whose daughter

24:12.718 --> 24:18.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is raising millions of dollars
for their foundation,
or the remnants of their
foundation, going

24:18.324 --> 24:20.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into her administration.

24:20.492 --> 24:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That has to be a cloud that
should -- will
probably hang over her if there
ends up being

24:26.465 --> 24:28.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appearances of conflicts of
interests.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: James
Grimaldi, Doug White,
thank you both.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DOUG WHITE: Thank you.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES GRIMALDI: Thank you.

24:34.206 --> 24:38.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we are
joined now by
Donna Shalala, president of the
Clinton Foundation.

24:38.277 --> 24:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She served as secretary of
health and human
services in the Bill Clinton
administration.

24:42.748 --> 24:45.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Madam Secretary, thanks for
joining us.

24:45.617 --> 24:51.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Members of Hillary Clinton's
campaign, as
well as your foundation, have
said recently

24:51.657 --> 24:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there is -- has been no
conflict of interests
in the meetings that Secretary
Clinton took

24:56.495 --> 25:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with those people who also
happen to be donors
to the Clinton Foundation.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you see the appearance of
impropriety?

25:02.134 --> 25:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA SHALALA, President,
Clinton Foundation:
Well, our goal is to eliminate
all appearance

25:06.872 --> 25:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of impropriety if Mrs. Clinton
is elected.

25:11.343 --> 25:16.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president has already
announced not
only that we won't take any
corporate donations

25:16.281 --> 25:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or foreign donations, but he
will leave a
role in governance.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He will leave the board of the
foundation.

25:23.288 --> 25:30.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, as for the other
organizations which
are our partners, we will make
sure that both

25:30.496 --> 25:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the governance is clean, but,
more importantly,
that those programs are spun
off, either as

25:36.902 --> 25:43.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
separate 501(c)(3)s without our
participation,
or we will find partners that
will take over

25:43.509 --> 25:44.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the responsibility.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We help millions of people
around the world.

25:47.913 --> 25:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are 100,000 farmers in
East Africa that
depend on the Clinton programs
for their seeds,

25:55.621 --> 25:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for technical assistance, for
training.

25:58.924 --> 26:04.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to make sure that
whether they're
women entrepreneurs in Latin
America or farmers

26:04.663 --> 26:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Africa or Asia that all of
these programs
are seamlessly transferred
either to other

26:12.371 --> 26:15.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organizations or to become
independent organizations.

26:15.908 --> 26:21.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have already announced that
the Clinton
Global Initiative, the great
matchmaker between

26:21.547 --> 26:28.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not-for-profit foundations and
corporations
to do wonderful charity work
around the world,

26:28.420 --> 26:33.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that that will end after this
September's
conference.

26:33.625 --> 26:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're taking very strong
steps, but it
would be irresponsible to do all
of this before

26:39.398 --> 26:41.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she is elected.

26:41.200 --> 26:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if she is elected, we
will take very
strong steps that will make it
very clear

26:50.476 --> 26:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Clinton Foundation has
no conflict
of interests, as many as we can
reduce, by

26:56.782 --> 27:01.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spinning off or finding partners
for our major
programs.

27:01.787 --> 27:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will keep some domestic
programs.

27:04.823 --> 27:09.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We can -- we have full
responsibility for
the Clinton Presidential
Library, for the

27:09.428 --> 27:16.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton Center in Little Rock,
which has had
tremendous economic interests
and impact on

27:16.568 --> 27:17.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Arkansas.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sure.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA SHALALA: So, people forget
the Clinton
Foundation includes a major
presidential library

27:22.207 --> 27:23.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and center.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sure.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I don't think anybody
would fault President
Clinton for wanting to be
involved with his

27:27.613 --> 27:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own library, but how about
having President
Clinton, Chelsea Clinton as
well, step away

27:32.551 --> 27:34.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
completely from the foundation?

27:34.520 --> 27:37.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are lots of foundations
around the planet
that are doing the work that
you're interested

27:37.623 --> 27:39.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in and are good at it.

27:39.391 --> 27:44.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA SHALALA: And, in fact, we
will find
partners, successful partners,
to make sure

27:44.863 --> 27:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the programs that we have
continue and
continue seamlessly.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what we're working on
now.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president has made this
announcement.

27:53.105 --> 27:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chelsea has said that she is
going to stay
on the foundation board to
provide oversight

27:58.277 --> 28:01.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for this transformation.

28:01.079 --> 28:05.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will have announcements
about her role
in the future as well.

28:05.651 --> 28:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the important thing
is that all
of this will take place and we
will make sure

28:12.524 --> 28:16.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's in place if Mrs. Clinton is
elected.

28:16.128 --> 28:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a responsibility to
millions of people
around the world that we have --
that our

28:20.899 --> 28:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
programs have an impact on.

28:22.901 --> 28:24.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we simply cannot walk away
from that.

28:25.003 --> 28:30.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea that we could just
close down
the foundation without carefully
going program

28:30.542 --> 28:38.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by program, and making certain
that the people
that are served by those
programs actually

28:38.250 --> 28:43.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continue to get those kinds of
services would
be irresponsible.

28:43.188 --> 28:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If Mrs.
Clinton does win
the White House, then, would
Chelsea Clinton

28:47.025 --> 28:49.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
step away as well from her role
on the board?

28:49.194 --> 28:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA SHALALA: We will have an
announcement
about that if Mrs. Clinton is
elected.

28:54.967 --> 29:00.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the important thing now
is that we
have made a series of statements
about what

29:00.706 --> 29:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're going to do with the
programs.

29:02.808 --> 29:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The major programs, we have
actually been
very clear about.

29:07.679 --> 29:12.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we have some smaller
programs that we're
working through, thinking about
what partners

29:12.918 --> 29:14.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and talking to partners.

29:14.219 --> 29:15.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sure.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONNA SHALALA: But all of this
takes place
if she is elected.

29:17.990 --> 29:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ms. Shalala,
President Bill
Clinton is no stranger to
politics.

29:21.493 --> 29:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Neither is Hillary Clinton.

29:23.362 --> 29:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even as she was being confirmed
for the secretary
of state position, several
senators tried

29:26.865 --> 29:30.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring this up, the appearance
of impropriety,
the potential conflict of
interests.

29:30.969 --> 29:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the question really is, is
that does the
foundation offer an opportunity,
a vehicle

29:36.041 --> 29:40.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to access a sitting secretary of
state, a
senator or possibly a president?

29:40.812 --> 29:45.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are so many different --
in these e-mails,
we see people have who have
given significant

29:45.283 --> 29:50.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amounts of money have access or
have had access
at short notice to her.

29:50.822 --> 29:52.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that a coincidence?

29:52.591 --> 30:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA SHALALA: I wouldn't
describe it as a
coincidence, but let me say
this, that we

30:00.265 --> 30:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know very clearly what conflict
of interests
we have to eliminate as part of
the foundation.

30:07.039 --> 30:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're focused on the foundation
program.

30:09.875 --> 30:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And no one should assume, if
they give a gift
to the foundation, that they're
going to get

30:14.346 --> 30:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
access to Mrs. Clinton or to
President Clinton
because of that for the purposes
of changing

30:20.452 --> 30:23.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public policy.

30:23.088 --> 30:24.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we're committed to that.

30:24.790 --> 30:26.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president is committed to
that.

30:26.625 --> 30:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a memorandum of
agreement between
the secretary and the
administration that

30:32.764 --> 30:34.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she went in to.

30:34.132 --> 30:38.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it was signed off on by
the Foreign
Relations Committee.

30:38.804 --> 30:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while we made one small
mistake, in my
judgment, in terms of what we
were supposed

30:44.076 --> 30:52.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to submit through that process,
as far as
I'm concerned, we have kept --
we kept to

30:52.918 --> 30:53.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that agreement.

30:53.919 --> 30:55.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sure.

30:55.554 --> 30:58.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONNA SHALALA: But, more
importantly, what
we're doing now is very
significant.

30:58.890 --> 31:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We cannot do the same types of
things that
we did when she was secretary of
state.

31:02.794 --> 31:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to take a much stronger
position to
eliminate any perception of
conflict of interests.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think that right now,
unfortunately, because
this is the political season,
the examples

31:13.638 --> 31:17.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are being brought out in
these e-mails
happen to be in the public
domain now.

31:18.009 --> 31:19.911 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

31:19.945 --> 31:23.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got a billionaire that
was coincidentally
at a breakfast meeting at the
New York Stock

31:23.582 --> 31:25.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Exchange.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The next day, the State
Department starts
working on a visa request on his
behalf, the

31:27.619 --> 31:30.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wife of another billionaire who
got a last-minute
meeting.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got another billionaire.

31:32.991 --> 31:39.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it sort of -- without
having to cherry-pick
individual meetings, it clearly
to the American

31:39.898 --> 31:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public points out that there
seemed to be
a line.

31:42.768 --> 31:45.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you helped the foundation,
you had access
to Mrs. Clinton.

31:45.437 --> 31:46.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think the concern is...

31:46.938 --> 31:52.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONNA SHALALA: Well, I think we
have to be
careful about that conclusion.

31:52.144 --> 31:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The major companies in the
United States,
the multinationals spend
billions of dollars

31:57.849 --> 31:59.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lobbying in Washington.

31:59.851 --> 32:03.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't think that anyone
has made any
connection there.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But here's what's important.

32:05.223 --> 32:10.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's important to us is that
there are millions
of people around the world whose
lives are

32:10.529 --> 32:17.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
improved by the work of the
Clinton Foundation,
whose lives have been changed by
the work

32:17.202 --> 32:18.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Clinton Foundation.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to make sure that work
continues.

32:20.906 --> 32:24.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has reinvented
philanthropy
in this country.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is an extraordinary
foundation.

32:27.712 --> 32:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And no one in the foundation
wants to see
these attacks or in any way be
perceived as

32:36.855 --> 32:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
having a conflict of interests.

32:38.657 --> 32:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by the end of the election,
if she wins,
it will be very clear to the
American people

32:47.032 --> 32:50.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what we will do and what
programs will remain
in the foundation.

32:50.535 --> 32:54.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only thing I can assure you
at the moment
is the Clinton Library is going
to remain

32:54.673 --> 32:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the foundation and that the
president is
going to visit his foundation,
library.

32:58.410 --> 32:59.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

32:59.811 --> 33:05.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you, Donna Shalala, the
president of
the Clinton Foundation.

33:05.784 --> 33:10.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

33:10.755 --> 33:14.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

33:14.226 --> 33:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
drastic spike
in the price of EpiPens used to
combat allergic

33:20.198 --> 33:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reactions; and the astronomical
discovery
of an Earth-like planet.

33:24.870 --> 33:31.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: Anti-immigrant
sentiment is on
the rise in Europe, and it has
spread to Iceland,

33:31.309 --> 33:36.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
one of the more unusual
destinations for refugees
from the war in Syria.

33:36.314 --> 33:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many people on this island
nation in the
middle of the North Atlantic
welcome the prospect

33:41.586 --> 33:46.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of their traditionally white,
Christian country
becoming more multicultural.

33:46.758 --> 33:51.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports
from the Icelandic capital,
Reykjavik.

33:51.563 --> 33:57.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Outside
Iceland's tiny Parliament,
pro-refugee supporters outnumber
and encircle

33:57.769 --> 34:03.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a group from a new party called
the Icelandic
National Front, which objects to
recent legislation

34:03.308 --> 34:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relaxing rules on immigration.

34:05.543 --> 34:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of their standard-bearers is
nurse Maria
Magnusdottir.

34:08.146 --> 34:12.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA MAGNUSDOTTIR, Icelandic
National Front:
We do not want people that are
not adapting

34:12.784 --> 34:16.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to our culture, like, for
example, Muslims.

34:16.121 --> 34:19.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not saying that all Muslims
are bad people.

34:19.057 --> 34:24.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, unfortunately, they are not
adapting
to cultures.

34:24.195 --> 34:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, like, in Europe, we can see
two cultures
in most of those countries.

34:31.536 --> 34:34.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is what we are afraid
of.

34:34.572 --> 34:38.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: One of the
cheerleaders on
the other side is Salmann
Tamimi, a Palestinian

34:38.510 --> 34:45.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imam who stopped off in Iceland
en route to
North America in the 1970s, and
never left.

34:45.183 --> 34:51.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALMANN TAMIMI, Imam: You see
how many supporters
are, five, six, 10 times more
than the other

34:51.623 --> 34:52.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guys.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is how the Icelandic
society is,
really.

34:55.360 --> 35:02.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have maybe 2 or 3 percent who
are what
I call racists and fascists.

35:02.767 --> 35:08.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And -- but the majority is nice
people and
we are happy for their support
that we are

35:08.273 --> 35:09.407 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
getting.

35:09.441 --> 35:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The population is very
small here in
Iceland.

35:18.316 --> 35:19.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are very few persons.

35:19.684 --> 35:25.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you open all the borders,
then we're
in trouble.

35:25.090 --> 35:30.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: "This is a
disgusting use
of the flag," shouts Logi
Stefansson, a well-known

35:30.228 --> 35:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
musician who shares Icelandic
and Angolan
heritage.

35:33.064 --> 35:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOGI STEFANSSON, Musician: They
want to basically
keep the country white.

35:35.567 --> 35:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're talking about -- like,
they have 800
asylum-seekers coming next year,
which is,

35:41.039 --> 35:43.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like, a disgraceful number.

35:43.441 --> 35:44.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's too small.

35:44.442 --> 35:45.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They just want the white
supremacy.

35:45.944 --> 35:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, seriously, the system for
asylum-seekers
in Iceland is disgusting.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They get treated like dogs.

35:54.552 --> 35:59.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But the
treatment afforded
the Al-Mohammad family from
Aleppo has been

35:59.324 --> 36:01.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
exemplary.

36:01.192 --> 36:05.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Al-Mohammads left Syria for
Lebanon in
2012, signed up for the U.N.
refugee resettlement

36:06.031 --> 36:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
program, and in January were
told that they
were going to Iceland.

36:09.100 --> 36:12.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Although it wasn't their choice,
English teacher
Khattab is not complaining.

36:13.004 --> 36:16.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHATTAB AL-MOHAMMAD, Syrian
Refugee: This
is now the dream of most of the
Syrians, to

36:16.975 --> 36:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
restore the happiness of their
children and
find a means for making this
happen.

36:24.049 --> 36:31.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were very lucky to be
here, for example,
and have this chance to play,
because other

36:31.790 --> 36:38.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children in Syria now, they are
killed by
the -- our criminal president
and his supporters.

36:38.930 --> 36:45.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Al-Mohammad,
his wife, their
six children and his mother,
have been given

36:45.670 --> 36:50.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an apartment in the middle-class
neighborhood
of Akureyri, a northern town
less than 40

36:50.642 --> 36:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
miles from the Arctic Circle.

36:52.577 --> 36:57.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHATTAB AL-MOHAMMAD: We found a
lot of similarities
between the two societies, for
example, the

36:57.382 --> 37:02.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safety of children, and the
educational system,
health care.

37:02.887 --> 37:06.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are free in Syria, and now
we found
it here.

37:06.391 --> 37:12.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And maybe the most obstacle was
the weather,
the climate itself.

37:12.897 --> 37:16.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we used to have sunny days.

37:16.067 --> 37:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A little bit were cold winter,
but not snow
for, for example, six months.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very hard for us.

37:23.608 --> 37:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The local
council is working
hard to integrate the newcomers.

37:27.145 --> 37:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the refugee coordinator is
visiting to
help the family with temporary
citizenship

37:31.516 --> 37:36.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
documents that will enable them
to travel
freely throughout Europe.

37:36.855 --> 37:40.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Al-Mohammad is looking to get
off welfare
benefits and is seeking a
business partner

37:40.558 --> 37:42.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to set up a restaurant.

37:42.427 --> 37:46.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHATTAB AL-MOHAMMAD: Although we
are -- appreciate
their help, but we want to
participate in

37:46.164 --> 37:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this society and in the economy
of this country.

37:49.267 --> 37:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we don't like to be living
on this kind
of charity.

37:53.671 --> 37:58.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I suppose all the Syrians
are trying their
best in the different places.

37:58.076 --> 38:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are normally independent.

38:01.112 --> 38:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't like to be dependent on
someone.

38:04.082 --> 38:07.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I'm
very happy.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Icelanders are good people.

38:09.687 --> 38:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The country is very generous and
welcoming.

38:12.724 --> 38:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are proud to be here and
to be part
of this country.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BOY (through translator): I'm
happy here.

38:19.797 --> 38:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have friends to play ball
with.

38:21.566 --> 38:24.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HALINA AL-MOHAMMAD, Syrian
Refugee (through
translator): Of course it's
better here, and

38:24.602 --> 38:25.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
secure.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The living here is good,
especially the kids'
school.

38:28.106 --> 38:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Akureyri is a
bustling town
of 18,000 people, popular with
tourists for

38:33.745 --> 38:36.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whale watching and another
nature pursuits.

38:36.748 --> 38:41.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The council is anxious to avoid
the mistakes
of much bigger countries, which
have created

38:41.119 --> 38:44.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ghettos by placing immigrants
together.

38:44.155 --> 38:51.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a nation of just 330,000
people, it's much
easier to house refugees amongst
Icelanders.

38:51.496 --> 38:56.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The town's Red Cross has
organized a support
group whose purpose is to help
the newcomers

38:56.935 --> 38:58.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
find their feet and bloom.

38:58.703 --> 39:05.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARI LAURSSON, Iceland: I hope
that, if at
some point, Iceland would go
sort of be a

39:05.510 --> 39:11.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war zone or something like that,
someone somewhere
else on the planet would welcome
me as well

39:11.482 --> 39:13.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as they possibly can.

39:13.384 --> 39:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTIN ISLEIFSDOTTIR, Iceland:
I think of
our country as just a part of
the global village.

39:16.621 --> 39:20.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody can decide where they're
born, and
I think everyone should have a
fair chance.

39:20.658 --> 39:24.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Two of the
volunteers are
heading out to the house of an
electrician

39:24.462 --> 39:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Damascus called Joumaa
Naser, who lives
with his wife and their five
children.

39:28.700 --> 39:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NGIBJORG STEFANSDOTTIR, Red
Cross Volunteer:
They don't speak English but
they're very

39:32.270 --> 39:34.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
good at practicing Icelandic.

39:34.572 --> 39:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are helping them to
learn.

39:37.075 --> 39:42.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to teach them how to be
themselves
in our society and to use the
Icelandic language.

39:42.580 --> 39:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As the girls
help one of
the younger children with his
Icelandic, the

39:46.985 --> 39:51.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town's cultural coordinator is
on hand to
translate a conversation between
one of the

39:51.723 --> 39:56.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sons, who is just about to start
high school,
and his new teachers.

39:56.194 --> 40:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joumaa Naser's skills as an
electrician are
in demand, and he's happy to be
working.

40:00.331 --> 40:04.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOUMAA NASER, Syrian Refugee
(through translator):
In the long term future, we
haven't yet decided

40:04.736 --> 40:06.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what's going to happen.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But for the immediate future, we
are settling
here.

40:08.606 --> 40:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is good for the children.

40:09.774 --> 40:10.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They feel safe here.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They will get an education.

40:12.877 --> 40:16.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, ultimately, our aim is to
get back to
Syria, when it's safe to do so.

40:16.848 --> 40:21.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Much of the
debate about
refugees and immigration centers
on multiculturalism

40:21.686 --> 40:22.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and religion.

40:22.887 --> 40:26.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the realpolitik of hard cash
has entered
the fray.

40:26.591 --> 40:31.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ever since the financial crisis
of 2008, Iceland
has been trying to get back on
its feet, and

40:31.796 --> 40:32.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it has succeeded.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The economy is booming.

40:34.799 --> 40:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The growth rate here is about 4
percent a
year, and, according to the
country's business

40:39.671 --> 40:46.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders, Iceland needs 2,000
immigrants a
year to maintain that level of
growth.

40:46.544 --> 40:51.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Akureyri's Mayor Eirokur
Bjorgvinsson is very
clear where he stands on the
issue.

40:51.516 --> 40:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EIROKUR BJORGVINSSON, Mayor of
Akureyri: Some
people say that the people need
also social

40:54.652 --> 40:55.620 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
support.

40:55.653 --> 40:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it is also money getting out.

40:57.021 --> 40:58.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they are giving more back
than they have
actually received.

40:58.890 --> 41:04.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Maybe they have received
something for months
or years, but in the long term,
they will

41:04.262 --> 41:06.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
give much more back than they
have received.

41:06.397 --> 41:11.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As elsewhere in
Europe, some
Icelanders have a profound fear,
if not phobia,

41:11.069 --> 41:13.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Islam.

41:13.071 --> 41:17.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHATTAB AL-MOHAMMAD: Islam is a
group of values,
not only just praying and you
agree that -- values.

41:17.942 --> 41:20.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The values of Islam, we see it
here.

41:20.044 --> 41:22.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, why are they afraid?

41:22.080 --> 41:27.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The values, to be honest, the
value of to
be helpful, the value to be
democratic, the

41:27.518 --> 41:31.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
value of being human, these are
the values
of Islam.

41:31.789 --> 41:33.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we found them here.

41:33.758 --> 41:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We missed them in Syria, but we
found them
here.

41:42.500 --> 41:49.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: anger,
criticism and
concern over the soaring cost
for a life-saving

41:49.340 --> 41:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: anger,
criticism and
concern over the soaring cost
for a life-saving

42:10.495 --> 42:11.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
allergy shot.

42:11.496 --> 42:13.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

42:13.231 --> 42:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The price of EpiPens
has jumped
more than 400 percent since
2009.

42:19.170 --> 42:24.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back then, pharmacies paid $103
for a set
of two.

42:24.275 --> 42:27.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As of May, the price had spiked
to $608.

42:27.712 --> 42:34.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mylan, the drug company that
bought EpiPens
in 2007, says nearly 80 percent
of commercially

42:34.085 --> 42:38.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insured patients don't pay
anything at all,
and they have given away
hundreds of thousands

42:38.956 --> 42:40.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of EpiPens for free.

42:40.992 --> 42:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But more than 3.5 million
prescriptions were
written last year, and some
consumers are

42:46.864 --> 42:50.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paying hundreds of dollars,
depending on their
insurance coverage.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now the issue is attracting
political attention.

42:53.504 --> 42:58.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Hillary Clinton called
the price hikes
outrageous, and senators from
both parties

42:58.676 --> 43:02.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are calling for hearings and
explanations
from the company.

43:02.580 --> 43:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar
of Minnesota
joins us now.

43:06.317 --> 43:11.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Klobuchar, everyone has
known someone,
as we were talking about
earlier, knows someone

43:11.656 --> 43:13.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who is carrying one of these
EpiPens.

43:13.891 --> 43:16.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you have got very direct
personal experience.

43:16.294 --> 43:17.261 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

43:17.295 --> 43:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY KLOBUCHAR (D), Minnesota:
Yes, John.

43:18.963 --> 43:23.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My daughter, Abigail, when she
was just 4
or 5 years old, we gave her a
cashew.

43:23.367 --> 43:27.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were in the middle of the
North Woods,
and she could hardly breathe.

43:27.472 --> 43:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I literally remember every
mile of that
nearly hour-long drive to the
hospital, not

43:32.310 --> 43:33.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
knowing if she would make it.

43:33.978 --> 43:36.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that started our journey
with allergies.

43:36.614 --> 43:39.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She still carries an EpiPen
today.

43:39.217 --> 43:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When she was growing up, we all
had to learn
how to stick it into her thigh.

43:44.555 --> 43:48.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's how it is for so many
parents and
so many patients that carry
those today.

43:48.659 --> 43:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to go from $100 to $600, a
400 to 500
percent price increase, to go
from 9 percent

43:56.501 --> 44:04.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
profit margin in 2008 to 55
percent in 2014,
which this company did, to me,
this is an

44:04.108 --> 44:05.076 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
outrage.

44:05.109 --> 44:07.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it really is not an isolated
incident.

44:07.278 --> 44:11.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're seeing other companies do
this as well,
pharmaceutical companies, with
lifesaving

44:11.482 --> 44:12.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drugs every day.

44:12.917 --> 44:16.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We should say that we
invited Mylan
to join us here today.

44:16.587 --> 44:19.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They said they couldn't make
anyone available
today.

44:19.924 --> 44:21.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They did issue a statement.

44:21.792 --> 44:25.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They talked about the changes
they have made
in the product over the years,
but they also

44:25.162 --> 44:30.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
pointed to the insurance
companies, the changing
nature of the insurance
companies, with the

44:30.067 --> 44:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
growth of high-deductible plans.

44:32.303 --> 44:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said: "This current and
ongoing shift
has presented new challenges for
consumers,

44:37.074 --> 44:39.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and now they are bearing more of
the cost."

44:39.810 --> 44:40.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your response?

44:40.811 --> 44:42.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your reaction to that?

44:42.413 --> 44:43.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

44:43.414 --> 44:45.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY KLOBUCHAR: OK.

44:45.182 --> 44:47.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, first of all, they
probably have made
some improvements, but there is
no way those

44:48.019 --> 44:53.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
improvements are at a 500
percent margin on
that -- the original product.

44:53.491 --> 44:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How could they be 500 percent
more than the
product itself in terms of the
value?

44:59.730 --> 45:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That makes no sense to me.

45:01.599 --> 45:08.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, when it comes to the
fact that they
have been selling these things
at this high

45:08.239 --> 45:12.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
price, and they blame insurance
companies
and government and everyone
else, their profit

45:12.510 --> 45:14.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
margin is the one that's gone
up.

45:14.211 --> 45:16.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're the ones that made more
money.

45:16.047 --> 45:19.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that you have these
high-deductible
plan, it just means consumers
are starting

45:19.750 --> 45:22.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to see what they have charged
for years.

45:22.787 --> 45:24.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Before, it was buried.

45:24.655 --> 45:28.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before, the taxpayers were
paying it, because
the companies were paying it or
the government

45:28.593 --> 45:30.428 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was paying it.

45:30.461 --> 45:33.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that doesn't at all take
away from the
fact that you can get their
exact same product

45:33.831 --> 45:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for hundreds of dollars less in
Canada.

45:36.534 --> 45:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are making money off the
backs of people
with allergies, and particularly
families

45:41.205 --> 45:45.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with kids with allergies that
really have
to buy not just two of these,
but four of

45:45.276 --> 45:48.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them, six of them a year because
they have
to have some at school, they
have to have

45:48.946 --> 45:51.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some in their bags, they have to
have some
at grandma's.

45:51.816 --> 45:53.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Things get lost.

45:53.651 --> 45:57.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is not the product they
should have
chosen to make these dramatic
price increases

45:57.054 --> 45:58.889 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

45:58.923 --> 46:01.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Something you just
said, you said
that this same product is being
said in Canada

46:01.525 --> 46:02.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for how much?

46:02.593 --> 46:03.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

46:03.661 --> 46:04.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY KLOBUCHAR: Hundreds of
dollars less.

46:05.029 --> 46:06.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Of course, it varies.

46:06.697 --> 46:10.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have had a lot of people write
in to my
Facebook page that they can get
it online

46:10.434 --> 46:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from a Canadian pharmacy in
Australia for
$180.

46:14.972 --> 46:19.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the bills I have with
John McCain,
which we're really trying to
push through,

46:19.410 --> 46:24.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be to allow competitive
prices, competitive
products, reimportation of
products from Canada.

46:24.615 --> 46:30.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You're the ranking
Democrat on
the Antitrust Committee of the
Judiciary Committee.

46:30.087 --> 46:31.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have called for hearings.

46:31.455 --> 46:33.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have called for the FTC to
look into this.

46:33.891 --> 46:34.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What else can you do?

46:34.959 --> 46:37.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What can you do as -- in
Congress?

46:37.461 --> 46:39.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

46:39.296 --> 46:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, I just keep
talking about
it and going to my colleagues
and saying,

46:43.401 --> 46:46.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is getting to the point now
where we
have to have a vote on this.

46:46.170 --> 46:47.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to pass something.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm going to continue to do
that.

46:49.674 --> 46:54.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think having regular people
call in to their
members of Congress is going to
make a big

46:54.278 --> 46:56.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
difference here.

46:56.047 --> 47:00.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Any of these bills would be
helpful, but I
think the most helpful, as we go
into a new

47:00.484 --> 47:06.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year and a new administration,
would be negotiations
under Medicare Part D for the
problem as a

47:06.390 --> 47:12.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole, where you have seen, you
know, 100
percent increase in four of the
top 10 drugs

47:12.129 --> 47:13.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in just the last few years.

47:13.998 --> 47:19.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And negotiations under Medicare
Part D would
harness the power of all of
America's seniors.

47:19.637 --> 47:23.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those prices go down, and then
it helps with
other insurance plans as well.

47:23.374 --> 47:27.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senator, I have to
ask you, one
fact that's getting a lot of
attention is

47:27.144 --> 47:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the CEO of this company is
the daughter
of one of your Democratic
colleagues, the

47:31.048 --> 47:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
daughter of Senator Joe Manchin
from West
Virginia.

47:33.751 --> 47:36.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this an issue or something
you would talk
to Senator Manchin about?

47:36.821 --> 47:38.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

47:38.656 --> 47:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, no, Senator
Manchin has
always kept an arm's length with
me when dealing

47:42.126 --> 47:43.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with any issues with this
company.

47:43.928 --> 47:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I haven't seen this as
something where
he's been somehow carrying the
water for his

47:50.201 --> 47:51.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
daughter or improperly involved.

47:51.836 --> 47:53.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I want to make that clear.

47:53.637 --> 47:58.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, pharma as
a whole,
there is absolutely no doubt
they have been

47:58.209 --> 48:02.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against all these bills I just
mentioned,
many of which are bipartisan.

48:02.646 --> 48:07.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it is time to get votes
on these bills
and to move forward, as well as
have an investigation

48:07.685 --> 48:09.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into this individual case with
EpiPen.

48:09.987 --> 48:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senator Klobuchar,
thanks so much
for joining us.

48:12.790 --> 48:13.758 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

48:13.791 --> 48:15.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY KLOBUCHAR: It was good to be
on.

48:15.192 --> 48:20.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thanks for covering this
important issue.

48:20.798 --> 48:31.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Time now for
our weekly
segment on science called the
Leading Edge,

48:31.942 --> 48:37.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the discovery of another
possible Earth-like
planet that is grabbing
worldwide attention

48:37.414 --> 48:39.183 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

48:39.216 --> 48:41.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is true, scientists have
previously said
they believe there are other
planets outside

48:41.685 --> 48:46.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our solar system that resemble
Earth in size
and may have liquid water.

48:46.457 --> 48:50.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this latest finding is the
closest planet
yet found.

48:50.327 --> 48:54.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, it's four light years from
Earth, just
a mere 25 trillion miles away.

48:54.465 --> 48:59.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But travel there may be possible
by the end
of the century, maybe not for me
and you.

48:59.537 --> 49:04.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The planet is called Proxima b,
circling a
small star called Proxima
Centauri.

49:04.108 --> 49:10.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As shown in this animation, it's
thought to
be about 1.3 times the mass of
Earth, probably

49:10.447 --> 49:14.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rocky like the Earth, and
possibly warm enough
for liquid water.

49:14.351 --> 49:17.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's learn more now from our
science correspondent
and resident space expert, Miles
O'Brien.

49:17.922 --> 49:20.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles, first of all, why are
they so excited
about this?

49:20.825 --> 49:24.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard about the planets
and this kind
of Goldilocks, not too hot, not
too cold,

49:25.029 --> 49:26.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
places before?

49:26.163 --> 49:28.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Location,
location, location,
Hari.

49:28.432 --> 49:34.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking now of about more
than 3,000
planets total, exoplanets in the
catalogue,

49:34.638 --> 49:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and growing by the minute, but
this is the
closest one that's been
discovered.

49:39.243 --> 49:41.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is what has scientists
quite interested.

49:41.779 --> 49:46.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Four light years is, in
astronomical terms,
a trip to the convenience store.

49:46.383 --> 49:50.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the idea that there might
be something
somewhat within the realm of
attainable if

49:50.988 --> 49:54.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we come up with some really cool
rocket propulsion
ideas gets people thinking.

49:54.825 --> 49:57.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How do we know
it is what
it is?

49:57.161 --> 49:58.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can't see it from our eyes.

49:58.963 --> 50:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's telescopes that see
things, but they
didn't really get a picture of
this planet.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's indirect.

50:05.135 --> 50:09.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Imagine driving down a darkened
highway and
a car coming at with its high
beams on.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't know anything about
that car, do
you?

50:11.575 --> 50:17.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are some ways to kind
of figure
this out using some interesting
technology.

50:17.348 --> 50:24.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, what they used was
the slight
wobble that occurs as these two
bodies interact

50:24.455 --> 50:25.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with each other.

50:25.856 --> 50:29.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the planet orbits around, the
star itself
moves ever so slightly.

50:29.894 --> 50:32.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's enough to infer that its
presence is
there.

50:32.263 --> 50:34.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a few other ways to do
it.

50:34.131 --> 50:39.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can actually detect the
slight diminishment
of light as a planet passes in
front of a

50:39.703 --> 50:42.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
star and infer that its presence
is there
that way.

50:42.573 --> 50:48.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's how the Kepler space
telescope has
done its work so well over the
years for NASA.

50:48.145 --> 50:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, tell us
what scientists
think they know about this
planet in relation

50:51.782 --> 50:53.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the Earth.

50:53.150 --> 50:56.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, I don't
think we want
to live there, Hari.

50:56.754 --> 51:01.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's 11 days around its star, so
an 11-day
year.

51:01.358 --> 51:07.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is tidily locked, which means
there is
a light side always and a dark
side always.

51:07.698 --> 51:10.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I suppose the real estate on
the light
side might be better.

51:10.267 --> 51:11.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

51:11.568 --> 51:13.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a night owl, maybe you
want to go
to the other side.

51:13.604 --> 51:17.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very close to its star, but
the star
itself is a brown dwarf.

51:17.708 --> 51:19.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a pretty wimpy star.

51:19.643 --> 51:25.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it can be closer and be
in what scientists
call the Goldilocks zone, the
just-right zone

51:25.916 --> 51:30.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where the temperatures are just
right for
water to exist in liquid form.

51:30.421 --> 51:32.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And here's the thing to
remember.

51:32.222 --> 51:36.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wherever we look on this planet,
no matter
where we go, deep down in the
ocean, in acid

51:36.994 --> 51:40.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
springs in Yellowstone, if there
is liquid
water, we find life.

51:40.731 --> 51:44.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And so there
could possibly
be -- even under this star's
light, there

51:44.201 --> 51:48.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
could be something maybe
subterranean, life
underground, or whatever
constitutes ground

51:48.238 --> 51:49.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on that planet?

51:49.940 --> 51:53.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It will take a
while, maybe
a decade, to kind of figure this
all out,

51:53.177 --> 51:55.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because, again, we haven't seen
it directly.

51:55.813 --> 51:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And -- but this is something
that has scientists
very intrigued.

51:58.382 --> 52:03.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as technology improves --
and NASA will
be launching another spacecraft
coming up

52:03.287 --> 52:07.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a year or so called TESS that
will be a
little more powerful and will be
looking a

52:07.524 --> 52:12.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little bit closer to us than its
predecessor,
Kepler.

52:12.329 --> 52:17.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Possibly, it will solve some of
those questions
for us and determine if, in
fact, there might

52:17.935 --> 52:19.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be life that close to us.

52:19.837 --> 52:23.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And so there
are some projects
kind of at least planned on
getting very,

52:23.907 --> 52:28.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very small sort of sensors or
objects out
farther and farther into space.

52:28.278 --> 52:33.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How could we ever, in our
lifetimes, maybe
not in our lifetime, our
children's lifetimes,

52:33.183 --> 52:34.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reach this to get a look at it?

52:34.985 --> 52:39.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, we have to
think about
some new ways of doing
propulsion in space.

52:39.323 --> 52:43.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some sort of nuclear option is
what we're
talking about here.

52:43.293 --> 52:48.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once you get into space, if you
can have steady
propulsion that never stops,
fueled by some

52:48.732 --> 52:54.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of nuclear reaction, you
continue to
accelerate, because there's no
friction in

52:54.772 --> 52:55.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
space, of course.

52:55.939 --> 52:58.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so ultimately you can
develop some real
speed.

52:58.108 --> 53:03.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, potentially, some ideas on
the drawing
board could make that trip of
four light years

53:03.113 --> 53:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something on the order of a
century or maybe
a little less.

53:06.083 --> 53:10.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, if you wanted to,
say, launch the
space shuttle, not that it could
go there,

53:10.587 --> 53:15.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but if you wanted to, just for
point of reference,
it would be more than 100,000
years to get

53:15.826 --> 53:17.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

53:17.694 --> 53:21.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voyager, for example, just
leaving our solar
system, if you aimed it at this
newly discovered

53:21.632 --> 53:24.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
planet, voyager would take about
70,000 years
to get there.

53:24.568 --> 53:27.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that gives you an idea,
where it's not
just billions and billions.

53:27.838 --> 53:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're talking trillions and
trillions here.

53:29.573 --> 53:33.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And to get a
photo back
from there would take several
years too.

53:33.110 --> 53:35.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, you know,
that's just
it.

53:35.479 --> 53:40.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The speed of light,
four-and-a-half light
years away, so it's
four-and-a-half years

53:40.384 --> 53:43.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get any transmission back and
forth.

53:43.187 --> 53:49.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it would be really hard to
engage in any
sort of jokes with the people
who might live

53:49.460 --> 53:50.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on this planet.

53:50.494 --> 53:52.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, comedy is timing, of
course.

53:52.830 --> 53:53.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

53:53.831 --> 53:54.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right.

53:54.998 --> 53:56.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles O'Brien joining us from
Boston, thanks
so much.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome.

53:58.469 --> 54:00.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're going
there, right?

54:00.137 --> 54:01.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Oh, yes, soon.

54:01.138 --> 54:02.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

54:02.272 --> 54:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:03.140 --> 54:04.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

54:04.208 --> 54:05.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

54:05.375 --> 54:06.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

54:06.977 --> 54:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

54:13.217 --> 54:16.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
