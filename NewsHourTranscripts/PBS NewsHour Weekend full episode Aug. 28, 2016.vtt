09:09.733 --> 09:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS FREE SPEECH ABSOLUTE?

09:11.300 --> 09:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE UNITED STATES, IN

09:16.300 --> 09:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT, YOU HAVE THE BEST POSSIBLE

09:18.866 --> 09:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTION OF SPEECH ANYWHERE IN

09:21.200 --> 09:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WORLD, THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

09:23.866 --> 09:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT OF COURSE, ANYWHERE IN THE

WORLD, ALSO THE UNITED STATES

09:27.300 --> 09:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU DO HAVE LIMITATIONS ON

09:29.133 --> 09:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEECH.

09:30.066 --> 09:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE KEY THAT ANY SOCIETY

09:33.866 --> 09:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD NEED IS CRIMINALIZATION OF

09:36.166 --> 09:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCITING OF VIOLENCE, I DON'T

09:37.766 --> 09:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK ANYONE SHOULD HAVE RIGHT

09:39.300 --> 09:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO INCITE VIOLENCE.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND CALL ON CITIZENS TO CALL UP

09:44.200 --> 09:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO KILL OTHER PEOPLE.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE

09:48.933 --> 09:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIETY TO ADD

09:50.200 --> 09:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE U.S. AND IN EUROPE, IN

09:52.866 --> 09:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S. YOU NEED A CLEAR AND

09:55.833 --> 09:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESENT DANGER, THAT IS WORDS

09:57.866 --> 10:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY IMMEDIATE

10:01.400 --> 10:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTION.

10:01.733 --> 10:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN EUROPE YOU CAN BE CONVICTED

10:03.866 --> 10:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF INCITING VIOLENCE EVEN THOUGH

10:06.333 --> 10:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAY NOT BE A RISK OF IMMEDIATE

10:10.333 --> 10:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTION FOLLOWING WORDS.

10:12.766 --> 10:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSONALLY, I AM MORE INCLINED

10:15.166 --> 10:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO FAVOR THE AMERICANS

10:17.033 --> 10:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:18.633 --> 10:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRITTEN IN THE PAST ABOUT THE

DISTINCTION BETWEEN WORDS AND

DEEDS.

10:21.666 --> 10:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SOME WAYS THAT WE SOMETIMES

10:24.733 --> 10:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIMIT SPEECH BECAUSE WE EQUATE

10:27.133 --> 10:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEECH WITH ACTUAL ACT.

10:28.200 --> 10:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

10:28.966 --> 10:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT DICTATORS

10:31.600 --> 10:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO.

10:34.933 --> 10:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHY DO DISSIDENTS BEHIND THE

10:37.600 --> 10:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRON CONSIDER TON END UP IN

10:38.566 --> 10:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LABOR CAMPS BECAUSE THEIR

10:40.300 --> 10:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS

10:41.633 --> 10:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING SEEN AS ALMOST PHYSICAL

10:44.400 --> 10:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKS ON THE GOVERNMENT.

10:45.866 --> 10:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY WERE UNDERMINING THE

10:51.466 --> 10:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOCIALIST IN SOCIALIST EUROPE.

10:55.600 --> 10:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF YOU GO BACK IN HISTORY,

10:59.433 --> 11:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS CHURCH BASICALLY, WITH

11:03.800 --> 11:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SENSOR SHIP.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CHURCH PERCEIVED ANY

CRITICISM OF RELIGION OR THE

11:09.400 --> 11:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHURCH AS A PHYSICAL ATTACK AND

11:11.633 --> 11:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAD THE RIGHT TO KILL PEOPLE

WHO BURNED ON THE STAKE OR --

11:17.533 --> 11:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DOCTRINE THAT MEANT THAT PEOPLE

11:32.066 --> 11:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF OTHER FAITHS HAVE THE RIGHT

11:33.300 --> 11:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO LIVE AND PRACTICE THEIR

MAJORITY FAITH AND LATER ON YOU

11:42.733 --> 11:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE ALSO STEP BY STEP THE RIGHT

TO DIFFERENT SPEECH.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTINCTION BETWEEN WORDS AND

11:49.366 --> 11:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEEDS IS IN FACT CRUCIAL AND IT

11:55.200 --> 11:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN LIB

11:57.300 --> 12:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DEFAMATION OF A RELIGIOUS

INCITEMENT OF OTHER PEOPLE TO

12:20.900 --> 12:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID YOU KNOW THIS WAS GOING TO

12:21.900 --> 12:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPEN?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO.

12:24.566 --> 12:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

12:25.566 --> 12:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY I'M LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE IN

12:27.000 --> 12:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY I DO.

12:28.033 --> 12:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, I DID NOT HAVE ANY BAD

INTENTIONS OR ABOUT CENSORSHIP

12:37.766 --> 12:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN IT COMES TO ISLAM AND THERE

12:40.500 --> 12:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE ARTISTS, TRANSLATORS,

12:43.933 --> 12:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRITERS, WHO WERE SUBMITTING

12:46.166 --> 12:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEMSELVES TO CENSORSHIP AND

12:47.366 --> 12:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PEOPLE WERE SAYING, NO,

12:49.633 --> 12:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS NOT THE CASE, THAT WAS

12:54.466 --> 12:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THOSE

12:56.933 --> 12:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARTOONS WERE COMMITTED TO START

12:58.300 --> 13:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A DEBATE ABOUT THIS AND TO TEST

13:00.933 --> 13:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THERE WERE CENSOR SIP IS IN

13:03.300 --> 13:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT OR NOT.

13:04.400 --> 13:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SECONDLY, THERE WAS BASED IN

13:10.166 --> 13:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FICTIONAL FEAR OR IN REAL FEAR.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEN YEARS LATER I WOULD SAY THAT

13:15.166 --> 13:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE TO ANSWER THOSE

13:17.366 --> 13:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTIONS IN THE AFFIRMATIVE,

13:19.900 --> 13:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YES, THERE WAS CENSORSHIP AND

13:21.800 --> 13:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE

13:22.633 --> 13:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.

13:25.933 --> 13:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MYSELF HAVE BODYGUARDS AROUND

13:28.633 --> 13:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CLOCK.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THE FEAR IS BASED IN RE

13:31.933 --> 13:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALITY.

14:17.300 --> 14:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECOMING A CHALLENGE WHEN PEOPLE
