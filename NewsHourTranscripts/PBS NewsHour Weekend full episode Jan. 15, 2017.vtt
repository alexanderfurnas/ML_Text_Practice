STEP WILL BE THAT ON TUESDAY,

THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE

HEARING ABOUT THIS REPORT THAT'S

04:43.984 --> 04:45.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN RELEASED PUBLICLY.

04:45.051 --> 04:46.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, OF COURSE, SOME OF ITS

04:46.086 --> 04:47.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE

04:47.487 --> 04:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLASSIFIED VERSION, WHICH IS

04:48.788 --> 04:50.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT 50 PAGES WE'RE TOLD.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN

04:51.825 --> 04:52.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS SEEN.

04:52.759 --> 04:53.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WILL BE WITNESSES THERE.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO QUESTION THE

INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE FINDINGS

04:57.831 --> 05:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND GO INTO MORE DETAILS ABOUT

05:01.067 --> 05:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY THEY REACHED THESE

05:01.768 --> 05:06.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCLUSIONS.

05:06.273 --> 05:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WILL BE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY

05:08.942 --> 05:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THIS TO GET AIRED PUBLICLY

05:11.077 --> 05:12.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR LAWMAKERS TO ASK MORE

05:12.712 --> 05:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECT QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE

05:14.447 --> 05:16.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINDINGS THAT THE RUSSIAN

05:16.716 --> 05:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT INTERVENED IN THE

05:18.084 --> 05:19.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION AND TRIED TO HELP

05:19.186 --> 05:20.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP GET ELECTED.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IN THE

05:21.321 --> 05:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NON-CLASSIFIED VERSION, THERE'S

05:22.989 --> 05:25.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO SMOKING GUN, SO TO SPEAK, BUT

05:25.292 --> 05:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SORT OF EXPECT THAT BECAUSE

05:27.160 --> 05:28.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE SOURCES AND METHODS ON

05:28.595 --> 05:29.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW THEY GOT THE INFORMATION

05:29.863 --> 05:31.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S IN THE CLASSIFIED REPORT.

05:31.131 --> 05:31.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THAT WHAT THE

05:31.598 --> 05:32.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ARE

05:32.432 --> 05:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELLING YOU?

05:33.500 --> 05:34.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> EXACTLY.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

05:35.802 --> 05:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM TO SO MUCH SHOW THEIR WORK

05:37.571 --> 05:39.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS TO SHOW THEIR CONCLUSIONS.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO WERE

05:40.707 --> 05:42.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY SKEPTICAL ABOUT THESE

05:42.943 --> 05:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINDINGS ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING

05:44.377 --> 05:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE PERSUADED BY THIS

05:45.712 --> 05:47.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULAR DOCUMENT THAT WAS

05:47.314 --> 05:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELEASED.

05:47.914 --> 05:49.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH IT IS DEFINITIVE IN A

05:49.416 --> 05:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF ITS JUDGMENTS, IT DOESN'T

05:51.117 --> 05:52.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY TELL YOU, "WE GOT THIS

05:52.953 --> 05:54.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SERIES OF COMMUNICATIONS THAT WE

05:58.225 --> 05:59.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERCEPTED."

05:59.059 --> 06:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S BEEN LEFT OUT, AS HAVE A

06:00.860 --> 06:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER OF OTHER PIECES OF THE

06:02.996 --> 06:04.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUZZLE, IF YOU WILL, THAT THE

06:04.431 --> 06:05.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES FEEL WOULD

06:05.799 --> 06:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE TOO REVEALING ABOUT HOW THEY

06:07.100 --> 06:08.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLECT INFORMATION, AND THEY

06:08.735 --> 06:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T WANT TO BURN THOSE

06:10.103 --> 06:11.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANNELS GOING FORWARD.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU KNOW,

06:12.005 --> 06:12.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S ONE QUOTE THAT I'M

06:12.906 --> 06:13.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING AT THAT SAYS, "WE DID

06:13.707 --> 06:15.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT MAKE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE

06:15.141 --> 06:16.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPACT THAT RUSSIAN ACTIVITIES

06:16.776 --> 06:18.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD ON THE OUTCOME OF THE 2016

06:18.712 --> 06:19.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION."

06:19.412 --> 06:20.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S FROM THE REPORT.

06:20.347 --> 06:23.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN I'M LOOKING AT

06:23.483 --> 06:24.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP'S TWEET,

06:24.451 --> 06:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"INTELLIGENCE STATED VERY

06:25.852 --> 06:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRONGLY THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO

06:28.154 --> 06:29.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVIDENCE THAT HACKING

06:29.089 --> 06:30.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFECTED THE ELECTION RESULTS."

06:30.924 --> 06:33.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, CAN BOTH OF THOSE EXIST

06:33.560 --> 06:35.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SORT OF PARALLEL UNIVERSES

06:35.996 --> 06:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE?

06:36.863 --> 06:38.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK THEY DO.

06:38.265 --> 06:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, CLEARLY, THE

06:39.232 --> 06:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES DID NOT

06:40.800 --> 06:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRY TO MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT OF

06:42.802 --> 06:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER OR NOT THIS RUSSIAN

06:43.870 --> 06:45.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERVENTION, WHICH THEY THINK

06:45.038 --> 06:47.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS TRYING TO HELP MR. TRUMP GET

06:47.574 --> 06:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTED, WHETHER IT ACTUALLY

06:48.708 --> 06:49.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCCEEDED.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN HIS STATEMENT, HE'S

06:51.044 --> 06:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARACTERIZING A BIT TOO FAR

06:54.881 --> 06:56.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES

06:56.049 --> 06:57.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY SAID.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, WHAT THEY DID SAY IN THIS

06:59.085 --> 07:00.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORT IS THAT THERE IS NO

07:00.387 --> 07:03.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVIDENCE THAT RUSSIAN HACKERS OR

07:03.089 --> 07:04.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYONE ELSE ACTUALLY MANIPULATED

07:04.624 --> 07:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE COUNTS OR GOT INTO VOTING

07:06.426 --> 07:08.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MACHINES OR EQUIPMENT AND

07:08.361 --> 07:10.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITERALLY CHANGED THE OUTCOME

07:10.297 --> 07:11.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAY.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER

07:12.432 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS SO-CALLED INFLUENCE

07:13.633 --> 07:15.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN CHANGED THE OUTCOME OF

07:15.435 --> 07:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ELECTION, THEY DID NOT

07:16.603 --> 07:17.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSESS THAT.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THAT THE

07:18.405 --> 07:20.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTING MACHINES WERE NOT HACKED

07:20.173 --> 07:21.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS SOMETHING EVEN THE OBAMA

07:21.141 --> 07:23.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION MENTIONED.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER THING IS THAT THIS

07:24.911 --> 07:27.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORT SEEMS TO BE A GUIDE POST

07:27.314 --> 07:29.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR ELECTIONS TO COME AROUND THE

07:29.215 --> 07:29.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORLD.

07:29.816 --> 07:30.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT AND

07:31.551 --> 07:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICIALS PUBLICLY HAVE SAID

07:32.819 --> 07:34.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THIS IS

07:34.487 --> 07:36.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT ACTIVITY BY RUSSIA THAT THEY

07:36.056 --> 07:37.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMAGINE WILL BE LIMITED ONLY TO

07:37.390 --> 07:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS CAMPAIGN, THIS ELECTION.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE ALREADY SEEING SIMILAR

07:41.995 --> 07:44.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVITIES IN ENGLAND, IN

07:44.998 --> 07:45.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GERMANY.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE SEEN THEM BEFORE IN

07:46.866 --> 07:47.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EASTERN EUROPE.

07:47.701 --> 07:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY REALLY WANTED PEOPLE TO

07:48.735 --> 07:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND, THIS IS NOW A FULL

07:50.370 --> 07:52.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECTRUM OF OPERATIONS THAT THE

07:52.439 --> 07:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IS USING AND

07:54.307 --> 07:56.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK NOW HAS SOME EVIDENCE

07:56.009 --> 07:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE.
