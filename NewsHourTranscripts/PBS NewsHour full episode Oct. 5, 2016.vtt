the fight against ISIS, but at
what cost?

BELKIS WILLE, Human Rights

this ability to carry out these

JAY ANDERSON, Florida: It's
scary.

00:54.388 --> 00:58.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when you're scared,
especially when you're
scared for your unborn child,
and especially

00:58.825 --> 01:03.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when it's your first child, you
try and focus
on what you can control.

01:03.330 --> 01:05.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's only a few things

MAN: Our homes are completely
destroyed.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have lost everything.

01:57.084 --> 01:59.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need help as fast as

01:59.152 --> 02:00.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We cannot be left behind.

CHARLES PATRICK ALMAZOR,
Partners in Health:
Because of the flooding, we
expect more cases

02:28.749 --> 02:31.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of cholera and more cases of
diarrhea-related
diseases.

02:31.184 --> 02:36.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, we are trying to get
prepared for that.

02:36.323 --> 02:41.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The disaster

set for next week.

02:56.276 --> 02:57.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is nothing left here.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: Next on Matthew's
path, the
Bahamas.

03:03.250 --> 03:08.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It pounded the southern islands
with heavy
rain all day, and the eye could
reach Nassau

03:08.522 --> 03:10.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tomorrow morning.

03:10.157 --> 03:14.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

expected to
be off South Florida.

03:14.428 --> 03:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

course to
whirl up the East Coast toward
the Carolinas,

03:20.500 --> 03:24.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Florida Governor Rick Scott says

a direct hit or not, the impacts
will be devastating.

03:33.380 --> 03:38.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I cannot emphasize it enough
that everyone
in our state must prepare now
for a direct

03:38.251 --> 03:40.053 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hit.

03:40.087 --> 03:44.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In South
Carolina, people flocked

I want to emphasize to the

03:57.404 --> 03:59.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a serious storm.

03:59.106 --> 04:04.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there is an evacuation order
in your community,
you need to take it seriously.

04:04.077 --> 04:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If it does make
landfall, Matthew
would be the first major
hurricane to strike

04:10.050 --> 04:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S. mainland since 2005.

04:13.820 --> 04:18.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
United Nations

climate change

04:18.258 --> 04:20.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will take effect on November 4.

04:20.627 --> 04:25.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It reached the threshold when
more than 55
nations generating at least 55
percent of

04:25.799 --> 04:29.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the planet's greenhouse gas
emissions signed
on.

04:30.003 --> 04:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

the White House
Rose Garden to hail the
development and its

04:34.441 --> 04:35.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
implications.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Today, the world
meets the moment.

04:38.145 --> 04:43.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we follow through on the
commitments
that this Paris agreement
embodies, history

04:43.850 --> 04:48.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may well judge it as a turning
point for our
planet.

04:48.188 --> 04:52.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So,this gives us the best
possible shot to
save the one planet we have got.

04:52.526 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The agreement
calls for countries
to report progress on reducing
emissions,

04:58.098 --> 05:00.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but doesn't set binding limits.

The U.N. Security Council agreed
unanimously

He would succeed Ban Ki-Moon.

05:18.752 --> 05:25.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Council votes tomorrow on
recommending
Guterres to the General

was set up

06:10.670 --> 06:13.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
within the knowledge of Iraqi
administration.

06:13.340 --> 06:17.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Baghdad officials have visited
this camp and
have even provided financial
support to it

06:17.711 --> 06:19.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the past.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This problem occurred because of
internal
conflict of Iraqi policy.

06:22.382 --> 06:26.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The two nations

06:51.845 --> 06:58.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

collection

06:58.418 --> 07:00.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of phone records.

07:00.253 --> 07:05.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

his coming-of-age

Israel.

07:37.524 --> 07:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

U.S.-Russian

07:55.842 --> 08:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cooperation that's left war-torn
Syria with
a harrowing future; and much
more.

08:05.952 --> 08:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cooperation that's left war-torn
Syria with
a harrowing future; and much

Now to the race for the White

08:22.402 --> 08:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's less than half the number

08:35.749 --> 08:38.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
after a contentious vice
presidential debate.

08:38.485 --> 08:43.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
He was cool.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He was smart.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was -- I mean, you just take
a look at
him.

08:49.496 --> 08:55.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was meant to be doing what

traveled to Washington,

09:00.106 --> 09:05.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

combative as
the Kaine-Pence face-off.

09:09.749 --> 09:15.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The statistics-driven 538 blog

may have
lost style points for that
approach, Democrats

09:40.280 --> 09:44.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

always directly
defend Trump's record, including

09:51.991 --> 09:54.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa

11:07.534 --> 11:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From the race for
the White
House, we turn to the start of a
new term

11:18.177 --> 11:21.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the Supreme Court, and to
Jeffrey Brown.

11:21.114 --> 11:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And a most
unusual term it
is, with an empty seat since the
death of

11:25.351 --> 11:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Antonin Scalia last February.

11:27.387 --> 11:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been at least 25 years
since the court
began a term with just eight
members.

11:31.925 --> 11:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look at that and at a case
argued today
about racial bias and the death
penalty.

11:37.096 --> 11:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we welcome back our favorite
court watcher,
Marcia Coyle of "The National
Law Journal."

11:41.568 --> 11:42.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

11:42.802 --> 11:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Thanks, Jeff.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Welcome back.

11:44.571 --> 11:45.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Time to get to work.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.539 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

11:46.573 --> 11:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Absolutely.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a term in which the court
begins shorthanded,
what impact are we seeing, might
we see?

11:51.377 --> 11:53.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What jumps out at you?

11:53.212 --> 11:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, I think,
right now, what
we see has to do with the kinds
of cases that

11:56.849 --> 12:00.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the court has already accepted
for decision.

12:00.286 --> 12:06.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are no potential
blockbuster issues
on the docket of the kind that
seemed to mark

12:06.726 --> 12:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just about every term of the
Roberts court
since it began in 2005.

12:10.229 --> 12:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There have always
been a couple
at least.

12:12.031 --> 12:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right.

12:13.900 --> 12:19.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, instead, the cases that
we're seeing,
there is a healthy dose of
patent, arbitration,

12:19.672 --> 12:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bankruptcy, and there are more
narrow technical
statutory interpretation cases.

12:25.211 --> 12:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would say, Jeff, there
have been other
terms that began rather low-key,
low-profile,

12:32.218 --> 12:35.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it only takes one to raise
the profile.

12:35.388 --> 12:39.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The justices will continue to
add cases through
the middle of January.

12:39.759 --> 12:44.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But without knowing what's in
every justices'
mind, I have a feeling this
court right now

12:44.130 --> 12:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is happy to have a low profile
during this
election campaign.

12:47.634 --> 12:50.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And we should
just say -- I
mean, we talk about this often,
but the court

12:50.536 --> 12:52.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gets to decide what cases it
will take.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: It does.

12:54.207 --> 12:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you're
suggesting that
the thinking might be, let
things simmer a

12:57.744 --> 13:03.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little bit, or maybe some cases
that are too
hot for an eight-member panel
might be worth

13:03.182 --> 13:04.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not taking.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: I think so,
because, certainly,
in the calculus of accepting a
case, they

13:07.387 --> 13:12.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to think, will we be able
to get five
votes, a majority, to decide it?

13:12.125 --> 13:16.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if that's questionable, they
may veer
away from that particular case.

13:17.030 --> 13:22.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, now,
no blockbusters,
but a lot of cases I see with a
theme around

13:23.002 --> 13:24.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
race or racial bias.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One was argued
today, a death
penalty case.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right.

13:29.509 --> 13:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, race plays a central
role or even
a smaller role in three types of
cases this

13:34.747 --> 13:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
term, criminal justice cases,
the drawing
of electoral maps, and even
mortgage lending.

13:40.086 --> 13:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, the court focused on
criminal
justice and Duane Buck's case.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Buck is a Texas death row
inmate.

13:48.361 --> 13:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His trial back in the mid-1990s,
his own defense
counsel at that trial introduced
an expert

13:56.669 --> 14:03.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
witness who testified to a
stereotype, a terrible
stereotype that's been debunked
for years

14:03.443 --> 14:05.078 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

14:05.111 --> 14:10.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He testified that, because Buck
was black,
he was more likely to be
dangerous in the

14:10.717 --> 14:12.485 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

14:12.518 --> 14:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Future dangerousness is a
special issue that
Texas jurors have to agree
unanimously to

14:17.590 --> 14:21.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in order to impose the death
sentence, and
they did so here.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, he's not --
in this case,
just to be clear, he's not
challenging the

14:24.597 --> 14:25.565 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conviction.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: No.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He's challenging
the sentencing,
which -- with the claim that it
was based

14:29.902 --> 14:30.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a racial bias.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's exactly
right.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what happened
in the court
today?

14:33.406 --> 14:34.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What was the argument?

14:34.741 --> 14:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, the court
seemed sympathetic
to Mr. Buck.

14:37.777 --> 14:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even Justice Alito said that
what happened
in that trial was indefensible.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the problem for the court is
really, how
are they going to deal with
this?

14:46.419 --> 14:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a very procedurally
complicated case.

14:50.456 --> 14:55.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the chief justice asked
Buck's attorney,
what do you want us to do here?

14:55.394 --> 15:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you want to us say, on one
hand, this was
a clear violation of the
Constitution, Mr.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Buck, he gets a new sentencing
hearing?

15:04.771 --> 15:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or do we address the issue that
the attorney
actually raised, and that is,
did the lower

15:10.209 --> 15:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal appellate court use the
right standard
in denying Buck what we call a
certificate

15:17.550 --> 15:22.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of appealability, which would
have enabled
him to go back to a federal
district court,

15:22.522 --> 15:27.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reopen his habeas petition to
argue that he
deserves a new sentencing
hearing?

15:27.693 --> 15:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, in this case,
the possible
outcomes are unclear.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But the sentiment
seemed to
be...

15:33.432 --> 15:35.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: I think so.

15:35.368 --> 15:39.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seemed pretty clear across
the bench that
they definitely had a problem
with what happened

15:39.138 --> 15:40.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at his trial.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just in our last
minute, let
me come back to the larger
picture, because

15:42.942 --> 15:43.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you said no blockbusters.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But there are a
few out there
that they might take.

15:46.145 --> 15:47.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

15:47.146 --> 15:48.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Oh, absolutely.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just because they may be small
or narrow or
low-profile doesn't mean they're
unimportant

15:51.818 --> 15:53.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or uninteresting.

15:53.386 --> 15:57.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The court has, for example, an
interesting
religion case.

15:57.857 --> 16:06.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trinity Lutheran Church in
Missouri is challenging
Missouri's denial of state
grants to it to

16:06.265 --> 16:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resurface a playground, claiming
that it discriminates
against religious institutions,
that violates

16:12.205 --> 16:13.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the First Amendment.

16:13.573 --> 16:18.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Oregon rock group the Slants
is involved
in a trademark case.

16:18.811 --> 16:26.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their mark was turned down by a
federal agency
because it disparaged Asian
Americans.

16:26.419 --> 16:30.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal appellate court struck
that law
down as violating the
Constitution.

16:30.823 --> 16:34.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Obama administration is
asking the Supreme
Court to take a look at it.

16:34.093 --> 16:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And some very
high-profile
-- there's a transgender case
that could...

16:37.897 --> 16:39.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: This is in the
wings, right.

16:39.065 --> 16:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the wings.

16:40.967 --> 16:44.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: There's a petition
from a Virginia
county school board that's
challenging a lower

16:44.737 --> 16:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court's order that a transgender
boy should
be able to use the boys'
bathroom.

16:50.376 --> 16:54.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's also an interesting
case, sort
of continued fallout from
same-sex marriage,

16:55.014 --> 17:01.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where a Colorado baker said his
religious
beliefs prevented him from
baking a wedding

17:01.487 --> 17:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cake for a same-sex couple.

17:04.090 --> 17:08.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Colorado's Civil Rights
Commission found that
the baker violated the public
accommodations

17:08.594 --> 17:09.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The baker has brought a petition
to the Supreme
Court.

17:12.164 --> 17:15.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They could definitely raise the
temperature
of the court if it takes it.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Absolutely.

17:17.103 --> 17:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OK, Marcia Coyle, "The National
Law Journal,"
welcome back.

17:18.504 --> 17:19.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Thank you.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My pleasure, Jeff.

17:21.307 --> 17:27.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And online,
there's more on
the case of Duane Edward Buck on
our Web site,

17:27.113 --> 17:30.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PBS.org/NewsHour.

17:30.316 --> 17:41.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the second
of our three
reports this week on the fight
for Iraq.

17:41.494 --> 17:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Militia groups, made up mostly
of Shia fighters,
and many backed by Iran, have
become instrumental

17:47.333 --> 17:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the battle to drive ISIS from
Iraq.

17:50.336 --> 17:54.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But their presence on the
battlefield makes
them a controversial force, one
with which

17:54.507 --> 17:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States has deadly
familiarity.

17:57.376 --> 18:03.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, again in partnership
with the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting,
special correspondent

18:03.115 --> 18:06.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jane Ferguson and producer Jon
Gerberg report.

18:06.852 --> 18:14.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: These young men
are holding
the line on a remote hilltop
north of Tikrit.

18:14.927 --> 18:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They fire at any movement across
the oil fields
on the horizon, where ISIS
snipers are dug

18:20.232 --> 18:23.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Conditions are rudimentary.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each fighter has little with him
beyond his
gun.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AHMED, Hashd al-Shaabi (through
translator):
The end of ISIS is on my mind.

18:31.410 --> 18:34.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Ahmed is not part
of the Iraqi
army.

18:34.814 --> 18:40.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is a member of Iraq's Hashd
al-Shaabi,
also known as Popular
Mobilization Unit.

18:40.953 --> 18:46.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are predominantly Shia
militias, and
radical Sunni group ISIS, or
Da'esh, as they're

18:46.459 --> 18:49.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called here, is their sworn
enemy.

18:49.195 --> 18:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AHMED (through translator): My
ambition is
the end of Da'esh in Iraq.

18:53.766 --> 18:58.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I came in response to the fatwa,
the doctrine
to defend my country, my sacred
places.

18:58.804 --> 19:02.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My wish in life is the end of
Da'esh in Iraq.

19:02.141 --> 19:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Like thousands of
other Shia
Iraqis, Ahmed heard the call of
Iraq's senior

19:08.147 --> 19:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shia leader, Ayatollah Ali
Sistani, who in
June 2014 issued a religious
command, or fatwa,

19:16.122 --> 19:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to take up arms and drive ISIS
from Iraq.

19:19.725 --> 19:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraq's security forces had
collapsed when
ISIS rushed in from Syria and
seized a third

19:24.230 --> 19:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the country, killing Shias,
who they believe
to be heretics.

19:27.967 --> 19:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while the military was in
chaos, tens
of thousands of young Iraqi men
flocked to

19:33.773 --> 19:35.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the militias instead.

19:35.574 --> 19:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMED (through translator): The
fatwa opened
the door for us, so we
volunteered with the

19:39.945 --> 19:41.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hashd militia.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ours is a belief and a will.

19:43.149 --> 19:46.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We came because of our belief,
not for a salary
or anything else.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We came because of our belief
and our principles.

19:50.056 --> 19:56.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: These troops have
come from
Southern Iraq, and they're
holding the front

19:56.729 --> 19:58.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
line in this whole area.

19:58.531 --> 20:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iraqi army are nowhere to be
seen, and
they are camped down here, with
ISIS positions

20:03.936 --> 20:05.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just over the front line.

20:05.971 --> 20:10.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of these fighters, who have
lived for
months on the front lines now,
were civilians

20:10.543 --> 20:13.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with no military experience
until they faced
ISIS.

20:13.979 --> 20:19.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUMAA AL-AYAME, Hashd al-Shaabi
(through translator):
Even the army didn't take in
volunteers in

20:19.218 --> 20:20.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
such numbers.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have huge numbers.

20:22.121 --> 20:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We came like this, no training
centers, nothing.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Their presence
has been essential
to the battle.

20:28.027 --> 20:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS has been pushed back from
many areas,
and the Hashd militias have
played a major

20:32.998 --> 20:35.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
role in battles against the
group.

20:35.701 --> 20:44.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the actions of heavily armed
Shia fighters
in Sunni areas of Iraq have been
deeply divisive.

20:45.010 --> 20:49.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also accused of war
crimes, such as
beheadings, killings, and
torture of Sunni

20:49.682 --> 20:52.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
residents in areas they have
fought in.

20:52.418 --> 20:56.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Human Rights Watch has called on
the Iraqi
government to rein them in,
saying that, in

20:56.856 --> 21:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vengeance for ISIS atrocities,
they have attacked
Sunni communities.

21:01.827 --> 21:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Belkis Wille is senior Iraq
researcher for
Human Rights Watch based in
Kiev.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We spoke with her via Skype.

21:08.534 --> 21:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BELKIS WILLE, Human Rights
Watch: These are
segments of the population that
are being

21:12.204 --> 21:19.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
singled out for allegiance with
ISIS, whether
or not these individual members
of the community

21:19.712 --> 21:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are actually affiliated with
ISIS.

21:22.515 --> 21:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Popular Mobilization
Forces has chosen
to really single out this
community and to

21:29.188 --> 21:36.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carry out these revenge attacks
on them outside
of the military structure.

21:36.428 --> 21:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have this ability to carry
out these
abuses, to carry out these
revenge attacks

21:41.000 --> 21:42.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with complete impunity.

21:42.801 --> 21:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: When Fallujah
city was retaken
from ISIS in June, the Hashd
al-Shaabi were

21:47.106 --> 21:51.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accused of detaining over 1,000
men who fled
the city.

21:51.177 --> 21:55.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some 600 are still reportedly
missing.

21:55.247 --> 21:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a problem for the
U.S.-led coalition.

21:58.117 --> 22:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Hashd al-Shaabi militias are
fighting
alongside U.S.-backed Iraqi army
forces and

22:04.123 --> 22:05.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
benefiting from American
airstrikes.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

22:07.726 --> 22:10.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DORRIAN, Coalition
Spokesperson: Prime
Minister Abadi has said that
those alleged

22:10.596 --> 22:16.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abuses definitely need to be
investigated,
and those responsible, if they
did occur,

22:16.235 --> 22:17.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
need to be held to account.

22:18.003 --> 22:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're going to work with the
Iraqis on
making sure that we set
conditions to reduce

22:24.243 --> 22:27.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as much as we can the
possibility for human
rights abuses.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's a very complicated
battlefield.

22:30.349 --> 22:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Shia militias
like these are
funded and supported by Iran and
are a powerful

22:36.722 --> 22:41.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tool of influence for the
Iranian regime on
their neighbor Iraq.

22:41.093 --> 22:44.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is plenty of bad blood
between them
and the U.S. military.

22:44.964 --> 22:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of these groups were
responsible for
killing American soldiers during
the war here,

22:50.302 --> 22:55.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen by many as Iran's way of
bleeding the
U.S. effort, says Michael
Eisenstadt.

22:55.741 --> 23:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served as both a civilian and
an army officer
in Iraq during the occupation.

23:00.512 --> 23:02.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is now at the Washington
Institute.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL EISENSTADT, Washington
Institute for
Near East Policy: Many of them
were involved

23:04.450 --> 23:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a low-level insurgency
against the United
States and have American -- the
blood of American

23:08.921 --> 23:10.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
soldiers on their hands.

23:10.189 --> 23:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't want to operate in the
same battle
space as them.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It creates a lot of problems.

23:14.760 --> 23:19.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Yet, as a major
force fighting
ISIS, they are technically on
the same side

23:19.465 --> 23:21.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as the U.S. in this war.

23:21.533 --> 23:24.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, their commander views
America with
deep suspicion.

23:24.970 --> 23:30.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAFAR HASSAN, Hashd al-Shaabi
(through translator):
Hashd al-Shaabi doesn't trust
America.

23:30.809 --> 23:32.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not here to fight ISIS.

23:32.544 --> 23:34.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are here to fight ISIS and
fight them properly.

23:35.014 --> 23:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: In fact, to him,
the Americans
have other intentions beyond
ISIS or even

23:41.453 --> 23:43.289 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iraq.

23:43.322 --> 23:47.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAFAR HASSAN (through
translator): They want
to control Arab countries and
establish bases

23:47.426 --> 23:48.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
close to Iran.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have intentions against
Iran, clearly.

23:51.030 --> 23:55.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: But America's
support of Iraq's
security forces has effectively
brought the

23:55.668 --> 23:59.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. into an indirect alliance
with Iranian-backed
groups.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is not by choice, says
Eisenstadt.

24:02.141 --> 24:06.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL EISENSTADT: But they
also play a role
in Iraq's efforts to emerge as
the dominant

24:06.545 --> 24:11.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside power in Iraq and to
kind of supplant
the U.S. in this role.

24:11.450 --> 24:15.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have control over who
participates
in the fight on the ground,
although we're

24:15.154 --> 24:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting a lot of pressure on the
Iraqi military
not to rely on these groups.

24:19.925 --> 24:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: After this
battle, the tens
of thousands of young recruits
to the Shia

24:24.363 --> 24:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
militias will have to find a new
purpose.

24:27.966 --> 24:34.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AHMED (through translator): When
Da'esh ends
in Iraq, I'm going to work.

24:34.573 --> 24:37.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When this fatwa was first
issued, I was sitting
doing nothing.

24:37.409 --> 24:41.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If I finish, I will go back to
the way I was.

24:41.080 --> 24:45.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JANE FERGUSON: They are,
however, unlikely
to all return home.

24:45.851 --> 24:52.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the continued existence of
armed militias
beyond full government control
could destabilize

24:52.224 --> 24:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Iraq long after ISIS is gone.

24:55.427 --> 25:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson
in Tikrit, Iraq.

25:05.371 --> 25:12.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:12.478 --> 25:18.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
pregnant
women in Miami are reacting to
Zika threats;

25:18.250 --> 25:23.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the important, but complex
discoveries
behind the Nobel Prizes
explained.

25:23.222 --> 25:29.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The French government
today announced
a renewed push for a cease-fire
in Syria,

25:29.094 --> 25:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after a previous deal failed.

25:31.397 --> 25:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two architects of that
accord, Secretary
of State Kerry and Russian
Foreign Minister

25:36.402 --> 25:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sergei Lavrov, spoke again today
by phone.

25:40.072 --> 25:46.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meantime, the push by Syrian
forces to retake
Aleppo's rebel-held sectors
continued, as

25:46.745 --> 25:52.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a humanitarian catastrophe
mounted.

25:52.584 --> 25:58.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As rescuers on the ground in
Eastern Aleppo
sifted through the ruins by
hand, United Nations

25:58.624 --> 26:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
satellite images from high above
showed the
sweeping destruction.

26:04.196 --> 26:12.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Syrian military announced
today it's reducing
the land and air bombardment to
let some 275,000

26:12.538 --> 26:14.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
civilians evacuate.

26:14.840 --> 26:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pablo Marco leads the Doctors
Without Borders
mission in Syria.

26:19.044 --> 26:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He spoke, via Skype, from Amman,
Jordan:

26:21.346 --> 26:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PABLO MARCO, Doctors Without
Borders: Unfortunately,
we have got at different moments
promises

26:25.751 --> 26:30.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Russian government and
also from
the Syrian government about the
cease-fires,

26:30.989 --> 26:37.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
truces, a reduction of fighting,
and, honestly,
we need to see it happen before
believing

26:37.196 --> 26:39.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

26:39.097 --> 26:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Prospects for
peace were briefly
brighter last month, when
Secretary of State

26:43.068 --> 26:49.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Kerry and Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei
Lavrov brokered a cease-fire.

26:49.608 --> 26:56.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But Syrian and Russian
airstrikes quickly
resumed in a new and devastating
offensive

26:56.882 --> 27:02.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against Aleppo, and an aid
convoy was bombed
near the city.

27:02.054 --> 27:07.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Monday, the State Department
severed direct
contact with Russia on the issue
of Syria.

27:07.392 --> 27:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Together,
the Syrian regime and Russia
seem to have

27:11.430 --> 27:15.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
rejected diplomacy in
furtherance of trying
to pursue a military victory.

27:15.367 --> 27:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the White
House today, top
advisers grappled with what to
do next.

27:20.205 --> 27:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post reported
military strikes
against Syrian government forces
are an option.

27:26.445 --> 27:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, President Obama has
refused to go
that far, and The New York Times
obtained

27:31.884 --> 27:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a recording of Secretary Kerry
voicing frustration
last month to the Syrian
opposition.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KERRY: I have argued for
use of force.

27:39.358 --> 27:41.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I stood up.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm the guy who stood up and
announced we're
going to attack Assad because of
the weapons.

27:43.262 --> 27:49.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, you know, things
evolved into a
different process.

27:49.801 --> 27:55.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Syria is also
echoing across
the presidential campaign, as in
last night's

27:55.841 --> 27:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vice presidential debate.

27:56.942 --> 27:58.810 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
The United States of America
should be prepared

28:00.245 --> 28:04.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to use military force to strike
military targets
of the Assad regime.

28:04.383 --> 28:06.218 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:06.251 --> 28:07.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
The notion is, we have to create
a humanitarian

28:07.452 --> 28:08.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
zone in Northern Syria.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very important.

28:10.455 --> 28:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the ravaged
landscape of
Aleppo begs the question: If
peace ever does

28:16.261 --> 28:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come, will there be anything
left to save?

28:20.165 --> 28:24.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to talk about what comes
next in Syria,
I'm joined now by Derek Chollet.

28:24.937 --> 28:28.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's a former assistant
secretary of defense
in the Obama administration.

28:28.473 --> 28:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now at the German Marshall
Fund.

28:31.009 --> 28:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Randa Slim, she's director of
the Track II
Dialogues initiative at the
Middle East Institute.

28:37.849 --> 28:40.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And New York Times columnist
Nicholas Kristof.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And welcome all three of you to
the program.

28:43.655 --> 28:49.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me just each one of you to
say in brief,
how did we get to this point
five years in,

28:49.328 --> 28:53.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
half a million people dead in
Syria, millions
more displaced?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How did we get here, Derek
Chollet?

28:55.734 --> 28:59.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEREK CHOLLET, Former U.S.
Assistant Secretary
of Defense: Well, it's a very
difficult confluence

28:59.838 --> 29:01.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of issues.

29:01.673 --> 29:06.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a proxy war that is being
fought by many
countries in the region, and, of
course, the

29:06.478 --> 29:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russians, with many different
interests at
play.

29:10.315 --> 29:18.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a brutal regime, in the
Assad regime,
that is willing to take any
measure, no matter

29:18.290 --> 29:24.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how immoral or war criminal
acts, to persecute
its goals.

29:24.596 --> 29:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's very much driven by
fears in the
United States, legitimate fears,
I believe,

29:29.701 --> 29:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about escalation of any U.S.
military involvement,
and what that may lead to in
terms of an enduring

29:35.540 --> 29:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. commitment, military
commitment, inside
of Syria.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nick Kristof, how
did we get
here?

29:41.446 --> 29:44.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS KRISTOF, Columnist, The
New York
Times: Well, I think that
President Obama

29:44.483 --> 29:51.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resisted the suggestions by
Hillary Clinton,
by David Petraeus, and others to
become more

29:51.256 --> 29:58.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engaged, partly because it
seemed plausible,
in 2012 or even 2013, that Assad
was going

29:58.497 --> 29:59.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to fall anyway.

29:59.998 --> 30:04.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, why get engaged
if what we
want is going to happen anyway?

30:04.136 --> 30:07.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was, indeed, plausible,
but it also
proved wrong.

30:07.873 --> 30:12.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think also, more broadly,
in a place
like Syria, you know, there are
no good options.

30:12.577 --> 30:16.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a situation like that,
it's always
easiest in any given day, if you
don't have

30:16.848 --> 30:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a good option, to say, well,
let's see what
we're going to do tomorrow.

30:20.385 --> 30:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's how bit by bit you
end up losing
half-a-million lives with no end
in sight.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Randa Slim, how
do you see
this?

30:28.660 --> 30:30.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did we get here?

30:30.429 --> 30:35.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANDA SLIM, Middle East
Institute: I think
we started, the administration,
putting the

30:35.967 --> 30:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right set of objectives in 2011,
when the
president said that Assad must
step aside,

30:43.075 --> 30:48.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it was rightly diagnosed
that the
primary driver of the conflict,
and still

30:48.413 --> 30:50.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the case today, is the Assad
regime.

30:50.916 --> 30:58.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
However, I think the
administration proved
unwilling and -- to put together
the strategy

30:58.790 --> 31:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to deploy the necessary
tools to make
that happen.

31:03.328 --> 31:09.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, as Nick said, there was
a strong
assumption that Assad will fall
or that Assad

31:09.134 --> 31:11.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can be convinced to transition
out.

31:11.169 --> 31:14.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think time and again, this has
proven to
be a wrong assumption.

31:14.940 --> 31:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, also, I think the other
factor is that
we were facing an opponent with
a coalition

31:21.513 --> 31:28.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporting it that has been
willing to endorse
and to engage in any kind of
tactic, in any

31:28.954 --> 31:35.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
kind of awful kinds of
intervention to stay
in power.

31:35.293 --> 31:42.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have this coalition
now made up
of Russia, made up of Iran, made
up of Hezbollah,

31:42.200 --> 31:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporting Assad that is very --
has a clear
-- I would say, that has a clear
objective,

31:47.773 --> 31:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has a clear strategy, and
that is willing
to deploy any tool at its
disposal, no matter

31:54.813 --> 31:57.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what -- how onerous it is, to
achieve that
objective.

31:57.382 --> 32:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me turn
back to Derek
Chollet.

32:00.485 --> 32:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Given all this, given where we
are, what is
the path forward?

32:05.090 --> 32:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And can the U.S. do something on
the own?

32:08.627 --> 32:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEREK CHOLLET: Well, it's very
difficult to
see a clear path forward, given
the extent

32:14.800 --> 32:20.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to which the Russians are now
involved in
this situation and the brutality
that Assad

32:20.038 --> 32:21.807 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has shown.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That said, I think it's
important for your
viewers to remember the United
States military

32:24.442 --> 32:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been bombing Syria every day
for the last
two years.

32:28.547 --> 32:33.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the targets the U.S.
military has been
hitting and the special
operators on the ground

32:33.251 --> 32:36.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been in support of the
Kurds and Arab
tribes in Syria.

32:36.988 --> 32:38.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The targets are counter-ISIL.

32:38.824 --> 32:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are some things to do
that we could
do in terms of expanding the
aperture of the

32:44.529 --> 32:50.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airstrikes, perhaps putting some
of the regime
targets at risk that would be
risky, but I

32:50.402 --> 32:56.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe would limit the risk of
escalation
that the president has rightly
been concerned

32:56.208 --> 32:57.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

32:57.843 --> 33:01.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no question the U.S.
military has
the capability to take out a
regime.

33:01.446 --> 33:05.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have shown three times over
the last 15
years that the U.S. military can
take down

33:05.717 --> 33:06.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regimes.

33:06.718 --> 33:07.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We did it in Afghanistan.

33:07.719 --> 33:08.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We did it in Iraq.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We did it in Libya.

33:10.488 --> 33:14.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The challenge is -- Judy, as you
suggested
in your opening piece, is, what
comes next,

33:14.593 --> 33:16.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what can the U.S. do about
what comes
next?

33:16.761 --> 33:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that has been a
limiting factor
on the president's decision to
get more involved

33:21.833 --> 33:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
militarily in trying to bring
about a transition
inside Syria.

33:24.870 --> 33:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nick Kristof, you
have written
about this extensively.

33:27.939 --> 33:31.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What realistically is the path
forward for
the U.S.?

33:31.309 --> 33:32.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are late in the Obama
administration.

33:32.978 --> 33:36.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is going to be another
president in
the next few months.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is a realistic path
forward?

33:38.917 --> 33:44.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Well, I mean,
I think what
we need to aim for is a
cease-fire and a kind

33:44.356 --> 33:50.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of de facto partition of Syria
among the sides,
with at least the fighting
stopping, and then

33:50.228 --> 33:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wait, and maybe some time down
the road, one
can put the pieces back together
again.

33:54.900 --> 33:59.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to get that cease-fire, to
stop the killing,
then you need leverage.

33:59.704 --> 34:05.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Syrian government has
responded only -- not
to moral appeals, but only when
it feels threatened.

34:05.644 --> 34:10.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, in 2013, when it feared
that it was
going to be -- it was going to
suffer airstrikes

34:10.282 --> 34:14.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then, indeed, it agreed, you
know, we will
have hand over chemical weapons.

34:15.020 --> 34:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many, many of the members of
Parliament in
Syria fled the country because
there was a

34:19.324 --> 34:21.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
credible military threat.

34:21.559 --> 34:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that John Kerry
feels legitimately
that his efforts to negotiate a
cease-fire

34:28.733 --> 34:33.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were enormously undercut because
the White
House wouldn't give him that
kind of leverage.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, look this is
hard.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It may not work.

34:37.575 --> 34:44.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have in fact imposed a de
facto no-fly
zone over parts of Northern
Syria to protect

34:44.849 --> 34:47.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. military advisers on
ground.

34:47.185 --> 34:52.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We could crater runways, for
example, that
Syrian military aircraft take
off of.

34:52.157 --> 34:55.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And these aren't perfect
solutions, but I
think they're better than
letting hundreds

34:55.327 --> 34:57.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of thousands of people die in
the coming years.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Randa Slim, is
any of this
realistic?

35:00.932 --> 35:04.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard the vice presidential
nominees last
night bring up solutions.

35:04.836 --> 35:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We just heard what Derek and
Nick have said.

35:09.007 --> 35:16.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does any of this, does it show
any relation
of what could, politically,
realistically

35:16.214 --> 35:17.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
take place?

35:17.682 --> 35:22.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RANDA SLIM: To what
realistically takes place
in the United States?

35:22.687 --> 35:28.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think that, with this
administration,
given the time frame that's left
in its tenure,

35:28.493 --> 35:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, five weeks, less than
five weeks
away from the election, I don't
think that

35:33.264 --> 35:41.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this administration would engage
in any kind
of military option that bears
risks, and especially

35:41.339 --> 35:42.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
high risks.

35:42.741 --> 35:46.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And any option right now in
Syria is going
to be a risky option.

35:47.012 --> 35:52.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we need to do and
what is realistic
is to alleviate the human
suffering.

35:52.650 --> 35:59.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is -- for example, we have
now 250,000
to 270,000 people that are under
siege by

35:59.991 --> 36:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Syrian regime and its
supporting coalition
in Eastern Aleppo, and that are
being basically

36:05.797 --> 36:07.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
starved to death.

36:07.665 --> 36:14.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so airdrops of humanitarian
aid, airdrops
over this region of medicine, of
food, massive

36:14.472 --> 36:22.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airdrops of medicine and food in
the short-term,
could help at least alleviate
the human suffering

36:22.380 --> 36:24.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of these people.

36:24.149 --> 36:30.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we also need to, in the
short-term,
to enable the armed groups, the
opposition

36:30.288 --> 36:36.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's still in Eastern Aleppo
to stay there,
and we need to enable the armed
groups that

36:36.394 --> 36:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are fighting against ISIL and
that are fighting
against the regime to continue
to fight against

36:41.099 --> 36:42.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIL, against the regime.

36:42.967 --> 36:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is this element here
that we always
are forgetting, that there are
regional parties

36:47.605 --> 36:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have high stakes in this
conflict, either
the United States or Russia
today.

36:53.078 --> 36:58.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these are countries that are
going to
continue to wage their proxy
wars in Syria

36:58.483 --> 37:07.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to, in a way, help change
the dynamics
on the ground in ways that best
serve the

37:07.125 --> 37:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
interests of the Syrian parties.

37:08.626 --> 37:10.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

37:10.428 --> 37:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, given that, Derek Chollet,
is the next
president going to have any more
success than

37:13.798 --> 37:15.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this one did?

37:15.533 --> 37:19.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we recognize the next
president could
have a different approach to
Syria.

37:20.004 --> 37:26.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEREK CHOLLET: Well, I think, as
Nick Kristof
said, this is a very difficult
problem.

37:26.611 --> 37:31.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there have been never been
easy, risk-free
solutions in Syria, whether
we're talking

37:31.616 --> 37:35.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in 2011, 2012, or today.

37:35.286 --> 37:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a set of options that
the next president
will -- I'm certain will
consider, in terms

37:39.991 --> 37:44.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the attackers that targets
that we're hitting
with our airstrikes, in terms of
the kinds

37:44.229 --> 37:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of support we're giving the
Syrian option,
the kinds of weapons we are
providing them,

37:48.533 --> 37:52.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of the targets we are
directing the
Syrian opposition the hit, in
terms of the

37:52.170 --> 37:56.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of special operators on
the ground
to work with the Syrian
opposition to try

37:56.774 --> 37:59.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make them more cohesive and
capable.

38:00.011 --> 38:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But none of those measures are
going to take
away the fundamental difficulty
of the situation

38:04.182 --> 38:09.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the dilemma that we're
facing, nor is
it going to take away the
significant risk

38:09.053 --> 38:12.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's entailed with any sort of
U.S. military
engagement in Syria.

38:12.457 --> 38:16.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's a risk we all
need to be
honest about and aware of as --
because I

38:17.028 --> 38:23.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think -- as we potentially
escalate further
into this conflict with no end
in sight perhaps.

38:23.067 --> 38:27.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, very
quickly, just to
give both Nick and Randa time
for a final

38:27.705 --> 38:33.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comment, at least will there be
a time for
an opportunity for a fresh start
with a new

38:33.711 --> 38:34.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president?

38:34.712 --> 38:36.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Quickly to Nick and then to
Randa.

38:36.481 --> 38:41.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICHOLAS KRISTOF: Well, you
know, I think
there is going to be an
opportunity, but I

38:41.619 --> 38:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think Russia and Syria are both
frantically
trying to change the attacks on
the ground,

38:45.623 --> 38:48.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that there is less room for
the next president
to maneuver.

38:48.893 --> 38:53.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the end of the day, I
mean, I guess
-- I think that President Obama
had a plausible

38:53.865 --> 38:58.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strategy a few years ago, but
one that, in
retrospect, just has failed.

38:58.469 --> 39:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after a half-a-million
deaths, after the
rise of ISIS, after a global
refugee crisis,

39:03.541 --> 39:08.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then I think the one thing that
should be
pretty clear now is that it's
time to reevaluate

39:08.413 --> 39:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and look for a new approach.

39:10.248 --> 39:13.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Randa Slim,
what do we
look for?

39:13.985 --> 39:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDA SLIM: I think -- as Nick
said, I think
the next president will be
evaluating what

39:22.293 --> 39:24.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we need to do in Syria.

39:24.229 --> 39:31.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But also, as Nick said, I think
the next president
will be facing less options to
deal with.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meaning what?

39:33.871 --> 39:36.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meaning that -- because the
Russians are now...

39:36.708 --> 39:41.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDA SLIM: Meaning -- meaning
that there
will be -- I mean, meaning, if
Aleppo were

39:41.646 --> 39:49.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fall in the next -- in the
next few weeks,
I think that will create a new
fait accompli

39:49.354 --> 39:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that will make the regime and
that will make
the coalition supporting the
regime less willing

39:55.460 --> 40:01.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to engage in the political
process which the
American administration has
always wanted

40:01.532 --> 40:03.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and advocated for.

40:03.268 --> 40:10.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it means that at -- that
this next
president needs to explore
carefully, but

40:10.174 --> 40:16.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also seriously, what kind of
military tools
could be deployed to create the
conditions

40:16.781 --> 40:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the ground for this political
process.

40:19.350 --> 40:21.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's complicated,
and it's
painful.

40:21.653 --> 40:24.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, as all three of you said,
it is hard.

40:24.155 --> 40:34.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Derek Chollet, Randa Slim,
Nicholas Kristof,
we thank you.

40:34.198 --> 40:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Derek Chollet, Randa Slim,
Nicholas Kristof,
we thank you.

40:40.204 --> 40:44.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, the U.S. Congress
finally agreed
on more funding to fight the
Zika virus.

40:44.809 --> 40:49.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The money comes months after
health officials
asked for it and places like
Florida grapple

40:49.380 --> 40:51.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to slow the virus' spread.

40:51.449 --> 40:56.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Miami, as William Brangham
reports, the
crisis has put pregnant women
particularly

40:56.287 --> 40:58.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on edge.

40:58.189 --> 41:02.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Beyond the
famous sugar-white
sands of South Beach in Miami,
there's a clear

41:02.327 --> 41:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sense of unease about the
growing public health
crisis here.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK SCOTT (R), Florida: This
means Florida
has become the first state in
the nation to

41:09.667 --> 41:12.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have local transmission of the
Zika virus.

41:12.437 --> 41:16.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Over the last
few months,
officials have been waging an
all-out war

41:16.274 --> 41:21.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against mosquitoes, spraying
pesticides from
the air, going door to door in
some neighborhoods,

41:21.913 --> 41:26.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
checking plants and standing
water, and plastering
the city with warning signs,
telling residents

41:26.918 --> 41:29.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how to protect themselves from
Zika.

41:29.687 --> 41:35.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are now over 940
documented cases of
Zika in the state of Florida and
over 230

41:35.927 --> 41:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Miami-Dade County alone.

41:38.396 --> 41:43.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the epicenter is here in
Miami, and the
largest number of
locally-acquired Zika infections

41:43.501 --> 41:46.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have occurred in these two
neighborhoods.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How are people in Florida doing
with this?

41:48.172 --> 41:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMMY MACK, WLRN: The pregnant
women that
I have talked to, and their
partners, or people

41:51.442 --> 41:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who know pregnant women are
taking it very
seriously, and there's a lot of
anxiety there.

41:57.415 --> 41:58.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's a lot of anxiety there.

41:58.950 --> 42:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pregnant women should avoid
nonessential travel
to the county.

42:02.086 --> 42:07.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sammy Mack is
a health reporter
for WLRN, the local NPR station
in Miami.

42:07.892 --> 42:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While she's eager to cover this
big story,
Mack has ended up in the middle
of in it in

42:12.397 --> 42:14.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a way she'd rather not.

42:14.265 --> 42:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's also four months pregnant.

42:16.033 --> 42:22.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMMY MACK: It became an issue
of, OK, how
-- how am I going to cover this
thing that

42:22.240 --> 42:27.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is happening in the middle of my
beat, in
a way that is not putting me at
any kind of

42:27.779 --> 42:29.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
additional risk?

42:29.614 --> 42:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mack took one
of the free
Zika tests offered by the state,
but the results

42:33.451 --> 42:37.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
took weeks, and those delays can
limit the
options for pregnant women.

42:37.321 --> 42:39.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMMY MACK: I waited five weeks
to get my
results back.

42:39.857 --> 42:41.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In the middle
of a pregnancy?

42:41.058 --> 42:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMMY MACK: In the middle of a
pregnancy.

42:42.960 --> 42:47.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If women don't get their test
turned around
quickly and are waiting four
weeks, six weeks,

42:47.231 --> 42:54.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eight weeks, whatever it is,
that may affect
their window to decide to
terminate the pregnancy.

42:54.939 --> 42:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Florida restricts abortion past
24 weeks.

42:57.141 --> 42:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thankfully,
Mack's results
were negative.

42:59.777 --> 43:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But she has to remain vigilant.

43:01.846 --> 43:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All it takes is one mosquito
bite.

43:03.781 --> 43:08.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as a journalist, this story
is unfolding
in areas she's not supposed to
go.

43:08.853 --> 43:12.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMMY MACK: I now have bug spray
that I give
out to everybody.

43:12.857 --> 43:13.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is that right?

43:13.858 --> 43:14.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SAMMY MACK: Yes.

43:14.859 --> 43:15.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

43:15.893 --> 43:16.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Individual
doses for people?

43:16.861 --> 43:17.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SAMMY MACK: Yes.

43:17.862 --> 43:19.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

43:19.664 --> 43:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I ordered a huge pack online,
and I hand them
out to people who are going to
the places

43:21.265 --> 43:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that I'm not going to.

43:22.266 --> 43:23.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:23.267 --> 43:24.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELLEN SCHWARTZBARD, OB/GYN: Hi,
Tiffany.

43:24.335 --> 43:25.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIFFANY ANDERSON, Florida: Hey,
Dr. Schwartzbard.

43:25.269 --> 43:26.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are you doing?

43:26.270 --> 43:27.238 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:27.271 --> 43:28.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELLEN SCHWARTZBARD: I'm good.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.240 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How are you?

43:29.273 --> 43:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIFFANY ANDERSON: I'm good.

43:30.274 --> 43:32.076 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thanks.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tiffany
Anderson and her
husband, Jay, are expecting
their first child

43:33.911 --> 43:35.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in just two weeks, and they too
have had to
adapt to this potential risk to
their unborn

43:35.480 --> 43:36.447 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
child.

43:36.481 --> 43:38.249 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN SCHWARTZBARD: I know you
have been very
cautious throughout your whole
pregnancy,

43:40.418 --> 43:42.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
protecting yourself from
mosquito bites with
regards to Zika.

43:42.920 --> 43:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Their OB/GYN,
Dr. Ellen
Schwartzbard, has been advising
Tiffany and

43:47.892 --> 43:50.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all her patients to be vigilant.

43:50.528 --> 43:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Andersons used to live just
on the edge
of one of the neighborhoods with
active Zika

43:55.466 --> 44:00.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transmissions, but they have
since moved into
this house a few miles away.

44:00.137 --> 44:02.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tiffany also took a Zika test a
month ago.

44:02.340 --> 44:03.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She was negative.

44:03.808 --> 44:07.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have changed their
behavior to make
sure she stays Zika-free.

44:07.044 --> 44:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIFFANY ANDERSON: We don't
really spend a
lot of time outdoors.

44:09.914 --> 44:14.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We won't go to restaurants where
we're going
to be eating outdoors, even if
it's outside

44:14.785 --> 44:21.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what the designated Zika
transmission zone
is, just because it's constantly
changing

44:21.158 --> 44:22.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and enlarging and...

44:22.627 --> 44:24.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And that's
just what your
daily life has to be now.

44:24.762 --> 44:26.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY ANDERSON, Florida: It's just
minimizing
exposure.

44:26.397 --> 44:27.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIFFANY ANDERSON: Exactly.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAY ANDERSON: It's scary.

44:29.267 --> 44:32.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when you're scared,
especially when you're
scared for your unborn child,
and especially

44:32.904 --> 44:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when it's your first child, you
try and focus
on what you can control.

44:37.341 --> 44:39.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's only a few things
that you can.

44:39.277 --> 44:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIFFANY ANDERSON: And I now
carry insect repellent
around in my purse, whereas,
before, it might

44:43.514 --> 44:44.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been perfume.

44:44.882 --> 44:48.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I stopped wearing -- my
perfume now of
choice is now deet.

44:48.686 --> 44:49.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

44:49.687 --> 44:51.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:51.489 --> 44:54.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Christine
Curry is one
of the main doctors treating
pregnant women

44:54.158 --> 44:56.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who do have Zika in Florida.

44:56.227 --> 45:00.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, she's caring for 15
pregnant women,
and eight who've already given
birth.

45:00.665 --> 45:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
None of the babies born to
Zika-infected mothers
here have shown signs of the
birth defect

45:05.836 --> 45:09.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
known as microcephaly.

45:09.140 --> 45:14.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear how often an
infected woman
will pass the virus to their
child in utero,

45:14.378 --> 45:17.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or how many babies with the
virus will develop
complications.

45:17.782 --> 45:21.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where do you think we are in our
understanding
of Zika?

45:21.085 --> 45:22.587 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:22.620 --> 45:24.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE CURRY, University of
Miami Health
System: At the very beginning.

45:24.422 --> 45:27.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're less than a year into
this, and so I
think that it's still going to
take another

45:27.858 --> 45:32.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
few years for us to both
understand the consequences
during pregnancy.

45:32.563 --> 45:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it's going to take
years to know,
the babies that were infected,
what do they

45:36.200 --> 45:40.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look like compared to uninfected
babies when
they're six months old or
1-year-old, or when

45:40.571 --> 45:42.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they hit school age?

45:42.373 --> 45:45.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As public
health officials
try to understand this virus
better, they're

45:45.743 --> 45:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also dealing with a protest over
Florida's
efforts to curtail its spread.

45:50.014 --> 45:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTERS: No more Naled!

45:51.782 --> 45:55.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Even though
the EPA and
the CDC have said that the
spraying of the

45:55.686 --> 46:00.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pesticide Naled is both safe and
effective,
its use has triggered a
backlash.

46:00.825 --> 46:06.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMMY MACK: The tension around
it is with
people who are -- fall into a
couple of categories.

46:06.731 --> 46:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, there are people who are
concerned that
the outcome of using this
chemical might be

46:12.770 --> 46:15.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worse than the risks of Zika.

46:15.473 --> 46:20.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are people who are just --
kind of don't
believe that Zika is actually a
problem, and

46:20.177 --> 46:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have been very loud at some
of these
meetings.

46:22.146 --> 46:23.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PROTESTERS: No!

46:23.147 --> 46:24.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No!

46:24.148 --> 46:25.516 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No!

46:25.549 --> 46:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Curry
spoke at one of
these public hearings.

46:26.517 --> 46:28.352 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:28.386 --> 46:29.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE CURRY: With your
permission, I would
like to face this direction
while I speak.

46:29.086 --> 46:30.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Sure.

46:30.087 --> 46:31.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:31.622 --> 46:33.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE CURRY: I am much more
comfortable
with patients than politicians.

46:33.491 --> 46:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Trying to
convince concerned
residents that, while no one
wants pesticides

46:35.993 --> 46:39.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their neighborhoods, Zika is
not to be
taken lightly.

46:39.597 --> 46:40.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:40.865 --> 46:44.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE CURRY: And I want you
to know that
Zika is a thing.

46:44.301 --> 46:50.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And while we don't fully
understand it, the
women who are positive have
higher rates of

46:50.274 --> 46:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
birth defects, and higher rates
of stillbirth,
and higher rates of
miscarriages, and higher

46:55.012 --> 46:59.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates of ultrasound images that
are ugly and
scary.

46:59.750 --> 47:04.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thanks in part
to aerial
spraying, Wynwood, one of the
two Miami neighborhoods

47:04.989 --> 47:10.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that was seeing active
transmissions, it has
now been declared Zika-free.

47:10.494 --> 47:13.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But cases in Miami Beach have
only grown.

47:13.764 --> 47:19.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 12 days since we visited
Miami, Florida
officials have discovered at
least 14 additional

47:19.637 --> 47:21.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
locally transmitted cases.

47:21.172 --> 47:31.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Miami, Florida.

47:31.449 --> 47:41.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
it is time
for our weekly segment about the
Leading Edge

47:41.726 --> 47:43.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of science and technology.

47:43.594 --> 47:48.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, this week, there is plenty
of science
in the news with the Nobel
Prizes.

47:48.065 --> 47:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has more from
our New York
studios.

47:50.768 --> 47:55.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The latest
winners are in
the field of chemistry, and the
Nobel went

47:55.172 --> 48:00.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a trio of scientists who
helped pioneer
tiny molecular machines in the
world of nanotechnology.

48:00.678 --> 48:04.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are specially designed
molecules that
can produce controlled
movements.

48:04.982 --> 48:08.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's talk they could some
day be useful
in the world of medicine.

48:08.719 --> 48:11.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our science correspondent, Miles
O'Brien,
is here to walk us through the
significance

48:11.589 --> 48:13.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this and the other Nobels
awarded this
week.

48:13.958 --> 48:15.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He joins us tonight from San
Diego.

48:15.993 --> 48:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles, Drs. Jean-Pierre Sauvage,
Fraser Stoddart
and Bernard Feringa, for the
design and synthesis

48:22.633 --> 48:24.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of molecular machines.

48:24.034 --> 48:25.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How small are we talking?

48:25.069 --> 48:27.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, think of a
nanometer.

48:27.938 --> 48:32.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A nanometer is -- well, there
are 80,000 of
them in a human hair.

48:32.676 --> 48:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That will give you an idea.

48:33.744 --> 48:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're talking very small.

48:35.780 --> 48:41.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Imagine machines at the
molecular level that
can do work, and some of the
applications

48:41.085 --> 48:46.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we're thinking about are
potentially
drug delivery inside our system,
and many

48:46.824 --> 48:52.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
others where tiny machines can
pack a punch.

48:52.897 --> 48:58.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another application they're
looking at potentially,
Hari, is creating computer
storage capability

48:58.702 --> 49:00.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the atomic level.

49:00.538 --> 49:04.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, if you're storing things
at the atomic
level, you basically need a
processor that

49:04.942 --> 49:07.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is at the molecular model.

49:07.044 --> 49:11.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so nanomachines are
potentially revolutionary.

49:11.081 --> 49:13.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're still very early on,
though, in that
game.

49:13.450 --> 49:16.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How do you
build something
that small?

49:16.520 --> 49:22.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's basically a
chemical process
that you engage with, and that
is part of

49:22.827 --> 49:24.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their insight.

49:24.662 --> 49:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, basically, the
researchers
are saying that we're kind of
like the Wright

49:29.433 --> 49:31.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Brothers at this point.

49:31.235 --> 49:36.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We built a flying machine, but
how could you
possibly have conceived of the
747 at the

49:37.007 --> 49:38.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time that occurred?

49:38.909 --> 49:45.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These mechanisms, these tiny
nanomachines,
have the capability of
revolutionizing medicine,

49:45.115 --> 49:49.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
revolutionizing computer
storage, and really
who knows what, because we can't
imagine that

49:49.353 --> 49:50.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
747.

49:50.487 --> 49:53.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
let's shift to
physics.

49:53.591 --> 49:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nobel was given to David
Thouless, Duncan
Haldane and Michael Kosterlitz
for something

49:58.762 --> 50:02.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
called topological phase
transitions and phases
of matter.

50:02.533 --> 50:05.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I need an advanced degree just
to understand
what the prize was for.

50:05.736 --> 50:08.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes, yes, it's --
this is a
tough one.

50:08.806 --> 50:11.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a lot of mathematics and
physics.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's difficult, frankly.

50:13.644 --> 50:14.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's tough sledding.

50:14.778 --> 50:17.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it is a very human moment
involved.

50:17.648 --> 50:19.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a very human moment
involved.

50:19.750 --> 50:23.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Kosterlitz got the word in
his car.

50:23.988 --> 50:25.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Listen to his response.

50:25.289 --> 50:28.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: We run the official
Web site for
the Nobel Prize.

50:28.525 --> 50:31.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have you already heard the news
of the announcements
to the physics...

50:31.896 --> 50:33.264 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

50:33.297 --> 50:34.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL KOSTERLITZ, Nobel Prize
Winner: No,
haven't heard anything.

50:34.832 --> 50:37.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm talking from an underground
car park in
Helsinki, Finland, right now.

50:37.968 --> 50:40.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I can barely hear you.

50:40.204 --> 50:47.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: It has just been
announced in Stockholm
that you are one of the
recipients of the

50:47.478 --> 50:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2016 Nobel Prize in physics.

50:50.614 --> 50:51.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

50:51.615 --> 50:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL KOSTERLITZ: That's
incredible.

50:53.951 --> 50:55.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's amazing.

50:55.286 --> 50:58.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: What a way to get
the news,
eh?

50:58.455 --> 51:01.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, here's what this is all
about, phase changes.

51:01.458 --> 51:03.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You might remember this from
high school.

51:03.894 --> 51:08.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Phase changes occur -- it's the
difference
between steam becoming --
condensing down

51:08.832 --> 51:12.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to water, and then ultimately
freezing into
a solid.

51:12.202 --> 51:13.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are phase changes we
understand.

51:13.971 --> 51:18.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it gets to the quantum
level, the way
things shift from phase to
phase, we don't

51:18.275 --> 51:19.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
understand as well.

51:19.643 --> 51:23.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a matter of fact, the quantum
world is
like a parallel universe.

51:23.113 --> 51:26.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Things react and do things very
differently.

51:26.450 --> 51:32.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Topology is a technique where
you identify
basic shapes, whether something
has like a

51:32.489 --> 51:35.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
single hole or two holes or is
solid.

51:35.759 --> 51:40.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Nobel Committee used a
pretzel and
a bagel and a muffin to try to
illustrate

51:40.698 --> 51:42.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this point.

51:42.666 --> 51:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But by understanding that
mathematics, scientists
hope to get greater insights
into what happens

51:46.937 --> 51:50.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the quantum level as things
move from phase
to phase.

51:50.407 --> 51:56.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This might one day lead to
superconducting
materials that can do their job
at room temperature.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So far, that's been a very
elusive goal, Hari.

51:58.882 --> 52:03.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Monday, the Nobel
for medicine was handed out to
just one individual,

52:03.087 --> 52:06.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi, for
something called
autophagy.

52:06.623 --> 52:07.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is that?

52:07.891 --> 52:11.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Autophagy is
recycling at the
cellular level.

52:11.562 --> 52:13.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It happens inside our bodies.

52:13.097 --> 52:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many years, scientists have
known about
lysosomes.

52:16.467 --> 52:21.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lysosomes are parts of our cells
that take
things that you don't
necessarily want there,

52:21.872 --> 52:26.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potentially toxins, and breaks
them down into
their constituent parts to be
reused by the

52:26.777 --> 52:28.579 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
body.

52:28.612 --> 52:31.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What scientists never really
understood was,
how does the bad stuff get to
the lysosome?

52:31.715 --> 52:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's where autophagy comes
in.

52:33.784 --> 52:40.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Autophagosomes are essentially
the dump trucks,
the trash trucks of our body
delivering stuff

52:40.124 --> 52:42.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to our cells to be recycled.

52:42.259 --> 52:47.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this is potentially very
exciting, because
this might be at the very heart
of the very

52:47.264 --> 52:52.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mechanisms that create cancer,
for example,
or neurological diseases.

52:52.403 --> 52:57.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the case of embryonic
development,
if you can see and understand
this, you can

52:57.608 --> 53:00.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
learn about how an embryo might
develop.

53:00.577 --> 53:04.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's tremendous potential
there for
medicine, lots of papers
generated out of

53:04.982 --> 53:08.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this one particular discovery by
this one
individual.

53:08.752 --> 53:10.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Very unusual.

53:10.521 --> 53:12.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Miles, if there
was a Nobel Prize for explaining
the Nobel

53:12.790 --> 53:14.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Prizes, you should be in
contention.

53:14.191 --> 53:17.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thanks so much for joining us
tonight from
San Diego.

53:17.261 --> 53:24.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You're welcome,
Hari.

53:24.668 --> 53:29.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think Miles
should actually
win that prize.

53:29.907 --> 53:31.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:31.442 --> 53:32.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:32.609 --> 53:34.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

53:34.845 --> 53:41.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

53:41.085 --> 53:44.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
