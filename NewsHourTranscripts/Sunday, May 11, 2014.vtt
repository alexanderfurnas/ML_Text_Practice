WHY DOES TODAY'S VOTE MATTER I

02:05.300 --> 02:06.767
THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS

02:06.767 --> 02:09.267

RUSSIAN SEPARATISTS IN EASTERN

UKRAINE, ABOUT TO DECLAR

NOT FOR ONE BUT TWO PROVINCE

THEY NEED THIS VOTE TO GIV

THEIR EFFORTS A VENEER O

02:22.400 --> 02:22.667
LEGITIMACY

02:22.667 --> 02:23.867
THAT'S WHY THERE'S BEEN SOME

02:23.867 --> 02:25.200
PEOPLE HEADING TO THE POLLS,

02:25.200 --> 02:26.033
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

02:26.033 --> 02:27.367
>> WHEN YOU SPOKE TO PEOPLE AT

02:27.367 --> 02:30.867
THE POLLS TODAY, WAS THIS A VOTE

02:30.867 --> 02:33.100
FOR INDEPENDENCE AND TO JOIN

02:33.100 --> 02:33.767
RUSSIA

02:33.767 --> 02:34.933
OR WAS THIS MORE FRUSTRATION

02:34.933 --> 02:37.700
AGAINST KIEV

02:37.700 --> 02:39.100
>> IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.800
IF YOU LOOK AT PUBLIC OPINIO

02:40.800 --> 02:43.100
POLLS, THE ONES THAT WER

02:43.100 --> 02:44.667
CONDUCTED INDEPENDENTLY BY

02:44.667 --> 02:45.833
PROFESSIONALS, THERE'S VERY,

02:45.833 --> 02:48.467
VERY LOW SUPPORT FOR ANY SORT OF

02:48.467 --> 02:49.833
INDEPENDENCE OR SECESSION FROM

02:49.833 --> 02:50.933
UKRAINE HERE

02:50.933 --> 02:51.967
INTERESTINGLY, THOSE SAME POLL

02:51.967 --> 02:54.367
ALSO SHOW, AS YOU SAID, GREA

02:54.367 --> 02:55.500
FRUSTRATION WITH THE INTERIM

02:55.500 --> 02:56.600
GOVERNMENT IN KIEV

02:56.600 --> 02:58.000
THE VOTE TODAY, PEOPLE THAT DI

02:59.500 --> 03:01.667
EVERYONE WHO WENT TO THE POLLS

03:01.667 --> 03:03.800
WOULD VOTE YES TO THE QUESTION

03:03.800 --> 03:04.833
OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY

03:04.833 --> 03:06.833
SO THEY WERE VOTING AGAINST KIEV

03:06.833 --> 03:08.233
AS MUCH AS THEY WERE VOTING FO

03:08.233 --> 03:09.367
ANY SORT OF INDEPENDENCE

03:09.367 --> 03:11.267
>> WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM TH

HAS THERE BEEN ANY RESPONSE FROM

03:18.533 --> 03:19.033
RUSSIA TODAY

03:19.033 --> 03:21.000
>> I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY RESPONS

03:21.000 --> 03:22.067
YET.

03:22.067 --> 03:22.933
IT'S INTERESTING

03:22.933 --> 03:24.267
BECAUSE THE REFERENDUM I

03:24.267 --> 03:25.633
ACTUALLY BEING CONDUCTED FOR THE

03:25.633 --> 03:27.033
AUDIENCE OF ONE, MAYBE MORE THAN

03:27.033 --> 03:28.900
ONE, BUT THAT'S THE KEY AUDIENCE

03:28.900 --> 03:30.233
OF THIS REFERENDUM, IT'S NOT I

03:30.233 --> 03:31.833
THE WEST, IT'S IN THE KREMLIN.

03:31.833 --> 03:35.900
THE PEOPLE WHO CALL THEMSELVES

03:41.300 --> 03:42.833
TO HAVE CRIMEA ANNEXATION BY

03:42.833 --> 03:43.033
RUSSIA

03:43.033 --> 03:46.600
THEY REALIZE THE DONETSK

03:46.600 --> 03:48.000
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC HAS NO

03:48.000 --> 03:48.733
ECONOMIC FUTURE.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.867
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY PUBLI

03:52.400 --> 03:53.633
LEADERS FOR AN NECESSARY SAYING,

03:53.633 --> 03:56.667

04:07.367 --> 04:08.400
CRIMEA-STYLE MERGER WITH RUSSI

04:08.400 --> 04:09.700
IS IN THE WORKS.

04:09.700 --> 04:10.433
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE HAV

04:10.433 --> 04:11.700
ACTUALLY DECIDED WHAT TO D

HERE, OR IN MOSCOW, FOR THAT

17:33.567 --> 17:35.000
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.400
SO IN THIS EXPERIMENT, THE

17:36.400 --> 17:38.067
INTERESTING THING IS THERE'S NOT

17:38.067 --> 17:39.667
ANY MIRACLE DRUG

17:39.667 --> 17:41.667
YOU FOUND A WAY TO SUPER CHARG

17:41.667 --> 17:44.767
A PATIENT'S OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM TO

17:44.767 --> 17:45.100
FIGHT A CANCER

17:45.100 --> 17:46.400
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

17:46.400 --> 17:47.933
>> THIS IS A WAY TO TAKE

17:47.933 --> 17:49.767
ADVANTAGE OF THE PATIENT'S OWN

17:49.767 --> 17:50.633
NATURAL IMMUNE DEFENSE AGAINST

17:50.633 --> 17:51.967
THE CANCER

17:51.967 --> 17:54.200
ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES IN ALL

17:54.200 --> 17:55.867
OF CANCER TREATMENT IS FINDING

17:55.867 --> 17:57.800
WAYS TO ATTACK THE CANCE

17:57.800 --> 17:58.233
WITHOUT ALSO ATTACKING NORMA

17:58.233 --> 18:02.333
CELLS.

18:02.333 --> 18:04.300
CANCER BECOMES A CANCER BECAUS

18:04.300 --> 18:06.367
A NORMAL CELL ACCUMULATES IN ITS

18:06.367 --> 18:08.367
DNA A LARGE NUMBER OF MUTATIONS,

18:08.367 --> 18:10.800
THAT IS, CHANGES IN THE DN

18:10.800 --> 18:12.533
SEQUENCE THAT RESULTS IN NEW

18:12.533 --> 18:13.167
PROTEINS

18:13.167 --> 18:14.800
IN THIS PAPER, WE'VE WORKED OU

18:14.800 --> 18:18.200
A WAY TO TARGET THE EXACT MU

18:18.200 --> 18:20.067
TRAITIONS THAT RESULT FROM

18:20.067 --> 18:21.667
MAKING A NORMAL CELL INTO

18:21.667 --> 18:22.233
CANCER CELL.

18:22.233 --> 18:24.933
SO IN THAT SENSE ARE IT'S A VERY

18:24.933 --> 18:26.533
HIGHLY SPECIFIC AND HIGHLY

18:26.533 --> 18:28.067
UNIQUE TREATMENT THAT HAS TO B

18:28.067 --> 18:30.033
DEVELOPED FOR EACH INDIVIDUA

18:30.033 --> 18:30.100
PATIENT.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.900
>> SO YOU REALLY DID THE DNA -

18:31.900 --> 18:33.933
>> THE SEQUENCING OF THE

18:33.933 --> 18:35.200
SPECIFIC TUMOR, THAT'S RIGHT

18:35.200 --> 18:37.033
SO WHAT ONE HAS TO DO IN

18:37.033 --> 18:37.900
PERFORMING THIS NEW TREATMENT IS

18:37.900 --> 18:42.067
TO SEQUENCE THE PATIENT'

18:42.067 --> 18:43.167
CANCER, IDENTIFY ALL OF TH

18:43.167 --> 18:43.967
MUTATIONS, THE DIFFERENCES FRO

18:43.967 --> 18:45.333
NORMAL THAT EXIST IN THA

18:45.333 --> 18:48.100
PATIENT'S DNA SEQUENCE

18:48.100 --> 18:50.867
AND THEN SPECIFICALLY TARGET THE

18:50.867 --> 18:52.700
INDIVIDUAL MUTATIONS THAT HAVE

18:52.700 --> 18:55.033
OCCURRED AMONG THE 3 BILLION

18:55.033 --> 18:56.767
BASES OF DNA

18:56.767 --> 18:58.900
WE CAN TARGET THE SINGLE BAS

18:58.900 --> 19:00.500
CHANGE THAT RESULTS IN MAKIN

19:00.500 --> 19:02.633
THAT NORMAL CELL A CANCER CELL

19:02.633 --> 19:04.933
IN DOING THAT WE CAN ACTUALL

19:04.933 --> 19:06.400
AFFECT THE CANCER WITHOU

19:06.400 --> 19:08.167
AFFECTING NORMAL TISSUES

19:08.167 --> 19:09.433
IT'S A VERY EXPERIMENTAL

19:09.433 --> 19:09.533
TECHNIQUE.

19:09.533 --> 19:11.067
IT HAS TO BE DEVELOPED

19:11.067 --> 19:12.300
INDIVIDUALLY FOR EACH PATIENT.

19:12.300 --> 19:14.367
>> HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE I

19:14.367 --> 19:15.867
IT'S SPECIFIC TO EACH PATIENT?

19:15.867 --> 19:18.067
>> FROM THE TIME WE ACTUALLY

19:18.067 --> 19:19.100
RESECT THE CANCER AND BEGIN TO

19:19.100 --> 19:20.967
DO THE SEQUENCING, ONE CAN HAV

19:20.967 --> 19:22.767
THE TREATMENT READY IN ABOUT

19:22.767 --> 19:23.900
FIVE TO SIX WEEKS.

19:23.900 --> 19:27.200
BUT IT'S A VERY COMPLEX KIND O

19:27.200 --> 19:27.467
TREATMENT.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.900
AND IN THE FIRST PATIENT I

19:28.900 --> 19:30.433
WHICH WE DEMONSTRATED THIS KIN

19:30.433 --> 19:32.700
OF APPROACH CAN WORK, IT TOO

19:32.700 --> 19:34.567
ABOUT TWO MONTHS TO DEVELOP TH

19:34.567 --> 19:35.633
TREATMENT FOR THAT INDIVIDUA

19:35.633 --> 19:35.733
PATIENT.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.167
BUT IT REPRESENTS A BLUEPRIN

19:37.167 --> 19:39.600
FOR HOW TO DO THIS FOR OTHER

19:39.600 --> 19:40.300
INDIVIDUALS AS WELL.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.367
>> ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'VE ONLY HAD

19:42.367 --> 19:43.900
ONE PATIENT, AS YOU MENTIONED.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.467
WHY IS THIS SO GROUND-BREAKING

19:46.467 --> 19:47.700
>> ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS W

19:47.700 --> 19:49.367
HAVE IN CANCER IS THE FACT THA

19:49.367 --> 19:50.500
ALTHOUGH WE CAN CURE ABOUT HAL

19:50.500 --> 19:53.233
OF ALL PATIENTS THAT DEVELOP

19:53.233 --> 19:55.633
CANCER IN THIS -- IN 2014, HAL

19:55.633 --> 19:58.300
OF THE PATIENTS THAT DEVELOP

19:58.300 --> 20:00.433
CANCER WILL ULTIMATELY DIE O

20:00.433 --> 20:00.567
THAT DISEASE

20:00.567 --> 20:03.667
WE DON'T HAVE CURES FOR MOST

20:03.667 --> 20:04.600
CANCERS ONCE THEY'VE SPREA

20:04.600 --> 20:06.733
THROUGHOUT THE BODY.

20:06.733 --> 20:08.667
WHEN WE APPLY TREATMENTS LIK

20:08.667 --> 20:09.733
SURGERY, RADIATION

20:09.733 --> 20:11.400
CHEMOTHERAPY, WE OFTEN ATTAC

20:11.400 --> 20:14.067
THE CANCER BUT CAN AFFECT NORMAL

20:14.067 --> 20:14.667
TISSUES AS WELL.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.600
THE UNIQUE ASPECT OF THI

20:16.600 --> 20:18.067
PARTICULAR TREATMENT THAT TAKE

20:18.067 --> 20:20.400
ADVANTAGE OF THE EXQUISITE

20:20.400 --> 20:21.500
SPECIFICITY AND SENSITIVITY OF

20:21.500 --> 20:24.000
THE BODY'S OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM I

20:24.000 --> 20:26.133
WE CAN TARGET SOMETHING THAT'S

20:26.133 --> 20:27.967
ABSOLUTELY UNIQUE TO THE CANCER.

20:27.967 --> 20:29.567
SO THAT IT HAS NO IMPACT AT AL

20:29.567 --> 20:32.367
ON THE PATIENT'S NORMAL TISSUES.

20:32.367 --> 20:34.767
NOW THIS HAS BEEN DONE IN ON

20:34.767 --> 20:34.933
PATIENT.

20:34.933 --> 20:37.400
A PATIENT THAT HAD 26 MUTATION

20:37.400 --> 20:39.033
INSIDE THEIR CANCER.

20:39.033 --> 20:40.833
WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A SINGL

20:40.833 --> 20:42.500
ONE THIS WE COULD TARGET

20:42.500 --> 20:44.933
SINCE ALMOST ALL CANCERS CONTAIN

20:44.933 --> 20:46.000
MUTATIONS, AS WE CONTINUE TO

20:46.000 --> 20:46.900
DEVELOP THIS, HOPEFULLY THIS

20:46.900 --> 20:50.267
KIND OF APPROACH CAN BE USED T

20:50.267 --> 20:51.867
TARGET THE OTHER CANCERS THA

20:51.867 --> 20:53.300
START IN MANY DIFFERENT ORGANS

20:53.300 --> 20:53.567
AND DIVIDE

20:53.567 --> 20:55.767
>> PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WONDE

20:55.767 --> 20:57.200
THAT EXACT QUESTION.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.100
THIS IS ONE SPECIFIC CANCER, ONE

20:59.100 --> 20:59.767
SPECIFIC PATIENT

20:59.767 --> 21:00.833
HOW LONG TILL YOUR RESEARC

21:00.833 --> 21:01.667
COMPLETES AND THIS CAN B

21:01.667 --> 21:03.200
APPLIED TO OTHER CANCERS AND I

21:03.200 --> 21:05.267
A WIDER AUDIENCE

21:05.267 --> 21:06.600
>> WE HAVE SOME IMMUNE OWE

21:06.600 --> 21:10.600

21:10.600 --> 21:13.333

21:15.833 --> 21:17.367
SYSTEM AGAINST KIDNEY CANCER

21:17.367 --> 21:19.367
WE HAVE NOT HAD IMMUNE-BASED

21:19.367 --> 21:21.133
TREATMENTS THAT CAN JOIN SURGERY

21:21.133 --> 21:22.567
RADIATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY T

21:22.567 --> 21:24.833
ATTACK THE COMMON CANCERS.

21:24.833 --> 21:26.100
CARRIES THAT START IN THE COLON,

21:26.100 --> 21:27.833
IN THE RECTUM, IN THE PANCREAS

21:27.833 --> 21:31.367
THE ESOPHAGUS, THE OVARY, TH

21:31.367 --> 21:31.633
PROSTATE

21:31.633 --> 21:33.667
THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH CAN

21:33.667 --> 21:35.300
WORK INDISCRIMINATELY REGARDLESS

21:35.300 --> 21:37.300
OF WHERE THE CANCER AROSE.

21:37.300 --> 21:38.600
IN THIS PARTICULAR PATIENT THE

21:38.600 --> 21:39.900
CANCER AROSE IN THE BILE DUCTS

21:39.900 --> 21:41.300
AND LIVER AND SPREAD THROUGHOU

21:41.300 --> 21:43.133
THE LIVER AND INTO THE LUNGS

21:43.133 --> 21:45.833
AND SO, AGAIN, I WANT TO

21:45.833 --> 21:47.300
EMPHASIZE IT'S A HIGHL

21:47.300 --> 21:49.900
