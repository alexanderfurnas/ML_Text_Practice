00:05.805 --> 00:06.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.806 --> 00:08.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.708 --> 00:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES, Former Acting U.S.
Attorney General:
You don't want your national
security adviser

00:10.477 --> 00:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
compromised with the Russians.

00:12.245 --> 00:16.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former acting
Attorney General
Sally Yates tells the Senate how
she warned

00:16.983 --> 00:22.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House that General
Michael Flynn
was at risk of being blackmailed
by Moscow.

00:22.655 --> 00:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: France's new leader,
centrist Emmanuel
Macron, wins a closely watched
presidential

00:28.728 --> 00:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election by a landslide over
far-right candidate
Marine Le Pen.

00:33.967 --> 00:38.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: more legal challenges for
President
Trump's travel ban.

00:38.238 --> 00:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal appeals court in
Virginia hears
arguments on the revised
executive order.

00:44.778 --> 00:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And bringing the doctor's office
to the kitchen
-- how health care professionals
are focusing

00:49.849 --> 00:53.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on their patient's diet to
prevent diseases
on the rise.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.522 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE FARMER, Primary Care
Physician: If
I teach you how to cook, you're
going to improve

00:57.524 --> 01:01.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the types of food that you eat
and then ultimately
that is what is going to prevent
chronic disease

01:01.861 --> 01:03.096 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for you.

01:03.129 --> 01:09.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:09.969 --> 01:12.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:12.772 --> 01:23.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the U.S.
Senate, the attention
today was on the investigation
into the Trump

01:23.049 --> 01:27.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration's relationship
with Russia,
as senators heard from a man who
has been

01:27.053 --> 01:32.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the spotlight for years and a
woman few
had heard of before last fall.

01:32.625 --> 01:34.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins reports.

01:34.561 --> 01:39.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At the Capitol,
a swarm of
attention at a Russia hearing
with two high-profile

01:39.666 --> 01:41.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
witnesses.

01:41.034 --> 01:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One was former Director of
National Intelligence
James Clapper.

01:44.170 --> 01:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But attention focused on the
other, former
acting Attorney General Sally
Yates, who first

01:49.275 --> 01:54.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warned the White House that then
National
Security Adviser Michael Flynn
had lied about

01:54.247 --> 01:56.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his talks with Russian
officials.

01:56.216 --> 01:58.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES, Former Acting U.S.
Attorney General:
The concern first about the
underlying conduct

01:58.384 --> 02:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
itself, that he had lied to the
vice president
and others, the American public
had been misled,

02:03.690 --> 02:09.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then, importantly, that
every time this
lie was repeated, and the
misrepresentations

02:09.596 --> 02:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were getting more and more
specific as they
were coming out, every time that
happened,

02:15.201 --> 02:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it increased the compromise.

02:17.070 --> 02:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to state the obvious, you
don't want your
national security adviser
compromised with

02:22.041 --> 02:23.643 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Russians.

02:23.676 --> 02:26.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yates said she
made no recommendations,
just relayed information.

02:26.613 --> 02:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES: That created a
compromise situation,
a situation where the national
security adviser

02:32.352 --> 02:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
essentially could be blackmailed
by the Russians.

02:35.588 --> 02:41.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally, we told them that we
were giving
them all of this information so
that they

02:41.761 --> 02:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could take action, the action
that they deemed
appropriate.

02:44.764 --> 02:49.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Eighteen days
after that
private warning, the White House
forced out

02:49.602 --> 02:50.904 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Flynn.

02:50.937 --> 02:53.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that was just four days
after the news
had become public.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Sean
Spicer said
this at the time:

02:56.276 --> 02:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
The acting attorney general
informed the White

02:59.012 --> 03:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House counsel that they wanted
to give -- quote
-- a "heads-up" to us on some
comments that

03:04.751 --> 03:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may have seemed in conflict with
what he had
said to the vice president in
particular.

03:10.123 --> 03:13.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today,
Democrats pressed
the witnesses on whether the
White House did

03:13.726 --> 03:15.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enough fast enough.

03:15.128 --> 03:16.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL), Minority
Whip: If you
had the warning from the White
House -- or,

03:18.731 --> 03:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pardon me -- from the Department
of Justice
to the White House about General
Flynn possibly

03:23.503 --> 03:29.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being compromised here, and then
these important
national security decisions that
followed,

03:29.108 --> 03:30.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would you have concern about
that?

03:30.910 --> 03:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER, Former National
Intelligence
Director: Well, I would,
hypothetically, yes.

03:35.181 --> 03:38.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, again, I was gone from
the government
as well when this happened.

03:38.885 --> 03:43.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President Trump
added his
thoughts this morning
electronically, tweeting:

03:43.223 --> 03:48.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if
she knows
how classified information got
into the newspapers

03:48.728 --> 03:52.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soon after she explained it to
the White House
counsel."

03:52.098 --> 03:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iowa Republican Senator Chuck
Grassley asked.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.102 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:56.135 --> 03:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa: Have
either of
you ever been an anonymous
source in a news

03:59.239 --> 04:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report about matters relating to
Mr. Trump,
his associates or Russians'
attempt to meddle

04:04.944 --> 04:05.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the election?

04:05.945 --> 04:06.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES CLAPPER: No.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SALLY YATES: Absolutely not.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this comes
as news reports
surfaced today President Obama
warned Mr.

04:12.652 --> 04:16.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump against hiring Flynn just
days after
the election.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For his part, Spicer said today
those comments
were expected.

04:19.425 --> 04:23.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: It's true that the
president
made it -- President Obama made
it known that

04:23.162 --> 04:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wasn't exactly a fan of
General Flynn's,
which frankly shouldn't come as
a surprise

04:27.734 --> 04:33.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to anyone, given that General
Flynn had worked
for President Obama, was an
outspoken critic

04:33.306 --> 04:34.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of President Obama's
shortcomings.

04:34.841 --> 04:38.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This topic and
Sally Yates
will remain in the spotlight.

04:38.044 --> 04:40.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A House committee is due to hear
from her.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No date scheduled for that yet.

04:42.248 --> 04:46.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa is here
with me now
to dig deeper into what we
learned today.

04:46.486 --> 04:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're also joined by Julie Pace,
who is the
White House correspondent for
the Associated

04:51.024 --> 04:51.991 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Press.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome, of course, to both of
you.

04:53.159 --> 04:55.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, to your first just quickly
off of your
report.

04:55.061 --> 04:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of accusations flying back
and forth
between the Trump White House
and the former

05:00.033 --> 05:01.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obama team.

05:01.968 --> 05:07.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that one of the things
this -- President
Trump has said is that President
Obama's White

05:07.173 --> 05:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House had given a security
clearance originally
to General Flynn, who they fired
as the head

05:13.012 --> 05:15.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of defense intelligence a few
years ago.

05:15.381 --> 05:16.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where does the truth in all that
lie?

05:16.783 --> 05:18.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

05:18.351 --> 05:20.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this security clearance is
something that
retired generals have access to.

05:20.687 --> 05:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can ask for it by the fact
that they
are a retired general.

05:24.590 --> 05:26.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Flynn did ask for that in 2016.

05:26.092 --> 05:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was given it by the Defense
Department.

05:27.894 --> 05:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was reporting today that
now the Defense
Department is looking into
whether he lied

05:31.798 --> 05:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to them during that clearance
security renewal.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Take that aside, though.

05:37.570 --> 05:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you talk to national
security experts,
some from the George W. Bush
team and Democrats,

05:40.773 --> 05:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they all told me today that a
security clearance
doesn't take the onus off an
incoming administration

05:46.546 --> 05:48.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do their own vetting.

05:48.214 --> 05:51.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a very important difference
about the
national security adviser, Judy,
it's not

05:51.484 --> 05:56.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Senate-approved position, so
it doesn't
go through all the ethics checks
necessarily,

05:56.723 --> 05:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unless the president forces it
to.

05:58.591 --> 06:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, now,
one other thing
that you have been looking into
today is this

06:02.195 --> 06:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question of President Obama,
after President
Trump was elected, after he was
elected last

06:07.734 --> 06:09.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
November, warning him.

06:09.235 --> 06:10.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did you find out about
that?

06:10.403 --> 06:12.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others have reported this as
well, but we
have a source telling us from
the Obama White

06:14.540 --> 06:18.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House that, in fact, President
Obama, that
it wasn't just about Michael
Flynn being a

06:18.578 --> 06:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
critic of his, but, from their
perspective,
that they Michael Flynn as
someone who was

06:22.448 --> 06:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
erratic, and a bad manager and
shouldn't continue
in government.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, well,
on that note,
let's pick up with Julie Pace.

06:28.121 --> 06:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Julie, you did some reporting
going into the
weekend about the Trump
transition team coming

06:34.761 --> 06:42.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Obama team during that --
during the
transition last November with
questions, and

06:42.034 --> 06:43.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what was the significance of all
that?

06:43.536 --> 06:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE PACE, Associated Press:
Right.

06:45.204 --> 06:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that what this shows is
just the depths
of the concerns about Mike
Flynn.

06:48.741 --> 06:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had people who were working
for the Trump
transition team after the
election who were

06:53.946 --> 06:58.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerned that Mike Flynn, who
was going to
be having a conversation with
the Russian

06:58.684 --> 07:02.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ambassador -- that wasn't
unusual -- as national
security adviser, you would be
talking to

07:02.989 --> 07:08.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a foreign counterpart -- but
that Mike Flynn
did not really understand the
potential motivations

07:08.127 --> 07:13.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Sergey Kislyak, the Russian
envoy, that
he might not understand rumored
ties that

07:13.166 --> 07:15.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Kislyak had to Russian
intelligence.

07:15.134 --> 07:21.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, what the transition
officials were seeking
is a classified CIA biography on
the Russian

07:21.240 --> 07:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ambassador that would give U.S.
intelligence
assessments about the envoy.

07:26.179 --> 07:30.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And for the Obama
administration, this raised
red flags, because it showed
that within Trump's

07:30.349 --> 07:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own team, there were concerns
about Flynn's
ability to handle what's an
incredibly sensitive

07:36.122 --> 07:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and high-pressure job that
involves an enormous
amount of contact with foreign
officials,

07:41.027 --> 07:43.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both friendly officials and
adversaries.

07:43.062 --> 07:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Julie, you
-- to move
beyond that, you have learned a
lot more about

07:48.201 --> 07:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the Obama team was thinking
during the
transition, how they grew
increasingly concerned

07:53.639 --> 07:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about what they were learning.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIE PACE: Right.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a growing concern
within the Obama
administration on a number of
fronts.

08:00.313 --> 08:05.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had Mike Flynn, who was
going in for his
meetings with his counterparts
in the Obama

08:05.418 --> 08:09.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration, and they would
talk about
Russia, and he would
essentially, I'm told,

08:09.589 --> 08:12.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dismiss Russia as a threat to
the United States.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That raised some concern.

08:14.660 --> 08:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had worries about handling
of sensitive
administration, documents that
the Obama administration

08:20.099 --> 08:22.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was turning over to the Trump
team.

08:22.368 --> 08:26.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was some concern that
those documents
were being copied and removed
from secure

08:26.205 --> 08:28.040 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rooms.

08:28.074 --> 08:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you saw the Obama team
limiting the amount
of information they were letting
outside the

08:31.110 --> 08:32.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

08:32.912 --> 08:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it really comes all at a
time when U.S.
also intelligence is starting to
gather more

08:37.617 --> 08:43.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information that some officials
believe shows
more ties between the Trump
campaign and Trump

08:43.890 --> 08:46.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
associates and Russia's meddling
in the elections.

08:46.492 --> 08:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, taken together from the
perspective of
Obama officials, this really
created a troubling

08:51.264 --> 08:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
picture of the Trump team's ties
to Russia.

08:54.166 --> 08:59.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Julie, in
other words, the ending of the
Obama administration

08:59.272 --> 09:02.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a pretty fraught frame of
mind over all
this?

09:02.575 --> 09:04.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIE PACE: Absolutely.

09:04.243 --> 09:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have seen that almost
continue, particularly
when it comes to Mike Flynn.

09:07.813 --> 09:13.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The revelations today, I don't
think are coincidental
that the Obama team felt the
need to get out

09:13.152 --> 09:18.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there that the outgoing
president was delivering
a personal warning to his
successor about

09:18.624 --> 09:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his likely choice for national
security adviser.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When you think about that,
that's quite extraordinary.

09:23.229 --> 09:29.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would expect presidents to
be giving their
successors advice perhaps on
policy.

09:29.135 --> 09:34.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to give a specific warning
about a potential
personnel pick really is
extraordinary.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Remarkable
reporting.

09:37.276 --> 09:42.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Julie Pace of the AP and our own
Lisa Desjardins,
we thank you both.

09:42.648 --> 09:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be discussing
Russia's meddling
with a former Justice Department
official

09:46.819 --> 09:49.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right after our news summary.

09:49.589 --> 09:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: A
federal appeals
court in Richmond, Virginia,
heard arguments

09:53.326 --> 09:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over President Trump's revised
travel ban.

09:55.995 --> 10:00.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first time it's been
scrutinized
at the appellate level since the
ban was reworked

10:00.533 --> 10:02.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in March.

10:02.368 --> 10:07.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judges are examining a
ruling that blocks
the administration from
suspending new visas

10:07.239 --> 10:10.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for people from six
Muslim-majority countries.

10:10.443 --> 10:15.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, at today's Senate
hearing in Washington,
former acting Attorney General
Sally Yates

10:15.948 --> 10:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took heat from Republicans for
refusing to
carry out the president's
original executive

10:21.020 --> 10:21.988 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The move ultimately led to her
firing.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.391 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:25.424 --> 10:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas: I find
it enormously
disappointing that you would
countermand the

10:29.261 --> 10:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
executive order of the president
of the United
States because you happened to
disagree with

10:32.431 --> 10:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it as a policy matter.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SALLY YATES, Former Acting U.S.
Attorney General:
I looked at this.

10:35.134 --> 10:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I made a determination that I
believed it
was unlawful.

10:37.870 --> 10:42.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also thought that it was
inconsistent with
the principles of the Department
of Justice,

10:42.675 --> 10:43.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and I said no.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what I promised you I
would do.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's what I did.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will have
excerpts from
today's appeals court hearing in
Richmond

10:50.683 --> 10:53.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
later in the program.

10:53.085 --> 10:57.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump is now working
to put his
own stamp on the nation's
federal court system.

10:57.356 --> 11:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, he released a slate of 10
conservative
judicial nominees.

11:01.827 --> 11:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More will be announced in the
months to come,
with more than 120 vacancies
still in need

11:07.266 --> 11:08.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of being filled.

11:08.701 --> 11:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of his judicial nominees
will require
Senate confirmation.

11:12.972 --> 11:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In France, president-elect
Emmanuel Macron
appeared alongside his
predecessor a day after

11:18.778 --> 11:22.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a resounding victory over rival
Marine Le
Pen.

11:22.982 --> 11:27.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Macron and Francois Hollande
presented a united
front at a ceremony marking the
end of World

11:27.687 --> 11:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
War II at the Tomb of the
Unknown Soldier
in Paris.

11:31.524 --> 11:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
that election,
and what a Macron presidency may
mean for

11:36.462 --> 11:38.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Europe, later in the program.

11:38.597 --> 11:44.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Pentagon officials have
confirmed that a military
raid last month killed the
leader of the Islamic

11:44.470 --> 11:46.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
State's affiliate in
Afghanistan.

11:46.806 --> 11:52.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The joint Afghan and U.S.
operation targeted
the eastern province of
Nangarhar.

11:52.078 --> 11:55.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Two U.S. Army Rangers also died.

11:55.347 --> 12:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon said that Abdul
Haseeb Logari
ordered a March attack on a
hospital in Kabul

12:01.821 --> 12:05.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that killed or wounded more than
100 people.

12:05.891 --> 12:10.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former President Barack Obama is
urging members
of Congress to look beyond party
lines when

12:11.030 --> 12:13.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it comes to the future of health
care.

12:13.065 --> 12:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Obama weighed in on the
issue last night
after receiving the John F.
Kennedy Profile

12:18.237 --> 12:20.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Courage Award in Boston.

12:20.272 --> 12:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first time he's spoken
out since
the Republican-led House voted
Thursday to

12:25.244 --> 12:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
repeal his Affordable Care Act.

12:27.313 --> 12:30.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, Former President
of the United
States: It actually doesn't take
a lot of

12:30.382 --> 12:38.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courage to aid those who are
already powerful,
already comfortable, already
influential.

12:38.591 --> 12:46.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it does require some courage
to champion
the vulnerable and the sick.

12:46.565 --> 12:51.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The GOP's
Obamacare replacement
faces a more uncertain fate in
the Senate,

12:51.270 --> 12:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where it's expected to undergo
major revisions.

12:54.540 --> 12:59.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas Governor Greg Abbott has
signed a law
banning so-called sanctuary city
policies

12:59.845 --> 13:01.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in his state.

13:01.714 --> 13:07.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The measure allows Texas police
officers to
question the legal status of
anyone they stop.

13:07.119 --> 13:12.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sheriffs who don't comply with
federal immigration
agents could face jail time.

13:12.491 --> 13:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abbott gave no advance notice
before signing
the bill on Facebook Live last
night.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It goes into effect September 1.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

13:21.700 --> 13:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG ABBOTT (R), Texas: Elected
officials
and law enforcement agencies
don't get to

13:26.438 --> 13:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pick and choose which laws they
will obey.

13:30.910 --> 13:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are consequences, deadly
consequences,
to not enforcing the law.

13:35.548 --> 13:39.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Trump
administration has
threatened to withhold federal
funding from

13:39.718 --> 13:41.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sanctuary cities.

13:41.620 --> 13:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country's largest TV station
operator,
Sinclair Broadcast Group, has
agreed to buy

13:47.459 --> 13:49.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rival Tribune Media.

13:49.762 --> 13:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The deal is valued at $3.9
billion, but is
still subject to regulatory
approval.

13:56.368 --> 14:01.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If approved, Sinclair would own
more than
200 stations nationwide.

14:01.907 --> 14:04.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And trading was light on Wall
Street today.

14:04.043 --> 14:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained five
points to close at 21012.

14:08.380 --> 14:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly two
points and the
S&amp;P 500 added a fraction of a
point.

14:14.386 --> 14:19.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a former
Justice Department official
weighs in on the

14:19.625 --> 14:26.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia investigation hearing; a
tough road
ahead for France's newly elected
president;

14:26.565 --> 14:34.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arguments for and against
President Trump's
travel ban in court; and much
more.

14:34.607 --> 14:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With us now to discuss today's
congressional
testimonies and the ongoing
investigation

14:47.052 --> 14:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into Russia's interference in
November's presidential
election is John Carlin.

14:52.291 --> 14:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served as assistant attorney
general for
national security from 2014
until October

14:57.997 --> 14:59.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of last year.

14:59.932 --> 15:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now an attorney in private
practice specializing
in cyber-security and crisis
management.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Carlin, welcome to the
"NewsHour."

15:06.305 --> 15:08.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN, Former Justice
Department Official:
Thank you.

15:08.073 --> 15:11.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you listened
to much of
today's hearing, the senators
questioning

15:11.510 --> 15:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the former acting Attorney
General Sally Yates,
the former head of national
intelligence,

15:15.748 --> 15:18.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Director of National
Intelligence Mr. Clapper.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did you mainly take away
from today?

15:20.552 --> 15:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, this one
thing I heard
was a career department official
describing

15:26.492 --> 15:30.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
handling a situation exactly the
way we have
handled numerous other
counterintelligence

15:30.896 --> 15:32.831 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigations.

15:32.865 --> 15:39.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, highly unusual that
the individual
who is having secret with
Russians and essentially

15:39.171 --> 15:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not telling his bosses is the
actual national
security adviser.

15:44.310 --> 15:50.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you can see why we take that
type of situation
very seriously, even when it's a
much lower-ranking

15:50.582 --> 15:53.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
official who possesses access to
our nation's
secrets.

15:53.752 --> 15:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for the national security
adviser to secretly
be having conversations with
Russian officials,

15:59.091 --> 16:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not telling the vice president
of the United
States, I can't imagine a
situation which

16:04.029 --> 16:08.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would cause more alarm for the
career counterintelligence
officials.

16:08.934 --> 16:12.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, how --
it's just a
natural question.

16:12.404 --> 16:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How unusual is a situation like
this?

16:14.840 --> 16:20.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, in some ways,
it's usual,
insofar as the Russians are
constantly trying

16:20.846 --> 16:27.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to compromise officials, even
businessmen,
in order to gain access and be
able to gain

16:27.553 --> 16:28.520 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
secrets.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They think years in advance.

16:30.022 --> 16:32.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think about one of the cases we
prosecuted,
the Russian illegal case.

16:32.524 --> 16:37.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are people here under
nonofficial cover,
growing families inside the
United States,

16:37.963 --> 16:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to maybe be used in some later
date.

16:40.833 --> 16:45.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's incredibly unusual
here is that
it's one of the most important,
if not the

16:45.371 --> 16:50.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most important national security
figure in
our entire apparatus, the
national security

16:50.042 --> 16:51.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
adviser.

16:51.777 --> 16:55.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I know that
former Attorney
General Yates and I know
Director Clapper

16:55.914 --> 17:00.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couldn't answer -- at least they
said, in
a public setting, they couldn't
answer some

17:00.552 --> 17:02.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of these questions.

17:02.488 --> 17:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how much can be said about
how much actual
proof there is that there was
collusion between

17:08.127 --> 17:10.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Trump campaign and what the
Russians were
up to?

17:10.596 --> 17:13.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, that's not
something that
I can talk about here.

17:13.766 --> 17:19.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's important that that
be investigated
by those trained and sworn to do
those investigations

17:19.338 --> 17:22.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without fear or favor in a
nonpartisan way.

17:22.241 --> 17:26.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have every trust in the
FBI agents I
worked with in -- years and
following that

17:26.345 --> 17:27.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where it needs to go.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You do have trust
in them?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: I do.

17:30.282 --> 17:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have worked with those folks
both at the
FBI when I was chief staff to
Director Mueller,

17:32.818 --> 17:36.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and also with them as a
prosecutor at the
Justice Department, and the
career prosecutors

17:36.955 --> 17:39.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there, that these are people,
they don't care
about politics.

17:39.691 --> 17:43.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to follow the
evidence where
it leads and take it where it
needs to go.

17:44.029 --> 17:46.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That said, we have got to look
forward.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One reason it's important to
learn lessons
about what exactly what Russia
did in our

17:49.935 --> 17:53.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prior election is because we now
have heard
two more officials, along with
the current

17:53.572 --> 17:58.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director of the FBI and our top
-- the leader
of the National Security Agency,
say, Russia

17:58.844 --> 18:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to do this again in
2020, maybe as
soon as next year.

18:03.315 --> 18:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just saw the massive hacking
attacks on
the French elections.

18:06.652 --> 18:08.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're doing it now in Europe.

18:08.253 --> 18:09.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to change our policy.

18:10.022 --> 18:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what does it
say that the
-- I mean, we're going back over
what they

18:12.891 --> 18:14.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
talked about today.

18:14.693 --> 18:18.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then the acting attorney
general goes
to the White House, to the
president's legal

18:18.997 --> 18:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
counsel, and says, this is what
we think is
going on.

18:21.233 --> 18:26.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe that Mr. Flynn has --
General Flynn
has had these contacts with the
Russians.

18:26.271 --> 18:29.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We think he hasn't told the
truth to the vice
president.

18:29.141 --> 18:33.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the White House's
reaction after
a day or so is to say, you're
fired.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, what does that tell you?

18:35.047 --> 18:39.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, I can't talk
about what
was going on in the minds of the
White House

18:39.751 --> 18:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they got this extraordinary
briefing
that said their national
security adviser

18:43.722 --> 18:46.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was compromised by the Russians.

18:46.492 --> 18:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the fact is, he was fired
several weeks
later.

18:49.361 --> 18:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After that.

18:53.298 --> 18:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing that came up
today that
I want to ask you about is the
questions from

18:58.270 --> 19:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several senators to the acting
-- Sally Yates,
then acting attorney general,
about why it

19:04.209 --> 19:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would matter that someone in the
White House,
one White House official didn't
tell the truth

19:09.948 --> 19:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to another White House official.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, you know,
they're new in
their positions.

19:14.653 --> 19:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I guess it's good that they
asked the
questions and received the
answers from the

19:20.859 --> 19:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
career law enforcement national
security officials
about why that is important, at
least when

19:26.698 --> 19:32.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the issue is that someone is
lying about contacts
with the Russians and what
Russians -- Russian

19:32.070 --> 19:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence services have done
with that
type of information in the past
and how they

19:36.408 --> 19:38.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
use it to compromise
individuals.

19:38.043 --> 19:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Final question.

19:39.945 --> 19:45.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there were an instance
ongoing today -- and
we don't know this at all to be
the case -- of

19:45.317 --> 19:48.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
someone in the administration
talking to the
Russians, the intelligence
community finds

19:48.820 --> 19:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out about it, tries to warn the
White House,
is it possible for the White
House to ignore

19:54.126 --> 19:59.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it and to say, we don't want the
hear that
information, you're fired, or is
it going

19:59.231 --> 20:02.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get the attention of the
people it needs
to -- it needs to?

20:02.234 --> 20:06.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, we can only
hope that it
will get the attention that it
needs to.

20:06.705 --> 20:11.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is why it's important in
a nonpartisan
way, while we have senators like
Graham and

20:11.710 --> 20:15.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the White House working
together, Senator
Grassley, I think, asked
appropriately, both

20:15.981 --> 20:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officials today, and said, what
are the lessons
that we have learned?

20:19.518 --> 20:20.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are they coming again?

20:20.719 --> 20:22.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said, yes, the Russians are
coming again.

20:22.654 --> 20:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to harden our state
systems.

20:24.723 --> 20:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to have public hearings
like this
to educate the American people
on how the

20:28.093 --> 20:33.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russians are using fake news
essentially to
try to influence elections.

20:33.665 --> 20:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need to do more to deter
them, working
with our allies to cause pain to
them to make

20:39.671 --> 20:42.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them rethink this tactic of
trying to undermine
democracy.

20:42.507 --> 20:47.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Carlin,
former assistant
attorney general, we thank you
very much.

20:47.546 --> 20:54.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: Thank you.

20:54.653 --> 21:03.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: France
elects a new president,
after the most closely watched
and divisive

21:03.662 --> 21:05.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign there in decades.

21:06.031 --> 21:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports
from Paris.

21:09.234 --> 21:15.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Emmanuel Macron
left his
home in Paris this morning
absorbing the reality

21:15.307 --> 21:18.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he is France's youngest
national leader
since Napoleon.

21:18.677 --> 21:20.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMMANUEL MACRON, French
President-Elect (through
translator): I will serve you
with humility,

21:20.579 --> 21:22.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with force.

21:22.080 --> 21:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will serve you in the name of
our motto,
liberty, equality, fraternity.

21:27.853 --> 21:32.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Macron overcame
Marine Le
Pen's brand of nationalist
populism and weathered

21:32.724 --> 21:37.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a suspected Russian hacking
attack on his
campaign that dumped reams of
internal e-mail

21:37.996 --> 21:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hours before voting began.

21:39.665 --> 21:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will be inaugurated as
France's 25th president
on Sunday.

21:44.403 --> 21:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even though he won 66
percent of the vote,
analysts said it could not be
regarded as

21:49.107 --> 21:50.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an overwhelming mandate.

21:50.809 --> 21:56.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Out of a possible electorate of
47 million,
only 20 million people voted for
Emmanuel

21:57.015 --> 21:58.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Macron.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of those did so tactically
just to keep
Le Pen out.

22:01.586 --> 22:06.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Macron could face a highly
troublesome five
years in the presidential
palace.

22:06.692 --> 22:11.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Analyst Pascal Boniface says the
struggles
could start early, if Macron
fails to get

22:11.363 --> 22:13.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a majority in the French
National Assembly.

22:13.198 --> 22:18.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PASCAL BONIFACE, Analyst
(through translator):
He has to create very soon a
huge movement

22:18.270 --> 22:20.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and to find a majority.

22:20.205 --> 22:24.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there is no majority in the
National Assembly,
he will be a president, but a
president with

22:24.976 --> 22:26.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few power.

22:26.478 --> 22:29.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Congratulatory
messages came
from across Europe today.

22:29.381 --> 22:34.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
offered his,
calling on Macron to -- quote --
"overcome

22:34.186 --> 22:36.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mutual mistrust."

22:36.088 --> 22:38.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Members of the European Union
expressed relief.

22:38.724 --> 22:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
German Chancellor Angela Merkel
said she was
delighted.

22:41.526 --> 22:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): He ran a
courageous, pro-European

22:47.699 --> 22:48.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He stands for openness to the
world.

22:50.502 --> 22:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Boniface says
Macron has
to deal with the fact that 40
percent of the

22:54.239 --> 22:57.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
French electorate are
dissatisfied with the
E.U.

22:57.075 --> 23:02.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PASCAL BONIFACE: If Macron wants
to succeed,
if he wants to make good
reforms, he must

23:02.881 --> 23:05.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
avoid to have demonstrations in
the streets.

23:05.417 --> 23:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a psychological and
political walk
to do to show that Europe is not
only for

23:10.655 --> 23:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the elite, but also for ordinary
people.

23:12.691 --> 23:16.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But there were
demonstrations
in the streets today.

23:16.628 --> 23:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Activists and union members
protested in Paris
against Macron's proposed labor
reforms.

23:22.033 --> 23:25.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some clashed with police, who
made a number
of arrests.

23:25.470 --> 23:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a starkly different scene
yesterday,
as Macron supporters sprinted
towards the

23:31.042 --> 23:34.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Louvre to catch the announcement
of his victory.

23:34.479 --> 23:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France's ethnic minorities, who
feared the
anti-immigrant Le Pen, were
jubilant.

23:41.553 --> 23:46.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This Macron supporter repeated
"Thank God"
in Arabic.

23:46.591 --> 23:51.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Marine Le Pen is a dinosaur,"
this woman
chanted.

23:51.930 --> 23:58.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: In terms of economy,
social cohesion,
everything, I mean, she was bad.

23:58.403 --> 24:00.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we're really happy today.

24:00.338 --> 24:07.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: There is so many people
who didn't
know Emmanuel Macron since one
year, and now

24:07.279 --> 24:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's the president of the
republic.

24:09.748 --> 24:14.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Macron's win
was particularly
sweet for the Avaaz
Internet-based advocacy

24:14.286 --> 24:18.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group which has been campaigning
in Europe
against right-wing nationalists.

24:18.290 --> 24:22.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Avaaz member Joseph Huff Hannon
points to
the effect of President Trump,
who called

24:22.561 --> 24:24.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to congratulate Macron this
morning.

24:24.362 --> 24:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH HUFF HANNON, Avaaz: The
last 100 days
or so has probably been a pretty
incredible

24:28.400 --> 24:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cautionary tale from what French
people could
come to expect from a faux
populist, somebody

24:33.638 --> 24:39.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who kind of says, I'm going to
transform the
country and improve your lives,
without offering

24:39.478 --> 24:41.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
any specific policies.

24:41.346 --> 24:45.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Hannon also
believes Macron's
victory signals that right-wing
nationalism

24:45.450 --> 24:50.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is on the wane in Europe, and
portends well
for the election later this year
in Germany.

24:50.789 --> 24:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France's new president, a man
with precious
little experience of government,
inherits

24:55.360 --> 24:57.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a country under a state of
emergency.

24:57.395 --> 25:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although he has tapped into a
rich seam of
enthusiasm amongst young French
people, his

25:02.734 --> 25:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
victory has brought little joy
to much of
the nation.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he now has to deliver on his
promise to
unite the country.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Paris.

25:12.244 --> 25:17.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on the
election of
Emmanuel Macron, and what his
election represents,

25:17.082 --> 25:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke a short time ago with
the French ambassador
to the United States, Gerard
Araud.

25:23.421 --> 25:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ambassador Araud, thank you very
much for
joining us.

25:25.924 --> 25:33.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even though we know Mr.
Macron won 66
percent of the vote, we also
know that turnout

25:33.899 --> 25:38.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was down slightly from before,
that many French
citizens either stayed home or
didn't express

25:38.637 --> 25:40.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a preference.

25:40.272 --> 25:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just what is the support for Mr.
Macron right
now?

25:43.241 --> 25:44.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD, French Ambassador
to the United
States: So, we have to
understand that the

25:44.910 --> 25:50.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
situation was totally
unprecedented.

25:50.215 --> 25:54.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two main -- the two parties,
the Socialist
on one side, the Conservative
party on the

25:54.319 --> 25:59.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other side, actually had been
defeated in
the first round of the election,
which means

25:59.157 --> 26:04.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, on the second round, you
had basically
Madam Le Pen and Monsieur
Macron, who have

26:04.296 --> 26:06.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
never been elected.

26:06.197 --> 26:11.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even for Mr. Macron was
running for the
first time, running for office.

26:11.069 --> 26:16.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it means that for some French
electors,
especially electors from the
Socialist Party

26:16.541 --> 26:22.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or from the Conservative Party,
really, they
felt to be excluded of this
run-off.

26:22.881 --> 26:27.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they decided that either
they were going
to stay home or they were going
not to express

26:27.886 --> 26:29.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a preference.

26:29.054 --> 26:32.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so how
divided is France
still?

26:32.657 --> 26:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were telling me, with the
parliamentary
elections coming, it's really
unclear that

26:36.461 --> 26:38.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Macron is going to have a
majority.

26:38.263 --> 26:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: Well, we have
never had such
a situation, I guess, in the
French political

26:43.868 --> 26:45.537 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

26:45.570 --> 26:50.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You have Mr. Macron, who
basically didn't
have a political party a few
months ago, yet

26:50.542 --> 26:55.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has created one, who didn't have
any member
of the parliament supporting
him.

26:55.580 --> 26:58.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we have the general
elections coming on
June 11 and 18.

26:58.650 --> 27:05.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for him, it will be quite a
challenge
to get a majority in a new
parliament.

27:05.890 --> 27:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, where is
France left then
with the Marine Le Pen brand of
populist nationalism?

27:13.064 --> 27:14.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it gone?

27:14.199 --> 27:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Has it just receded for a short
time?

27:17.268 --> 27:19.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see that?

27:19.070 --> 27:22.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: No, actually, we
are facing
the same populist outburst, the
same rebellion

27:22.907 --> 27:27.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of some of our voters that you
have been facing
during the last presidential
election in the

27:27.812 --> 27:32.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. or that our British friends
have been
facing during the Brexit
referendum.

27:32.651 --> 27:39.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this rebellion is not going
to fade away
if Mr. Macron and his government
are not responding

27:39.357 --> 27:41.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the concerns of these voters.

27:41.826 --> 27:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in a sense, we have five
years left to
avoid a final victory of
populism.

27:48.066 --> 27:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do these
voters want and
what does it mean for the
European Union?

27:52.837 --> 27:58.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, France stays in the
European Union,
but is that a secure decision,
do you think?

27:58.343 --> 28:04.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: I think that a lot
of French,
like a lot of American voters,
feel frightened

28:04.949 --> 28:06.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by globalization.

28:06.818 --> 28:13.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in this country,
globalization, really,
basically is put -- in the eyes
of the voters,

28:13.391 --> 28:16.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the responsible are Wall Street
or Washington,
D.C.

28:16.861 --> 28:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Europe, globalization is seen
as the fact
of Brussels, of the European
Union.

28:22.767 --> 28:28.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, fighting for -- against
globalization
means for a lot of French
fighting against

28:28.073 --> 28:29.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the European Union.

28:29.841 --> 28:36.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in a sense, if you reassure
the French
voters about their life in a
global world,

28:36.548 --> 28:41.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, really, I think that
the question
of the European Union will be
solved.

28:41.986 --> 28:46.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So we know
President Trump
was saying pretty favorable
things about Marine

28:46.558 --> 28:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Le Pen during the campaign, but
he has now
called Mr. Macron to
congratulate him.

28:51.896 --> 28:56.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How would you describe the
relationship right
now between the U.S. and France
with Mr. Macron's...

28:56.534 --> 28:58.336 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

28:58.369 --> 29:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: For the moment,
the relationship
between our two countries is
excellent, for

29:01.106 --> 29:07.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a simple reason is that, once
more, our soldiers
are fighting together side by
side against

29:07.278 --> 29:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
international terrorism in
Africa or in the
Levant against ISIS.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I think it's quite
important.

29:15.186 --> 29:20.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first time I met Secretary
Mattis, immediately,
he told me: The French are our
best allies.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that is the most
important.

29:22.527 --> 29:27.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Mr.
Ambassador, Mr.
Macron had very -- relatively
little to say

29:27.398 --> 29:32.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during the campaign about
foreign policy,
about his view of the world.

29:32.337 --> 29:33.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is known about that?

29:33.905 --> 29:35.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does he see France's role?

29:35.707 --> 29:40.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: Well, first, I
think -- and
that was quite important in our
times of euro

29:40.245 --> 29:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
skepticism -- is really a truly
European.

29:44.315 --> 29:48.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants to -- in a sense to
move forward
into European integration.

29:48.920 --> 29:55.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, his first visit will be
Berlin, where
he is going to meet Chancellor
Merkel.

29:55.827 --> 30:00.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am quite sure that they
are going to
speak about the next steps in
our European

30:00.632 --> 30:01.599 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
endeavor.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a visit to
the U.S.?

30:03.434 --> 30:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: Actually, he will
meet President
Trump on the margin of the NATO
summit on

30:08.940 --> 30:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
May 25 in a few weeks, because
President Trump
will be in Brussels and they
agreed to have

30:16.281 --> 30:18.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bilateral meetings in Brussels.

30:18.082 --> 30:21.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there is some
reporting
that you may be called to serve
in the Macron

30:21.152 --> 30:22.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GERARD ARAUD: My fate is in the
hands of God.

30:24.189 --> 30:25.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:25.190 --> 30:26.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK.

30:26.191 --> 30:27.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ambassador Gerard Araud, thank
you very much.

30:27.458 --> 30:32.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GERARD ARAUD: Thank you.

30:32.096 --> 30:43.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump's
travel ban
got its first federal appeals
court review

30:43.808 --> 30:45.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

30:45.577 --> 30:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The arguments mark the biggest
test yet for
the president's revised
executive order to

30:49.280 --> 30:54.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suspend travel to the U.S. for
people from
six majority-Muslim countries.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that story.

30:56.421 --> 31:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At the center
of today's
arguments before the Fourth
Circuit is whether

31:00.191 --> 31:04.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president's second executive
order is
motivated by national security
concerns, or

31:04.963 --> 31:08.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether it discriminates against
Muslims,
which would be unconstitutional.

31:08.900 --> 31:13.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among other issues, the judges
will also decide
whether the president's own
words about Muslims

31:13.471 --> 31:15.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can be used against him.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here's an example from a
campaign rally in
December of 2015.

31:17.575 --> 31:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Donald J. Trump is calling for a
total and

31:21.746 --> 31:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complete shutdown of Muslims
entering the
United States until our
country's representatives

31:28.987 --> 31:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can figure out what the hell is
going on.

31:33.191 --> 31:35.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

31:35.093 --> 31:37.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: To go through
today's arguments,
I'm joined by Marcia Coyle,
chief Washington

31:38.029 --> 31:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
correspondent for "The National
Law Journal,"
and a "NewsHour" regular.

31:41.332 --> 31:42.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome back.

31:42.500 --> 31:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Thank you.

31:43.868 --> 31:45.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, you heard
what I said
at the introduction.

31:45.303 --> 31:47.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that roughly the contours of
this?

31:47.572 --> 31:50.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president is arguing, this
was all about
national security.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His critics are saying, no, it's
religious
discrimination.

31:53.278 --> 31:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: In fact, not just
his critics,
but the lower federal district
court in this

31:57.482 --> 32:04.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particular case found that the
primary purpose
of the order wasn't national
security, that

32:04.923 --> 32:10.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a secondary purpose, that
this was a Muslim
ban and that there was a
violation of the

32:10.762 --> 32:12.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First Amendment's Establishment
Clause.

32:12.964 --> 32:19.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that is what we -- as we go
into the federal
appellate court here today, the
argument breaks

32:19.971 --> 32:21.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
down in two ways.

32:21.739 --> 32:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government is still going to
argue that
this is national security, and
it's relying

32:26.444 --> 32:32.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heavily on a Supreme Court case
from a number
of years back in which the court
said, if

32:32.483 --> 32:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president has a legitimate
and bona fide
reason for his or her decision
about how to

32:41.726 --> 32:47.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
permit or disallow the entry of
aliens into
this country, that's it, that's
sufficient.

32:47.598 --> 32:52.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the government's lawyer said
that there
is a legitimate and bona fide
reason here,

32:52.570 --> 32:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national security, and so,
court, your job
ends basically there.

32:57.375 --> 32:59.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's
listen to one
of these clips.

32:59.210 --> 33:04.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Judge Keenan having a
discussion with
Jeffrey Wall, who is
representing the Trump

33:04.148 --> 33:05.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

33:05.950 --> 33:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDGE BARBARA MILANO KEENAN,
Fourth Circuit
Court of Appeals: What in the
text -- I'm

33:06.851 --> 33:08.619 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
looking for it.

33:08.653 --> 33:14.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What in the text of Executive
Order Number
2 supports the conclusion that
these aliens

33:14.692 --> 33:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from these countries, these 82
million people,
would be detrimental to the
interests of the

33:20.098 --> 33:21.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States?

33:21.866 --> 33:22.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY WALL, Acting United
States Solicitor
General: I don't think what the
president

33:22.867 --> 33:24.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was saying was, I know them all
to be dangerous.

33:24.736 --> 33:26.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was saying, I'm not certain
here.

33:26.971 --> 33:32.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he said is, I find that it
would be detrimental
to letting people from countries
we know to

33:32.677 --> 33:37.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be dangerous, that have
deteriorated over
time, until I have had a chance,
working with

33:37.515 --> 33:41.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my Cabinet officials, to assess
the vetting
procedures for those countries.

33:41.352 --> 33:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, it would be detrimental
in the face
of that uncertainty.

33:44.889 --> 33:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a reasonable finding,
one that an
executive branch official could
draw.

33:48.726 --> 33:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is no question
that it should
survive rational basis review.

33:52.163 --> 33:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, Marcia,
that's the argument
the administration has been
making all along,

33:56.234 --> 33:59.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president has authority
and that
this is in the interest of the
country.

33:59.637 --> 34:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right.

34:01.172 --> 34:04.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the government doesn't see
any violation
of the Establishment Clause.

34:05.009 --> 34:11.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, as we all know,
the Establishment
Clause doesn't permit the
government to disfavor

34:11.649 --> 34:13.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
religion.

34:13.518 --> 34:16.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government's attorney today
said that
there was nothing in this order
that had anything

34:16.687 --> 34:22.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do with religion, and that
the president,
even though he had made earlier
statements

34:22.660 --> 34:29.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about a Muslim ban, had
clarified his position
later after he took the oath of
office to

34:29.567 --> 34:33.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insist that he's talking about
terrorism and
territories, not religion.

34:33.938 --> 34:36.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In fact, there
was a very
interesting moment today in the
hearing where

34:36.874 --> 34:42.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a judge asked, let's just say
the president
had taken back some of those
comments about

34:42.180 --> 34:43.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Muslims.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Would this be allowable?

34:44.182 --> 34:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's listen to that clip.

34:46.050 --> 34:48.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDGE ROBERT KING, Fourth
Circuit Court of
Appeals: The president
repudiated his statements

34:48.286 --> 34:51.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in campaign and post-election
about the Muslim
ban.

34:51.856 --> 34:54.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What if he repudiated them all?

34:54.826 --> 34:57.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OMAR JADWAT, ACLU: I think that
would be significant,
Your Honor.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It would be a significant fact.

34:59.197 --> 35:00.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't know whether...

35:00.865 --> 35:03.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDGE DENNIS SHEDD, Fourth
Circuit Court of
Appeals: Would that change the
result?

35:03.468 --> 35:09.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OMAR JADWAT: I think a simple
repudiation
might not -- no, wouldn't change
the result.

35:09.373 --> 35:10.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDGE DENNIS SHEDD: Let me
follow up, then.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What if he says he's sorry every
day for a
year?

35:13.077 --> 35:14.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:14.078 --> 35:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDGE DENNIS SHEDD: Would that
do it for you?

35:15.913 --> 35:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OMAR JADWAT: Here's the issue,
Your Honor,
is that what the Establishment
Clause prohibits

35:19.617 --> 35:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is targeting and denigrating a
religion.

35:23.821 --> 35:26.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At a minimum, that's what it
prohibits.

35:26.657 --> 35:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the question is, would
reasonable people
see what he was doing in total
as achieving

35:35.166 --> 35:36.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that effect?

35:36.934 --> 35:38.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDGE DENNIS SHEDD: So, you say
reasonable
people would say he doesn't
really mean it

35:38.469 --> 35:40.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when he says he's sorry?

35:40.037 --> 35:45.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OMAR JADWAT: Your Honor, I think
it's possible
that saying sorry is not enough.

35:45.843 --> 35:53.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: This, again, is an
exchange
between judges, but, this time,
with the lawyer

35:53.251 --> 35:57.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the challengers to the
order, the ACLU's
lawyer.

35:57.355 --> 36:03.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is saying, basically,
look, you have
to look at the evidence in this
particular

36:03.361 --> 36:05.229 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case.

36:05.263 --> 36:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ACLU believes that this
wasn't a national
security purpose, that this was
a Muslim ban,

36:10.601 --> 36:14.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and, because of that, a
violation of the Establishment
Clause.

36:14.071 --> 36:20.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the ACLU's lawyer told the
judges, there
are really three categories of
evidence you

36:20.077 --> 36:21.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should be looking at here.

36:21.546 --> 36:24.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, there is the order on its
face.

36:24.215 --> 36:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not facially legitimate, he
argued, because,
even though it names just six
countries, there

36:30.688 --> 36:35.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are other countries that have
been associated
and found to be associated with
terrorism

36:35.393 --> 36:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the United States that are
not on that
list.

36:38.429 --> 36:40.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is just Muslim countries.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secondly, there are the
president's statements.

36:43.768 --> 36:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as the ACLU lawyer said,
sometimes, saying
you're sorry is not enough.

36:48.906 --> 36:54.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These statements, he claims,
continued after
the president took the oath of
office.

36:54.412 --> 36:57.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it's not just campaign
statements.

36:57.315 --> 37:03.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the final category of
evidence, the
lawyer said, had to do with some
reports that

37:03.221 --> 37:08.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were leaked or released by the
Department
of Homeland Security that
basically said that

37:08.392 --> 37:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the order itself wouldn't
prevent terrorism
in the United States.

37:12.630 --> 37:18.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: How unusual is
this, Marcia,
to have the president's own
words, the words

37:18.202 --> 37:22.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his own administration come
back to be
used as evidence against them in
court?

37:22.440 --> 37:24.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, I think it's
quite unusual.

37:24.709 --> 37:30.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it obviously is an issue of
contention
among the various judges that
have had to

37:30.781 --> 37:33.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deal with this executive order.

37:33.551 --> 37:38.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, going forward,
whoever loses
either in this particular case
or in a case

37:38.956 --> 37:43.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Hawaii that will be heard in
another week,
and there are many other
challenges pending

37:43.661 --> 37:47.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the country, will take
the case to
the Supreme Court.

37:47.198 --> 37:52.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there, the Supreme Court
will again have
to deal with the relevance and
weight of the

37:52.737 --> 37:54.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president's statements.

37:54.572 --> 37:59.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ultimately, I think it will be
the Supreme
Court that will have to resolve
this tension.

37:59.076 --> 38:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this just to be judged on the
basis of
national security, or does the
religion clause

38:06.651 --> 38:08.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
jurisprudence come in as well?

38:08.686 --> 38:14.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Marcia Coyle,
as always,
thank you so much.

38:14.358 --> 38:21.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure.

38:21.165 --> 38:28.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When you go to
the doctor,
you often leave with a
prescription for medicine,

38:28.539 --> 38:34.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but some doctors are
experimenting with a
new kind of prescription, one
for fresh, healthy

38:34.278 --> 38:36.080 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
food.

38:36.113 --> 38:39.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as the trend grows, more
doctors and
health professionals are getting
more training

38:39.417 --> 38:41.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the kitchen.

38:41.052 --> 38:44.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Allison
Aubrey of NPR
News has the story.

38:44.922 --> 38:48.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We have the minerals and
grains that
are going to lower blood
pressure.

38:48.993 --> 38:55.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: At Casey Health
Institute
in Gaithersburg, Maryland, the
doctor is in,

38:55.633 --> 39:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but your appointment might just
be in the
kitchen.

39:01.305 --> 39:03.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is called the Physician's
Kitchen.

39:03.240 --> 39:07.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on this night, primary care
doctor Nicole
Farmer is prescribing food.

39:07.478 --> 39:09.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE FARMER, Primary Care
Physician: So,
you can see eating whole grains
actually is

39:11.382 --> 39:16.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going full circle in terms of
helping to control
diabetes and blood pressure, but
also prevent

39:16.554 --> 39:17.988 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it too.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: This doesn't
mean giving up
favorites, like pancakes.

39:20.491 --> 39:25.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, the goal here is to
make breakfast
foods healthier, using grains
like buckwheat

39:25.629 --> 39:26.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and millet.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.265 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE FARMER: I feel like it's
important
for me to spend my time here, in
addition

39:30.134 --> 39:31.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to being in the exam room.

39:31.936 --> 39:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I teach you how to cook,
you're going to
improve the types of food that
you eat, and

39:36.240 --> 39:39.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then ultimately that is what is
going to prevent
chronic disease for you.

39:39.543 --> 39:42.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: The most recent
evidence comes
from a study published in "The
Journal of

39:42.947 --> 39:44.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the American Medical
Association."

39:44.682 --> 39:49.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers found that, here in
the United
States, about one out of every
two deaths

39:49.387 --> 39:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from heart disease, stroke and
type 2 diabetes
is linked to a poor diet.

39:53.824 --> 39:56.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's 1,000 deaths every day.

39:56.727 --> 39:59.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paula Fischthal knows that all
too well.

39:59.797 --> 40:03.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her dad died early of a heart
attack, and
her mom had diabetes.

40:03.667 --> 40:07.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With this strong family history,
she was really
concerned.

40:07.171 --> 40:09.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's how she ended up here.

40:09.039 --> 40:12.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULA FISCHTHAL, Patient: When I
first came
here, Dr. Farmer diagnosed me
with pre-diabetes.

40:12.042 --> 40:14.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I really didn't want to take
medication.

40:14.278 --> 40:17.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Fischthal has
changed her
whole relationship with food.

40:17.982 --> 40:20.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She tossed out processed snacks,
and she's
cooking with fresh ingredients.

40:20.918 --> 40:26.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAULA FISCHTHAL: I have
gradually gotten rid
of the starch that goes with
dinner.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's more vegetables and
protein.

40:27.925 --> 40:30.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: She also started
taking yoga
classes.

40:30.528 --> 40:33.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And over the last year, she's
lost weight.

40:33.130 --> 40:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now her blood sugar has returned
to normal.

40:36.233 --> 40:39.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this means she's no longer
considered
to have pre-diabetes.

40:39.437 --> 40:45.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Her story fits with the
conclusion of the
most comprehensive study ever on
diabetes

40:45.409 --> 40:47.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prevention.

40:47.211 --> 40:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a federally funded study
carried out
by the National Institutes of
Health, with

40:50.614 --> 40:53.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
collaborators at 27 sites across
the country.

40:53.517 --> 40:58.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They found, when people change
their diet
to lose weight and become more
active, it

40:58.222 --> 41:02.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can be more effective than
medication in preventing
the disease.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dr. Farmer tells all her
patients about it.

41:05.062 --> 41:06.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

41:06.831 --> 41:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE FARMER: The diabetes
prevention study
taught medical science that we
don't need

41:09.333 --> 41:15.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to jump the gun when it comes to
prescribing
medications to prevent diabetes,
and that

41:15.306 --> 41:20.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most effective thing we can
do is to promote
a healthier diet and to promote
them to engage

41:20.644 --> 41:21.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in regular exercise.

41:22.012 --> 41:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The porridge could be a daytime
snack, if
you want it to.

41:25.182 --> 41:29.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: And meeting
patients here
in the kitchen, Farmer says, is
the best promotion.

41:29.620 --> 41:33.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea that you can bring
doctors and other
health care professionals into
the kitchen

41:33.858 --> 41:39.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to teach people that changing
their diets
can actually help them prevent
disease is

41:39.129 --> 41:40.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
starting to catch on.

41:40.931 --> 41:46.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Inside this stone fortress is
the Culinary
Institute of America's Napa
Valley campus.

41:46.036 --> 41:52.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, some 500 doctors and
health professionals
recently got a crash course in
how to build

41:52.176 --> 41:55.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
food and nutrition into their
medical practices.

41:55.746 --> 42:04.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They spent four days sauteeing,
slicing and
tasting.

42:04.922 --> 42:08.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's put on by the Harvard
School of Public
Health and the Culinary
Institute, as well

42:08.893 --> 42:12.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a few dozen food service
companies who
sponsor the event.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:14.164 --> 42:17.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID EISENBERG, Harvard School
of Public
Health: -At this conference, we
bring in some

42:17.234 --> 42:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the top nutrition scientists
in the world
to say, look, here's the
evidence that eating

42:22.039 --> 42:27.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these foods either keeps you
healthy or reduces
your risk of disease, whereas
eating these

42:27.745 --> 42:33.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foods really speeds up your risk
of disease,
heart disease, cancer, diabetes.

42:33.083 --> 42:37.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second,the chefs at the Culinary
Institute,
who are not just great chefs,
but great teachers,

42:37.521 --> 42:40.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, let me show you how to do
that.

42:40.057 --> 42:44.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Dr. David
Eisenberg from Harvard's
School of Public Health is
master of ceremonies

42:44.595 --> 42:46.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and founder of this event.

42:46.463 --> 42:49.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's called Healthy Kitchens,
Healthy Lives.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One thing he's trying to change
may be surprising.

42:51.969 --> 42:55.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most doctors, he says, aren't
taught much
at all about nutrition.

42:55.205 --> 42:57.007 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:57.041 --> 43:01.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID EISENBERG: Today, most
medical schools
in the United States teach less
than 25 hours

43:01.912 --> 43:04.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of nutrition over four years.

43:04.214 --> 43:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that less than 20
percent of medical
schools have a single required
course in nutrition,

43:10.087 --> 43:11.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's a scandal.

43:11.789 --> 43:12.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's outrageous.

43:12.957 --> 43:14.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's obscene.

43:14.625 --> 43:19.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Primary care
doctor Helen
Delichatsios is speaking at the
event.

43:19.563 --> 43:24.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's been teaching her patients
about nutrition
and cooking for seven years now,
at Massachusetts

43:24.101 --> 43:25.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
general hospital in Boston.

43:25.269 --> 43:26.904 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:26.937 --> 43:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HELEN DELICHATSIOS, Primary Care
Physician:
Many people come to their doctor
and have

43:28.305 --> 43:30.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high blood pressure and high
cholesterol.

43:30.274 --> 43:35.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One somewhat easy answer is to
send them away
with one prescription for their
blood pressure,

43:35.279 --> 43:39.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one prescription for their
diabetes, one prescription
for their cholesterol, when, in
reality, if

43:39.717 --> 43:43.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you work on the underlying root
problem, which
may be poor diet and physical
inactivity,

43:43.754 --> 43:48.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both of which are tied together,
fixing those
can address all of the concerns
at once.

43:48.459 --> 43:52.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Delichatsios has
figured out
how her practice can get
reimbursed for all

43:52.296 --> 43:54.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the cooking and nutrition
instruction.

43:54.531 --> 43:57.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And she's sharing this
information with other
doctors at the conference.

43:58.002 --> 44:02.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Joseph Wetterhahn's hospital
just installed
a teaching kitchen.

44:02.539 --> 44:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a primary care doctor in a
rural area
of Upstate New York.

44:05.676 --> 44:07.444 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH WETTERHAHN, Primary Care
Physician:
Part of our education here is,
they do teach

44:09.313 --> 44:13.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how to do the correct coding and
the correct
billing, so that you can do this
at a break-even.

44:13.851 --> 44:18.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: After attending
this conference
a few years back, Sanjeet
Baidwan was so inspired,

44:18.455 --> 44:24.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she convinced Yale Medical
School to let her
teach a new class called
Culinary Medicine.

44:24.395 --> 44:28.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a primary care doctor at
Yale's Medical
Center in New Haven,
Connecticut.

44:28.098 --> 44:29.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:29.867 --> 44:34.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANJEET BAIDWAN, Yale Medical
Center: When
dealing with medical school, I
often felt

44:34.271 --> 44:37.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that residents were
ill-equipped, or they
would say to me, well, I don't
know that.

44:37.107 --> 44:38.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe we should send them to a
nutritionist,
or would kind of maybe give some
really broad-stroke

44:38.108 --> 44:39.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nutrition information like off
the cuff.

44:40.010 --> 44:48.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would say that a lot of
patients come
in just really desperate for
good information,

44:48.986 --> 44:50.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good direction.

44:50.621 --> 44:52.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Eisenberg's
vision goes way
beyond just doctors in the
office.

44:52.990 --> 44:54.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:54.892 --> 44:58.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID EISENBERG: If we're going
to build teaching
kitchens in hospitals, maybe we
should also

44:58.696 --> 45:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think about building them in
K-12 schools,
and why stop there?

45:03.067 --> 45:07.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How about corporate workplaces
and retirement
communities?

45:07.604 --> 45:13.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: One of the
largest food service
companies in the world is
already on board.

45:13.410 --> 45:18.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Compass Group USA Runs food
services at schools,
nursing homes and corporate
offices.

45:18.549 --> 45:21.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're planning to build 20
teaching kitchens
this year.

45:21.585 --> 45:23.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:23.320 --> 45:25.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE FARMER: We have the
polyphenols in
grains that are going to lower
pressure.

45:25.122 --> 45:29.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALLISON AUBREY: Back in
Gaithersburg, Maryland,
physician Nicole Farmer says one
stumbling

45:29.393 --> 45:31.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
block for her patients can be
cost.

45:31.995 --> 45:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she shows them that healthy
choices aren't
necessarily more expensive.

45:35.899 --> 45:37.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:37.267 --> 45:41.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICOLE FARMER: We got a whole
bag of millet
for less than $2.

45:41.572 --> 45:45.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this contains about three to
four servings,
so about enough for three to
four meals.

45:45.409 --> 45:46.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: So, what about
this farro
here?

45:46.744 --> 45:49.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a little bit pricier
than a brown
rice, right?

45:49.646 --> 45:51.448 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:51.482 --> 45:54.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICOLE FARMER: So, a box of
farro will cost
about the same price as a
good-quality brown

45:54.118 --> 45:55.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Rice.

45:55.953 --> 45:57.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Farmer says you
may have to
shop around a little bit or go
online to buy

45:57.955 --> 46:02.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these grains, but they are
available, including
in stores that accept SNAP
benefits, or food

46:02.993 --> 46:04.762 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stamps.

46:04.795 --> 46:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the last decade, Eisenberg
says he has
watched as this movement has
started to take

46:08.999 --> 46:09.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
off.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:11.335 --> 46:12.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID EISENBERG: There are now
hundreds of
teaching kitchens.

46:12.703 --> 46:18.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the idea has found
receptivity
across the country.

46:18.142 --> 46:20.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have now got Cleveland
Clinic.

46:20.277 --> 46:22.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have got Kaiser Permanente.

46:22.045 --> 46:27.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have got Harvard, and
Princeton, and the
University of Texas, and 20
other university

46:27.217 --> 46:32.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
systems making this available to
their patients
or their trainees.

46:32.256 --> 46:39.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: I'm Allison
Aubrey of NPR
News for the "PBS NewsHour" in
Napa Valley,

46:39.463 --> 46:41.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
California.

46:41.231 --> 46:46.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online, if you're
looking for
healthy recipes approved by both
chefs and

46:46.470 --> 46:48.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doctors, we have some for you to
try.

46:48.172 --> 46:54.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can find five ideas at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

46:54.578 --> 47:07.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight, our Politics
Monday duo is
here to unpack the aftermath of
the Republican

47:07.491 --> 47:13.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care plan passing the
House, new concerns
about possible conflicts of
interest in the

47:13.430 --> 47:19.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump White House, and former
President Obama
speaking out about his signature
legislation.

47:19.336 --> 47:24.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For all that, Tamara Keith of
NPR and Amy
Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

47:24.675 --> 47:26.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

47:26.476 --> 47:29.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And before we talk about that,
we are just
literally in the last minute or
two watching

47:29.680 --> 47:32.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some new tweets from President
Trump.

47:32.449 --> 47:39.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, he is essentially saying
that today's
hearing on Capitol Hill about
the Russia investigation,

47:39.656 --> 47:42.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the White House was told by
the then
acting attorney general, he's
saying it's

47:42.626 --> 47:46.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all old news, that the fake news
had to have
been disappointed.

47:46.396 --> 47:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is calling the entire
investigation a hoax.

47:49.666 --> 47:51.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said, when will this
taxpayer-funded charade
end?

47:51.869 --> 47:53.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I guess it's not surprising.

47:53.136 --> 47:55.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: It's
not surprising.

47:55.339 --> 48:00.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the short answer for when it
will end
is not very -- not very soon,
not anytime

48:00.210 --> 48:01.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
soon.

48:01.912 --> 48:07.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it's more likely that
we are talking
about these issues well into
2018.

48:07.117 --> 48:12.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the reality of how
much staff
that the House and the Senate
still have to

48:12.522 --> 48:14.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get to that they haven't even
begun.

48:14.625 --> 48:22.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Sally Yates story today
didn't produce
any bombshells, but that doesn't
mean that

48:22.633 --> 48:26.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is now going to go away in
the near future.

48:26.904 --> 48:30.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, indeed, Tam,
the gentleman
I interviewed just a few minutes
ago, former

48:30.407 --> 48:33.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assistant attorney general, was
saying it's
pretty clear now the Russians
are going to

48:33.710 --> 48:36.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be -- they not only felt they
were successful
this time.

48:37.014 --> 48:38.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are going to keep trying in
2020.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes.

48:40.817 --> 48:45.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is why -- that sort of
concern is
why members of Congress are
going to keep

48:45.789 --> 48:49.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigating this, whether
President Trump
wants them to or not.

48:49.893 --> 48:55.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump often takes
these sorts of
investigations or hearings as
coming after

48:55.866 --> 49:02.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, where many members of
Congress see this
as going for information, and
not necessarily

49:02.606 --> 49:08.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to undermine him, but, of
course, the
resistance does see it as a
chance to undermine

49:08.211 --> 49:09.846 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's go back
and talk
about -- it seems like a hundred
years ago,

49:11.748 --> 49:17.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Amy, that the House of
Representatives voted
to -- finally voted to undo, at
least to pass

49:17.921 --> 49:21.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a replacement bill for
Obamacare.

49:22.025 --> 49:26.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's already been ads run in
congressional
districts around the country
both for and

49:26.730 --> 49:30.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against Republican members,
depending on how
they voted.

49:30.767 --> 49:35.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this -- do we know yet
whether this is
a plus or minus politically for
these House

49:35.772 --> 49:37.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
members?

49:37.541 --> 49:39.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, if you're
sitting in one
of these competitive
congressional districts,

49:40.010 --> 49:43.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you might think that we're
already deep into
the middle of a midterm
election, the number

49:43.914 --> 49:47.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of ads that are running now and
will continue
to run.

49:47.517 --> 49:51.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats believe that this is a
potent issue
for them in the election.

49:51.655 --> 49:55.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they remember what it was
like when they
were on the other side.

49:55.592 --> 49:57.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the reason they think
it's going to
be so powerful.

49:57.828 --> 50:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in 2010, when they were the
ones voting
for a bill that was
controversial, pushing

50:03.233 --> 50:07.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it through on a party-line-only
vote, they
suffered the consequences.

50:07.204 --> 50:09.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was a toxic vote for them.

50:09.106 --> 50:12.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They lost 63 seats and control
of the House.

50:12.109 --> 50:15.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats are convinced this is
going to be
that kind of issue for
Republicans.

50:15.245 --> 50:18.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is not a lot of polling
that's been
out yet.

50:18.215 --> 50:22.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One poll that came out today
showed 31 percent
of Americans supporting it.

50:22.719 --> 50:27.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Compare that to where Americans
-- how Americans
feel about the Obamacare, which
is now at

50:27.791 --> 50:28.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about 48 percent.

50:28.992 --> 50:30.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So that's not great.

50:30.927 --> 50:37.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The best news for Republicans is
that Republicans
are supportive of it, about 75
percent supportive

50:37.401 --> 50:42.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of it, but the intensity on the
other side,
people who say they oppose is
much, much higher.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's growing.

50:43.273 --> 50:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, we are months
away from the
midterms.

50:45.909 --> 50:50.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's November of next year, Tam,
and you still
don't know what the Senate is
going to do.

50:50.714 --> 50:51.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That's right.

50:51.782 --> 50:54.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Senate is going to take
their time.

50:54.151 --> 50:59.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They are waiting for the
Congressional Budget
Office to come back with a score
of the House

50:59.723 --> 51:00.791 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bill.

51:00.824 --> 51:02.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something that the House
didn't wait
for.

51:02.559 --> 51:06.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also saying that they're
basically
starting fresh and doing
something on their

51:06.196 --> 51:07.364 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
own.

51:07.397 --> 51:09.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is a deadline here.

51:09.132 --> 51:13.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The way they're trying to do
this is through
this budget reconciliation
process.

51:13.370 --> 51:17.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why they don't need any
Democratic
votes in the Senate, but that
turns into a

51:17.107 --> 51:18.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pumpkin at the end of September.

51:18.942 --> 51:21.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there isn't much time.

51:21.344 --> 51:24.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there is a big challenge
here.

51:24.748 --> 51:28.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the House side, they really
thread a needle
to get the number of votes that
they needed,

51:28.819 --> 51:34.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get the Freedom Caucus and
the moderates
to come along.

51:34.057 --> 51:37.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The needle is completely
different over on
the Senate side that they need
to thread.

51:38.028 --> 51:41.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how they combine those
things, if the
Senate is able to get something
done, with

51:41.898 --> 51:45.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a much tighter margin than they
had in the
House, it's unclear.

51:45.102 --> 51:47.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is a somewhat
different
calculus in the Senate.

51:47.904 --> 51:50.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It is a different --
absolutely.

51:50.173 --> 51:54.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing to remember,
if you're
thinking as a House member, is,
no matter

51:54.544 --> 51:59.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what happens with the Senate
bill, no matter
whether we ultimately see it on
the president's

51:59.149 --> 52:03.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desk and it's signed into law
and it looks
different from the one that way
voted on,

52:03.186 --> 52:10.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they own that vote that they
cast the other
week and all that went along
with it.

52:10.093 --> 52:15.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why, when we talked
about these
ads as a preview for 2018, for
those people

52:15.866 --> 52:22.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sitting in those districts, what
they are
watching are images of a baby
with a respirator,

52:22.405 --> 52:28.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a pregnant woman who's looking
distraught
talk about the fact that there
are costs that

52:28.645 --> 52:32.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to go up, seniors are
going to pay
more, preexisting conditions are
going to

52:32.616 --> 52:34.417 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
exist.

52:34.451 --> 52:38.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those kinds of ads are going to
run throughout
2018, regardless of what the
final bill looks

52:38.388 --> 52:39.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
like.

52:39.923 --> 52:41.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Something
completely separate
I want to ask you both about.

52:41.691 --> 52:44.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have been doing some
reporting on
this, Tam.

52:44.361 --> 52:49.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's son-in-law,
Jared Kushner,
he has separated himself from
the business

52:49.733 --> 52:55.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that his family very involved
in, very successful
real estate business.

52:55.238 --> 53:01.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His sister was in China over the
last few
days, and talking about special
treatment

53:01.378 --> 53:06.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possibly for people seeking
these so-called
EB-5 visas.

53:06.383 --> 53:10.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's complicated, but it matters
in terms
of people looking at whether
there is any

53:10.120 --> 53:11.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conflict of interests here.

53:11.421 --> 53:13.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That's right.

53:13.156 --> 53:16.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Kushner organization has
apologized
for any misunderstanding or any
impression

53:16.359 --> 53:20.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that could be left that she was
trying to
use her brother's position.

53:20.263 --> 53:25.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jared Kushner has said that he
will not involve
himself in anything involving
these visas

53:25.569 --> 53:26.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as they're considered.

53:26.870 --> 53:29.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a controversial visa
program.

53:29.573 --> 53:37.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For as little as $500,000,
investors, foreign
nationals can invest in a
project, a real

53:37.881 --> 53:43.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
estate project typically, and
get a visa that
gets them on a path to
citizenship to become

53:43.386 --> 53:45.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a citizen of the United States.

53:45.222 --> 53:49.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's --
we're -- only
a little bit of time left here,
but it's just

53:49.960 --> 53:54.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another case of what the Trump
White House
has to be on the lookout for.

53:54.564 --> 53:55.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Yes, right.

53:55.565 --> 53:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And here's an opportunity.

53:56.833 --> 53:59.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a president who wants to
push for immigration
reform.

53:59.469 --> 54:02.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He could have talked about
reforming this
very issue.

54:02.472 --> 54:03.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Politics Monday.

54:03.506 --> 54:04.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Amy, Tam, thank you both.

54:04.808 --> 54:05.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

54:05.976 --> 54:07.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:07.143 --> 54:08.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:08.645 --> 54:18.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.

54:18.688 --> 54:24.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
