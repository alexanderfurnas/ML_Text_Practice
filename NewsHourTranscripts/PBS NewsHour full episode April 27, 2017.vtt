JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.305 --> 00:06.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.306 --> 00:08.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.041 --> 00:12.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY, White House
Budget Director:
We're trying to drive the
economic benefit

00:12.112 --> 00:14.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here to the taxpayers in the
middle.

00:14.981 --> 00:20.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: White House
Budget Director
Mick Mulvaney joins me to
explain the administration's

00:20.253 --> 00:22.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tax reform proposal and
President Trump's
plan to get a spending bill
passed.

00:22.155 --> 00:26.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead, a look at the first
100 days of
the Trump presidency, the
progress and setbacks

00:26.526 --> 00:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the domestic front for the
new administration.

00:28.361 --> 00:32.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: a wall keeping people and
wildlife out
-- how a political divide could
endanger animals

00:32.966 --> 00:34.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
living along the U.S.-Mexico
border.

00:34.768 --> 00:39.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS,
Arizona-Sonora Desert
Museum: Long-term, this could be
a division

00:39.439 --> 00:45.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of genetical populations, where
a group of
animals from one side cannot
reproduce with

00:45.378 --> 00:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another group of animals,
breaking the connectivity,
creating some genetical
problems.

00:51.317 --> 00:55.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.288 --> 00:59.459 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.492 --> 01:10.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Trump
administration is
out with the broad strokes of
what it says

01:10.870 --> 01:13.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be the largest tax reform
in U.S. history.

01:13.206 --> 01:17.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plan's main features,
released today,
include cutting corporate tax
rates to 15

01:17.243 --> 01:18.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
percent from 35 percent.

01:19.012 --> 01:22.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would also consolidate
existing income
tax brackets into just three,
ranging from

01:22.749 --> 01:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
10 percent to 35 percent.

01:24.384 --> 01:28.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it would double the standard
deduction,
while repealing the estate tax.

01:28.688 --> 01:33.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a White House briefing,
Treasury Secretary
Steven Mnuchin promised the plan
will not

01:34.027 --> 01:35.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make the deficit worse.

01:35.895 --> 01:41.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. Treasury
Secretary: This
will pay for itself with growth
and with reduced

01:41.367 --> 01:44.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
reduction of different
deductions, and closing
loopholes.

01:44.104 --> 01:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will be working very closely,
as I said,
with the House and Senate to
turn this into

01:51.377 --> 01:57.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bill that can be passed and
the president
can sign, and there's lots and
lots of details

01:57.984 --> 02:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going into how that will pay for
itself.

02:00.920 --> 02:07.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
leaders said the
plan offers critical guideposts
for a tax

02:07.660 --> 02:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overhaul, but Democrats called
it a massive
tax break for the wealthy.

02:13.433 --> 02:21.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On another issue, Secretary
Mnuchin said today
that President Trump -- quote --
"has no intention"

02:21.074 --> 02:23.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of making his own tax returns
public.

02:23.276 --> 02:27.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress moved closer today to
trying to prevent
a government shutdown on
Saturday.

02:27.814 --> 02:32.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats said one stumbling
block apparently
fell away when the White House
agreed to continue

02:32.919 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
subsidies for millions of poor
people under
Obamacare.

02:35.188 --> 02:38.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, conservative House
Republicans
announced that they will back a
newly revised

02:38.424 --> 02:39.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plan to repeal and replace
Obamacare.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is not yet clear if moderates
will go along.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is word that President
Trump has settled
on a course of action against
North Korea.

02:45.365 --> 02:50.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A top national security official
says it begins
with diplomacy, but includes a
range of options.

02:50.103 --> 02:57.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That word came as all 100
senators took a
bus caravan to the White House
for a classified

02:57.076 --> 02:58.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
briefing.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrat Chris Coons of Delaware
was among
those who spoke afterwards.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.482 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS COONS (D), Delaware: I was
encouraged
that they chose to brief the
entire Senate.

03:05.285 --> 03:10.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the -- it was a
sobering briefing,
in which it was clear just how
much thought

03:10.857 --> 03:17.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and planning is going into
preparing military
options, if called for, and a
diplomatic strategy

03:17.063 --> 03:20.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that strikes me as clear-eyed
and well -- well-proportioned
to the threat.

03:20.967 --> 03:24.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: House members had
their briefing
later at the Capitol.

03:24.971 --> 03:30.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And North Korea issued a new
warning that
it will -- quote -- "go to the
end," apparently

03:30.276 --> 03:34.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meaning a nuclear strike, if
there is an all-out
war with the U.S.

03:35.014 --> 03:39.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China today unveiled its first
domestically
built aircraft carrier, the
latest step in

03:39.485 --> 03:41.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a major naval expansion.

03:41.187 --> 03:45.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vessel slowly slipped into
the water in
the port city of Dalian to much
fanfare.

03:45.725 --> 03:50.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is expected to become
operational by 2020,
after undergoing sea trials.

03:50.096 --> 03:54.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump today decried a
new legal
blow to his immigration policy.

03:54.934 --> 04:01.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday, a federal district
judge in San
Francisco blocked his order to
withhold funding

04:01.074 --> 04:07.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from so-called sanctuary cities,
which seek
to protect many of those who are
undocumented.

04:07.880 --> 04:13.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president tweeted that the
decision was
-- quote -- "ridiculous" and he
vowed to appeal.

04:13.486 --> 04:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lumped that in with criticism
of the 9th
Judicial Circuit, where
appellate courts also

04:19.359 --> 04:20.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blocked his travel ban.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Later, he echoed that complaint:

04:22.662 --> 04:25.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I'm never surprised by the 9th
Circuit.

04:26.032 --> 04:27.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

04:27.333 --> 04:29.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: As I said, we will
see them
in the Supreme Court.

04:29.235 --> 04:35.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Trump also
told The Washington
Examiner newspaper that he has
considered

04:35.275 --> 04:37.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proposals to split up the 9th
Circuit.

04:38.011 --> 04:43.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the Department of
Homeland Security
formally opened a new office to
help victims

04:43.483 --> 04:45.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of crimes by undocumented
immigrants.

04:45.485 --> 04:51.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary John Kelly said that
it will help
shine a light on victims as part
of the president's

04:51.224 --> 04:52.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
push on illegal immigration.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Multiple studies show that
native-born Americans
are more likely to commit crimes
than are

04:55.862 --> 04:57.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigrants.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump administration is
going to review
so-called national monument
designations for

04:59.966 --> 05:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
millions of acres of federal
land.

05:01.534 --> 05:04.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They go back to President
Clinton's time in
office.

05:04.170 --> 05:07.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump ordered the review at
the U.S. Interior
Department today.

05:07.674 --> 05:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is aimed at what he called a
-- quote -- "massive
federal land grab" that bars
drilling, mining

05:11.944 --> 05:13.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and other uses.

05:13.379 --> 05:16.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Environmental and Native
American tribal groups
denounced the action.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Wall Street gave a little
ground today.

05:17.917 --> 05:21.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 21 points
to close at 20975.

05:21.654 --> 05:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell a quarter of a
point, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped one point.

05:27.894 --> 05:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I sit down
with White House Budget Director
Mick Mulvaney

05:34.334 --> 05:38.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk about the president's
budget and tax
priorities; approaching
President Trump's

05:38.237 --> 05:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first 100 days in office, a look
at what he
has accomplished here at home;
and much more.

05:44.377 --> 05:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On this day when the White House
is unveiling
the outline of a tax system
overhaul, and

05:52.185 --> 05:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
negotiating down to the wire
over a federal
spending plan to fund the
government through

05:56.789 --> 06:01.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
September, I sat down with Mick
Mulvaney,
the head of the Office of
Management and Budget.

06:01.527 --> 06:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with him at his office
this afternoon,
before there were reports of a
deal on health

06:07.500 --> 06:08.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care subsidies.

06:08.901 --> 06:15.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Director Mick Mulvaney, thank
you very much
for talking with us.

06:15.408 --> 06:22.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY, White House
Budget Director:
Judy, thank you for having me.

06:22.715 --> 06:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I do want to
start by asking
you about taxes.

06:29.989 --> 06:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the big announcement
coming from the
administration today.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: Sure.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The proposal,
among other things,
calls for increases in the
standard deductions,

06:39.132 --> 06:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
individuals and families.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: Yes.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Big cuts in
corporate business
taxes.

06:42.735 --> 06:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the administration
trying to accomplish
with this proposal?

06:47.573 --> 06:51.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Getting economic
growth back
where it's supposed to be.

06:51.344 --> 06:54.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we have forgotten
for the last
decade is that America used to
be a fast-growing

06:54.280 --> 06:56.082 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

06:56.115 --> 07:00.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look over the course of
our 200-plus
years, we're supposed to grow at
about 3 percent,

07:00.119 --> 07:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on average, and that's where we
have been
since World War II, at the very
least, even

07:06.125 --> 07:07.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
further back than that.

07:08.027 --> 07:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for the last decade, we
have been growing
at less than 2 percent.

07:12.365 --> 07:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't sound like much,
but if you think
about it in terms of the power
of compound

07:17.403 --> 07:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interest, when you take an
economy our size
that only grows 2 percent a year
for a decade,

07:22.475 --> 07:26.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instead of 3 percent a year, the
difference
between those things are
tremendous.

07:26.212 --> 07:29.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Folks who are 30 years old have
never had
a job during a time when the
economy was growing

07:29.816 --> 07:30.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at 3 percent.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's entirely different.

07:32.351 --> 07:36.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was a young person, if
you got fired,
you could find another job.

07:36.055 --> 07:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you wanted to quit, you could
go start
your own company.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We haven't had that for 10 years
now.

07:41.494 --> 07:43.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're trying to get back to
that.

07:43.329 --> 07:48.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is what is driving not
only everything
we do at the White House, but
specifically

07:48.167 --> 07:49.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this tax plan.

07:49.869 --> 07:57.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A number of the
analysts who
have looked at say, when you put
together

07:57.076 --> 08:02.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the proposed business tax cuts,
some of the
individual cuts, and when you
look at the

08:02.715 --> 08:11.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proposal to do away with some of
the taxes
that are now in the Affordable
Care Act, in

08:11.224 --> 08:15.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
essence, it's the top 1 percent
of Americans,
1 percent of American,
high-income level,

08:15.461 --> 08:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who are going to benefit the
most from this.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you answer that?

08:21.167 --> 08:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: I'm not sure how
could they
could come to that conclusion.

08:25.371 --> 08:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would be curious to know what
assumptions
they're making regarding the
value of deductions.

08:30.610 --> 08:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, we get rid of all
the deductions
on the personal side, except, I
think, let's

08:34.480 --> 08:36.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see, charity and some of the
home interest
deduction.

08:37.016 --> 08:42.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm not sure how you could
make that conclusion,
unless you're making some wild
assumptions

08:42.121 --> 08:44.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the nature of those
deductions.

08:44.156 --> 08:47.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where do you see
the benefits
falling, what income?

08:47.493 --> 08:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Middle class.

08:49.128 --> 08:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Middle class and business, writ
large, both
large business and small
business.

08:52.398 --> 08:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it should be one of the
largest reductions
on small business, what we call
S Corporations,

08:58.938 --> 09:00.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the history of S
Corporations.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're trying to drive the
economic benefit
here to the taxpayers in the
middle, the folks

09:03.776 --> 09:08.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are in the middle class, who
are paying
the taxes, and the places where
they work.

09:08.681 --> 09:12.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We know the tax
cuts for these
so-called pass-through
businesses, owner-owned

09:12.184 --> 09:14.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
businesses, are going to be
among the beneficiaries.

09:14.153 --> 09:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know President Trump, it's
the kind of
business he has.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much does he stand to
benefit?

09:19.625 --> 09:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I ask people of because
people are saying,
we don't know what his tax
income situation

09:24.797 --> 09:25.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is.

09:25.798 --> 09:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has said he's not going to
release that.

09:27.867 --> 09:30.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does the public know that he
doesn't stand
to benefit significantly?

09:30.836 --> 09:33.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Well, I actually
don't care
about whether or not someone
else benefits.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I care about whether I benefit,
I being just
anybody.

09:35.975 --> 09:37.376 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As long as I'm better off, why
should I care
if somebody is as well?

09:39.545 --> 09:44.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I look at through is the
lens of the
business I used to run.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I owned a restaurant.

09:45.184 --> 09:46.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a fast, fresh Mexican
restaurant.

09:46.886 --> 09:49.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, I rolled burritos the
day that I
announced I was running for
Congress.

09:49.889 --> 09:53.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this would be a huge benefit
to us, to
the point where S Corporations
right now pay

09:53.225 --> 09:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax at the pass-through rate,
which is typically
the highest individual rate of
the owners

09:55.895 --> 09:57.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the business.

09:57.730 --> 10:02.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You take that number to 15
percent, it allows
me to keep a lot more money in
my business.

10:02.602 --> 10:07.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I would have done, had
I still been
in that line of work, is start
preparing to

10:07.640 --> 10:09.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
open another restaurant.

10:09.442 --> 10:14.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I also want to
ask you about
the revenue loss that comes from
all these

10:14.380 --> 10:16.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tax cuts.

10:16.148 --> 10:19.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The administration at one point
was talking
about a border tax, some kind of
adjustable

10:19.552 --> 10:21.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tax at the border.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That doesn't appear to be part
of the proposal
right now.

10:25.992 --> 10:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you address significant
drop in revenue,
at a time when the country is --
has deficits

10:32.198 --> 10:33.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are historic?

10:33.199 --> 10:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: Sure.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we can talk about deficits
more.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I want to.

10:39.338 --> 10:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let's talk about -- you
asked a couple
different things, which is the
border tax.

10:46.145 --> 10:49.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keep in mind that this is the
first round
of discussions.

10:49.548 --> 10:51.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a pre-cooked bill.

10:51.584 --> 10:53.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not prepackaged.

10:53.386 --> 10:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is sort of our principles,
so just because
it's not in this first round of
principles

10:57.757 --> 10:59.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't mean it won't be in a
final version
of the bill.

10:59.558 --> 11:04.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president is interested in
trying to figure
out a way to tax imports,
especially from

11:04.096 --> 11:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
countries that tax our exports.

11:05.898 --> 11:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regarding the revenue loss, keep
in mind that
the corporate income tax only
generates, I

11:11.170 --> 11:13.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think, about only $300 billion a
year.

11:13.506 --> 11:18.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you can do a fairly good bit
within the
corporate tax, and not cost a
lot of revenue.

11:18.077 --> 11:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally -- and you have
heard Secretary
Mnuchin talk about this today --
we're hoping

11:21.514 --> 11:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for really, really good growth
from these
numbers, from this tax reform.

11:24.784 --> 11:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as you know,
when big
tax cuts instituted during the
presidency

11:28.587 --> 11:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Ronald Reagan, that growth
didn't materialize.

11:30.489 --> 11:34.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They ended up having to raise
taxes again
by the end of his
administration.

11:34.994 --> 11:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Actually, that's
not true.

11:36.862 --> 11:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did get really good growth
from the Reagan
years.

11:39.999 --> 11:45.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You saw GDP grow at very high
rates as we
came out of the recession,
something that

11:45.304 --> 11:49.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't happen at the end of the
recession
in 2007-2008.

11:49.909 --> 11:53.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama chose to deal
with his recession
by increasing regulations and
getting government

11:53.179 --> 11:54.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more involved in the economy.

11:54.613 --> 11:57.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Reagan decided to do
the exact opposite.

11:57.616 --> 12:00.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Reagan got a
tremendous result in
terms of economic growth.

12:00.619 --> 12:03.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama gave us eight
years without
3 percent growth.

12:03.122 --> 12:07.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I do think history shows us,
if we do
the tax reform right, that we
can put people

12:07.860 --> 12:09.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back to work and grow the
economy.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I want to
move on to
the budget.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: Sure.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You finish up the
fiscal year
later on.

12:15.935 --> 12:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, we don't know if
there's an agreement
on a spending -- on a spending
plan for the

12:21.040 --> 12:22.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rest of this year.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where does that stand right now?

12:23.976 --> 12:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: That is a really,
really good
question, and I don't know
either, which bothers

12:27.947 --> 12:30.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me a little bit, because I'm the
budget director.

12:30.783 --> 12:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we had thought we had a deal
on Monday.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats had objected to
our inclusion
of the bricks-and-mortar portion
of the border

12:37.022 --> 12:37.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wall.

12:38.023 --> 12:39.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said that that was a poison
pill.

12:39.825 --> 12:43.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to sort of drive home their
point, they
said, well, now we want these
cost-sharing

12:43.796 --> 12:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
payments, cost -- the CSR
payments, cost-sharing
reduction payments to the
insurance industry

12:47.867 --> 12:49.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as part of the Obamacare.

12:49.702 --> 12:51.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

12:51.537 --> 12:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: And they said --
they put that
on after they found out our
request for the

12:55.708 --> 12:56.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wall.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, we took the wall request
away on Monday.

12:58.611 --> 13:03.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're still waiting for the
Democrats
to let us know where they stand.

13:03.149 --> 13:08.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we thought we had a deal on
Monday, almost
48 hours ago now, and we have no
idea where

13:08.687 --> 13:10.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Democrats are.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know if they're doing
internal polling
that maybe says they're going to
benefit from

13:13.058 --> 13:14.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a shutdown.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're really -- we're not
concerned yet, but
I'm a little surprised that we
haven't buttoned

13:17.930 --> 13:19.732 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this up.

13:19.765 --> 13:24.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is the
administration, are
you, the president, prepared to
go ahead with

13:24.403 --> 13:28.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a spending arrangement that
doesn't include
these payments to -- subsidy
payments to insurance

13:28.040 --> 13:29.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
companies that help low-income
Americans?

13:29.742 --> 13:36.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Well, that's the
whole idea,
is that the bipartisan bill that
is being

13:36.582 --> 13:41.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- that I think has been
negotiated now for
three months, two months, on the
Hill never

13:41.954 --> 13:44.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
included those payments until
about two weeks
ago.

13:44.089 --> 13:48.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we just assumed when we gave
up on our
immediate demands for the
bricks-and-mortar

13:48.260 --> 13:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wall that the Democrats would do
the same
thing.

13:50.696 --> 13:58.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for some reason, they're not
being straightforward
yet about what they want to do
on those payments.

13:58.637 --> 14:04.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House,
you mentioned
the wall, the fact that the
president initially

14:04.844 --> 14:07.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said this was something he felt
very strongly
about.

14:07.446 --> 14:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It had to be -- there had to be
money in there
to pay for a bricks-and-mortar
wall.

14:11.717 --> 14:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What signal that does it send,
though, that
he -- that was a centerpiece of
his campaign.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICK MULVANEY: Yes.

14:19.258 --> 14:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The day after we sign the bill
that keeps
the government open for the last
five months

14:23.662 --> 14:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the fiscal year -- our fiscal
year ends
the end of September -- the
discussions begin

14:28.601 --> 14:31.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immediately for the larger
budget for the
full 2018 fiscal year.

14:31.503 --> 14:40.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, that's the budget we
happen to be
working on today as well.

14:40.112 --> 14:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're doing '17 and '18 at the
same time.

14:45.517 --> 14:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those conversations will have
actually already
started in terms of what wall
funding will

14:48.053 --> 14:49.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be in 2018.

14:49.288 --> 14:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't think it's fair to
say he's dropped
anything.

14:52.291 --> 14:56.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We simply said, look, this is
the last five
months of the fiscal year.

14:56.295 --> 15:02.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's very little we can get
built in five
months anyway, so let's focus
instead on things

15:02.034 --> 15:03.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we agree on.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Democrats say they support
border security.

15:05.371 --> 15:11.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2006, for example,
then-Senator Obama voted
for a lot of the stuff we're
asking for right

15:11.744 --> 15:13.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

15:13.445 --> 15:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's not a
lessening of
his -- that this is a priority
for him?

15:17.716 --> 15:22.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: It's simply a
recognition of
the fact that we only have five
months left

15:22.988 --> 15:25.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the year anyway.

15:25.557 --> 15:29.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the only discussion we're
having right
now, and that there are other
things we can

15:29.461 --> 15:30.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agree on.

15:30.462 --> 15:31.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, let's agree on them.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's fund the government and
let's start
talking about 2018.

15:33.799 --> 15:34.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Final question.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're coming up on the 100-day
mark.

15:37.002 --> 15:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: I'm familiar with
it.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, I have heard a little bit
about it.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For President
Trump.

15:43.642 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you know, there are critics,
even friends
of the administration out there,
who are saying,

15:47.746 --> 15:51.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this has been a rocky beginning
for this administration,
that you haven't been able to
get as much

15:51.383 --> 15:53.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
done as you wanted.

15:53.218 --> 15:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pulling back -- Obamacare hasn't
been repealed
and replaced, the border wall
that we have

15:55.354 --> 15:56.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just been discussing.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you see these first 100
days?

15:58.190 --> 16:01.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: A lot of the
stuff that was
entirely in our control, I think
we have actually

16:01.160 --> 16:02.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exceed our own expectations.

16:02.661 --> 16:06.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can talk about the number of
bills that
the president has signed.

16:06.932 --> 16:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there's been at least
13, more than
any president since World War
II, the number

16:12.972 --> 16:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of executives orders that we
have issued.

16:15.474 --> 16:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, it's not just number of
these things,
but what they have done.

16:20.179 --> 16:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By passing this legislation, we
have undone
a lot of the regulatory regime
that the previous

16:23.148 --> 16:24.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
administration put in.

16:24.583 --> 16:27.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have undone a lot of damage
they did with
our executive orders.

16:27.519 --> 16:32.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have actually been able
to reduce role
of government in your life a
great deal in

16:32.458 --> 16:33.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the first 100 days.

16:33.459 --> 16:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We take that as a huge success.

16:35.394 --> 16:37.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think President Trump is the
first president
since the 1880s to have a
Supreme Court justice

16:37.496 --> 16:38.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the first 100 days.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, we have not gotten health
care done.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, we're just starting tax
reform today.

16:41.734 --> 16:45.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But keep in mind those are
things we had to
work with Congress, and Congress
turned out

16:45.971 --> 16:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be a lot more broken than we
thought it
was.

16:48.707 --> 16:53.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, one of the reasons we
think the Democrats
have not responded on our
funding proposals

16:53.812 --> 16:59.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for this year is that they don't
want to give
it to us within the first 100
days.

16:59.918 --> 17:04.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's how poisonous the
atmosphere is
that we're working in, that they
sort of agreed

17:04.723 --> 17:06.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in principle.

17:06.558 --> 17:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to say yes, but they
won't say yes
until after the 100 days to deny
that to the

17:12.831 --> 17:13.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

17:13.832 --> 17:15.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's just absurd.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the folks back home pay the
price for
that, which is unfortunate.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Budget Director
Mick Mulvaney,
thank you very much.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICK MULVANEY: Thanks, Judy.

17:22.708 --> 17:26.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a very
different view of
the president's tax plans.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham takes it from
here.

17:28.080 --> 17:31.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In addition to
cutting the
corporate rate and reducing the
number of

17:31.316 --> 17:35.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax brackets, the president's
blueprint calls
for eliminating the Alternative
Minimum Tax,

17:35.487 --> 17:37.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or AMT, as well as the estate
tax.

17:37.456 --> 17:40.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would also eliminate any
taxes on the first
$24,000 of a couple's earnings.

17:40.659 --> 17:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it would cut all itemized
deductions,
except for two big ones,
mortgage interest

17:45.564 --> 17:46.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and charitable giving.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm joined now by Jared
Bernstein.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's an economist who served in
the Obama
administration.

17:49.168 --> 17:52.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now a fellow at the Center
on Budget
and Policy Priorities.

17:52.438 --> 17:54.073 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN, Former Chief
Economist to
Vice President Joe Biden: Thank
you.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: First reaction
to the president's
tax proposal?

17:58.510 --> 18:01.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: There are a lot
of problems
with this proposal.

18:01.413 --> 18:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can think of three or four
right off the
top of my head, first of all on
the revenues.

18:06.652 --> 18:11.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a tax plan, even though
we don't know
all the details yet, what we do
know suggests

18:11.757 --> 18:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very clearly that this is going
to lead to
a loss of north of at least $3
trillion to

18:14.593 --> 18:17.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the treasury, and it could be as
much as $6
trillion.

18:17.996 --> 18:19.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's over 10 years.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So,
potentially big deficit
hits.

18:21.366 --> 18:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Big deficit.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Big deficit debt hits.

18:24.470 --> 18:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are argument that the
growth effects
of these tax cuts will offset
those revenue

18:28.040 --> 18:29.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
losses, those arguments are
completely unfounded.

18:29.808 --> 18:33.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's just not a shred of
evidence, not
a shred, that tax cuts pay for
themselves

18:33.512 --> 18:35.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the totality, which is what
they're suggesting.

18:35.714 --> 18:39.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not to say that tax cuts
can't have
some growth effects, but they
tend to be really

18:39.251 --> 18:40.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quite small.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's the first point.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The growth point was number two.

18:43.522 --> 18:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The third point -- and I really
think Director
Mulvaney got this pretty
backwards -- was,

18:46.391 --> 18:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this tax cut plan exacerbates
after-tax inequality.

18:48.293 --> 18:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means most its benefits
accrue to those
at the very top of the scale.

18:52.598 --> 18:58.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can go through some of the
details, some
of the pieces that you announced
that generate

18:58.704 --> 19:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that effect, but it mostly has
to do with
this very sharp cut in the
corporate rate

19:00.672 --> 19:02.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this pass-through rate that
you heard
him talk about.

19:02.574 --> 19:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally -- and this relates
to this pass-through
problem -- this tax plan oppose
up a huge

19:06.678 --> 19:08.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
loophole.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every high-end earner has an
incentive now
to become an independent
business, an S Corp,

19:10.749 --> 19:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an LLC, to take advantage of a
pass-through
rate is now going to be 15, 20
percentage

19:15.254 --> 19:17.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points below what they would
otherwise pay.

19:17.122 --> 19:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Secretary
Mnuchin in his
briefing today -- and you heard
Mick Mulvaney

19:19.825 --> 19:23.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make the same argument -- they
argue that
these taxes are geared largely
to middle-income

19:23.495 --> 19:24.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
earn earners.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't see any evidence that
there's targeted
tax breaks for them in this?

19:27.499 --> 19:30.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JARED BERNSTEIN: Just a
slightest bit, which
is this increase in the standard
deduction.

19:30.636 --> 19:33.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's going to help some
folks at the
bottom.

19:33.071 --> 19:34.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But that's tiny.

19:34.873 --> 19:38.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vast majority of the revenue
losses that
I was describing, the trillions
that are not

19:38.076 --> 19:44.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be flowing to the
treasury if this
tax cut ever becomes law, very
much swamp

19:44.183 --> 19:45.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anything to the middle class.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let me give you an example.

19:47.085 --> 19:50.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This sounds to me very similar
to a House
plan that was written by Paul
Ryan quite recently.

19:50.289 --> 19:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with that plan, the top 1
percent, their
after-tax income went up 11
percent.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's about $240,000.

19:55.727 --> 19:57.396 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

19:57.429 --> 20:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The middle class, their income
went up 0.1
percent, which we can just call
zero.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's 60 bucks.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's the kind of imbalance
we're looking
at here.

20:04.803 --> 20:09.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what I mean when I
say this really
exacerbates a problem we already
have, which

20:09.708 --> 20:11.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is one of high levels of
inequality.

20:11.610 --> 20:15.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You heard Judy
and Mick
Mulvaney talk about these
pass-through companies

20:15.647 --> 20:20.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the huge tax cut that
they're going to
be getting.

20:20.152 --> 20:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you explain what those
companies are and
what that tax cut would mean?

20:26.225 --> 20:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: These are the
small businesses,
but they're not the moms and
pops.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was another misleading part
of that.

20:32.564 --> 20:37.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, they
argue that this
is -- that that is largely a tax
cut for small

20:37.035 --> 20:38.804 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
business.

20:38.837 --> 20:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: So, that's --
well, it is
a tax cut for some small
business, but which

20:41.740 --> 20:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
small businesses are we talking
about?

20:43.542 --> 20:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The moms and pops, you think
about the corner
store, they're already paying a
low rate on

20:46.778 --> 20:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their pass-through income,
something close
to the 15 percent that we're
talking about.

20:48.647 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ones who get the huge break
here are high-end
small businesses, you know, law
firms and

20:53.418 --> 20:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
private equity funds and hedge
funds.

20:55.254 --> 20:58.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, the point here is
that, if you're
being paid a high salary, you
now -- which

20:58.190 --> 21:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have to pay on your personal
income side,
which, under their plan, would
be 35 percent,

21:02.794 --> 21:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you now have a very big, very
tempting incentive
to go to your boss and say,
starting tomorrow,

21:07.132 --> 21:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're no longer paying me a
paycheck.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm Jared Bernstein LLC, and I'm
going to
tap that 30 -- that 15 percent
loophole.

21:12.437 --> 21:15.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You're a
veteran of a lot
of tax battles in the Congress
and the Senate

21:15.874 --> 21:17.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the administration.

21:17.209 --> 21:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isn't this just the opening
salvo of the Trump
administration?

21:20.445 --> 21:23.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is their beginning of their
negotiating
position?

21:23.248 --> 21:25.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: It is an
opening salvo.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's an important
point and we shouldn't
forget that.

21:28.487 --> 21:34.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is that the -- this
opening salvo
goes completely in the wrong
direction.

21:34.960 --> 21:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are a society, an economy, a
government
that is going to need more
revenues in the

21:41.500 --> 21:42.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
future, not less.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Think about demographics alone.

21:44.403 --> 21:52.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The share of elderly people in
our country
is going to go from 15 to about
21 percent

21:52.744 --> 21:54.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over the next couple of decades.

21:54.746 --> 21:56.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, that's baked in the cake.

21:56.615 --> 21:57.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's going to happen.

21:57.949 --> 21:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That creates certain budgetary
pressures.

21:59.718 --> 22:03.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the idea that we're even
starting with
an opening salvo that's going to
keep, you

22:03.889 --> 22:07.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, $3 trillion, $4 trillion,
$5 trillion
over 10 years of going into the
coffers at

22:07.759 --> 22:09.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the treasury is starting from
precisely the
wrong place.

22:09.928 --> 22:15.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jared
Bernstein, thanks
very much for your analysis.

22:15.734 --> 22:21.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JARED BERNSTEIN: My pleasure.

22:21.373 --> 22:25.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:25.043 --> 22:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
hell on earth,
a new striking documentary on
Syria and its

22:30.849 --> 22:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civil war; walled-off, the
proposed U.S.-Mexico
border wall putting endangered
species at

22:35.153 --> 22:37.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk; and remembering Jonathan
Demme, the
director who brought us "Silence
of the Lambs."

22:37.556 --> 22:41.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: As President Trump
nears his 100th
day in office, White House
correspondent John

22:41.226 --> 22:46.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yang begins our look at his
accomplishments
and setbacks, with a focus on
the home front.

22:46.732 --> 22:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For President Trump,
today's tax
announcement amounted to a
campaign promise

22:52.104 --> 22:53.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kept.

22:53.472 --> 22:57.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
It's a great plan.

22:57.642 --> 23:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to put people back
to work.

23:01.046 --> 23:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It comes as he nears
his 100th
day in office.

23:06.184 --> 23:10.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump dismisses that
milestone as
not very meaningful and a
ridiculous standard,

23:10.589 --> 23:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even as administration officials
aggressively
push his accomplishments online
and on-camera.

23:15.260 --> 23:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
When you think about what he's
started, it's

23:21.199 --> 23:24.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been a huge, hugely successful
first 100 days.

23:24.736 --> 23:31.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump came to the
White House
intent on shaking things up,
changing how

23:31.443 --> 23:32.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Washington works.

23:32.778 --> 23:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He and his advisers have focused
on asserting
executive action.

23:34.780 --> 23:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is on track to sign the most
executive
orders in his first 100 days
since World War

23:39.284 --> 23:41.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
II.

23:41.186 --> 23:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But like other presidents bent
on changing
Washington, he's run into
obstacles in Congress

23:45.791 --> 23:47.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and in the courts.

23:47.526 --> 23:49.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There have been clear victories.

23:49.394 --> 23:53.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Administration officials tout
the confirmation
of Supreme Court Justice Neil
Gorsuch, though

23:53.665 --> 23:56.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans had to change Senate
rules to
do it.

23:56.868 --> 24:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And I got it done
in the first
100 days.

24:01.139 --> 24:02.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's even nice.

24:02.908 --> 24:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And he moved quickly
to revive
construction of the Keystone
pipeline with

24:07.679 --> 24:09.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
executive action.

24:09.714 --> 24:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The courts have stymied other
executive actions,
like his immigrant travel ban,
and, just yesterday,

24:14.252 --> 24:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his effort to strip federal
funding from so-called
sanctuary cities.

24:18.089 --> 24:23.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While stinging from those court
actions, administration
officials say the president's
tough talk has

24:23.762 --> 24:29.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led to a sharp drop in illegal
crossings over
the southern border since
January, reversing

24:29.801 --> 24:31.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a nearly 20-year trend.

24:31.670 --> 24:36.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump has also reversed
himself on some
campaign promises, such as not
declaring China

24:36.041 --> 24:40.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a currency manipulator, as he
had pledged
to do in campaign rallies across
America.

24:40.812 --> 24:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: What should have
done years
ago.

24:44.983 --> 24:51.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And now the White
House is working
to turn around the most
embarrassing setback

24:51.156 --> 24:55.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his first 100 days, the
initial failure
to repeal and replace the
Affordable Care

24:55.227 --> 24:58.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Act, or Obamacare, a signature
pledge of his
campaign.

24:58.196 --> 25:00.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We were very
close.

25:00.232 --> 25:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a very, very tight
margin.

25:02.434 --> 25:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That episode shook
some administration
officials' confidence in House
Speaker Paul

25:07.305 --> 25:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ryan's ability to deliver votes.

25:09.374 --> 25:11.142 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

25:11.176 --> 25:18.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: We
came really close today, but we
came up short.

25:18.783 --> 25:21.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On tax reform and on
other major
legislative initiatives in the
near future,

25:21.953 --> 25:25.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
such as the promised
infrastructure rebuilding,
there are indications the White
House intends

25:25.991 --> 25:32.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to chart its own course as they
search for
the victories the president
wants to turn

25:32.197 --> 25:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his vision of making America
great again into
a reality.

25:36.067 --> 25:39.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang at the
White House.

25:39.371 --> 25:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on
President Trump's
first 100 days, and how he
compares to his

25:44.109 --> 25:49.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
predecessors, I am joined by
Barbara Perry,
director of presidential studies
at the University

25:49.548 --> 25:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Virginia's Miller Center, and
presidential
historian and "NewsHour" regular
Michael Beschloss.

25:54.185 --> 25:57.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

25:57.455 --> 25:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael, I'm going to start with
you.

25:59.357 --> 26:02.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, remind us quickly, where
did this 100-day
standard come from?

26:02.961 --> 26:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
It came from Franklin Roosevelt.

26:05.864 --> 26:10.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had 100 days that started a
couple days
after -- a few days after he was
inaugurated.

26:10.302 --> 26:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was trying to deal with
the Great Depression
and had this amazing success
with Congress,

26:19.311 --> 26:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting all this legislation,
fixing the banks,
trying to relieve the poor,
Tennessee Valley

26:24.115 --> 26:29.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authority, Public Works, a kind
of legislative
record that we probably will not
see again.

26:29.220 --> 26:33.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every president since then
has hated it,
because they're measured against
this almost-unreal

26:33.892 --> 26:35.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
standard.

26:35.660 --> 26:39.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Barbara
Perry, here we
are, almost 100 days in for
President Trump.

26:39.731 --> 26:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does he compare to his
predecessors at
this point?

26:43.401 --> 26:46.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARBARA PERRY, Director,
University of Virginia
Miller Center: Depends on what
you want to

26:46.705 --> 26:48.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
compare him on.

26:48.607 --> 26:53.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you want to look at,
let's say, executive
orders, certainly, in terms of
the numbers,

26:53.979 --> 26:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would be right up there in
the categories
of most presidents.

26:57.782 --> 27:04.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, as Michael said, in
reference to legislation,
I think FDR passed 76 laws in
the first 100

27:04.723 --> 27:06.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
days through a very amenable
Congress.

27:06.658 --> 27:09.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, Trump is not going to
come anywhere
near that record, and probably
no other president

27:09.461 --> 27:11.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will either.

27:11.396 --> 27:13.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would say, certainly on
executive orders,
on the Supreme Court appointment
of Neil Gorsuch,

27:13.498 --> 27:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he gets A's in terms of getting
what he wanted
based on some of the promises
that he made

27:18.236 --> 27:19.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during the campaign.

27:19.604 --> 27:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael, how do
you see him
compared to others?

27:22.307 --> 27:25.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: I think I
would say it
a little differently, because
Trump made such

27:26.011 --> 27:29.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a point before the campaign just
before the
election, saying, elect me.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a referendum on my
100-day action
plan.

27:31.016 --> 27:34.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will get all these things
through Congress
with a Republican Congress,
which he has had.

27:34.519 --> 27:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in retrospect, as you do
say, this has
been 100 days with almost
nothing of great

27:39.524 --> 27:44.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
importance, despite the fact
that he had promised
health care reform and big tax
reform, which

27:44.996 --> 27:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's getting to this week and a
number of
other things, border wall.

27:49.134 --> 27:55.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you're looking at the 100
days largely
as a legislative standard -- and
that is what

27:55.306 --> 28:01.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is usually is in history --
Trump is really
pretty low down on the list.

28:01.946 --> 28:05.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Barbara,
Michael referenced
where this 100-day standard
comes from, but

28:05.583 --> 28:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how often do presidents get a
lot done early
on in their administration?

28:09.154 --> 28:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARBARA PERRY: It depends on the
president,
of course.

28:11.122 --> 28:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at someone like
Lyndon Johnson,
who had, of course, two first
days -- first

28:15.293 --> 28:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
100 days, one after the Kennedy
assassination,
and then being elected in his
own right, but

28:18.863 --> 28:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly after the 1964
election, in 1965,
as he moved forward with the
Great Society,

28:21.800 --> 28:26.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medicare and Medicaid, and the
Voting Rights
Act of 1965, so we will point to
a president

28:26.104 --> 28:27.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

28:27.472 --> 28:29.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, no one will ever again
standard of
FDR in legislation.

28:29.974 --> 28:33.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also look out where they come
out in the
first 100 days on approval
ratings, which

28:33.311 --> 28:35.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a fascinating parlor game to
play.

28:35.046 --> 28:35.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know this president coming
in, of course,
came in with the lowest entering
approval

28:35.613 --> 28:37.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rating of any president.

28:37.382 --> 28:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it also doesn't matter
necessarily if
you make a mistake, because the
person with

28:41.486 --> 28:46.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the highest rating after 100
days is John
F. Kennedy, after the Bay of
Pigs.

28:46.091 --> 28:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the way he handled that
issue by going
before the American people and
saying, I'm

28:50.261 --> 28:54.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsible for this, I'm the
responsible
officer of the government,
caused his approval

28:54.132 --> 28:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ratings to spike even further.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So he comes in with an 83
percent rating.

28:57.969 --> 29:02.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know Trump's approval ratings
is down in
the low 40s at this point.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dig a little
deeper there,
Michael, in terms of how Donald
Trump has

29:04.476 --> 29:06.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
done compared to other
presidents.

29:06.077 --> 29:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You started to talk about this a
moment ago
with the setting of the
standard.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But how does he stack up?

29:10.348 --> 29:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Well, you
know, a lot of
this, you know, what presidents
do, above

29:13.818 --> 29:17.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and beyond their congressional
record, is,
do they expand the base that
they had on Election

29:17.388 --> 29:18.723 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day?

29:18.757 --> 29:20.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, you know, got,
what, 47 percent
of the popular vote.

29:20.625 --> 29:21.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now he is down to about 40,
which would suggest
that, if anything, he's
alienated some of

29:21.326 --> 29:23.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the people who voted for him.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, with presidents you see
-- and this
is true of almost every
president back to

29:25.730 --> 29:27.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FDR -- the opposite.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They get elected, they say, I
need people
who didn't vote for me, who are
skeptical

29:30.668 --> 29:31.636 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of me.

29:31.669 --> 29:33.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to reach out to them.

29:33.037 --> 29:34.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm the president of all the
people.

29:34.873 --> 29:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you see the numbers go up
because people
appreciate the fact that they
are reaching

29:39.277 --> 29:41.045 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

29:41.079 --> 29:44.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is the one thing Donald
Trump -- and
this has been his own choice --
has not done.

29:44.048 --> 29:46.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's essentially said, I'm happy
with my base.

29:46.217 --> 29:47.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will play to them.

29:48.019 --> 29:52.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am not going to make a big
effort to reach
out to Democrats and
independents in Congress

29:52.290 --> 29:53.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or out among the American
people.

29:53.491 --> 29:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the numbers show
that he's paid
for that.

29:56.161 --> 30:00.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One other feature
of this presidency
has been his unusual attacks, if
you will,

30:00.865 --> 30:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Barbara, on the judiciary.

30:02.667 --> 30:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Time and again, he has singled
out the courts,
judges, justices when he didn't
like what

30:06.471 --> 30:08.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they ruled.

30:08.273 --> 30:11.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA PERRY: He has, which is
a little odd,
in the sense that his sister is
a federal

30:11.109 --> 30:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judge, and a circuit judge at
that.

30:13.111 --> 30:21.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is following in the
footsteps of some
other presidents, and we can
point directly

30:21.085 --> 30:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to FDR, for example, who took on
the judiciary
headlong, not necessarily even
in the first

30:26.324 --> 30:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
term, but certainly once he was
reelected
by a landslide in '36, and
famously, or infamously,

30:33.097 --> 30:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tried to pack the court.

30:34.999 --> 30:40.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I always go back to a speech
that he gave
in which he said, the two
branches of government,

30:40.471 --> 30:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president and Congress, are
pulling a wagon.

30:43.241 --> 30:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are two horses pulling in
the same direction,
and the court, particularly the
Supreme Court,

30:48.813 --> 30:53.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which kept striking down his
many pieces of
New Deal legislation, is pulling
in the opposite

30:53.885 --> 30:55.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
direction.

30:55.220 --> 30:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was a metaphor that the
American people
could understand.

30:56.921 --> 31:00.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they never supported in the
main or for
the majority his court-packing
plan.

31:00.758 --> 31:02.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it's not so
unusual, Michael.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is -- there has been a
frequency we
haven't seen.

31:05.496 --> 31:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: I think
that's right.

31:06.965 --> 31:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Reagan talked about
unelected judges.

31:08.833 --> 31:12.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in Trump's case, you have
had -- and this
is historically unusual -- two
big executive

31:13.004 --> 31:15.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
orders within these first 100
days, including
most recently sanctuary cities,
and earlier

31:15.607 --> 31:17.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the travel ban.

31:17.342 --> 31:19.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each time, he would say, almost
in anger,
this was something that an
unelected judge

31:19.477 --> 31:21.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
did, or something that a
so-called judge did.

31:21.813 --> 31:27.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's sort of the opposite of
conservatism,
because one of the things that
is most fundamental

31:27.685 --> 31:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in being a conservative is
having respect
for the democratic institutions
that we think

31:30.388 --> 31:32.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are important.

31:32.257 --> 31:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk,
finally, Barbara,
about what the first 100 days
tells us about

31:34.559 --> 31:36.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the rest of a presidency.

31:36.494 --> 31:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To what extent can we look at
Donald Trump's
first few months in office and
say this forecasts

31:41.499 --> 31:43.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whether he's going to be
successful or not?

31:43.501 --> 31:46.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA PERRY: Well, I'm from
Louisville,
Kentucky, originally, and we're
about to do

31:46.738 --> 31:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Kentucky Derby, so I say a
horse can stumble
out of the gate or it can be
running last

31:50.775 --> 31:51.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the first third...

31:51.876 --> 31:52.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Absolutely.

31:52.877 --> 31:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARBARA PERRY: ... and still
come on to win.

31:55.146 --> 32:01.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to the point about low
approval ratings
and Michael's point about not
necessarily

32:01.219 --> 32:08.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accomplishing all of the list of
things he
said he would do in the 100 days
doesn't mean

32:08.593 --> 32:15.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he won't be reelected or
that he will
have a failed presidency.

32:15.133 --> 32:20.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you think of someone like
Bill Clinton,
who had a rather chaotic start
in a host of

32:20.438 --> 32:23.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ways in those first 100 days,
and even up
to the Oklahoma City bombing in
1995, and

32:23.875 --> 32:26.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people were saying, oh, it's the
shrinking
presidency and the shrinking
Bill Clinton

32:26.377 --> 32:28.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as president, and yet he came on
strong.

32:28.112 --> 32:31.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we know that he was
reelected in '96.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's not a Ouija board.

32:33.751 --> 32:41.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as a professor, I would say
to the students
in the first third of the
semester, if they

32:41.225 --> 32:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scored lower than they wanted on
the first
test, I would say, you have more
tests to

32:46.564 --> 32:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do, you have a term paper,
participate in
class.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Trump still has many more
things on which
to be graded.

32:51.536 --> 32:53.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
this first...

32:53.604 --> 32:54.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

32:54.605 --> 32:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: I totally
agree with that.

32:56.507 --> 33:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is that it's a standard
that historically
doesn't tell us a lot, because
think of all

33:00.211 --> 33:01.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these presidents and what turns
out to be
important about their
administration, these

33:01.980 --> 33:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moments like Kennedy and the
missile crisis,
or Johnson and the Vietnam
escalation, or

33:06.050 --> 33:07.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
George W. Bush and 9/11.

33:07.552 --> 33:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
None of those things happened in
the first
-- during the first 100 days.

33:10.989 --> 33:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if we were having a great
conversation
like this 100 days into each of
those presidencies,

33:16.160 --> 33:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we wouldn't have been able to
predict what
historians now think was really
turning out

33:20.698 --> 33:22.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be pivotal.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael
Beschloss, Barbara
Perry, thank you both.

33:24.335 --> 33:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Thank you,
Judy.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARBARA PERRY: Thank you, Judy.

33:27.672 --> 33:31.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, tomorrow, we
will take
a look at the Trump
administration's successes

33:31.142 --> 33:33.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and setbacks overseas within its
first 100
days.

33:33.177 --> 33:37.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a look at a new film about
the brutal
Syrian civil war.

33:37.148 --> 33:38.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that story.

33:38.983 --> 33:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The French
government said
today its analysis of samples
from a chemical

33:41.652 --> 33:44.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack in Syria earlier this
month prove that
the government of Bashar
al-Assad was responsible.

33:44.222 --> 33:47.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That attack was one more flash
point in a
war that has now entered its
seventh year,

33:47.325 --> 33:52.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it is the subject of a
searing new documentary
called "Hell on Earth: The Fall
of Syria and

33:52.296 --> 33:54.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Rise of ISIS."

33:54.098 --> 33:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It debuts at the Tribeca Film
Festival this
week here in New York, and will
air later

33:59.170 --> 34:01.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this summer on National
Geographic.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is co-directed by the
journalist and author
Sebastian Junger, who also
narrates the film.

34:03.775 --> 34:05.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

34:05.610 --> 34:07.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER, Director,
"Hell on Earth:
The Fall of Syria and the Rise
of ISIS": Thank

34:08.012 --> 34:08.980 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

34:09.013 --> 34:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why make this
right now?

34:10.114 --> 34:11.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: We started
about two years
ago.

34:11.916 --> 34:24.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We wanted to explain why the
Syrian civil
war happened, how it evolved,
and particularly

34:24.429 --> 34:32.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
why ISIS came out of it.

34:32.637 --> 34:35.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ISIS is a kind of rare
phenomenon.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we wanted to explain that to
the American
people.

34:38.342 --> 34:41.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But there's a
family that
you intersperse throughout this
documentary.

34:41.712 --> 34:46.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are making their way out of
Syria, or
attempting to as they go along.

34:46.317 --> 34:52.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a real telling clip
early on in
the film where there's a father
just trying

34:52.423 --> 34:54.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to comfort his kids.

34:54.058 --> 34:55.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take a look.

34:55.626 --> 34:59.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Don't
be afraid,
dear.

34:59.297 --> 35:00.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't be afraid.

35:00.865 --> 35:02.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(CRYING)

35:02.166 --> 35:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Honestly, I'm about
to explode.

35:05.636 --> 35:10.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I can't express what is
happening inside of
me.

35:10.374 --> 35:15.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have to smile against my will,
so the kids
don't get scared.

35:15.246 --> 35:19.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, this is
juxtaposed with
a phrase that you have from
Syrian President

35:19.784 --> 35:22.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bashar al-Assad saying, we don't
indiscriminately
bomb anyone.

35:22.120 --> 35:26.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here we have a family who
clearly could
be the target of this.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yes.

35:28.426 --> 35:34.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, that clip shows a
nighttime bombing
by the Syrian government, by the
Syrian air

35:34.932 --> 35:35.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force.

35:35.933 --> 35:37.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Assad is just lying.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plenty of politicians do, and
he's one of
them.

35:39.871 --> 35:47.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
interesting things,
there's also a little map that
you have throughout

35:48.012 --> 35:54.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this film about how massive this
tiny country,
this tiny war has gotten,
meaning how many

35:54.585 --> 35:58.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other global partners or parties
are involved
in this.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not just the reason.

35:59.857 --> 36:05.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you have proxies in
Russia and the
United States involved, but you
also have

36:05.596 --> 36:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so many countries around it that
are involved
now.

36:08.866 --> 36:09.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yes.

36:09.967 --> 36:12.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, wars a little like
tumors.

36:12.537 --> 36:18.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, they sort of like
drawn draw in
more and more blood supply, and
they grow.

36:18.910 --> 36:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so there's arms going in.

36:21.612 --> 36:23.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's oil coming out.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's antiquities coming out.

36:25.249 --> 36:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's people coming out.

36:27.051 --> 36:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there's jihadis going in.

36:29.320 --> 36:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's the whole ecosystem.

36:32.056 --> 36:38.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And even on the sort of
diplomatic level,
on the sort of national level,
there are a

36:38.863 --> 36:43.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good dozen countries that are
directly involved
in the mechanics of that war,
and some very,

36:43.267 --> 36:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very powerful players in the
world.

36:45.002 --> 36:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's like a bar fight that,
you know,
the longer it goes on, the more
people are

36:47.905 --> 36:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involved, until everyone is
fighting, and
one of the rationales for
stepping in early

36:50.074 --> 36:54.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and trying to stop these civil
wars before
they get this kind of critical
mass.

36:54.712 --> 37:00.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
stepping in
early or later, one of the
things that you

37:00.518 --> 37:05.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point out is that there's a
legacy that goes
all the way back, perhaps, to
the de-Baathification

37:05.323 --> 37:09.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Iraq and how that contributed
to what is
happening in Syria.

37:09.794 --> 37:17.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also you take a fairly
pointed look at
President Obama and the red line
and the United

37:17.268 --> 37:21.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States' inability to do anything
after that
red line was crossed.

37:21.138 --> 37:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Oh, there are
huge missteps
by the United States, the
invasion of Iraq

37:30.615 --> 37:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
arguably being one of them.

37:32.617 --> 37:38.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After we invaded Iraq, the
de-Baathification
put on the street tens of
thousands of Baath

37:38.456 --> 37:43.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party members who weren't
necessarily loyalists,
but they were sort of expelled
from government,

37:43.561 --> 37:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expelled from the military,
expelled from
their jobs.

37:45.596 --> 37:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we helped install a
Shia government
in Baghdad that really starting
preying on

37:49.467 --> 37:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these people, killing them.

37:51.369 --> 37:54.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so of course those people
saw ISIS as
-- ISIS presented themselves as
their protectors.

37:54.372 --> 37:58.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, you know, of course,
that -- you know,
that worked quite well for ISIS.

37:58.609 --> 38:03.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And had that not happened --
and, you know,
this analysis comes from
American generals.

38:03.247 --> 38:05.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This isn't some sort of far-out
left-wing
analysis.

38:05.650 --> 38:10.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are American generals
looking back at
the war in Iraq and thinking, my
God, was

38:10.821 --> 38:12.590 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that a mistake.

38:12.623 --> 38:17.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the ripple
effects now
it has even going all the way up
into Europe

38:17.662 --> 38:19.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and even political repercussions
of the migrant
influx into Europe.

38:19.597 --> 38:21.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Yes.

38:21.465 --> 38:25.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the modern world, and maybe
even the ancient
world, you really can't say that
someone else's

38:25.603 --> 38:26.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
problems aren't your problems.

38:26.771 --> 38:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They will eventually reach you.

38:28.172 --> 38:29.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My first war was Bosnia.

38:29.940 --> 38:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a war that a lot of
people sort of
ignored, but it started just
pumping millions

38:34.045 --> 38:36.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of refugees out of Eastern
Europe into neighboring
countries, and along with that
came a lot

38:36.981 --> 38:41.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of problems, including organized
crime into
allied countries, countries that
we're allied

38:41.085 --> 38:42.420 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

38:42.453 --> 38:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, eventually, President
Clinton stepped
in and put a stop to it.

38:45.489 --> 38:47.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there are real consequences.

38:47.425 --> 38:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Syria, it's a sort of
cauldron of an
awful lot of things that will
affect us, refugees,

38:52.763 --> 38:56.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism, and a huge nexus of
sort of illegal
activity, arms sales, drugs,
antiquities.

38:56.701 --> 39:01.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And wars are not something you
want happening
in the world, and they will
affect everybody,

39:01.072 --> 39:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including people in the United
States.

39:02.807 --> 39:04.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think people don't quite
understand that.

39:04.642 --> 39:06.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sebastian
Junger, thanks
for joining us.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER: Thank you.

39:08.579 --> 39:13.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
has long said
he wants to build a hardened
wall across the

39:13.184 --> 39:17.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S.-Mexico border to reduce the
flow of drugs
and illegal immigration.

39:17.588 --> 39:22.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what would a continuous wall
from California
to Texas mean for wildlife in
the area?

39:22.560 --> 39:25.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham is back again
with a report
from Arizona.

39:25.229 --> 39:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is part of our weekly series
examining
the leading edge of science.

39:28.499 --> 39:31.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tens of
thousands of migrants
risk their lives each year
crossing this dangerous,

39:31.936 --> 39:34.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remote desert between the U.S.
and Mexico.

39:34.271 --> 39:40.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some have found creative ways to
get over
or around the steel fences built
to keep them

39:40.111 --> 39:41.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

39:41.812 --> 39:45.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many of the wild plants and
animals here
in the Sonoran Desert can't do
that.

39:45.349 --> 39:48.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These miles of fencing divide
their natural
habitat and threaten their
survival.

39:48.219 --> 39:52.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least 50 species near the
border are already
endangered, like the Sonoran
pronghorn, the

39:52.590 --> 39:54.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gray wolf and the ocelot.

39:54.158 --> 39:56.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS,
Arizona-Sonora Desert
Museum: Nature has no borders.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nature knows no political
boundaries.

39:58.295 --> 40:00.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sergio
Avila-Villegas is
a wildlife biologist with the
Arizona-Sonora

40:00.698 --> 40:02.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Desert Museum in Tucson.

40:02.700 --> 40:07.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's spent the last 16 years
studying this
area.

40:07.238 --> 40:12.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took us to the Coronado
National Memorial
in the Huachuca Mountains on the
Arizona-Mexico

40:12.777 --> 40:14.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
border.

40:14.545 --> 40:19.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says the border fence -- you
can see it
there in the distance -- means
animals have

40:19.116 --> 40:21.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to range farther afield to find
food, water
and mates.

40:21.819 --> 40:26.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's this one, what seems to
my eye a very
thin fence that runs across the
border, but

40:26.223 --> 40:31.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're saying this really does
have a major
impact on the species that live
here?

40:31.362 --> 40:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS: From a
sparrow perspective,
from a grasshopper perspective,
and from even

40:35.499 --> 40:41.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plant perspective, this is a
very difficult
thing to overcome, and this
blocks reproduction

40:41.272 --> 40:43.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of plants and animals.

40:43.073 --> 40:47.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In one study
from 2011,
biologists found border fences
increased the

40:47.344 --> 40:50.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk of population decline and
extinction,
especially for endangered
species.

40:50.748 --> 40:55.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another study from the same year
found border
security infrastructure could
interfere with

40:55.286 --> 40:57.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
black bear breeding.

40:57.254 --> 41:01.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the border fence between
the U.S. and
Mexico went up about 10 years
ago, conservationists

41:01.225 --> 41:03.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tried to stop it, but ultimately
lost that
fight.

41:03.160 --> 41:05.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eighty percent of Arizona's
border with Mexico
has some kind of barrier.

41:05.696 --> 41:08.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gaps do occasionally exist where
wildlife
can pass, but finding those
places isn't easy.

41:08.632 --> 41:12.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I would build a great wall.

41:12.536 --> 41:18.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now that
President Trump
plans to build what may be a
continuous wall

41:18.542 --> 41:23.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from California to Texas,
Avila-Villegas and
other scientists worry this will
only accelerate

41:23.747 --> 41:25.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the extinction of some animals.

41:25.616 --> 41:28.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS:
Long-term, this could
be a division of genetical
populations, where

41:28.552 --> 41:35.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a group of animals from one side
cannot reproduce
with another group of animals,
breaking the

41:35.793 --> 41:37.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
connectivity, creating some
genetical problems.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The survival of the species is
at risk.

41:40.197 --> 41:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Species like
this jaguar,
which was spotted several times
in Arizona

41:44.835 --> 41:46.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the last few years.

41:46.704 --> 41:50.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Historically, these jaguars
roamed from the
Southwest United States down
through the Amazon

41:50.641 --> 41:52.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Basin, all the way to Argentina.

41:52.476 --> 41:57.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists estimate this big cat
now occupies
less than half of its original
range because

41:57.414 --> 41:59.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of habitat loss and poaching.

41:59.049 --> 42:02.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There may be fewer than 50,000
breeding adults
left.

42:02.052 --> 42:06.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS: If
there's an impermeable
barrier, we are losing the
opportunity to

42:06.724 --> 42:12.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have the third largest cat in
the world to
recover its populations in the
United States.

42:12.263 --> 42:14.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jaguars deserve an opportunity
to live in
this place too.

42:14.298 --> 42:18.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Coronado
National Memorial
is considered a critical habitat
zone, meaning

42:18.202 --> 42:21.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would normally be protected
by the Endangered
Species Act.

42:21.605 --> 42:23.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Congress wanted the fence
built quickly.

42:23.974 --> 42:27.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 2005, it allowed the
Department of Homeland
Security to bypass all
environmental laws

42:27.945 --> 42:30.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during construction, including
the requirement
to study what this fence would
do to wildlife.

42:30.781 --> 42:33.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Congressman Rob Bishop,
Republican from Utah,
thinks those exemptions aren't
enough.

42:34.018 --> 42:39.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's introduced legislation that
would extend
those legal waivers to Border
Patrol agents,

42:39.089 --> 42:42.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who do have to obey
environmental laws.

42:42.326 --> 42:44.061 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

42:44.094 --> 42:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROB BISHOP (R), Utah: So,
everything from
California to Texas is almost
all federal

42:49.300 --> 42:54.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
property, and over half of that
is in a wilderness
designation, which has specific
requirements

42:54.104 --> 42:56.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for what can and cannot be done.

42:56.173 --> 43:01.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where the Border Patrol
is prohibited
from doing their job, and that's
the mistake,

43:01.845 --> 43:05.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because that becomes the avenue
for most of
the illegal entrants into this
country.

43:05.282 --> 43:13.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it has a direct
correlation to
the amount of federal land and
the amount

43:13.691 --> 43:18.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of restrictions the Border
Patrol has on how
they can do their jobs on that
corridor.

43:18.729 --> 43:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Border Patrol
can't build
bases, towers, or roads without
permission

43:22.499 --> 43:26.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from other federal agencies,
like the Fish
and Wildlife Service.

43:26.704 --> 43:33.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also not allowed to
drive over protected
lands, a rule smugglers don't
have to follow.

43:33.677 --> 43:39.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNDI TUELL, Environmental
Attorney: We have
one of the largest wilderness
areas in a national

43:39.750 --> 43:50.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wildlife refuge in Southern
Arizona, and Border
Patrol has been driving over it
for close

43:50.661 --> 43:58.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to a decade.

43:58.402 --> 44:01.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Cyndi Tuell is
an environmental
lawyer and border lands
conservation advocate

44:01.605 --> 44:05.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who says she's seen Border
Patrol in places
they're not supposed to be.

44:05.309 --> 44:16.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNDI TUELL: The main focus of
my work as
a conservation attorney is to
try to get Border

44:16.754 --> 44:22.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Patrol, Department of Homeland
Security to
follow the law.

44:22.693 --> 44:25.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they're one of the largest
law enforcement
agencies in the country, they
very much need

44:25.996 --> 44:27.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be complying with the law
themselves.

44:27.865 --> 44:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She spends
part of her time
travelling the backcountry,
looking for signs

44:30.034 --> 44:31.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Border Patrol's impact on
public lands.

44:31.835 --> 44:34.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says their vehicles can
crush vegetation
and erode soil, and that habitat
is destroyed

44:34.271 --> 44:36.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when they build bases and
surveillance towers.

44:36.073 --> 44:37.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNDI TUELL: Every time I'm out
here, though,
I interact with a Border Patrol
agent, or

44:37.708 --> 44:39.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I see the signs of
militarization.

44:39.309 --> 44:40.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I see tanks.

44:40.310 --> 44:42.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I see heavily armed men.

44:42.112 --> 44:45.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see vehicle tracks two or
three miles into
a wilderness area that I know
shouldn't be

44:45.749 --> 44:47.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GIL KERLIKOWSKE, Former
Commissioner, U.S.
Customs and Border Protection:
Customs and

44:49.687 --> 44:55.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Border Protection has to be able
to be on
the borders, whether it's in
environmentally

44:55.959 --> 44:57.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sensitive land or not.

44:57.895 --> 45:01.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Gil
Kerlikowske served as
the commissioner for customs and
border protection

45:01.432 --> 45:03.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from 2014 until the new
administration took
over.

45:03.634 --> 45:05.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's now a fellow at Harvard
University.

45:05.602 --> 45:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIL KERLIKOWSKE: I think it's
very difficult
for those agents and their
vehicles and other

45:09.573 --> 45:13.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
types of equipment to be in an
area and not
to leave some type of footprint.

45:13.844 --> 45:18.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would mention that, as
often as hard
as they work to try and reduce
their environmental

45:18.115 --> 45:24.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact, I think there's always
going to be,
as a result of that human
intervention, some

45:24.421 --> 45:27.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
type of an effect on the
environment.

45:27.391 --> 45:30.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS: The
infrastructure
seems to be a
one-solution-fits-all for many

45:30.828 --> 45:33.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different problems, and I don't
think it's
addressing the root causes.

45:34.031 --> 45:38.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really think that the
environment is
paying the ultimate price for
this.

45:38.469 --> 45:41.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Have you and
the conservation
community made those concerns
known to the

45:41.772 --> 45:43.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Border Patrol and the Customs
and Border Protection?

45:43.540 --> 45:47.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGIO AVILA-VILLEGAS: A lot of
our concerns
have been voiced through the
conservation

45:47.945 --> 45:51.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and science community to the
Department of
Homeland Security.

45:51.181 --> 45:53.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They don't go anywhere.

45:53.083 --> 45:58.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Border Patrol and the
Department of Homeland
Security have no mandate to
listen to these

45:58.756 --> 46:00.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
concerns.

46:00.524 --> 46:02.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We asked the
Department
of Homeland Security if they
have required

46:02.426 --> 46:07.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any passageways for wildlife in
the solicitations
they have put out to contractors
who want

46:07.264 --> 46:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to build the new wall.

46:09.266 --> 46:11.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have told us that the
current plans -- quote
-- "will not result in
significant environmental

46:11.301 --> 46:12.836 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
impacts.

46:12.870 --> 46:15.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, for this particular
project,
DHS is not planning for
mitigation."

46:15.506 --> 46:19.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump ordered 5,000
more agents
be hired and deployed along the
border, and

46:19.710 --> 46:22.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plans for his wall are now being
drafted.

46:22.112 --> 46:25.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The few wildlife corridors that
do remain
could soon be closed for good.

46:25.983 --> 46:28.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the Sonoran Desert in
Arizona, I'm William
Brangham for the "PBS NewsHour."

JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally
tonight, Hari Sreenivasan
is back with an appreciation of
an Oscar-winning

46:33.056 --> 46:34.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
director.

46:34.057 --> 46:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANTHONY HOPKINS, Actor: Quid pro
quo.

46:35.826 --> 46:40.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tell you things, you tell me
things, not
about this case, though, about
yourself.

46:40.063 --> 46:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After years
making B-movies,
Jonathan Demme's first major
commercial success

46:42.900 --> 46:44.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was 1991's "Silence of the
Lambs," and, for
many, would remain his
best-known film.

46:45.002 --> 46:52.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dark thriller, based on a
book, followed
Jodie Foster as an FBI field
agent on the

46:52.943 --> 46:55.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hunt for a serial killer, using
the counsel
of a psychopath named Hannibal
Lecter, played

46:55.145 --> 46:56.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by Anthony Hopkins.

46:56.413 --> 46:57.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY HOPKINS: What is your
worst memory
of childhood?

46:57.414 --> 46:58.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JODIE FOSTER, Actress: The death
of my father.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY HOPKINS: Tell me about
it, and don't
lie, or I will know.

47:00.584 --> 47:03.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JODIE FOSTER: He was a town
marshal, and one
night, he surprised two burglars
coming out

47:04.021 --> 47:05.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the back of a drugstore.

47:05.889 --> 47:07.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They shot him.

47:07.357 --> 47:13.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It earned
Demme the Academy
Award for best director.

47:13.330 --> 47:22.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KEVIN COSTNER, Actor: To
Jonathan Demme for
"Silence of the Lambs."

47:22.439 --> 47:24.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

47:24.308 --> 47:28.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it remains
the only
horror film to ever win for best
picture.

47:28.779 --> 47:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JONATHAN DEMME, Director: Hi,
mom.

47:30.614 --> 47:38.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And thanks for transferring your
love of movies
to me.

47:38.188 --> 47:45.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And thanks, dad, for making me
think I could
actually be part of this
industry.

47:45.329 --> 47:46.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And thank you.

47:46.730 --> 47:48.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mike Sargent
is a film critic
for Pacifica Radio.

47:48.498 --> 47:55.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT, Film Critic,
Pacifica Radio:
At the time, a thriller and
horror were kind

47:55.172 --> 47:59.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of seen to be the same thing.

47:59.176 --> 48:04.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a movie about a serial
killer is not the
kind of movie that really gets
acclaim.

48:04.448 --> 48:09.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he took something that
could've been considered
pulpy, and really turned it into
high art.

48:09.786 --> 48:11.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He really elevated the form.

48:11.154 --> 48:13.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But Demme did
more than
crime thrillers.

48:13.590 --> 48:17.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over his career, he made indie
films, dramas,
documentaries, comedies and
concert movies,

48:17.194 --> 48:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too, including 1984's "Stop
Making Sense,"
a stylized look at the band the
Talking Heads.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENZEL WASHINGTON, Actor: So,
you were concealing
your illness.

48:25.969 --> 48:32.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In 1993, Demme
directed
"Philadelphia," one of the first
major Hollywood

48:32.576 --> 48:34.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
films to confront the HIV/AIDS
crisis.

48:34.578 --> 48:40.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It starred Denzel Washington and
Tom Hanks,
who won an Oscar for his
portrayal of a gay

48:40.317 --> 48:42.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lawyer infected with HIV.

48:42.252 --> 48:46.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENZEL WASHINGTON: Didn't you
have an obligation
to tell your employer you had
this dreaded,

48:46.356 --> 48:47.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deadly, infectious disease?

48:47.357 --> 48:50.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOM HANKS, Actor: That's not the
point.

48:50.761 --> 49:05.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the day they hired me to
the day I was
fired, I served my clients
consistently, thoroughly,

49:05.108 --> 49:07.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with absolute excellence.

49:07.444 --> 49:16.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they hadn't fired me, that's
what I would
be doing today.

49:16.853 --> 49:22.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Five years
later, Demme
directed the adaptation of Toni
Morrison's

49:22.826 --> 49:24.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
novel "Beloved," starring Oprah
Winfrey.

49:24.428 --> 49:27.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OPRAH WINFREY, Actress: Could
stay the night,
if you had a mind to.

49:27.998 --> 49:31.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANNY GLOVER, Actor: You don't
sound too steady
in the offer.

49:31.201 --> 49:32.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OPRAH WINFREY: Oh, it's truly
meant.

49:32.903 --> 49:35.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's just I hope you will pardon
my house.

49:35.739 --> 49:36.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANNY GLOVER: "My house."

49:36.974 --> 49:38.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I like the sound of that.

49:38.775 --> 49:44.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: He was definitely
someone who
I think was sensitive to issues
of race and

49:44.214 --> 49:45.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sexuality and things like that.

49:45.449 --> 49:47.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM HANKS: What I loved the most
about the
law?

49:47.851 --> 49:49.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DENZEL WASHINGTON: Yes.

49:49.619 --> 49:56.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM HANKS: Is that every now and
again, not
often, but occasionally, you get
to be a part

49:56.293 --> 49:59.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM HANKS: Is that every now and
again, not
often, but occasionally, you get
to be a part

50:27.124 --> 50:29.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of justice being done.

50:29.192 --> 50:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: I think he stacks
up there in
the top 25 of great American
directors, I

50:35.866 --> 50:39.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: I think he stacks
up there in
the top 25 of great American
directors, I
