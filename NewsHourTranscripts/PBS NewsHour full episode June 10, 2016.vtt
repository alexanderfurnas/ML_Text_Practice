JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.139 --> 00:11.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
saying goodbye
to the greatest. Thousands
gather to celebrate

00:11.445 --> 00:16.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the life of boxing legend
Muhammad Ali in
his home town of Louisville,
Kentucky.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:18.518 --> 00:20.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Donald Trump would take us in
the wrong direction

00:20.387 --> 00:22.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on so many issues we care about.

00:22.322 --> 00:24.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Hillary Clinton's Wall Street
agenda will

00:24.958 --> 00:26.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crush working families.

00:26.860 --> 00:31.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a new phase of
the presidential
race, Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump go

00:31.798 --> 00:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
head to head for the first time
as the two
likely nominees.

00:36.637 --> 00:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's Friday. Mark Shields
and David Brooks
analyze a full week of news.

00:42.442 --> 00:47.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead, it's a big year for
the stage.
With the Tonys around the
corner, we look

00:47.347 --> 00:51.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at standout stage productions,
including the
record-setting musical
"Hamilton."

00:51.118 --> 00:54.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN BRANTLEY, Chief Theater
Critic, The New
York Times: But it really is
unlike anything

00:54.421 --> 00:59.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's come on Broadway before,
and it's drawing
audiences that Broadway hasn't
really brought

00:59.693 --> 01:01.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in en masse in many years.

01:01.895 --> 01:09.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:09.636 --> 01:12.372 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:12.472 --> 01:22.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
confirmed today
that the military now has
approval to expand

01:22.482 --> 01:28.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airstrikes in Afghanistan. They
will be in
support of Afghan troops against
the Taliban.

01:28.422 --> 01:32.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And U.S. ground forces will be
joining Afghan
units on more missions.

01:32.859 --> 01:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, White House
spokesman Josh
Earnest stressed that the U.S.
will not be

01:37.397 --> 01:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taking on direct combat roles.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
We are actually giving our
commanders on the

01:42.636 --> 01:48.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground the ability to decide to
do more where
it's appropriate. And that's why
it is not

01:49.042 --> 01:53.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a change in our mission, but
rather it gives
them the ability to conduct this
mission of

01:53.880 --> 02:00.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
advice and assistance in
slightly more areas,
if our commanders have concluded
that it's

02:00.487 --> 02:02.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beneficial.

02:02.556 --> 02:06.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Afghan leaders
have been appealing
for American airpower to resume
backing up

02:06.326 --> 02:10.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their soldiers. U.S. airstrikes
on the Taliban
largely ended in 2014.

02:11.098 --> 02:17.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, food deliveries have
reached the
besieged rebel suburb of
Damascus, for the

02:17.504 --> 02:23.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first time in four years. U.N.
and Red Crescent
officials entered the town of
Daraya overnight.

02:24.044 --> 02:29.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's been under siege by
government forces.
Dozens of convoys brought in
basic food items

02:29.983 --> 02:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and medical supplies. The U.N.
estimates between
4,000 and 8,000 people are
living in Daraya.

02:36.757 --> 02:44.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The European soccer
championship, Euro 2016,
kicked off today in France, amid
tight security.

02:44.398 --> 02:49.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country is still under a
state of emergency
after terror attacks in recent
months. And

02:49.803 --> 02:54.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tensions surged last night in
Marseilles,
when fights broke out.

02:54.174 --> 02:58.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keme Nzerem of Independent
Television News
reports.

02:58.178 --> 03:07.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEME NZEREM: This is not what
France needs,
more violence in Marseille,
where England

03:07.554 --> 03:13.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is playing Russia tomorrow, and
reports spreading
of more trouble between rival
fans and local

03:13.827 --> 03:16.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
youths, like there was last
night.

03:16.997 --> 03:23.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, people are
twitchy for another
reason. France is under a state
of emergency,

03:23.970 --> 03:30.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but last night tens of thousands
danced the
night away at the opening
concert in Paris.

03:30.277 --> 03:35.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly 100,000 more have flocked
into the
Stade de France for the opening
game.

03:35.348 --> 03:42.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yards away, this anonymous side
street. Many
fans will be oblivious to the
secrets it holds,

03:42.489 --> 03:49.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but not Aca Pavlovic. Last
November, he nearly
died when shrapnel from suicide
bombs strafed

03:49.696 --> 03:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this lamppost and his flesh.

03:52.099 --> 03:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Aca will be back tonight,
selling scarves
to raise money for survivors
like him.

03:58.839 --> 04:04.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACA PAVLOVIC, Attack Survivor
(through translator):
It is a stadium. The game goes
on, and so

04:04.978 --> 04:11.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
does life. People need to
celebrate and go
and see the games. And that
makes me happy.

04:11.384 --> 04:17.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEME NZEREM: Into this cauldron
of hopes and
dreams, fans from 24 European
countries are

04:17.357 --> 04:20.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pouring. But it is France, no
doubt, with
the most at stake.

04:20.961 --> 04:25.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The month-long
tournament comes
as France is struggling with
strikes by garbage

04:25.699 --> 04:28.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
collectors and public transit
workers.

04:28.568 --> 04:34.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A wave of religious murders
surged again today
in Bangladesh. A Hindu holy man
was hacked

04:34.474 --> 04:39.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to death by suspected Islamist
militants in
the country's north. That
follows the killing

04:40.080 --> 04:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a Hindu priest, and a fatal
attack on a
Christian grocery store owner
earlier this

04:45.685 --> 04:50.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week. Police have launched a
crackdown, and
detained hundreds of suspects.

04:51.024 --> 04:56.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the man
they called
Mr. Hockey, Gordie Howe, died
today. He's

04:56.296 --> 04:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
considered one of the greatest
players ever.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has more on his life.

05:01.134 --> 05:05.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: That's right, Gordie
Howe is on
his way to his third goal of
this game.

05:05.639 --> 05:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He had some of the
best skills,
and sharpest elbows, in the
game, second on

05:11.044 --> 05:17.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the all-time scoring list with
801 goals and
winner of four Stanley Cups with
the Detroit

05:17.117 --> 05:25.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Red Wings. Gordie Howe's 32-year
career spanned
five decades, as The Detroit
Free Press put

05:25.358 --> 05:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it today, from World War II
through Vietnam,
Truman to Carter, Sinatra to the
Sex Pistols.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau spoke
of Howe's legacy.

05:36.870 --> 05:42.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, Canadian Prime
Minister: His
career inspired and gave rise to
many, many

05:42.342 --> 05:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dreams and many, many Canadians
of what could
be, what might be.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: And Howe was in the
right place
at the right time.

05:48.548 --> 05:54.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Howe was the league's
most valuable
player six times. A gentleman
off the ice,

05:54.554 --> 06:01.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was a ferocious competitor on
it. During
his career, he had some 500
stitches to his

06:01.127 --> 06:02.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
face alone.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GORDIE HOWE, Former Professional
Hockey Player:
In my early days, I would yell,
look out,

06:04.731 --> 06:08.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then I would hit him. If I
didn't like
him, I would yell out when I hit
him.

06:08.168 --> 06:13.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He retired after the
1971 season,
but came back two years later to
play in the

06:13.840 --> 06:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
upstart World Hockey Association
with his
sons Mark and Marty.

06:17.844 --> 06:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: Coming up on the
right side, Howe
over the line to his father.

06:21.681 --> 06:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They were the only
father-son teammates
in pro sports. Howe called it
the highlight

06:27.787 --> 06:34.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of his career. He was a
52-year-old grandfather
when he left the game for good.

06:34.394 --> 06:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Howe was diagnosed with dementia
in 2012 and
suffered two strokes in 2014. He
was 88 years

06:42.269 --> 06:43.103 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
old.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

06:45.472 --> 06:51.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A milestone of a
decidedly
different sort for the first
family, today:

06:51.578 --> 06:55.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Obama's oldest
daughter, Malia,
graduated from high school. She
attended the

06:56.016 --> 07:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
private Sidwell Friends School
in Washington,
and plans to take a gap year
before starting

07:01.454 --> 07:03.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
college at Harvard.

07:03.690 --> 07:09.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street had its second
off day in
a row, as stocks were hit by
falling oil prices,

07:09.396 --> 07:14.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and global growth concerns. The
Dow Jones
industrial average lost nearly
120 points

07:14.768 --> 07:23.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to close at 17865. The Nasdaq
fell 64, and
the S&amp;P 500 slipped 19.

07:23.677 --> 07:29.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a funeral
fit for the greatest, Muhammad
Ali; Donald

07:29.582 --> 07:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump and Hillary Clinton trade
barbs; a day
in the life of a middle-class
family struggling

07:35.655 --> 07:50.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make ends meet; and much
more.

07:50.303 --> 07:56.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The famous and the anonymous
alike paid tribute
today to Muhammad Ali. Their
final farewell

07:56.376 --> 08:01.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
came in his hometown,
Louisville, Kentucky.

08:01.748 --> 08:07.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was a day-long tribute
befitting the man
known as the greatest. Muhammad
Ali began

08:08.021 --> 08:14.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his final journey at a
Louisville funeral
home. The casket, draped in an
Islamic shroud,

08:14.661 --> 08:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was guided into a hearse by
pallbearers who
included actor Will Smith and
former heavyweight

08:21.067 --> 08:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
champion Mike Tyson. A butterfly
symbol, a
nod to Ali's signature phrase,
float like

08:27.741 --> 08:31.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a butterfly, sting like a bee,
adorned the
windshield.

08:31.911 --> 08:39.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From there, the 17-car motorcade
wound its
way through Louisville, with
thousands lining

08:39.486 --> 08:41.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the streets.

08:41.588 --> 08:45.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CROWD: Ali! Ali! Ali!

08:45.825 --> 08:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: His impact transcends
across the world.
It's just a blessing and it
makes us as Louisvillians

08:49.929 --> 08:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proud that he's from our city
and our hometown.

08:53.733 --> 08:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some even touched
the hearse,
while others ran alongside it.
And the procession

08:59.806 --> 09:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paused at sites of significance,
such as the
Ali Center in downtown
Louisville, and the

09:07.414 --> 09:11.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
boxing legend's childhood home.

09:11.584 --> 09:18.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 19-mile procession ended at
Cave Hill
Cemetery on a road strewn with
flower petals.

09:18.691 --> 09:24.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muhammad Ali chose the site a
decade ago as
his final resting place, with a
headstone

09:24.831 --> 09:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be inscribed simply "Ali."

09:26.800 --> 09:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: He spoke to the people.
He spoke to
all people. All people came
together regardless

09:31.938 --> 09:35.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of race and gender and religion.
Everyone
came together.

09:35.141 --> 09:41.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The burial
service was private,
but 15,000 people turned out for
the public

09:41.648 --> 09:48.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
memorial service that followed.
Ali himself
had requested the event be open
to ordinary

09:48.221 --> 09:54.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fans, and hundreds of
celebrities, dignitaries
and sports greats joined them.

09:54.327 --> 10:01.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They ranged from Jesse Jackson
to Arnold Schwarzenegger,
Utah Senator Orrin Hatch, whom
Ali befriended

10:01.935 --> 10:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the 1980s and who spoke at
the service.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The formal eulogies began with
Ali's widow,
Lonnie:

10:08.074 --> 10:13.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE ALI, Widow of Muhammad
Ali: The boy
from Grand Avenue in Louisville,
Kentucky,

10:13.613 --> 10:20.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
grew in wisdom from his
journeys. He discovered
something new, that the world
really wasn't

10:20.787 --> 10:26.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black and white at all. It was
filled with
many shades of rich colors,
languages and

10:26.793 --> 10:28.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
religions.

10:28.661 --> 10:32.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as he moved with ease
around the world,
the rich and powerful were drawn
to him, but

10:32.866 --> 10:34.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was drawn to the poor and the
forgotten.

10:35.068 --> 10:40.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there was
comedian Billy
Crystal, dubbed little brother
by the three-time

10:40.740 --> 10:47.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heavyweight champion. Crystal's
famous 1979
routine "15 Rounds" was about
Ali.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILLY CRYSTAL, Comedian: It's
great to look
at clips, and it's amazing that
we have them,

10:51.217 --> 10:58.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but to live in his time,
watching his fights,
experiencing the genius of his
talent, was

10:58.391 --> 11:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
absolutely extraordinary. Every
one of his
fights was an aura of a Super
Bowl. He did

11:04.564 --> 11:09.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things nobody would do. He
predicted the round
that he would knock somebody
out, and then

11:09.102 --> 11:10.637 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he would do it.

11:10.737 --> 11:12.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

11:12.739 --> 11:15.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILLY CRYSTAL: He was funny. He
was beautiful.
He was the most perfect athlete
you ever saw,

11:15.475 --> 11:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and those were his own words.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

11:19.178 --> 11:25.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Journalist Bryant
Gumbel met
Ali as a teenager, and in 1991
interviewed

11:25.518 --> 11:28.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
him about the Parkinson's
disease that he
battled for decades.

11:29.055 --> 11:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYANT GUMBEL, Journalist: Some
of us like
him took pride in being black,
bold and brash.

11:34.961 --> 11:45.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And because we were so
unapologetic, we were
in the eyes of many way too
uppity. We were

11:45.672 --> 11:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way too arrogant. Yet we reveled
in being
like him. By stretching
society's boundaries

11:55.181 --> 12:02.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as he did, he gave us levels of
strength and
courage we didn't even know we
had.

12:02.288 --> 12:08.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former President
Bill Clinton
presented Ali with a Citizens
Medal in 2001,

12:08.995 --> 12:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and spoke at the dedication of
the Ali Center
four years later. He gave the
day's final

12:15.101 --> 12:16.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
eulogy.

12:17.036 --> 12:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, Former President
of the United
States: I think he decided,
before he could

12:20.907 --> 12:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possibly have worked it all out,
and before
fate and time could work their
will on him,

12:31.384 --> 12:38.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he decided that he wouldn't be
ever disempowered.

12:38.725 --> 12:44.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He decided that not his race,
nor his place,
nor the expectations of others,
positive,

12:45.098 --> 12:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
negative or otherwise, would
strip from him
the power to write his own
story.

12:53.773 --> 13:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Muhammad Ali died
one week
ago today at the age of 74.

13:18.398 --> 13:23.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two presumptive nominees for
president
were in Washington today, each
speaking to

13:23.469 --> 13:28.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a friendly crowd and trying out
attack lines
aimed at the other.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins reports.

13:30.209 --> 13:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It was an
effort to reassure
the religious right, Donald
Trump speaking

13:36.049 --> 13:40.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to an evangelical Christian
audience at the
Faith and Freedom Coalition's
conference in

13:40.720 --> 13:42.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

13:42.555 --> 13:46.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We want to uphold the sanctity
and dignity

13:46.492 --> 13:47.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of life.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

13:50.029 --> 13:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Religious freedom,
the right
for people of faith to freely
practice their

13:57.570 --> 13:59.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
faith, so important.

13:59.505 --> 14:03.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At the same
time, he tried
to address recent accusations of
racism, including

14:03.743 --> 14:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from some in his own party.

14:05.645 --> 14:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Freedom of any
kind means no
one should be judged by their
race or their

14:11.417 --> 14:18.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
color and the color of their
skin, shouldn't
be judged that way. And, right
now, we have

14:18.257 --> 14:21.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a very divided nation. We're
going to bring
our nation together.

14:21.260 --> 14:25.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump seemed to
gain ground
with the crowd, if not a full
embrace.

14:25.364 --> 14:30.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WHITNEY BLOUNT, Conservative
Voter: I came
in a little skeptical, but his
speech was

14:30.970 --> 14:36.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really what I wanted to hear.
But I continue
to be a little skeptical. But I
am more excited

14:36.576 --> 14:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the outcome of what a
president could
over Christian voters.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PENNY YOUNG NANCE, Concerned
Women for America:
This is a room full of
conservative voters,

14:43.449 --> 14:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so I think they came into this
ready to vote
for him, but the question now,
but the question

14:48.121 --> 14:49.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, how hard will they work for
him?

14:50.056 --> 14:53.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And the
Republican presumptive
nominee tries to shore up his
argument with

14:53.826 --> 15:00.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the religious right, Hillary
Clinton, she's
pounding away with her base on
the left.

15:00.299 --> 15:03.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton was also in the nation's
capital,
at a Planned Parenthood event,
giving her

15:03.970 --> 15:06.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first speech as the Democratic
Party's presumptive
nominee.

15:06.906 --> 15:11.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
When Donald Trump says let's
make America

15:11.110 --> 15:23.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
great again, that is code for
let's take America
backward, back to a time when
opportunity

15:23.790 --> 15:30.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and dignity were reserved for
some, not all,
back to the days when abortion
was illegal,

15:30.997 --> 15:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women had far fewer options, and
life for
too many women and girls was
limited.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

15:39.038 --> 15:41.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Last night,
following a day
of endorsements from the
president and vice

15:41.974 --> 15:45.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, Clinton also received
the backing
of progressive champion
Massachusetts Senator

15:46.012 --> 15:47.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Elizabeth Warren.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D),
Massachusetts:
I am ready to get in this fight
and work my

15:50.116 --> 15:54.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heart out for Hillary Clinton to
become the
next president of the United
States and to

15:54.187 --> 15:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make sure that Donald Trump
never gets any
place close to the White House.

15:58.224 --> 16:01.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This morning,
the senator
and the candidate met at the
Clintons' Washington

16:02.094 --> 16:08.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home. Clinton later declined to
respond when
asked if Warren is a potential
running mate.

16:08.334 --> 16:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton hosts a fund-raiser at
her D.C. home
tonight, while Trump holds a
rally in Richmond,

16:13.206 --> 16:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Virginia. Their job now? Excite
their respective
bases enough to come out in
November.

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa

JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

16:34.393 --> 16:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks on this week's
political

16:38.631 --> 16:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
news; and Broadway's landmark
year ahead of
Sunday's Tony Awards.

16:43.603 --> 16:49.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, first: the financial
pressures of the
middle class. It's part of what
you're hearing

16:49.141 --> 16:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from voters and on the campaign
trail this
year.

16:52.178 --> 16:57.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we zero in on the case
of a California
family feeling the squeeze. It's
part of our

16:57.550 --> 17:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
joint project with American
Public Media's
Marketplace and PBS'
"Frontline," and it's

17:03.489 --> 17:05.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
called How the Deck Is Stacked.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's funded by the Corporation
for Public
Broadcasting.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The correspondent is the host of
Marketplace,
Kai Ryssdal.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AARON MURRAY, California: Don't
I call my
insurance first to make a claim?

17:16.168 --> 17:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MURRAY, California: Yes. Do
you think
it's totaled?

17:19.005 --> 17:20.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AARON MURRAY: Yes.

17:20.873 --> 17:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: This has not been a
good morning
for Aaron and Mary Murray and
Vandy, their

17:25.244 --> 17:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
5-year-old daughter. They came
out to find
Aaron's car had been hit
overnight, one of

17:29.649 --> 17:33.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those unexpected expenses hat
can throw a
lot of middle-class families
off-track.

17:33.886 --> 17:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Thank you for calling
Esurance. My
name is Rebecca. How can I help?

17:38.925 --> 17:44.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON MURRAY: Hello, Rebecca.
I'm calling
because my car got sideswiped. I
did not see

17:45.031 --> 17:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them. They just left a note on
my car, ah,
and the note that they swerved
to avoid a

17:50.636 --> 17:52.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cat dashing across the street.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: OK.

17:53.539 --> 17:56.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: Got to brake for
animals.

17:56.175 --> 18:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Things get back on
track, though,
with Mary's car, and they head
to the Los

18:00.579 --> 18:04.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Angeles Zoo to meet some
friends. Vandy's
really looking forward to the
dinosaurs.

18:05.051 --> 18:07.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY MURRAY: Oh, my gosh.

18:07.219 --> 18:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AARON MURRAY: It's OK. I will
protect you.

18:10.723 --> 18:15.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: Yes, right. He
makes noise. I
think he's real.

18:15.695 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Over a standard zoo
lunch of
chicken fingers, talk turns back
to that car

18:20.800 --> 18:22.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
accident.

18:22.401 --> 18:25.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AARON MURRAY: The check goes to
pay off the
car. It doesn't come to me.

18:25.438 --> 18:30.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Next up, groceries
at Target.
And Vandy is eager to help.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VANDY MURRAY, 5 Years Old:
Fruit, taco kit,
and (INAUDIBLE)

18:32.211 --> 18:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: Nice. High five.
Boom. Awesome.

18:37.116 --> 18:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Mary keeps close
eye on the family
budget. Money-saving apps are
key.

18:42.288 --> 18:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: Bread, any bread.
Unlocked. Cha-ching,
25 cents.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AARON MURRAY: All right.

18:46.459 --> 18:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: The tricky thing
when you're
talking about the middle class
is who exactly

18:50.396 --> 18:55.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you're talking about. One
definition, according
to the Pew Research Center, is a
family of

18:55.801 --> 19:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four making between $48,000 and
$145,000 a
year, which is basically the
Murrays.

19:02.808 --> 19:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're both teachers. Household
income is
right at $90,000. And they're
the ones that

19:08.481 --> 19:11.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
politicians talk about all the
time.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hey, how're you?

19:13.185 --> 19:13.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AARON MURRAY: Hello.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: This is Vandy.

19:15.187 --> 19:17.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Hi, Vandy. How are
you sweetie?
You good?

19:17.523 --> 19:17.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Crazy day today?

19:18.090 --> 19:19.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AARON MURRAY: Yes.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: You walked out to
-- what, Aaron,
you walked out to get your
laptop?

19:21.827 --> 19:26.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON MURRAY: Yes, I had been
sideswiped this
morning. Like, the rear axle's
broke. It is

19:26.632 --> 19:28.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- I mean, this is...

19:28.601 --> 19:31.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)
MARY MURRAY: Yes. And that's
part of it.
KAI RYSSDAL: Is that part of the
wheel?

19:31.103 --> 19:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AARON MURRAY: Yes, that's the
wheel.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: The tow truck's
here.

19:35.975 --> 19:42.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: How big of a pain
is this, other
-- you're insured, but...

19:42.248 --> 19:47.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON MURRAY: Exactly. That's
exactly it.
I'm insured, but even if they
pay everything

19:47.286 --> 19:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, I now don't have a new car.
Do we get
a new car? How do we find the
money to get

19:52.391 --> 19:54.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the down payment? Like, that's
really the
big thing.

19:54.660 --> 19:56.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: So, what's that
going to do to
your monthly budget?

19:56.662 --> 20:02.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON MURRAY: This month is
shot, right? This
month is shot. Next month is
shot. I'm a teacher.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't get paid over the
summer.

20:04.503 --> 20:07.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: As you try to get
ahead, this
is like two steps back, maybe
more.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AARON MURRAY: Yes.

20:09.175 --> 20:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they're going to cover
everything,
but covering everything is never
everything.

20:12.244 --> 20:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Our family, the
Murrays, they
make $90,000 a year.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER PATE, Loyola Marymount
University:
Yes. Yes.

20:17.583 --> 20:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Now, granted, they
live in L.A.,
an expensive part of the
country. Housing

20:20.486 --> 20:20.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is ridiculous.

20:21.087 --> 20:21.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER PATE: Yes.

20:22.088 --> 20:23.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: They're
middle-class, right?

20:23.255 --> 20:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER PATE: They would be,
yes, by definition.

20:25.491 --> 20:29.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Jennifer Pate is an
economist
at Loyola Marymount University.

20:29.662 --> 20:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we hear politicians and
others say the
middle class in America is being
hollowed

20:35.101 --> 20:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, what does that mean? It
means it's getting
smaller?

20:36.969 --> 20:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER PATE: Yes. People are
either going
up, which is called upward
mobility, or more

20:41.874 --> 20:45.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likely it's downward mobility.
We're seeing
a hollowing out of the middle.
These are people

20:45.845 --> 20:50.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who purchase goods and services
across the
year that leads to higher
economic prosperity

20:50.716 --> 20:53.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our country. What do families
do when they
struggle?

20:53.452 --> 20:55.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: They don't spend,
right? They
retrench.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER PATE: They spend less.
They sometimes
have to take jobs that have
better security,

20:58.090 --> 21:04.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but pay lower wages. Wages have
been stagnant
in real terms roughly since the
mid-'70s.

21:04.830 --> 21:10.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Our family, the
Murrays, they're
teachers, they're hustling to
get by. Getting

21:10.669 --> 21:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their car wrecked wasn't in
their budget.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER PATE: Yes.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you're living very close to
your means,
or just barely living within
your means, when

21:16.142 --> 21:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have a catastrophic events,
right, something
like having your car get totaled
unexpectedly,

21:22.248 --> 21:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that disproportionately weighs
on you.

21:23.916 --> 21:27.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: I don't feel middle
class. I
would like to feel middle class.
I don't.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hardly even feel like an
adult.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAI RYSSDAL: We asked the
Murrays whether
they expected things to turn out
like this.

21:33.025 --> 21:37.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY MURRAY: In my best
remembrance, we actually
had planned on, like, having
bought a house,

21:37.930 --> 21:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even here in L.A. We were going
to have somebody's
loans paid off.

21:42.535 --> 21:47.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON MURRAY: Yes, and I would
be done with
my master's program, and in a
teaching job

21:47.806 --> 21:49.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for LAUSD.

21:49.175 --> 21:52.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: All right, so run
me through
that. How'd we do?

21:52.244 --> 21:55.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: No loans are paid
off. We do
not have a house.

21:55.548 --> 21:59.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON MURRAY: I hate to say
student loans
are the only reason, but they
are a large

21:59.752 --> 22:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reason. I could have purchased a
house for
the amount of my student loans.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Are there months
you choose not
to pay bills?

22:07.026 --> 22:11.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: I have from time to
time chosen
not to pay something or to skip
something.

22:11.497 --> 22:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I never skipped the rent. I
never skipped
the car payment. I never skipped
the insurance.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: When you look at
this election...

22:17.469 --> 22:19.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AARON MURRAY: Yes.

22:19.505 --> 22:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: ... do you feel
like the politicians
and the campaigns and the
candidates are paying

22:23.142 --> 22:28.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attention to your situation?
Hillary Clinton
talks about the middle class all
the time.

22:28.247 --> 22:30.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump has a middle-class
element in
his platform.

22:30.950 --> 22:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: Yes. But I don't
think they see
the reality of the middle class.
I think that

22:36.188 --> 22:42.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a -- like, there's an
idea of what
middle class is, which I think
middle class

22:42.194 --> 22:44.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, you don't live paycheck to
paycheck.

22:44.129 --> 22:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Do you think your
fortunes are
going to change based on this
election?

22:46.932 --> 22:48.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY MURRAY: I don't.

22:48.901 --> 22:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: Maybe a better
question, though,
is what about the fortunes of
their daughter?

22:53.939 --> 22:59.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you two setting Vandy up to
be better
off than you are right now?

22:59.378 --> 23:01.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: I hope so. I don't
really know.

23:01.780 --> 23:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AARON MURRAY: When you say save
money, cut
this out, don't do that, it
doesn't always

23:08.153 --> 23:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work that way, because the one
person I do
have the hardest time saying no
to is my daughter.

23:13.726 --> 23:19.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If she says, let's -- can we go
to Pinkberry,
and we say no because we only
have $50 left

23:19.231 --> 23:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the rest of the month,
that's kind of
hard.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
KAI RYSSDAL: Yes.

23:22.868 --> 23:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: Yes. She loves
going to gymnastics.
That's not negotiable.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AARON MURRAY: Yes.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY MURRAY: That is something
that we pay
every month for her. She loves
it, and we

23:28.073 --> 23:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did cut out a lot of things so
that she could
do that.

23:30.576 --> 23:36.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAI RYSSDAL: This isn't a story
or a series
about one family. It's about an
economy that's

23:36.949 --> 23:40.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changing, and what it means when
something
as simple as your car getting
sideswiped can

23:40.953 --> 23:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
set you back on your heels.

23:43.022 --> 23:46.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The middle class is what makes
this economy
go, the Murrays and the millions
of families

23:46.892 --> 23:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like them being able to buy
stuff. It's almost
that basic. And if they're
getting squeezed,

23:52.164 --> 23:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if the deck is stacked, then
everybody's going
to feel it.

23:56.468 --> 24:05.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Kai Ryssdal
from Los Angeles, California.

24:05.210 --> 24:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A historic week
for Hillary
Clinton. Bernie Sanders stays in
the race,

24:15.688 --> 24:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but pledges his support. And
Donald Trump's
campaign tries to recover from a
stumble.

24:21.560 --> 24:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That brings us to the analysis
of Shields
and Brooks. That's syndicated
columnist Mark

24:25.397 --> 24:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shields and New York Times
columnist David
Brooks.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

24:30.035 --> 24:35.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's talk a little bit
about the history.
It took, what, just 240 years,
but we do now

24:35.207 --> 24:39.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a woman as the nominee for
president
of a major political party.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did you feel the history, David,
this week?

24:41.380 --> 24:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Weirdly not. Maybe
I'm a chauvinist
or something.

24:44.583 --> 24:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, obviously, the
transformation
of the role of women is the
biggest event

24:48.387 --> 24:53.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of our lifetime. It's the
biggest transformation
after thousands of years of
human history

24:53.392 --> 24:56.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to getting closer to equality on
that front.

24:56.929 --> 25:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Hillary Clinton, it was so
long in coming,
it didn't, to me, feel like the
big seismic

25:02.468 --> 25:06.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shift, frankly, the way Barack
Obama felt
in '08, I think because she's
such a familiar

25:06.572 --> 25:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
figure and because the social
trend has been
gradual in coming, that it
didn't feel like

25:12.010 --> 25:14.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of this huge, momentous
breakthrough
moment.

25:14.179 --> 25:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's in part because
-- and this
maybe speaks well of the
situation we're in

25:17.783 --> 25:25.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it wasn't like a feminist
tide. It was
a tide of her own grit, a lot of
issues, the

25:25.524 --> 25:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic establishment. If you
polled Sanders
voters vs. Clinton voters,
Sanders voters

25:30.763 --> 25:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were more likely to think there
was structural
discrimination against women
than Clinton

25:34.733 --> 25:36.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

25:36.668 --> 25:43.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she rode on the tide of
merit, on issues,
but not necessarily a feminist
tide. And so

25:43.108 --> 25:48.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this particular event didn't
feel a seismic
opening, at least to me, that,
say, the Obama

25:48.614 --> 25:49.415 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
did -- thing did.

25:49.515 --> 25:50.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?

25:50.382 --> 25:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I'm a feminist.

25:51.784 --> 25:52.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:52.351 --> 25:54.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

25:54.319 --> 25:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Golda Meir is my guide on this.
The only woman
prime minister of Israel said
that women are

25:59.558 --> 26:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better than men, I cannot say,
but what I
can say is they certainly are
not worse.

26:04.096 --> 26:09.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we have come to that
point of
equality in our politics. I have
to confess

26:09.401 --> 26:14.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that, 32 years ago, when
Geraldine Ferraro
was named by Walter Mondale, I
was emotional.

26:14.339 --> 26:17.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I thought of my mother. I
thought of my wife.
I thought of my daughter. I
thought -- it

26:18.043 --> 26:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was just very in large part, I
think, because
-- David said it -- it was such
a surprise.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was such a pioneer. And this
has been.

26:25.050 --> 26:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This was less of
a...

26:26.985 --> 26:31.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: This was. And
Hillary Clinton
has been a formidable,
significant political

26:31.857 --> 26:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
figure and actor for 25 years.

26:35.627 --> 26:42.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And -- but there was genuine
emotion in that
hall. You could feel it if you
watched it,

26:42.267 --> 26:51.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when she accepted that
nomination, and she
obviously reciprocated it. But
it was done

26:51.543 --> 26:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just as a sisterhood is
powerful campaign.
It was a political campaign and
it was an

26:58.116 --> 26:59.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
effective one.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's bring
it down to
the politics of it.

27:01.553 --> 27:07.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Quite a good week for the
Democrats, whether
it was history or not, David.
You had Hillary

27:07.125 --> 27:13.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clinton finished. She won
California, pretty
big margin. She got the
president's endorsement.

27:13.565 --> 27:19.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She got the endorsement of the
vice president.
Bernie Sanders is not getting
out of the race,

27:19.171 --> 27:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he now is signaling he's
going to support
her.

27:22.508 --> 27:27.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats seem to have pulled it
together
this week. What did you make of
that?

27:27.112 --> 27:31.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, California
was a big one.
If she had lost California, then
we have a

27:31.550 --> 27:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole different gestalt. We
don't have a different
nominee, but we have a different
feeling to

27:34.553 --> 27:36.622 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the whole thing.

27:36.722 --> 27:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so winning California,
winning very convincingly,
is a reminder, for all that we
have been surprised

27:40.292 --> 27:46.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Sanders, she did win this.
She won it cleanly
and in a big way over the whole
course of

27:46.732 --> 27:51.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the primary season. And so she
clearly deserves
to be the nominee. And the
Democratic big

27:51.870 --> 27:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chieftains are coming together
now.

27:54.306 --> 27:59.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The questions I would have for
Clinton are
that people are coming together,
and they're

27:59.378 --> 28:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
uniting and they're strong,
people like Warren,
but this is not a year where the
establishment

28:03.982 --> 28:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is doing particularly well with
the voters.
And so I'm not sure how much it
will help

28:08.153 --> 28:10.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her in the campaign.

28:10.122 --> 28:15.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while Trump's poll numbers
are really
taking a hit, hers are sort of
steady and

28:15.127 --> 28:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're not steady at a great
place. In three-way
races -- I'm really struck by
the three-way

28:18.964 --> 28:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
races all the sudden, where
she's at 39 or
40, and Trump is at like 35, and
then suddenly

28:24.570 --> 28:27.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Gary Johnson, Libertarian
candidate, is like
at a 10.

28:28.040 --> 28:32.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one can see there is so much
dissatisfaction
with those two that if Johnson
could run a

28:32.244 --> 28:36.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good campaign, he could stick
around in the
double digits and really he will
be a big

28:37.082 --> 28:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story as we talk about the rest
of the year.

28:39.351 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much do you
think, Mark,
the fact that they sort of --
the White House

28:44.022 --> 28:49.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
orchestrated this, this week, in
a way that
they just -- they gave Bernie
Sanders gave

28:49.461 --> 28:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the space to get out when he
wants to.

28:51.897 --> 28:57.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Democrats,
historically, when
they form a firing squad, from a
circle. This

28:57.669 --> 28:59.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a total exception.

28:59.838 --> 29:05.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was brilliantly
choreographed. In addition
to the president's endorsement,
a man not

29:05.344 --> 29:10.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
noted for his self-doubt, to say
that she
was the most qualified
presidential candidate

29:10.616 --> 29:15.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in his lifetime was quite an
admission and
statement.

29:15.253 --> 29:21.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought the other part of it,
Judy, was
the deference and respect and
space they gave

29:21.827 --> 29:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- given to Bernie Sanders, that
he's paid
homage, he's paid tribute, and I
think deservedly

29:30.135 --> 29:37.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so. He lost the nomination, but
he won the
future of the Democratic Party.

29:37.809 --> 29:43.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the awareness of
this and the
awareness of the need for him
not to be a

29:43.482 --> 29:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gene McCarthy, as Gene McCarthy
was in 1968
when Hubert Humphrey lost the
presidency to

29:48.220 --> 29:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Richard Nixon by 511,000 votes,
and Gene McCarthy
waited, the great anti-war
candidate, until

29:55.761 --> 30:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six days before the election to
endorse Humphrey,
when, undoubtedly, that would
have made a

30:00.866 --> 30:03.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
difference in the outcome.

30:03.468 --> 30:08.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bernie Sanders is not going
to play this
role. I think -- I think all of
that was good

30:08.840 --> 30:13.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and positive and encouraging.
And the idea
that the Democrats are going to
have a peaceful

30:13.245 --> 30:17.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convention, they're on the love
boat now.
A week ago, it looked like a
civil war, or

30:17.916 --> 30:18.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two weeks ago.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

30:20.552 --> 30:23.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: And the
Republicans, who looked
were going to have a boring
convention, now

30:23.188 --> 30:25.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
there's a restiveness and
restlessness in
the ranks.

30:25.190 --> 30:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the two of
you have been
saying, I think, for some weeks
that you don't

30:27.726 --> 30:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think Hillary Clinton has a
single message
for her campaign. And, David,
you were just

30:32.698 --> 30:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hinting that that is still the
case.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do you come down, Mark?

30:36.101 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, she doesn't.

30:37.869 --> 30:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality is, this is a change
election
year. As popular as Barack
Obama, and he's

30:43.542 --> 30:48.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at 51 percent favorable rating,
some -- four
out of five American voters want
the country

30:48.513 --> 30:52.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to head in the right, a
different direction.
They're not satisfied with the
economy. Barack

30:52.584 --> 30:55.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama could not win a third term
on a referendum.

30:56.054 --> 31:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could if he was running
against Donald
Trump. But -- so, there's a
change -- you

31:01.560 --> 31:07.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, after two terms, there's a
desire for
change in the country. And
Hillary Clinton

31:07.532 --> 31:13.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a candidate of continuity.
And that's a
problem. And her message as of
now is the

31:13.538 --> 31:19.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change of Donald Trump is so
reckless and
so dangerous, that I am the safe
and sensible

31:19.578 --> 31:20.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
alternative.

31:20.345 --> 31:21.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that enough?

31:21.680 --> 31:23.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Oh, yes, probably.

31:23.615 --> 31:24.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:24.182 --> 31:25.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

31:26.084 --> 31:28.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, people -- I still sense
people will
be sick of Donald Trump and they
will go for

31:28.386 --> 31:33.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
her. At least she will be
competent and she
will be normal. But one -- it's
not sufficient

31:33.658 --> 31:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the country. It's enough
politically.
But it's not sufficient for --
as Sanders

31:37.796 --> 31:41.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even spoke this week, I was
really struck
by how he opened the campaign
really well

31:41.500 --> 31:43.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with a core message.

31:43.401 --> 31:47.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the message just sat there.
He had the
same message from beginning to
end, the same

31:47.706 --> 31:50.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
few talking points from
beginning to end.
It would have been interesting
to know, if

31:50.675 --> 31:55.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had expanded that message or
taken it the
next step, a different kind of
issues, if

31:55.147 --> 31:56.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he would have done better.

31:57.048 --> 32:01.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Clinton has not had those
issues. And
her incrementalism is not
sufficient, as Mark

32:02.053 --> 32:05.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
said. And what will be
interesting, if she
can take some of the left-wing
policies -- one

32:05.991 --> 32:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the things we have seen from
Trump is how
ideologically flexible the
country is right

32:09.394 --> 32:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
now, that they just want
different, and they're
willing to grab from column A
and column B.

32:14.733 --> 32:18.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is a flawed messenger, but
if Clinton
could grab some column A from
the left column

32:18.470 --> 32:21.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and some unpredictable things
from the right
column that could appeal like to
the family

32:22.007 --> 32:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we just saw in Kai's piece,
suddenly, that's
a real message.

32:26.244 --> 32:30.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as I say, a lot of this is
characterological.
We just haven't seen imagination
from her

32:30.482 --> 32:34.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the course of her political
campaign.
We have seen determinedness,
industriousness,

32:34.653 --> 32:36.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but we haven't seen the
unexpected.

32:36.555 --> 32:41.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about Trump.
He has had a really bad week, as
his campaign

32:41.459 --> 32:43.261 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
has gone.

32:43.361 --> 32:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark, he really has not backed
down from the
comments he made about the judge
of Hispanic

32:48.800 --> 32:54.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heritage, Mexican heritage. And
you see the
Republican Party struggling to
try to figure

32:54.806 --> 32:58.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out what to do about it. What
shape is he
in right now?

32:58.910 --> 33:00.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He's in bad shape.

33:01.012 --> 33:05.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I say that, Judy, because
think about
this, if you're a Republican. A
week ago,

33:05.884 --> 33:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democrats had a terrible,
terrible week.
The inspector general's reports
from the State

33:11.223 --> 33:14.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department came through on
Hillary Clinton's
private e-mail. It showed that
the Clinton

33:15.093 --> 33:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people had disassembled, that
they had not
cooperated, that they had
actually made it

33:19.097 --> 33:24.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
more difficult for the
investigation and had
not been forthcoming.

33:24.903 --> 33:30.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in addition to that, we had
the worst
job creation numbers we'd had in
six years.

33:31.009 --> 33:36.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet Donald Trump dominated
the news the
whole week, and Hillary Clinton
made the news

33:36.381 --> 33:40.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and dominated it in a positive
sense with
her speech critical of him.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: So, you know,
Donald Trump now
is going to a teleprompter, as
we saw today

33:45.290 --> 33:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and we saw on election night.

33:47.592 --> 33:52.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump on a teleprompter
is about as
electrifying as the recorded
message you get

33:52.530 --> 33:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calling the airlines and saying,
calls will
be answered in the order by
which they were

33:58.003 --> 33:58.303 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
received.

33:58.403 --> 33:59.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:59.471 --> 34:01.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: He loses all of
Donald Trump.

34:01.940 --> 34:05.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, how much
damage has
been done? Is he going to be
able to pick

34:05.210 --> 34:06.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself up and keep going? What
do you see?

34:06.912 --> 34:09.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he will be
able to pick
up. There will be ebbs and
flows.

34:09.547 --> 34:13.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have -- he's had so many
bad weeks
with no effect in the polls,
but, this week,

34:13.818 --> 34:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was an effect in the
polls. So, he was
dropped, I don't know, six, 10
points. There

34:17.088 --> 34:18.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was a chunk down.

34:18.990 --> 34:23.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the flaking way of the
Republicans,
the Ryans and even the Mitch
McConnells are

34:23.595 --> 34:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beginning to grow wobbly, Scott
Walker. The
whole party is, like, oh, no,
what are we

34:28.233 --> 34:30.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to do?

34:30.168 --> 34:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I understand why Ryan is
trying to hang
in there. He wants unity. His
theory is that,

34:34.739 --> 34:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we get unified, we will --
that's the only
way we can win as a party. And
his theory

34:39.644 --> 34:43.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, I have got a policy agenda.
If I hug Donald
Trump, maybe he will take part
of it, but

34:43.448 --> 34:47.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if I push him away, he will
never embrace
my agenda, and I care most about
my agenda.

34:48.019 --> 34:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that is unworkable
and frankly
not morally sound, that policy.
It's unworkable

34:54.025 --> 34:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because you can't share a stage
with Donald
Trump. He's not a sharing guy.
He's a sole

34:59.731 --> 35:06.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
figure who doesn't do
collaboration. He doesn't
do reciprocity. He doesn't do
teamwork. And

35:06.271 --> 35:08.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you can't have unity with a guy
like that.

35:08.239 --> 35:11.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wrote in my column today it's
like trying
to hug a tornado. It's just not
going to work,

35:11.910 --> 35:16.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because you will get what we
just saw. And
it's immoral, or amoral, at
least, because

35:16.448 --> 35:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can't embrace somebody who
says racist
things because he happens to
agree with your

35:19.751 --> 35:22.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
defense budget.

35:22.220 --> 35:28.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The character is foundational.
And Ryan is
trying to paper over a moral
chasm with policy.

35:28.793 --> 35:32.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's just not -- it's not
the right thing
to do, in my view.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pretty tough.

35:34.065 --> 35:40.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It was tough. It
was a good
column. And it was -- David said
it well.

35:40.905 --> 35:44.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, to quote David,
which I'm always
reluctant to do...

35:44.309 --> 35:46.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:46.111 --> 35:48.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: ... but he has no
horizontal
relationships. And I think
that's true.

35:48.513 --> 35:55.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mo Udall, a wonderful
congressman from Arizona,
said, always beware of any
presidential candidate

35:55.887 --> 36:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who doesn't have friends his own
age who can
tell him to go to hell and --
when you're

36:01.760 --> 36:04.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrong. And I just don't see that
in Donald
Trump.

36:04.662 --> 36:09.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, I see a lot of
relationships and a
lot of vertical relationships
and good relationships

36:09.467 --> 36:13.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with his family. But, I mean, I
think, Judy,
the vote for president is a very
personal

36:13.471 --> 36:18.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one. And people are going to
make their decisions
based on, as Heraclitus said 25
centuries

36:19.010 --> 36:22.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago, character is destiny, and
it will be
in 2012 (sic).

36:22.347 --> 36:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he's going
to -- I guess
next week, he is going to try to
talk about

36:25.216 --> 36:25.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's character.

36:25.950 --> 36:26.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

36:26.484 --> 36:27.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: OK.

36:27.552 --> 36:28.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will see
what he says.

36:28.787 --> 36:34.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark Shields, David Brooks,
thank you both.

36:34.726 --> 36:47.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Broadway's 70th
annual Tony
Awards air Sunday night with all
eyes on the

36:47.772 --> 36:49.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
musical "Hamilton."

36:49.774 --> 36:55.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as Jeffrey Brown reports,
there are many
more stage productions which may
provide surprises.

36:55.747 --> 37:03.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: No question about
it, it was
the year of "Hamilton," and the
hip-hop musical

37:03.455 --> 37:09.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about America's first treasury
secretary received
a record 16 Tony nominations.

37:09.861 --> 37:14.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also took in over a billion
dollars in
ticket sales and helped make
this a profitable,

37:14.999 --> 37:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as buzzed-about year on
Broadway.
Another contender in the best
musical category,

37:22.507 --> 37:28.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"Shuffle Along," with an
all-star cast led
by Audra McDonald, also got much
buzz, even

37:28.480 --> 37:31.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if it faces tough Tony odds.

37:31.716 --> 37:38.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the best play category, "The
Humans" and
"Eclipsed" were among the
standouts. The former

37:38.923 --> 37:43.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
presents a Thanksgiving
gathering where tensions
reach a boiling point and family
fault lines

37:44.028 --> 37:46.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are exposed.

37:46.464 --> 37:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Eclipsed," starring Lupita
Nyong'o is a drama
set amidst the Liberian civil
war. The best

37:59.043 --> 38:05.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
revival of a musical category
includes new
takes on two well-known stories.
"The Color

38:05.350 --> 38:10.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Purple," based on Alice Walker's
Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel, centers on
African-American

38:10.755 --> 38:18.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
women in the 1930s South.

38:18.163 --> 38:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Tevye and tradition returned
in "Fiddler
on the Roof," first produced on
Broadway in

38:23.268 --> 38:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1964. And in the best revival of
a play category,
famed playwright Arthur Miller
faces off against

38:30.942 --> 38:33.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
himself, as well as others.

38:33.378 --> 38:38.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's "The Crucible," about
the Salem Witch
Trials and an allegory of
McCarthyism in later

38:38.383 --> 38:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, and "A View From the
Bridge," Miller's
1956 drama of a Brooklyn
longshoreman.

38:46.591 --> 38:53.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as it happens, both Miller
revivals were
directed by Ivo Van Hove.

38:53.565 --> 38:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for a further look at a most
interesting
year on Broadway, I'm joined by
Ben Brantley,

38:57.735 --> 38:59.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chief theater critic for The New
York Times.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome to you.

39:01.773 --> 39:05.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, let's start with the
"Hamilton" phenomenon.
There is really no other way to
refer to it,

39:05.143 --> 39:06.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I guess.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN BRANTLEY, Chief Theater
Critic, The New
York Times: No, you can't avoid
it.

39:08.846 --> 39:10.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, there is a song from
"Hamilton," "I
Want to Be in the Room When It
Happens," which

39:10.882 --> 39:15.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is referring to sort of the
political ambitions
of Aaron Burr. But it became
sort of the mantra

39:15.353 --> 39:21.659 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for everyone.

39:21.759 --> 39:31.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have never received so many
questions from
people sort of crawling out of
the woodwork

39:32.070 --> 39:36.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of my past asking if I could get
them tickets,
because they're hard to come by.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:37.242 --> 39:39.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEN BRANTLEY: And that kind of
feeds the fuel.

39:39.110 --> 39:43.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is one case, though, in
which that
kind of hype is justified. It
really is unlike

39:43.982 --> 39:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anything that's come on Broadway
before and
it's drawing audiences that
Broadway hasn't

39:49.020 --> 39:51.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really brought in en masse in
many years.

39:51.689 --> 39:57.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One aspect to it
much noted
"Hamilton" and other plays is
the diversity

39:57.528 --> 39:59.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in theater.

39:59.364 --> 40:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN BRANTLEY: The Oscars look
especially pale
by comparison to Broadway this
year.

40:03.001 --> 40:09.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the point of "Hamilton,"
or one of the
many points of "Hamilton," which
is a multi-leveled

40:09.240 --> 40:14.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
production in so many ways, is
that this country
was founded by immigrants. And
one of the

40:14.946 --> 40:22.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strokes of genius was casting
all the dead
white founding fathers with very
vital young

40:22.754 --> 40:30.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
men and women of color.

40:30.428 --> 40:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It fuses the language of
hip-hop, sort of
the braggadocio in that, the
energy in that,

40:36.000 --> 40:42.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kind of show-off aspect of
it as the natural
language for young people who
would be revolting.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, other plays
aside from
"Hamilton" this year, right?

40:46.644 --> 40:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk about the new play
category. And
we mentioned "The Humans" and
"Eclipsed."

40:51.582 --> 40:53.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What stood out for you?

40:53.484 --> 40:59.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN BRANTLEY: "The Humans" is
lovely. It's
probably an old-fashioned play
in many ways.

40:59.924 --> 41:04.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Stephen Karam, he's a very
interesting
playwright. It's perfectly
balanced. It's

41:04.829 --> 41:09.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a portrait of family
dysfunction, which is
what American plays, significant
American

41:09.967 --> 41:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dramas, tend to be like. But
there's kind
of a nimbus of the supernatural
within it

41:16.374 --> 41:23.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that suggests that the ghost,
what really
haunts us, the horror, the
monsters, are us.

41:24.015 --> 41:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Eclipsed" is its own creature.
I never -- I
don't think there has been ever
been a play

41:29.387 --> 41:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this on Broadway before,
woman playwright,
all-female cast. And it's about
African brides,

41:38.363 --> 41:46.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
basically, who have been
kidnapped by revolutionaries
in a time of civil war. And it's
their very

41:46.137 --> 41:49.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
limited existences and their
hopes of escaping
it.

41:49.240 --> 41:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's sort of a conventional play
in the way
it's told, but I think it's
really good. And

41:54.679 --> 42:01.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the accents are thick, the lingo
is thick.
The historical context or the
topical context

42:01.185 --> 42:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is thick in a way that you
really have to
pay attention to follow it. And
when you do,

42:06.391 --> 42:08.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you're hooked.

42:08.960 --> 42:14.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A young actress named Cynthia
Erivo in the
musical "The Color Purple,"
which came in

42:14.766 --> 42:18.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from London, it had been on
Broadway not that
long ago, but this is the
pared-down revival

42:18.903 --> 42:22.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from John Doyle. And she is
extraordinary.

42:22.140 --> 42:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She plays -- it's based on Alice
Walker's
novel. And she plays a
repressed, young girl

42:28.880 --> 42:35.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really, who grows into her sense
of herself.
And watching Cynthia Erivo grow
in presence

42:35.253 --> 42:39.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on stage is like watching a star
being born
before your eyes. It's just
thrilling.

42:39.924 --> 42:44.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you
briefly, finally,
to sum up the year.

42:44.729 --> 42:50.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's some years where the
talk about Broadway
is, oh, blockbuster musicals,
nothing all

42:50.768 --> 42:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that new and really exciting.
Where do you
think we're at right now?

42:55.072 --> 43:00.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BEN BRANTLEY: This year,
"Hamilton" is so
singular, that it really does
sort of put

43:00.311 --> 43:04.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything else in the shade,
but it's good
that something this original --
and it is

43:04.916 --> 43:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
truly original -- is what's
casting that shadow.

43:08.186 --> 43:13.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aside from that the fact we had
Ivo Van Hove,
a radically experienced
director, bringing

43:13.491 --> 43:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two Arthur Miller plays to
Broadway, "The
Crucible" and "A View From the
Bridge," and

43:18.529 --> 43:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making them seem so new and so
startling and
so emotionally engaging, in a
way, yes, any

43:25.703 --> 43:30.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show that contains those, and
"The Humans"
and this great reinvented
revival of "The

43:30.708 --> 43:34.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Color Purple," it's a season to
give thanks
for.

43:34.345 --> 43:36.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ben Brantley of
The New York
Times, thanks very much.

43:36.814 --> 43:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BEN BRANTLEY: Thank you for
having me.

43:41.252 --> 43:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will be back
in a moment.

43:52.830 --> 43:57.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take this time to
hear from your
local PBS station. It's a chance
to offer

43:57.702 --> 44:17.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps to
keep programs
like ours on

44:18.022 --> 44:19.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the air.

44:19.824 --> 44:21.592 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

44:21.692 --> 45:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: What's the best way to
ensure financial

45:19.684 --> 45:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
security for your family? Think
