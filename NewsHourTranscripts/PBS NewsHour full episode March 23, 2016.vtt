JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.306 --> 00:07.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.975 --> 00:11.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight,
we are on the ground in
Brussels. The city

00:11.445 --> 00:15.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grapples with the deadly attacks
and the most
effective way to fight terror.

00:15.883 --> 00:21.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: There is a mix
of fear and
resilience on the streets here
tonight, as

00:21.688 --> 00:25.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Belgians shift focus to
confronting extremism
in their midst.

00:25.525 --> 00:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Then: foreign policy
and the next
president, today, the Democrats.
Hillary Clinton

00:31.465 --> 00:34.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
delivers a major address. And we
talk with
Bernie Sanders.

00:34.501 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Can ISIS be destroyed? Of course
they can.

00:38.538 --> 00:43.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a question of the
coalition. It's a question,
as King Abdullah has said,
Muslim troops on

00:43.410 --> 00:48.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ground, not American troops.
And, by the
way, it is not a question of
going to war

00:48.348 --> 00:50.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against a religion.

00:50.217 --> 00:56.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we travel to
the Philippines,
where young girls are lured into
the sex trade

00:56.089 --> 00:57.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
online.

00:57.691 --> 01:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.665 --> 01:07.501 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:07.534 --> 01:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The city of
Brussels began
three days of mourning today; 31
people were

01:17.778 --> 01:23.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed and 270 others wounded in
Tuesday's
suicide attacks.

01:23.183 --> 01:28.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, investigators kept up a
manhunt, as
the city tried to get back to
something like

01:28.088 --> 01:29.356 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
normal.

01:29.389 --> 01:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Malcolm Brabant reports from
Brussels.

01:31.525 --> 01:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Hundreds
gathered in Brussels'
Place de la Bourse this morning
to remember

01:36.630 --> 01:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the victims of yesterday's twin
bombings with
a moment of silence.

01:40.434 --> 01:45.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Well, I think everyone
can agree that
this is a horrible, horrible,
horrible thing.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's all there is left
to say about
it.

01:48.342 --> 01:52.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLINE LEDENT, Brussels
Resident (through
translator): I think we had to
be here. I

01:52.679 --> 01:56.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't have the words to express
what I feel,
but it's true that we have been
used to see

01:56.883 --> 02:01.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these attacks for a long time,
but when it
happens at home, you feel it in
a stronger

02:01.722 --> 02:03.490 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

02:03.523 --> 02:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Elsewhere in
the city, flags
at European Union buildings were
lowered to

02:06.460 --> 02:12.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
half-staff. European leaders
laid a wreath
at the metro station where one
of the bombers

02:12.532 --> 02:17.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
struck, and Belgium's king and
queen visited
with staff and emergency
responders at the

02:17.804 --> 02:23.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Brussels Airport, which
announced it will
remain closed at least another
day.

02:23.443 --> 02:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many others in the Belgian
capital took pride
in returning to work and routine
as a sign

02:28.015 --> 02:29.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of strength in the face of
terror.

02:29.983 --> 02:34.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We all have to, because,
otherwise,
I think they will win. That's
what they want,

02:34.187 --> 02:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to paralyze our lives in Europe,
and we have
to go on with it.

02:38.125 --> 02:42.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: We shouldn't be afraid. I
think the
most straight answer is to be
there, to continue

02:42.462 --> 02:46.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
our lives, to go to the
terraces, to drink
our coffee, to go to the cinema
and so on.

02:46.433 --> 02:51.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But, as life
went on, so
did the search for answers.
Investigators

02:51.338 --> 02:55.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now believe at least four
individuals were
involved in the attacks.

02:55.442 --> 03:00.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say Ibrahim El Bakraoui and
another man
seen were the suicide bombers
who struck the

03:00.514 --> 03:06.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
departures concourse. That
second man, Najim
Laachraoui, allegedly also made
the suicide

03:06.586 --> 03:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vests for the Paris bombings.

03:09.423 --> 03:14.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it was El Bakraoui's
brother, Khalid,
who blew himself up on a subway
car near the

03:14.628 --> 03:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European Union complex about an
hour later.
The third man, not yet
identified from the

03:20.067 --> 03:22.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airport photo, is still being
sought.

03:22.269 --> 03:26.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERIC VAN LEEUW, Belgian
Federal Prosecutor
(through translator): The third
suspect wearing

03:26.073 --> 03:31.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a light jacket and a hat is on
the run. He
put down a large bag, then left
before the

03:31.211 --> 03:36.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
explosion. It contained the
largest explosive
charge. Shortly after the
arrival of the bomb

03:36.116 --> 03:40.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disposal unit, this bag blew up
because of
the highly unstable nature of
the explosives.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Fortunately, nobody was injured.

03:42.789 --> 03:47.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Officials say
the two brothers
did have criminal records tied
to robbery

03:47.127 --> 03:53.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and carjacking, but it wasn't
until a March
15 raid on a Belgium apartment
rented by Khalid

03:54.000 --> 03:59.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
El Bakraoui that they became
suspects in the
ongoing terror probe.

03:59.072 --> 04:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That search also turned up
fingerprints belonging
to Salah Abdeslam, the top
suspect in November's

04:04.778 --> 04:11.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terror attacks in Paris. He was
captured last
week. One of several raids since
yesterday's

04:11.384 --> 04:17.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks turned up explosives and
chemicals
used to make bombs, as well as
Ibrahim El

04:17.491 --> 04:23.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bakraoui's computer on which he
said he was
unsure what to do, hunted
everywhere, and

04:23.063 --> 04:24.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no longer safe.

04:24.931 --> 04:29.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Turkish President Recep
Tayyip Erdogan
said one of the attackers was
deported from

04:30.003 --> 04:31.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Turkey in June.

04:31.905 --> 04:35.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): We informed the
Belgium Embassy

04:35.675 --> 04:41.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a diplomatic note about the
deportation
on July 14, 2015. Despite our
warnings that

04:41.848 --> 04:46.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this person is a foreign
fighter, Belgium
could not establish any links
with terrorism.

04:46.286 --> 04:50.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Likewise,
French officials
have complained that Belgium
failed to conduct

04:50.924 --> 04:56.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security crackdowns in Muslim
areas after
the Paris attacks. French Prime
Minister Manuel

04:56.696 --> 05:00.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Valls called for greater
coordination today,
before traveling to Brussels.

05:00.967 --> 05:05.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANUEL VALLS, French Prime
Minister (through
translator): We closed our eyes
everywhere

05:05.338 --> 05:10.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Europe, including France, to
the progression
of extremist ideas,
neighborhoods which through

05:10.143 --> 05:15.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a combination of drug
trafficking and radical
Islamism perverted youth. And
I'm not here

05:15.315 --> 05:18.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to lecture the Belgians, because
I'm sure
they're more than aware of this.

05:18.485 --> 05:22.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: There was also
word that
Secretary of State John Kerry
will travel

05:22.522 --> 05:26.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Brussels on Friday to meet
with top Belgian
and European officials.

05:27.027 --> 05:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, tonight, European and Iraqi
intelligence
officials told the Associated
Press that ISIS

05:33.567 --> 05:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has dispatched at least 400
fighters to Europe,
and they have been specifically
trained to

05:37.771 --> 05:39.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attack the West -- Judy.

05:39.539 --> 05:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Malcolm,
given the threat
of these fighters, give us a
sense of the

05:44.711 --> 05:48.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security across Europe. You
traveled into
Belgium today.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Yes, I have
come from Lesbos
in Greece, and have traveled
through Athens

05:52.819 --> 05:54.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Paris.

05:54.621 --> 05:57.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all the way along that
route, you can
see just how sensitive people
are in the wake

05:57.657 --> 06:02.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these attacks at transport
hubs. At Athens
Airport, for example, today,
there was an

06:02.596 --> 06:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alarm going off, and you could
see the tension
in people's faces because they
just didn't

06:06.099 --> 06:07.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know what was going on.

06:08.001 --> 06:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Paris, the plane was met by
policemen checking
very assiduously everybody's
passports. And

06:14.341 --> 06:18.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is something that shouldn't
normally
happen within the Schengen free
travel zone.

06:18.745 --> 06:23.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is supposed to be
paper-free. But they
were checking everybody's
identities very

06:23.216 --> 06:24.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
closely.

06:24.951 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indeed, there were sniffer dogs
there. And
then driving into Belgium wasn't
a problem.

06:29.589 --> 06:33.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The border was wide open, but on
the other
side of the motorway, it was
very difficult

06:33.426 --> 06:38.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting out. There were hordes
of policemen
on the border with France trying
to see if

06:38.331 --> 06:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they could get hold of those
people that might
be involved in those attacks
yesterday.

06:43.470 --> 06:48.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I finally got into the
center of
Belgium, into Brussels this
morning -- this

06:48.141 --> 06:53.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afternoon, rather, at the
Eurostar station,
it looked very much like this
was a city at

06:53.980 --> 06:59.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war. There were army trucks
everywhere, police
guards, and people checking --
being checked

06:59.920 --> 07:04.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they went into the Eurostar
station, because
this is something that people
really are concerned

07:04.124 --> 07:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, that, in order to get
into these places
now, you perhaps need to be
checked.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there was a queue
outside. And these
are the sort of things that can
become soft

07:11.531 --> 07:17.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
targets in the future. So,
there's a real
difficulty about the balance of
security in

07:17.037 --> 07:20.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
places like Eurostar, train
station and at
airports.

07:20.940 --> 07:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Malcolm,
you reported on Turkey having
deported back

07:25.578 --> 07:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Belgium one of the attackers
from what
happened yesterday. How do
Belgians explain

07:33.219 --> 07:35.221 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

07:35.255 --> 07:39.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Well, this is
really embarrassing
for the Belgians, because the
Turkish president

07:39.392 --> 07:46.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
said that the Belgian
authorities were warned
that this man did have terrorist
links, and

07:46.132 --> 07:48.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said that the Belgians had
not been able
to find any.

07:48.802 --> 07:54.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet this man was able to
wander around
in Belgium for months before
carrying out

07:54.074 --> 07:58.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this terrible suicide attack.
And it really
does beg the question about what
the European

07:58.912 --> 08:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authorities are going to do
about people who
return from Syria, especially as
this is where

08:04.451 --> 08:08.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're getting the military
expertise to
be able to carry out the sort of
attacks that

08:08.321 --> 08:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we saw in Brussels yesterday.

08:10.090 --> 08:16.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Malcolm Brabant
reporting for
us tonight from Brussels, we
thank you.

08:16.229 --> 08:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will take a closer look
at Europe's
struggle to prevent this sort of
attack after

08:20.266 --> 08:22.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the news summary.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: President
Obama defended his
administration's strategy

08:26.005 --> 08:30.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against terror, and dismissed
Republican calls
for more aggressive action.

08:30.610 --> 08:35.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president spoke in Buenos
Aires, where
he met with President Mauricio
Macri. At a

08:35.281 --> 08:40.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
news conference, he said
fighting the Islamic
State group is his number one
priority.

08:40.754 --> 08:47.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he rejected Donald Trump's
calls for water-boarding
and Ted Cruz's talk of major
military strikes.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
So, when I hear we somebody
saying we should

08:49.863 --> 08:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carpet-bomb Iraq or Syria, not
only is that
inhumane, not only is that
contrary to our

08:59.606 --> 09:07.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
values, but that would likely be
an extraordinary
mechanism for ISIL to recruit
more people

09:07.514 --> 09:11.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
willing to die and explode bombs
in an airport.

09:11.384 --> 09:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mr. Obama also
condemned Cruz's
call for surveillance of Muslim
neighborhoods.

09:17.056 --> 09:21.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said it would be wrong and --
quote -- "un-American
to make Muslims feel
ghettoized."

09:21.828 --> 09:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump was
off the campaign
trail today, but Ted Cruz was in
New York

09:26.900 --> 09:32.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
City, where he fired back at the
president.
After a rally in Manhattan, Cruz
branded the

09:32.272 --> 09:37.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama policy a failure, and said
Americans
are fed up with being -- quote
-- "lectured

09:37.710 --> 09:39.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Islamophobia."

09:39.546 --> 09:42.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
We have seen President Obama's
weakness and

09:42.215 --> 09:49.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appeasement give rise to radical
Islamic terrorism.
ISIS, which President Obama
wrongfully dismissed

09:49.589 --> 09:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the junior varsity, is the
face of evil.
They have declared jihad on
America and President

09:56.429 --> 10:03.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama refuses to acknowledge
that. He is so
captured by political
correctness, he's unwilling

10:03.069 --> 10:04.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to confront it.

10:04.804 --> 10:09.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today, Cruz
picked up
the endorsement of former rival
Jeb Bush,

10:09.509 --> 10:15.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
after winning Tuesday's
Republican caucuses
in Utah. But Donald Trump won
the Arizona

10:15.381 --> 10:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary, to pad his delegate
lead. On the
Democratic side, Hillary Clinton
won Arizona,

10:21.721 --> 10:25.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Bernie Sanders won caucuses
in Utah and
Idaho.

10:25.258 --> 10:30.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will hear some of Clinton's
speech on foreign
policy today, and have an
interview with Senator

10:30.530 --> 10:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sanders later in the program.

10:32.332 --> 10:36.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: House Speaker Paul
Ryan decried
the state of politics and the
presidential

10:37.003 --> 10:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign today in a Washington
speech. The
Wisconsin Republican named no
names, but his

10:42.442 --> 10:45.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
remarks appeared pointed
directly at front-runner
Donald Trump.

10:45.678 --> 10:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
This has always been a tough
business. And

10:49.549 --> 10:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when passions flare, ugliness is
sometimes
inevitable. But we shouldn't
accept ugliness

10:55.421 --> 11:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the norm. We should demand
better from
ourselves. We should demand
better from one

11:01.494 --> 11:05.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another. We are slipping into
being a divisive
country.

11:05.131 --> 11:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are speaking to each other in
echo chambers,
where we only talk to those who
agree with

11:08.935 --> 11:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us, and we think that there is
something wrong
with the people who don't agree
with us.

11:13.206 --> 11:18.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ryan has said he
will back the
eventual Republican presidential
nominee.

11:18.111 --> 11:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's word that
most of the
warring parties in Yemen have
agreed to a

11:22.148 --> 11:27.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cease-fire as of April 10. A
special U.N.
envoy says it involves the
government and

11:27.687 --> 11:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its Sunni backers, including
Saudi Arabia,
plus Shiite rebels. Meanwhile,
local officials

11:33.626 --> 11:39.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confirm that a U.S. airstrike
killed some
50 militants at an al-Qaida
training camp

11:39.532 --> 11:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
west of the port city of Mukalla
on Tuesday.

11:42.735 --> 11:48.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: An independent task
force in Michigan
blasted state officials today
for mishandling

11:48.708 --> 11:53.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the water contamination crisis
in Flint. The
group was appointed by
Republican Governor

11:53.379 --> 11:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rick Snyder last year. It found
the state
is -- quote -- "fundamentally
accountable"

11:58.518 --> 12:02.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for letting lead taint the
city's water and
then ignoring pleas from the
public.

12:02.922 --> 12:08.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A son of
billionaire Warren
Buffett has unveiled a $90
million fund to

12:08.761 --> 12:14.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help young girls of color in the
U.S. The
foundation, run by Peter and
Jennifer Buffett,

12:14.834 --> 12:19.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says it's the largest single
investment of
its kind. The first step will be
to survey

12:19.439 --> 12:24.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
minority girls and their
advocates to determine
how best to use the money.

12:24.243 --> 12:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On Wall Street, a
new drop in
oil and other commodities pulled
stocks down.

12:29.549 --> 12:35.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly
80 points to close just above
17500. The Nasdaq

12:36.022 --> 12:40.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fell more than 50 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped 13.

12:40.460 --> 12:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And former mayor
-- Major League
Baseball catcher and Hall of
Fame broadcaster

12:46.766 --> 12:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joe Garagiola has died in
Scottsdale, Arizona.
He played eight seasons in the
majors, and

12:53.406 --> 12:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then for decades, he called
games on radio
and TV, and even co-hosted NBC's
"Today Show."

12:59.646 --> 13:06.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He finally retired in 2013. Joe
Garagiola
was 90 years old.

13:06.185 --> 13:11.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Europe's
struggle to combat terror;
Bernie Sanders

13:11.057 --> 13:17.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on his view of America's role in
the fight
against ISIS; arguments over
covering contraception

13:17.430 --> 13:24.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before the Supreme Court; and
much more.

13:24.771 --> 13:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We return to the
attacks in Brussels,
and what they said about the
growing Islamic

13:39.619 --> 13:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State threat in Europe and
elsewhere.

13:42.355 --> 13:47.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Daniel Benjamin was coordinator
for counterterrorism
at the State Department during
the first term

13:47.260 --> 13:52.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Obama administration.
He's now a professor
at Dartmouth College. And Joby
Warrick is

13:52.665 --> 13:57.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a national security
correspondent at The Washington
Post. He's also the author of
the book "Black

13:57.770 --> 14:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Flags: The Rise of ISIS."

14:00.339 --> 14:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Daniel Benjamin, was this a
nightmare scenario
that could have been foreseen?
Yesterday,

14:04.210 --> 14:06.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we heard people saying, this is
what we feared.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN, Former State
Department Coordinator
for Counterterrorism: I think
that people

14:08.548 --> 14:13.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have been watching terrorism
have been
fearing this for many years,
actually.

14:13.186 --> 14:18.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The recognition that Europe had
a problem
with extremism in its midst and
the recognition

14:18.925 --> 14:23.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that Europe hadn't taken
security arrangements
as seriously as it should have,
I think, has

14:23.463 --> 14:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been common. That observation
has been common
in the security community for
many years now.

14:28.568 --> 14:33.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Joby Warrick, the
Associated Press,
among others, have been
reporting today that

14:33.306 --> 14:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there were as many as 400 people
being trained
by ISIS to carry out these
attacks in Europe.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So did they not leave any
footprints or any
signs?

14:42.515 --> 14:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK, The Washington
Post: Well, the
number's a little bit soft, I
think, but it's

14:45.451 --> 14:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not unrealistic to think that if
you have
5,000 Europeans that went to
Iraq and Syria

14:50.456 --> 14:54.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fight, if only 10 percent of
them came
back home, you know, that's a
pretty good

14:54.794 --> 14:56.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
base for future attacks.

14:56.729 --> 15:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Abaaoud, the guy who
carried out
the November attacks in Paris,
claimed that

15:01.534 --> 15:05.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there were 90 people that he
knew of involved
in cells getting ready to carry
out attacks.

15:05.838 --> 15:07.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's not something that can
be easily dismissed.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From what you know
about from
writing your book on ISIS, is
this the sort

15:10.676 --> 15:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of thing that the United States
should be
wary of? Are there footprints as
well leading

15:16.983 --> 15:18.851 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here?

15:18.885 --> 15:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Well, it's a
different situation
for us. Fortunately, we don't
have the kind

15:20.720 --> 15:25.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of radical communities that you
see in Europe.
We have radicalized individuals,
but not so

15:25.925 --> 15:27.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much a community problem.

15:27.927 --> 15:33.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we also have, fortunately,
oceans separating
us from some of these jihadists.
I think Europeans

15:33.432 --> 15:37.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a much more acute problem.
They're really
waking up to it now. It's almost
too late

15:37.970 --> 15:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for some of the action they're
taking, because
the threat is really at hand.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Daniel Benjamin,
you agree
that this idea of alienation
makes it different

15:44.877 --> 15:48.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Muslim communities or the
radical Muslim
communities in Europe and here?

15:48.948 --> 15:53.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: There's no
question that
there's a higher level of
alienation and of

15:53.820 --> 15:55.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
radicalization.

15:55.888 --> 16:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European Muslims are several
times more likely
to go to fight in Iraq and
Syria, perhaps

16:01.761 --> 16:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as much as 10 times as much. And
if you look
at the -- just the casualties
that we have

16:06.899 --> 16:12.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen since 9/11, you know,
there's been vastly
more violence in Europe, 10
times as much

16:12.405 --> 16:18.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least, compared to the United
States, where,
despite all the concern, we have
only had

16:18.044 --> 16:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about 45 casualties, 45 deaths,
due to jihadist
violence.

16:21.514 --> 16:26.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, is it law
enforcement that
is dropping the ball in Europe?

16:26.052 --> 16:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: It's a much
larger problem
than law enforcement.

16:29.822 --> 16:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a very different kind
of set of Muslim
communities. They tend to be
much poorer,

16:35.561 --> 16:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much less educated. They have
much less social
mobility, much less access to
education and

16:41.133 --> 16:45.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
even less political
representation. So, it's
really a societal problem.

16:45.738 --> 16:51.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important to note that the
large majority
of European Muslims are very,
very peaceful

16:51.744 --> 16:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and love their countries. In
fact, when polls
are taken, they tend to be more
patriotic

16:57.583 --> 17:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than the non-Muslim populations.
But, because
of these conditions, it is
easier for a smaller

17:04.757 --> 17:10.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of extremists, still much
larger than
we have in the U.S., to swim in
the same seas,

17:10.129 --> 17:11.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if you will.

17:11.931 --> 17:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, Joby Warrick,
Daniel Benjamin
mentions that there are only 45
casualties

17:17.069 --> 17:19.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since 2004, including Madrid and
Paris and...

17:19.839 --> 17:23.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: No, no, I'm
sorry. In Europe,
you have had closer to 500.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Europe, oh, 500.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: In the United
States, you
have had about 45.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The other way
around, that's right.

17:28.247 --> 17:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, making the point -- thank
you -- that
there are that many people and
that many signs,

17:33.753 --> 17:40.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is this something that is
operating so far
under the radar that Belgian
authorities or

17:40.359 --> 17:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europol or French authorities
couldn't have
had a heads-up about it,
especially -- I just

17:46.332 --> 17:51.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to add, especially since
President Erdogan
of Turkey today is saying that
he made a warning?

17:51.604 --> 17:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Well, yes, I think
the Belgians,
in particular, have a problem.
And they're

17:54.774 --> 17:59.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very aware of it. And we're
often saying these
days that you're only as strong
as your weakest

17:59.745 --> 18:01.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
link.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the case of Belgium, you have
got a country
that -- it's got a fairly small
police force.

18:04.550 --> 18:10.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If they have 100 -- by
conservative estimates,
about 100 ISIS veterans have
returned to that

18:10.189 --> 18:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country alone, just so the
manpower involved
in conducting surveillance and
watching all

18:15.261 --> 18:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these people, watching their
phone calls,
conversations, it sort of taxes
their police

18:18.898 --> 18:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces beyond their capability,
not -- let
alone the problem of dealing
with counterradicalization,

18:23.602 --> 18:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and just all the tracking and
surveillance
they need to be doing.

18:27.306 --> 18:31.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, they have a problem
there. They have
a problem with coordinating with
other agencies

18:31.477 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other governments. And so,
yes, that sets
a huge problem for them. And I
think they

18:35.514 --> 18:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really are aware of this now,
but it's kind
of late to the party.

18:39.018 --> 18:43.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Has the migrant
crisis that we
have seen, we have spent a lot
of time talking

18:43.889 --> 18:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about on this program, has that
exacerbated
the problem?

18:47.093 --> 18:48.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: It absolutely
has.

18:48.995 --> 18:54.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know, for example, in the
case of the Paris
attacks, that at least one of
the perpetrators

18:54.800 --> 19:00.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
came in with the flow of
migrants. And, you
know, it's had a pretty
destabilizing effect.

19:00.639 --> 19:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's quite possible -- you
spoke earlier
of a report of 400, which I find
to be really

19:05.111 --> 19:07.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
high number of potential
infiltrators.

19:08.014 --> 19:15.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, certainly, Europe has had
very weak external
borders. Its internal borders in
the Schengen

19:15.488 --> 19:20.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
area are nonexistent, so it's
very easy for
bad actors to move around, and
the migrant

19:20.593 --> 19:22.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crisis has really exacerbated
things.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Joby Warrick, what
do you think
about that?

19:24.463 --> 19:26.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOBY WARRICK: Yes.

19:26.298 --> 19:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's obviously something
that people talk
about politically in this
country, but it's

19:29.835 --> 19:34.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very different situation for
us here. There's
really much more vetting of
refugees, potential

19:34.974 --> 19:40.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees that come into this
country. It hasn't
really existed in Europe. And
now we have

19:40.479 --> 19:44.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got a huge problem that already
exists, and
it's in they're having to
retroactively go

19:44.050 --> 19:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back and try to figure out who
some of these
people are, and it is clear that
some bad

19:48.621 --> 19:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people came in with the rest.

19:50.423 --> 19:54.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, would you both
say that maybe
the root of this is more likely
to be the

19:54.527 --> 19:58.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civil war in Syria than because
of this, or
the civil war in Syria, which is
exacerbating,

19:58.631 --> 20:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is causing the migrant
crisis and also
causing this kind of
radicalization?

20:02.701 --> 20:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: So, there is
multiple causality.

20:05.738 --> 20:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, the Syrian civil war
has made a
huge difference and had a
profound effect

20:11.110 --> 20:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on radicalizing people who have
wanted to
go to Syria and fight to defend
Sunni Muslims

20:16.248 --> 20:20.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who they found were being
treated appallingly,
as we have seen.

20:20.219 --> 20:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, you know,
security services
in Europe for the most part --
and their bureaucracies

20:25.391 --> 20:30.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in general -- never had that
catalytic moment
that we had after 9/11, and they
have never

20:30.596 --> 20:35.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
removed their stovepipes. They
have never
really forced themselves to
cooperate as well.

20:35.167 --> 20:39.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are times in the U.S.
government when
you would find that part of a
particular foreign

20:40.005 --> 20:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
European government had one set
of information,
but didn't want another part to
know, but

20:44.910 --> 20:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we knew. And, you know, it's a
remarkable
situation, but, really, until
you have one

20:49.748 --> 20:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of these horrific attacks, there
isn't a sufficient
prod to reorganize.

20:54.420 --> 20:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Daniel Benjamin of
Dartmouth College,
and Joby Warrick, author of the
book "Black

20:59.458 --> 21:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Flags: The Rise of ISIS," thank
you both very
much.

21:12.438 --> 21:20.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
today said
the U.S. stands with Belgium and
other European

21:20.679 --> 21:26.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allies. But, at the same time,
she called
for more European countries to
invest in security.

21:26.619 --> 21:31.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In a speech at Stanford
University, she also
slammed the Republicans'
response to the terror

21:31.724 --> 21:33.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attacks in Brussels.

21:33.626 --> 21:37.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
In our fight against radical
jihadism, we

21:37.563 --> 21:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have to do what actually works.

21:40.833 --> 21:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing we know that doesn't
work is offensive,
inflammatory rhetoric that
demonizes all Muslims.

21:50.676 --> 21:55.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are millions of
peace-loving Muslims
living, working, raising
families and paying

21:55.548 --> 22:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taxes in this country. These
Americans are
a crucial line of defense
against terrorism.

22:02.855 --> 22:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are the most likely to
recognize the
warning signs of radicalization
before it's

22:08.127 --> 22:12.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
too late, and the best
positioned to block
it.

22:12.698 --> 22:19.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when Republican candidates
like Ted Cruz
call for treating American
Muslims like criminals

22:19.872 --> 22:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and for racially profiling
predominantly Muslim
neighborhoods, it's wrong, it's
counterproductive,

22:27.246 --> 22:29.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's dangerous.

22:29.048 --> 22:34.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more now on
the terrorist
attacks in Belgium, U.S. foreign
policy and

22:35.020 --> 22:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the race for the White House, we
turn to the
other Democratic presidential
candidate, Vermont

22:39.925 --> 22:41.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Senator Bernie Sanders.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Sanders, welcome. And,
first of all,
congratulations on your wins
yesterday in

22:45.998 --> 22:48.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Utah and Idaho.

22:48.133 --> 22:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know you know, as the voters
were going
to the polls in those states,
though, on the

22:51.403 --> 22:57.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other side of the Atlantic, the
city of Brussels
was reeling from this terrible
set of terrorist

22:57.610 --> 22:59.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
attacks.

22:59.445 --> 23:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Clinton said just a
short time ago
that ISIS cannot be contained;
it has to be

23:06.619 --> 23:08.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
defeated.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you agree? And, if so, how?

23:10.055 --> 23:13.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, I think it has to be
destroyed.

23:13.559 --> 23:19.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a barbaric organization
that is a
threat not only to the people in
the Middle

23:19.331 --> 23:23.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
East, to the people in Europe,
but obviously
to the people in the United
States as well.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It has to be destroyed.

23:25.137 --> 23:30.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here is how we destroy it.
We do not destroy
it by doing what we did in Iraq
and getting

23:30.542 --> 23:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into perpetual warfare. I voted
against the
war in Iraq. In fact, Secretary
Clinton, when

23:35.981 --> 23:39.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she was in the Senate, voted for
that war.

23:39.118 --> 23:45.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we do, as King Abdullah of
Jordan has
told us, is we work to put
together a very

23:45.324 --> 23:52.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effective coalition of Muslim
nations who
lead the effort on the ground,
supported by

23:52.798 --> 23:59.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States, the U.K.,
France, and other
major powers in the air and
through training.

23:59.038 --> 24:05.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in the last year, we have
had some success.
Ramadi has been recaptured. ISIS
has lost

24:05.177 --> 24:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 20 percent of the ground
that it controlled.
But we have a lot more to do.
So, I think

24:12.084 --> 24:14.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what we need is strong
coalition.

24:14.186 --> 24:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, Judy -- and
very few people
talk about this -- we have got
to bring in

24:18.557 --> 24:23.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
some of the Gulf region
countries who have
kind of sat it out, countries
like Qatar,

24:23.896 --> 24:30.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the wealthiest countries
on earth,
who are spending $200 billion in
preparation

24:30.235 --> 24:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the World Cups in 2022.

24:33.339 --> 24:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're spending $200 billion
for the World
Cup. Well, they may want to
spend some money

24:37.743 --> 24:43.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helping us destroy ISIS. Saudi
Arabia, the
UAE, Kuwait are going to have to
play a greater

24:43.382 --> 24:45.084 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
role.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Senator, as
the United
States waits for these other
countries to

24:47.186 --> 24:53.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get on board to form this
coalition, ISIS
is not only strong in its base
in Iraq and

24:53.859 --> 25:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria. It's now sending, we
know, hundreds
of fighters into Europe, the AP
reporting

25:00.265 --> 25:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today 400 trained fighters
planing attacks
in Europe.

25:05.637 --> 25:06.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's going on right now.

25:06.905 --> 25:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Right, and
that raises
the other issue.

25:09.341 --> 25:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, we have got to
destroy ISIS.
Second of all, we have got to
protect the

25:15.981 --> 25:22.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States from attacks and
protect our
allies throughout the world. And
that means

25:22.187 --> 25:27.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need to do a much greater job
in sharing
intelligence. We need to do a
much better

25:27.192 --> 25:32.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job in monitoring those young
people who are
being drawn into terrorism.

25:32.631 --> 25:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got to monitor how they
communicate
with each other to plan attacks.
So, there

25:38.103 --> 25:43.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a lot of work to be done to
protect our
country, as well as to protect
our allies

25:43.542 --> 25:45.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Europe and elsewhere, by the
way.

25:45.511 --> 25:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But how do you do
that, when
there are people right now in
Europe, in Belgium,

25:50.315 --> 25:55.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and other countries and
presumably here in
the United States who are
prepared to die

25:55.421 --> 25:57.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for this cause?

25:57.122 --> 26:02.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Well, Judy,
no one ever
said that this is going to be
simple.

26:02.494 --> 26:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have got to do is work
with increased
intelligence capabilities,
shared intelligence

26:07.966 --> 26:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capabilities. We have to work
with increased
law enforcement, with increased
monitoring,

26:13.739 --> 26:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with increased tracking of
people who come
into this country. This is not
easy. Your

26:17.810 --> 26:19.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
point is right.

26:19.545 --> 26:23.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If somebody is willing to blow
themselves
up and walk into an airport, or
walk into

26:23.682 --> 26:28.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a movie theater, you know what?
It is tough
to defend ourselves against
that. But, obviously,

26:28.921 --> 26:30.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we must do everything that we
can.

26:30.789 --> 26:35.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But I don't
understand how
you destroy ISIS, to use your
word, when you're

26:35.661 --> 26:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about intelligence
operations and
cooperation and coalitions.

26:40.732 --> 26:44.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: You don't
understand
how we destroy ISIS?

26:44.336 --> 26:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We destroy ISIS because there
are millions
of soldiers in the Middle East
who are under

26:51.009 --> 26:56.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arms right now. ISIS has perhaps
30,000 or
40,000 fighters. Our goal is to
bring those

26:56.949 --> 27:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries together, to put
troops on the ground
to destroy ISIS, not to get the
United States

27:02.921 --> 27:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
involved in perpetual warfare.

27:05.290 --> 27:09.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can ISIS be destroyed? Of course
they can.
It's a question of a coalition.
It's a question,

27:09.728 --> 27:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as King Abdullah has said,
Muslim troops on
the ground, not American troops.
And, by the

27:14.466 --> 27:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, it is not a question of
going to war
against a religion, as some of
my Republican

27:20.606 --> 27:26.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleagues would have us do.
We're taking
on terrorism and ISIS, not Islam
as a religion.

27:26.411 --> 27:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But to play
devil's advocate,
just one more question here,
Senator. The

27:31.450 --> 27:36.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach you describe is one
that is going
to take many months, maybe even
many years.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does the United States...

27:38.790 --> 27:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Well, you
know, Judy,
I don't know -- let me tell you
this, also,

27:40.626 --> 27:46.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy. I don't know how we can
stop somebody
who has an assault weapon from
shooting up

27:46.665 --> 27:48.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some people today.

27:48.500 --> 27:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are not easy answers.
You're right.
This is difficult. And anyone
who tells you

27:52.838 --> 27:58.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have a magical solution to
this problem
is not telling you the truth.
But the two-pronged

27:58.076 --> 28:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack -- two-pronged approach
has got to
be, number one, we do destroy
ISIS on the

28:03.916 --> 28:08.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ground in Iraq and in that
region.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, we do everything
possible to defend
the United States.

28:11.723 --> 28:15.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Senator
Sanders, a question
about the path to the
nomination.

28:15.093 --> 28:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You do have right now over 900
delegates.
But even the most optimistic,
realistic scenario

28:23.735 --> 28:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shows that it's very difficult
for you, going
to be very difficult for you to
overcome,

28:27.506 --> 28:29.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to overtake Secretary Clinton.

28:29.775 --> 28:35.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you still believe that it is
possible for
you to accumulate the number of
delegates

28:35.047 --> 28:37.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you need to capture the
Democratic nomination?

28:37.449 --> 28:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Well, Judy,
let's start
off by remembering maybe a
discussion you

28:42.254 --> 28:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I might have had 10 months
ago when I
began.

28:45.190 --> 28:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that point, I was 3 percent
in the polls,
70 points behind Hillary
Clinton. CBS had

28:51.363 --> 28:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a poll this week had me five
points behind.
And what Democrats all over this
country are

28:56.368 --> 29:03.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking notice of is that, in
virtually every
national poll, I defeat Donald
Trump by significantly

29:03.241 --> 29:05.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
greater numbers than does
Secretary Clinton.

29:05.811 --> 29:12.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, what Democrats are
understanding and what
superdelegates are understanding
that, really,

29:12.317 --> 29:17.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most important thing right
now is to make
sure we don't have some
Republican in the

29:17.289 --> 29:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House. And I think people
are taking
a second look at Bernie Sanders,
because,

29:21.860 --> 29:26.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clearly, he is the stronger
candidate to defeat
Donald Trump.

29:26.365 --> 29:32.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, in terms of how the
electoral process
has gone on, Secretary Clinton
did very, very

29:32.738 --> 29:37.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well in the Deep South. We
didn't do well.
She got a whole lot of
delegates. Well, you

29:37.175 --> 29:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, what? We're moving out of
the Deep South
now.

29:39.978 --> 29:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just yesterday, as you know, we
got almost
80 percent of the vote in Idaho
and Utah.

29:45.517 --> 29:50.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We won Democrats aboard with 67
percent. This
weekend, we're heading to
Washington, Hawaii,

29:50.822 --> 29:54.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alaska. I can't predict the
outcomes. I hope
we do very well.

29:54.693 --> 30:00.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have major states like New
York state,
New Jersey, California, Oregon
coming up.

30:00.165 --> 30:04.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We think we have a chance to do
very, very
well there. So, we have come
from way, way,

30:04.469 --> 30:10.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way back. And I think very few
people would
have thought that a Bernie
Sanders and our

30:10.475 --> 30:16.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign and what we're talking
about would
have won 12 contests already.

30:16.481 --> 30:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we do believe we have a path
to the White
House, and it is through the
West.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still very much
in the fight.

30:24.289 --> 30:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Bernie Sanders, we thank
you.

30:26.358 --> 30:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you
very much.

30:30.362 --> 30:41.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

30:41.606 --> 30:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
sex trafficking
of young girls has moved online;
and listen

30:50.348 --> 30:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, the latest songs and sounds
added to the
Library of Congress.

30:55.687 --> 31:00.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, we turn to the
Supreme Court,
where the clash between
religious freedom

31:00.459 --> 31:04.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and women's access to birth
control played
out once again today.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Hands off my birth
control!

31:06.098 --> 31:12.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Today marked the
fourth time the
high court has heard a challenge
to the president's

31:12.104 --> 31:13.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
signature health care law.

31:13.905 --> 31:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the center of today's case,
the Affordable
Care Act's contraceptive
mandate. Just two

31:20.412 --> 31:26.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years ago, arts and crafts chain
Hobby Lobby
challenged that mandate, and
won. Justices

31:26.418 --> 31:32.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ruled that family-owned
companies run on religious
principles could refuse to pay
for their employees'

31:32.791 --> 31:34.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
birth control.

31:34.760 --> 31:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's case shifted the focus
from private
companies to the potential
burden for religious

31:39.397 --> 31:45.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nonprofits. The challenge comes
in part from
an order of nuns, the Little
Sisters of the

31:45.103 --> 31:50.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Poor. Along with six other
plaintiffs, they
argue the law forces them to
either violate

31:50.275 --> 31:53.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their beliefs or pay a
substantial fine.

31:53.311 --> 31:56.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOTHER LORAINE MARIE MAGUIRE,
Little Sisters
of the Poor: We find ourselves
in a situation

31:56.314 --> 32:02.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
where the government is
requiring us to make
changes in our health care, our
religious

32:02.120 --> 32:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care plan to include
services that
really violate our deepest-held
religious

32:08.126 --> 32:09.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
beliefs as Little Sisters.

32:09.895 --> 32:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The National Women's
Law Center
sided with the Obama
administration, saying

32:15.000 --> 32:17.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coverage alternatives for these
groups already
exist.

32:17.736 --> 32:20.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRETCHEN BORCHELT, National
Women's Law Center:
Women deserve insurance coverage
for birth

32:20.705 --> 32:26.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control no matter where they
work. These employers
want to take that benefit away
from their

32:26.778 --> 32:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
employees. The alternatives that
they proposed
in court today are unworkable
and, frankly,

32:33.585 --> 32:34.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
insulting.

32:34.452 --> 32:37.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A ruling is expected
by June.

32:37.756 --> 32:41.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on today's arguments,
we turn to
our "NewsHour" regular Marcia
Coyle of "The

32:41.393 --> 32:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Law Journal." She was,
as always,
in the court today.

32:44.763 --> 32:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It seems like we had a
discussion about morality
at the Supreme Court, Marcia.

32:48.400 --> 32:53.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Yes, because the religious
nonprofits that

32:53.471 --> 32:59.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have brought these cases -- and
there are
seven cases -- to the Supreme
Court feel that

32:59.511 --> 33:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government's attempt to
accommodate their
objections is making them
complicit in immoral,

33:07.118 --> 33:08.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sinful conduct.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, how did this end
up back at
the court? Because we have --
the court has

33:11.890 --> 33:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ruled on this, on Obamacare
before, a couple
times now.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Oh, yes.

33:17.963 --> 33:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, this is the fourth time
the court's
looked at the law. But this is
-- it really

33:21.967 --> 33:27.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
involves health regulations
under the Affordable
Care Act, and there are -- there
have been

33:27.439 --> 33:33.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dozens and dozens of lawsuits by
religious
nonprofits almost from the
beginning of the

33:33.311 --> 33:34.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enactment of the Affordable Care
Act.

33:34.579 --> 33:35.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Including
universities and schools.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's right.

33:37.549 --> 33:41.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is not just Little Sisters of
the Poor
even before the Supreme Court.
There are religious-affiliated

33:41.887 --> 33:48.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleges. There are Roman
Catholic diocese
and some clergy who are also
party to these

33:48.994 --> 33:50.795 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cases.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So what are the
other options?
What is the compromise that the
administration

33:52.931 --> 33:54.599 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was offering?

33:54.633 --> 33:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: The administration
has told
the religious nonprofits to
simply write a

33:58.904 --> 34:04.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
letter to the Department of
Health and Human
Services notifying the
department of their

34:04.409 --> 34:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
objections, and also to give the
department
the name of their health insurer
or their

34:10.949 --> 34:12.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
third-party administrator.

34:12.817 --> 34:18.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The religious nonprofits say
they are not
objecting to objecting, but they
claim that

34:18.723 --> 34:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by providing the name of their
insurer or
third-party administrator,
they're allowing

34:24.129 --> 34:30.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government to hijack their
insurance plan
and provide the coverage to
their employees

34:30.969 --> 34:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they object to. And this
makes them complicit
in that coverage.

34:34.940 --> 34:39.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, in fact,
Justice -- Chief
Justice Roberts used that word
hijacked today.

34:39.177 --> 34:41.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell us about how this played
out in front
of the court.

34:41.313 --> 34:45.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Chief Justice
Roberts and Justice
Alito in particular were the
most aggressive

34:45.550 --> 34:51.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questioners of the solicitor
general of the
United States defending the
accommodation

34:51.556 --> 34:53.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this case.

34:53.325 --> 34:58.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Chief Justice Roberts said
he thought
that hijacking was an accurate
description

34:58.730 --> 35:04.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what's happening here. But
the solicitor
general told the justices that
it's not accurate.

35:04.536 --> 35:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that these insurance
plans do not
belong to the employers. They
belong to the

35:11.376 --> 35:13.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
insurers.

35:13.244 --> 35:17.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the government has always
had the ability
to make arrangements with third
parties. And,

35:17.148 --> 35:22.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this case, the government
would arrange
with the insurer to provide the
contraceptive

35:22.821 --> 35:29.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
coverage in a separate
agreement, separate
communications, and segregated
funds. The

35:29.494 --> 35:31.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
employer is entirely out of it.

35:31.363 --> 35:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now, we know, of
course, that
last time there was a challenge
to the Affordable

35:35.533 --> 35:41.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Care Act involving the Hobby
Lobby case, Justice
Scalia was still alive, still a
nine-member

35:41.272 --> 35:41.940 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
court.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's correct.

35:43.742 --> 35:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: With the 4-4 split,
what did you
discern from the arguments today
about how

35:47.379 --> 35:49.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's going to turn out?

35:49.147 --> 35:52.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, my sense is
-- as I left
the courtroom, is that the court
is evenly

35:52.283 --> 35:54.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
divided.

35:54.085 --> 36:01.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the government wants to win a
ruling for
the entire nation, it's going to
need somebody

36:01.960 --> 36:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the conservative side to
move over to
the liberal side, so that there
would be a

36:06.798 --> 36:13.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
5-3 majority. The most likely
person often
is Justice Kennedy. But he gave
conflicting

36:13.304 --> 36:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
signals during the argument, but
he also did
pick up the hijacking language.

36:18.743 --> 36:23.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's not clear to me how this
is going
to come out. I would say, Gwen,
that this

36:24.015 --> 36:30.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
court doesn't like 4-4
decisions. It's a waste
of everybody's time. It doesn't
create a precedent.

36:30.455 --> 36:33.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it leaves uneven law
throughout the country.

36:33.992 --> 36:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But if it were to
happen in this
case, what stands?

36:36.728 --> 36:38.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

36:38.563 --> 36:43.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, the lower court's opinion
stands. Now,
in these seven cases, four
federal appellate

36:43.201 --> 36:48.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courts have ruled for the
government. An additional
three appellate courts ruled for
the government.

36:48.540 --> 36:55.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One has not. So, in the states
where the government
won, the employers have to
comply.

36:55.213 --> 36:56.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: OK. It's
complicated.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

36:57.749 --> 36:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm sorry to throw
that at you
at the last minute.

36:58.983 --> 37:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marcia Coyle of "The National
Law Journal,"
thank you.

37:03.121 --> 37:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Gwen.

37:09.127 --> 37:16.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: a
disturbing new trend
in the trafficking of mostly
young women and

37:16.601 --> 37:18.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
children into the sex trade.

37:18.970 --> 37:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro reports
from the Philippines on what
police call cyber-trafficking.

37:25.310 --> 37:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of his ongoing series
Agents for
Change.

37:28.346 --> 37:33.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Sex tourism
has long been
a scourge in the Philippines, an
industry

37:33.551 --> 37:39.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that thrives on trafficked human
beings and
deep poverty in this nation of
100 million.

37:39.858 --> 37:44.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recent studies have shown that
anywhere from
100 to more than 300 thousand
Filipinos are

37:44.996 --> 37:50.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trafficked each year; 80
percent, four out
of five, are under the age of
18.

37:50.802 --> 37:57.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The government, under
international pressure,
has stepped up enforcement.
Stings like this

37:57.108 --> 38:03.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one to rescue young women are
more common,
as are arrests and convictions.
But the sex

38:03.348 --> 38:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trafficking industry, as always,
seems a step
ahead in the game.

38:07.519 --> 38:08.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It has expanded online.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVY CASTILLO, Police Officer:
That's only
one but there are a lot.

38:11.890 --> 38:16.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: At the
police cyber-crime
center, officer Ivy Castillo
explained one

38:16.895 --> 38:21.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the many ways that vulnerable
young women
are tricked into the trade.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IVY CASTILLO: This is a fake
account.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Modeling is
a common lure.

38:25.403 --> 38:32.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they're pretending that this
is a real
modeling agency to entrap the
young girls?

38:32.143 --> 38:38.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has all the trappings of a
glamorous fashion
model agency, especially to a
young rural

38:38.216 --> 38:39.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Filipina girl.

38:39.551 --> 38:42.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVY CASTILLO: At first, they are
requested
to send this image.

38:42.554 --> 38:47.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They're
asked to submit
pictures that seem innocuous,
facial shots,

38:47.759 --> 38:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ostensibly part of the selection
process.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
IVY CASTILLO: The next
requirement is with
a two-piece.

38:51.729 --> 38:57.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The next
steps call for
more revealing images, just the
torso, not

38:57.402 --> 39:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the face, they're assured,
giving the false
impression that it's
unidentifiable. The young

39:03.441 --> 39:08.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman won't make the connection
that computer
software will, until it's too
late.

39:08.613 --> 39:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have got her face from her
previous,
more innocent images, and have
Photoshopped

39:13.384 --> 39:14.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them with the nude ones.

39:14.819 --> 39:16.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IVY CASTILLO: Yes.

39:16.621 --> 39:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In no time,
they are shamed
and blackmailed into working for
the opaque

39:19.357 --> 39:22.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criminal networks behind the
trade.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lila Shahani is on a government
task force
on human trafficking.

39:25.630 --> 39:30.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LILA SHAHANI, Human Trafficking
Task Force:
Cyber-pornography is easily one
of our biggest

39:30.702 --> 39:37.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problems. It's proliferated very
quickly.
and it's an expensive thing to
police, and

39:37.642 --> 39:39.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we're a Third World country.

39:39.811 --> 39:46.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But it's an
industry fueled
by First World demand, from
pedophiles mostly

39:46.084 --> 39:49.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Europe, North America, and
Australia, says
officer Castillo.

39:49.921 --> 39:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IVY CASTILLO: These foreign
perpetrators,
they have contacts here in the
Philippines,

39:54.892 --> 39:58.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wherein these contacts are
looking for children.

39:58.529 --> 40:03.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And perhaps
the most frustrating
challenge with this cyber-sex
industry is

40:03.568 --> 40:08.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a social one. Cecilia Oebanda,
who founded
the Philippines' largest
anti-trafficking

40:09.007 --> 40:12.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group, says many people don't
believe or don't
want to believe it's that
harmful.

40:12.910 --> 40:16.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CECILIA FLORES-OEBANDA,
Anti-Trafficking Activist:
Because they think that they're
-- the girls

40:16.547 --> 40:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are just actually performing in
the computer,
and there's no contact, there is
no touch.

40:23.321 --> 40:28.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For them, it's OK. There's no
harm actually
put to the child.

40:28.860 --> 40:33.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: At a shelter
her agency
runs is living proof that it's
not just emotionally

40:33.665 --> 40:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abusive, but also frequently
escalates. The
children are invariably inducted
into traditional

40:40.071 --> 40:44.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prostitution and its daily
physical abuse.

40:44.108 --> 40:49.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These two 15-year-olds were
rescued in a police
sting from a cyber-porn racket.
Their alleged

40:49.947 --> 40:55.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pimp, a man named Jerrie Arraz
began as a
good samaritan neighbor.

40:55.119 --> 41:00.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIRL (through translator): There
was a time
when my mother need money
because my stepfather

41:00.491 --> 41:03.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was in jail. So she asked Jerrie
for help.

41:04.028 --> 41:06.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Her mother:

41:06.564 --> 41:10.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): He
was really
kind. When we didn't have food,
he gave us

41:10.968 --> 41:14.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
food. Jerrie offered to send
Gina to school.

41:14.472 --> 41:19.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: This young
woman is the
11th of 12 children in a family
from one of

41:19.744 --> 41:25.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the many rural Philippine
islands beset by
poverty and often natural
disasters.

41:25.416 --> 41:32.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Opportunities are scarce, so, at
12, the offer
of a scholarship from a kindly
stranger, a

41:32.123 --> 41:34.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
man visiting to her village, was
hard to resist.

41:34.826 --> 41:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIRL (through translator): He
said that he's
from Manila. So, I would say my
dream is to

41:39.197 --> 41:45.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
study in Manila and to know the
people, to
-- like, to wear nice clothes.

41:45.536 --> 41:49.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She
accompanied the man
to Manila, and was placed with
Arraz, with

41:49.874 --> 41:55.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
whom he was apparently
associated. She was
in fact placed in school, but,
gradually,

41:55.546 --> 42:01.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there were demands, and they
escalated, to
display herself before strangers
online, then

42:01.519 --> 42:06.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to perform sexually and with
Arraz in front
of the camera.

42:06.457 --> 42:12.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIRL (through translator): He
would wake me
up to say there was a customer
online and

42:12.630 --> 42:18.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wanted us to perform while
the customer
was watching. Each time, it
happened, I just

42:18.035 --> 42:19.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cried.

42:19.771 --> 42:24.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In time, the
cyber-sex
had escalated to plain old
prostitution.

42:24.108 --> 42:30.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIRL (through translator): In a
month, about
four to five times, we met with
foreign customers

42:30.415 --> 42:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a hotel, plus daily online.

42:32.750 --> 42:38.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It was when
both girls
were in a hotel one day that
Arraz was nabbed

42:38.322 --> 42:42.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as he negotiated with two
undercover detectives
posing as customers.

42:42.627 --> 42:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN LLEDO, Prosecutor:
There were Caucasian
-- Caucasian undercover agents.

42:45.830 --> 42:51.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Prosecutor
Jonathan Lledo
was on the sting team, one of
whose members

42:51.803 --> 42:53.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hid in waiting.

42:53.070 --> 42:57.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN LLEDO: He was inside
the closet for
four hours.

42:57.141 --> 43:03.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the phone call rung that
signaled that
money exchanged hands. And we
opened the door

43:03.047 --> 43:07.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and announced. There was
bewilderment. There
was: What is happening here?

43:07.652 --> 43:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The young
women, in terror,
ran to their trafficker and to
his defense.

43:13.491 --> 43:18.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIRL (through translator): We
always felt
like Jerrie was our father, so
that's what

43:18.129 --> 43:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we told rescuers. He is our
father. We were
really scared.

43:22.200 --> 43:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It's been
called the Stockholm
syndrome, Lledo says, one more
complication

43:27.605 --> 43:33.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in rescuing hostages who become
sympathetic
to their captor, and any change
to what has

43:33.077 --> 43:35.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
become normal in their lives is
unsettling.

43:35.746 --> 43:42.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN LLEDO: The trafficker
is providing
them with food, clothing,
shelter and a place

43:42.353 --> 43:47.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stay, and law enforcement
will disrupt
all this.

43:47.358 --> 43:54.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: As it turns
out, six children
were removed from the home of
Jerrie Arraz

43:54.065 --> 44:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and placed with Oebanda's
agency, including
a 1-year-old infant abandoned by
its mother.

44:02.807 --> 44:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The more immediate task is to
try to restore
childhoods through counseling
and eventually

44:07.845 --> 44:12.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
adoption into homes, education
and skills
training for those older.

44:12.383 --> 44:15.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVY CASTILLO: Most of our cases
are referred
from our foreign counterparts.

44:15.953 --> 44:20.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Philippine
police officials
say most of the enforcement
comes from the

44:20.324 --> 44:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consumer end. Tracking down
providers is fraught
with difficulty. They can be
anywhere, evidence

44:26.297 --> 44:30.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against them, if it exists,
hidden in the
cloud instead of a hard drive.

44:30.835 --> 44:32.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of bad guys are not being
caught, right?

44:32.937 --> 44:34.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
IVY CASTILLO: Yes.

44:34.605 --> 44:37.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Another big
challenge
is that police must rely on tips
from the

44:37.675 --> 44:39.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public, says task force member
Shahani.

44:40.011 --> 44:50.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LILA SHAHANI: There is a real
fear of -- among
informants of retaliation from
big syndicates.

44:50.755 --> 44:55.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But Oebanda,
who has long
campaigned against trafficking,
sees progress.

44:55.760 --> 45:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CECILIA FLORES OEBANDA: Our
conviction rate
has more than double. So, for
me, that progress

45:03.601 --> 45:07.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is indications of the political
will.

45:07.438 --> 45:12.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Attention is
now on Jerrie
Arraz's trial, now under way in
Manila. These

45:12.777 --> 45:17.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
images are from his Facebook
page. It's the
first so-called
cyber-trafficking case to

45:18.015 --> 45:22.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be brought, in hopes that it
will mark a turning
point.

45:22.253 --> 45:28.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Manila.

45:28.492 --> 45:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to a "NewsHour"
essay.

45:37.368 --> 45:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier in the week, we heard
what it was
like to live through the wave of
terrorism

45:41.606 --> 45:47.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Turkey from Elliot Ackerman,
a decorated
Marine veteran in Iraq and
Afghanistan, and

45:47.044 --> 45:49.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
author of the new novel "Green
on Blue."

45:49.847 --> 45:54.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Ackerman examines the
legacy of a
revolution and the deep wounds,
but often

45:54.518 --> 45:57.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
strong bonds forged by war.

45:57.355 --> 46:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLIOT ACKERMAN, Author, "Green
on Blue":
Five years ago this past
December, the Arab

46:00.424 --> 46:05.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spring started when a Tunisian
street vendor,
Mohamed Bouazizi, poured a can
of gasoline

46:05.696 --> 46:08.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over his head and lit himself on
fire.

46:08.366 --> 46:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was protesting a corrupt
government official's
seizure of his fruit cart and
scales. In the

46:13.437 --> 46:18.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months that followed across
Egypt, Libya,
Yemen, and, most disastrously,
Syria, revolution

46:18.576 --> 46:20.378 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spread.

46:20.411 --> 46:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, there is no revolution
left in the
Arab world, only war. Yet, the
revolutionaries

46:25.182 --> 46:30.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remain. They are particularly
prevalent among
Syria's growing diaspora. When
the Arab Spring

46:31.022 --> 46:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began, I was in Afghanistan on
my last deployment,
ending combat service that had
started in

46:36.060 --> 46:37.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Iraq seven years before.

46:37.828 --> 46:42.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And instead of returning home, I
returned
to the Middle East, writing
about the conflict

46:42.233 --> 46:47.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria from Turkey's southern
border. Working
as a journalist, I believed at
first that

46:47.538 --> 46:52.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my experience as a Marine in
America's unpopular
wars would prove a liability
when speaking

46:52.977 --> 46:55.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to former revolutionaries.

46:55.112 --> 47:00.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Slowly, thanks to close Syrian
friends, what
I found was quite the opposite.
A bond existed

47:00.451 --> 47:06.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between us. And this surprised
me. One of
these friends was Abed, an
activist from Damascus

47:06.357 --> 47:08.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now living in Southern Turkey.

47:08.259 --> 47:13.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Proud as Abed was of his role as
an organizer
in the 2011 protests, he felt
deeply conflicted

47:13.964 --> 47:19.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about his participation. Abed
believed in
the revolution's ideals. He
still did, yet

47:19.370 --> 47:24.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he couldn't deny that the very
forces of change
he helped unleash created a
power vacuum exploited

47:24.909 --> 47:27.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by extremists like the Islamic
State.

47:27.978 --> 47:32.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sipping tea or having dinner on
any given
night, Abed would begin by
asserting that

47:32.316 --> 47:37.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the revolution wasn't over,
that, despite
setbacks, hope still existed for
democracy

47:37.088 --> 47:42.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside Syria. But by the time
each evening
drew to a close, he would often
despair: "I

47:42.827 --> 47:47.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wish we had never taken to the
streets. I
have destroyed my home."

47:47.198 --> 47:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abed's inability to reconcile
what his revolution
hoped to achieve with its
outcome felt familiar

47:52.169 --> 47:57.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to me. When it comes to
America's wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan, I feel
almost exactly

47:57.208 --> 47:58.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the same conflict.

47:58.976 --> 48:03.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to rooting out
al-Qaida and the
Taliban in Afghanistan, and
searching for

48:03.280 --> 48:09.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WMD in Iraq, our nation sent me
and countless
others who volunteered to bring
freedoms and

48:09.286 --> 48:13.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
democracy to those who had lived
under violent,
autocratic regimes for decades.

48:13.991 --> 48:20.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, it seems naive to say now,
but that was
one of the goals then. Just as
the Syrian

48:20.364 --> 48:25.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
revolution resulted in a power
vacuum filled
by international jihadists, so,
too, did the

48:25.369 --> 48:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S.-led wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan.

48:28.739 --> 48:33.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As my friendship with Abed grew,
we began
to speak about the parallel
trajectories of

48:33.244 --> 48:38.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
our disillusionment, how
high-minded ideals
bogged down in the quagmire of
Islamist dogma

48:38.282 --> 48:41.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and sectarian bloodshed.

48:41.352 --> 48:46.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After I had known Abed for about
a year, he
invited me to his wedding. The
summer before

48:46.157 --> 48:51.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the revolution, he had met a
Swiss woman,
a university student studying in
Damascus.

48:51.295 --> 48:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would be married just
outside Geneva
at the Abbey Debeve (ph) along
the banks of

48:56.400 --> 48:58.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lake Neuchatel.

48:58.202 --> 49:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few days before the ceremony,
Abed called
and asked if I would serve as
his witness.

49:03.140 --> 49:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had become close, but his
request was a
surprise. Yet, when I arrived at
the chapel,

49:07.578 --> 49:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it made sense. The bride's
family and friends
filled the pews, but with Abed's
family trapped

49:13.250 --> 49:17.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Damascus, I represented the
entirety of
the groom's party.

49:17.388 --> 49:22.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the wedding started, there
were four of
us, the maid of honor, the
bride, Abed, and

49:22.126 --> 49:27.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me, on a single pew. The civil
ceremony was
in French, which Abed does not
speak, and

49:27.998 --> 49:32.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his bride leaned toward him,
quietly whispering
a translation.

49:32.036 --> 49:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Abed struggled to understand
his vows,
he glanced over to me now and
again, plaintively,

49:36.740 --> 49:40.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as if apologizing that I cannot
understand
either.

49:40.911 --> 49:45.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That a former American Marine
should serve
as the sole witness to a new
life embarked

49:45.115 --> 49:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
upon by a former Syrian activist
felt appropriate.
My wars and his revolution had
left a wake

49:51.288 --> 49:56.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of destruction, forcing both of
us to craft
new lives from the wreckage.

49:56.360 --> 49:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sitting next to my friend, it
didn't seem
to matter that he couldn't
understand the

49:59.730 --> 50:07.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particulars of his vows. What
mattered was
the choice he had made, to start
again.

50:08.005 --> 50:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And finally, our
"NewsHour" shares
of the night, something that
caught our eye

50:19.650 --> 50:22.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- actually, in this case,
caught our ear.

50:22.586 --> 50:28.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each year, the Library of
Congress designates
25 sound recordings for
posterity and preservation.

50:28.792 --> 50:30.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
See if your picks match theirs.

50:30.794 --> 50:35.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has a sample.

50:35.099 --> 50:45.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a trip
through the 20th
century, with something for
everyone, including

50:45.709 --> 50:52.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plenty of romance, from a 1911
recording by
the Columbia Quartet of "Let Me
Call You Sweetheart"

50:52.850 --> 51:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Julie London's version of
"Cry Me a River"
in 1955.

51:02.526 --> 51:13.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A year later came the jazz
standard "Mack
the Knife" with this performance
by Louis

51:13.170 --> 51:24.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Armstrong. And nearly a decade
later, the
Motown hit "Where Did Our Love"
go by the

51:24.148 --> 51:35.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supremes, a song the trio
initially thought
was too simplistic, but helped
gained them

51:35.159 --> 51:37.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great fame.

51:37.061 --> 51:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also among the 25 recordings are
important
speeches. Here is George
Marshall in 1947

51:42.666 --> 51:46.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outlining the plan to restore
Europe after
World War II.

51:46.270 --> 51:48.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE MARSHALL, U.S. Army Chief
of Staff:
It is logical that the United
States should

51:48.839 --> 51:54.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do whatever is able to do to
assist in the
return of normal economic health
in the world,

51:54.111 --> 51:57.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
without which there can be no
political stability
and no assured peace.

51:57.381 --> 52:02.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then a bit of
basketball
history: the only surviving
recording of Wilt

52:02.553 --> 52:06.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chamberlain scoring 100 points
in 1962. It
was taped off the radio by a
fan.

52:06.223 --> 52:14.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: They stopped the game.
People are running
out onto the court, 100 points
for Wilt Chamberlain!

52:14.198 --> 52:23.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Back to music,
and you knew
it had to be there, Gloria
Gaynor's 1978 anthem

52:23.574 --> 52:25.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"I Will Survive."

52:25.342 --> 52:34.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And last, but -- well, you
decide -- some
heavy metal from 1986,
Metallica's "Master

52:34.251 --> 52:35.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Puppets."

52:35.886 --> 52:40.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From the audio time capsule, I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

52:40.257 --> 52:44.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK, Gloria Gaynor
and the Supremes.

52:44.661 --> 52:47.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: She was singing it,
I swear. She
was singing along.

52:47.464 --> 52:48.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was trying.

52:48.565 --> 52:49.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:49.700 --> 52:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm all for "Cry Me
a River" and
Wilt.

52:51.368 --> 52:54.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Gwen
Ifill.

52:54.138 --> 52:55.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

52:56.006 --> 53:00.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening. For all of us at the
"PBS NewsHour,"

53:00.778 --> 53:10.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.

53:10.888 --> 53:20.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
