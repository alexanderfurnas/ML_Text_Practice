00:26.960 --> 00:28.395

00:28.395 --> 00:30.964
TAKE RISKS THEN WHO'S GOING TO

00:30.964 --> 00:32.432
DO THAT AND OUR NATION WILL

NEVER BE BUILT.

THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:44.177 --> 00:45.812
WE START WITH NEWS OF AN

00:45.812 --> 00:47.080
UNPRECEDENTED DIPLOMATIC MOVE:

00:47.080 --> 00:48.348
SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN KERRY

00:48.348 --> 00:49.816
SAYS THE U.S. AND ITS ALLIES

00:49.816 --> 00:51.818
WILL HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH

00:51.818 --> 00:53.253
PRESIDENT BASHAR AL-ASSAD TO END

00:53.253 --> 00:55.022
THE CONFLICT IN SYRIA.

00:55.022 --> 00:56.456
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE

00:56.456 --> 00:58.025
IT CLEAR TO HIM THAT THERE IS A

00:58.025 --> 00:59.826
DETERMINATION BY EVERYBODY TO

00:59.826 --> 01:01.895
SEEK THAT POLITICAL OUTCOME AND

01:01.895 --> 01:03.063
CHANGE HIS CALCULATION ABOUT

01:03.063 --> 01:04.965
NEGOTIATING.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.167
THAT'S UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW.

01:07.167 --> 01:08.168
>> Sreenivasan: UP UNTIL NOW,

01:08.168 --> 01:09.569
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS

01:09.569 --> 01:11.171
SAID ASSAD NEEDED TO STEP DOWN

01:11.171 --> 01:12.205
INSTEAD OF JOINING IN

01:12.205 --> 01:13.473
NEGOTIATIONS.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.075
MORE THAN 200,000 PEOPLE HAVE

01:15.075 --> 01:16.843
DIED DURING THE CONFLICT WHICH

01:16.843 --> 01:19.546
ENTERS ITS 5TH YEAR TODAY.

01:19.546 --> 01:20.514
SECRETARY KERRY ALSO SAID TODAY

01:20.514 --> 01:21.949
HE HOPES TO REACH THE FRAMEWORK

01:21.949 --> 01:23.483
OF A NUCLEAR ARMS DEAL WITH IRAN

01:23.483 --> 01:25.352
BY THE END OF MARCH.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.720
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH

01:26.720 --> 01:28.588
MCCONNELL SAYS HE'S, QUOTE,

01:28.588 --> 01:29.656
ALARMED ABOUT THE CURRENT PLAN.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.191
>> THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO

01:31.191 --> 01:32.225
MAKE, WHAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE A

01:32.225 --> 01:33.060
VERY BAD DEAL.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.761
HE CLEARLY DOESN'T WANT CONGRESS

01:34.761 --> 01:37.631
INVOLVED IN IT, AT ALL, AND

01:37.631 --> 01:39.499
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT IT.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.368
WE DON'T THINK HE OUGHT TO MAKE

01:41.368 --> 01:43.737
A BAD DEAL WITH ONE OF THE WORST

01:43.737 --> 01:44.938
REGIMES IN THE WORLD.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.106
>> Sreenivasan: THE WALL STREET

01:46.106 --> 01:47.307
JOURNAL'S CAROL LEE JOINS US NOW

01:47.307 --> 01:49.009
FROM WASHINGTON.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.444
>> SO LET'S START TALKING FIRST

01:50.444 --> 01:51.578
ABOUT THE 47 SENATORS WHO WROTE

01:51.578 --> 01:53.080
A LETTER TO IRAN AND WHAT THAT

01:53.080 --> 01:55.615
DID TO THIS NEGOTIATION PROCESS.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.084
>> WELL, IF ANYTHING IT CREATED

01:57.084 --> 01:58.785
A POLITICAL FIRESTORM IN THE

01:58.785 --> 01:59.453
U.S.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.321
I THINK WE DON'T YET KNOW

02:01.321 --> 02:02.956
EXACTLY THE IMPACT IT IS GOING

02:02.956 --> 02:04.958
TO HAVE ON NEGOTIATIONS THIS

02:04.958 --> 02:06.293
WEEK, WHICH STARTS SUNDAY NIGHT

02:06.293 --> 02:07.995
BUT IT CERTAINLY REALLY ANGERED

02:07.995 --> 02:09.963
THE WHITE HOUSE WHICH FELT LIKE

02:09.963 --> 02:12.265
THE LETTER WAS DESIGNED FOR NO

02:12.265 --> 02:14.067
OTHER INTENTION THAN TO UNDERCUT

02:14.067 --> 02:15.502
THE PRESIDENT ON HIS CHIEF

02:15.502 --> 02:17.137
FOREIGN POLICY INITIATIVE OF A

02:17.137 --> 02:18.905
THE SECOND TERM AND TWO TRACKS

02:18.905 --> 02:20.907
THAT IT COULD GO DOWN IN TERMS

02:20.907 --> 02:25.412
OF OUTCOME.

02:25.412 --> 02:26.713
FALLOUT FROM IT, AND ONE COULD

02:26.713 --> 02:28.382
BENEFIT THE WHITE HOUSE AND THAT

02:28.382 --> 02:29.783
IS THAT IT SEEMS TO MAKE

02:29.783 --> 02:31.985
DEMOCRATS WHO WERE ALIGNING WITH

02:31.985 --> 02:34.688
REPUBLICANS IN SOME LEGISLATION

02:34.688 --> 02:37.991
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE OPPOSES

02:37.991 --> 02:39.960
REGARDING IRAN IT IS GOING TO

02:39.960 --> 02:41.795
GIVE THEM PAUSE AS TO WHETHER

02:41.795 --> 02:43.764
THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

02:43.764 --> 02:45.532
SUPPORT THAT LEGISLATION OR AT

02:45.532 --> 02:48.368
THE VERY LEAST THERE ARE BILLS

02:48.368 --> 02:49.803
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE WOULD

02:49.803 --> 02:51.238
VETO, ONE OF THE THINGS

02:51.238 --> 02:52.739
REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO DO IS

02:52.739 --> 02:54.307
GET A MAJOR APPROVED MAJORITY IN

02:54.307 --> 02:57.244
THE SENATE BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS

02:57.244 --> 02:59.146
INTERPRETED IT AS SO PARTISAN

02:59.146 --> 03:00.747
MAY HAVE A BENEFIT FOR THE WHITE

03:00.747 --> 03:05.218
HOUSE OF THE REPUBLICANS NOT

03:05.218 --> 03:06.486
BEING ABLE TO ACHIEVE, BE AN

03:06.486 --> 03:08.021
APPROVED MAJORITY.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.222
AND THE SECOND THING THIS DID IS

03:09.222 --> 03:11.525
CREATE THE SITUATION THERE THAT

03:11.525 --> 03:13.727
THE THEY HAD CONCERNS IN THE

03:13.727 --> 03:15.262
WHITE HOUSE IF IRAN WALKS AWAY

03:15.262 --> 03:16.797
FROM THE TALKS IT IS VERY

03:16.797 --> 03:18.331
IMPORTANT THAT IRAN BE TO BE

03:18.331 --> 03:20.167
BLAMED FOR THAT AND IRAN OWNS

03:20.167 --> 03:21.868
THAT, AND IF THE TALKS FAIL A

03:21.868 --> 03:24.404
AND THEY CAN BLAME THE U.S. THAT

03:24.404 --> 03:26.973
IS A REAL CONCERN.

03:26.973 --> 03:28.809
>> SO THE WHITE HOUSE SENT A

03:28.809 --> 03:30.110
LETTER OF ITS OWN BACK LAST

03:30.110 --> 03:31.111
NIGHT.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.212
WHAT DID THAT SAY?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.847
>> THIS IS A LETTER FROM THE

03:33.847 --> 03:35.348
PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF,

03:35.348 --> 03:37.250
DENIS MCDONOUGH TO SENATOR ROB

03:37.250 --> 03:38.585
CORKER, THE ON THE FOREIGN,

03:38.585 --> 03:40.720
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AND

03:40.720 --> 03:42.422
IT STAYS WE DON'T SUPPORT YOUR

03:42.422 --> 03:44.458
BILL WHICH IS WIDELY KNOWN,

03:44.458 --> 03:46.660
SENATOR CORKER HAS A BILL THAT

03:46.660 --> 03:48.195
WOULD ESSENTIALLY GIVE CONGRESS

03:48.195 --> 03:49.996
AN UP OR DOWN VOTE OR WHETHER IT

03:49.996 --> 03:51.765
COULD APPROVE OR REJECT ANY

03:51.765 --> 03:54.134
FINAL DEAL AND THE WHITE HOUSE

03:54.134 --> 03:55.135
SAID THE PRESIDENT WOULD VETO

03:55.135 --> 03:56.336
THAT.

03:56.336 --> 03:57.637
THEY DON'T LIKE IT, THEY DON'T

03:57.637 --> 03:59.239
THINK THIS IS THE KIND OF

03:59.239 --> 04:01.141
AGREEMENT THAT REQUIRES SENATE

04:01.141 --> 04:03.210
RATIFICATION, AND SO DENIS

04:03.210 --> 04:05.078
MCDONOUGH SENT A LETTER TO

04:05.078 --> 04:07.280
CORKER AND SAID THEY DON'T

04:07.280 --> 04:08.715
OPPOSE THIS IN FACT HE STARTED

04:08.715 --> 04:10.517
TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT YOU ARE

04:10.517 --> 04:12.352
LIKELY TO HEAR MORE OF, HIS

04:12.352 --> 04:13.553
ARGUMENT WAS THAT CONGRESS WILL

04:13.553 --> 04:14.588
GET A VOTE ON THIS.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.356
THEY DON'T GET A VOTE ON WHETHER

04:16.356 --> 04:18.024
OR NOT TO APPROVE A DEAL OR DENY

04:18.024 --> 04:19.659
A DEAL BUT THEY WILL GET A VOTE

04:19.659 --> 04:20.694
IN TERMS OF, AND THEY WILL HAVE

04:20.694 --> 04:22.229
THEIR SAY IN TERMS OF HAVING TO

04:22.229 --> 04:24.831
LIFT SANCTIONS BECAUSE THEY

04:24.831 --> 04:25.932
CAN'T -- THE U.S. -- CAN

04:25.932 --> 04:27.334
PRESIDENT CANNOT UNILATERALLY

04:27.334 --> 04:28.568
LIFT ALL OF THE SANCTIONS,

04:28.568 --> 04:30.036
PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE MOST

04:30.036 --> 04:31.805
INTENSE ONES AND THAT REQUIRES

04:31.805 --> 04:32.772
AN ACT OF CONGRESS.

04:32.772 --> 04:33.773
>> SO HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT

04:33.773 --> 04:35.308
OVER THE NEXT WEEK?

04:35.308 --> 04:37.043
>> WELL, AS THEY GET CLOSER AND

04:37.043 --> 04:39.045
THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS THAT

04:39.045 --> 04:40.647
THEY ARE CLOSER THAN THEY HAVE

04:40.647 --> 04:42.048
EVER BEEN TO A DEAL, THERE IS

04:42.048 --> 04:43.850
PRETTY MUCH A BROAD BELIEF THEY

04:43.850 --> 04:45.285
WILL MEET THIS DEADLINE BY THE

04:45.285 --> 04:47.687
END OF MARCH, BUT AT THE SAME

04:47.687 --> 04:50.290
TIME THE POLITICAL THEATRE AND

04:50.290 --> 04:52.359
OUTCRY IN THE U.S. IS REALLY

04:52.359 --> 04:54.561
STEPPING UP, AND SO IT REMAINS

04:54.561 --> 04:56.696
TO BE SEEN HOW EXACTLY THIS WILL

04:56.696 --> 04:58.632
PLAY OUT, BUT I THINK IT ALSO

04:58.632 --> 05:00.634
REMAINS TO BE SEEN THAT IRAN

05:00.634 --> 05:02.369
RESPONDS TO, AND YOU WILL SEE

05:02.369 --> 05:04.638
THAT IN THE NEXT COMING DAYS

05:04.638 --> 05:06.273
WHAT THEIR POSTURE IS IN THIS

05:06.273 --> 05:08.441
ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS.

05:08.441 --> 05:09.509
>> ALL RIGHT, CAROL LEE OF THE

05:39.606 --> 05:40.740
ACKNOWLEDGED HE FIRED SHOTS AS

05:40.740 --> 05:42.542
THE PROTEST OUTSIDE THE POLICE

05:42.542 --> 05:43.610
STATION WAS BREAKING UP EARLY

05:43.610 --> 05:44.711
THURSDAY.

05:44.711 --> 05:45.979
WILLIAMS TOLD AUTHORITIES HE WAS

05:45.979 --> 05:47.280
NOT TRYING TO TARGET THE

05:47.280 --> 05:48.648
OFFICERS, BUT WAS INVOLVED IN AN

05:48.648 --> 05:49.482
UNRELATED DISPUTE.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.650
WILLIAMS WAS ALREADY WANTED FOR

05:50.650 --> 05:51.785
VIOLATING PROBATION.

05:51.785 --> 05:52.886
THE PROSECUTOR THANKED THE

05:53.987 --> 05:54.988
LEADING TO THE ARREST, AND ASKED

FOR MORE AS THE INVESTIGATION

06:02.195 --> 06:03.830
INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THEM BY

06:03.830 --> 06:05.565
MEMBERS OF THEM COMMUNITY, AND I

06:05.565 --> 06:07.867
CANNOT STRESS HOW IMPORTANT THAT

06:07.867 --> 06:09.569
IS IN EVERY CASE, AND IN THIS

06:09.569 --> 06:13.640
CASE IT HAS BEEN INVALUABLE.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.041
>> Sreenivasan: THE OBAMA

06:15.041 --> 06:16.543
ADMINISTRATION HAS REPORTEDLY

06:16.543 --> 06:17.577
ABANDONED PLANS TO PULL

06:19.546 --> 06:20.513
YEAR.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.315
THE U.S. HAD PLANNED TO REDUCE

06:22.315 --> 06:24.117
THE NUMBER OF TROOPS TO 5,500 BY

06:24.117 --> 06:25.719

06:25.719 --> 06:26.753
HOWEVER, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

06:26.753 --> 06:27.988
REPORTS THAT MILITARY LEADERS

06:27.988 --> 06:29.422
WANT TO KEEP MORE TROOPS ON THE

06:30.824 --> 06:32.259
REMNANTS OF AL-QAIDA AND MONITOR

06:32.259 --> 06:33.760
ISIS.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.228
THE WHITE HOUSE IS EXPECTED TO

06:35.228 --> 06:36.730
ANNOUNCE THE SLOWER WITHDRAWAL

06:36.730 --> 06:37.697
TIMELINE LATER THIS MONTH.

06:50.443 --> 06:51.778
THE DEATH TOLL IS EXPECTED TO

06:51.778 --> 06:52.545
RISE.

06:52.545 --> 06:53.780
MILITANT LEADERS SAY THE ATTACKS

06:53.780 --> 06:55.181
WILL CONTINUE UNTIL THERE IS A

09:16.322 --> 09:17.690
DOLLARS FROM THE C.I.A.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.092
EVIDENTLY WOUND UP IN THE

REPORTER MATTHEW ROSENBERG IN

09:25.231 --> 09:26.032
WASHINGTON, D.C.

09:26.032 --> 09:26.933
>> SO THAT MILLION WAS PART OF A

09:26.933 --> 09:27.500
LARGER SUM.

09:27.500 --> 09:28.334
WHERE DID THIS MONEY COME FROM

09:28.334 --> 09:29.836
AND WHERE DID IT GO?

09:29.836 --> 09:33.907
>> THE CIA FOR YEARS STARTING IN

09:33.907 --> 09:35.175
2003 PROVIDED WHAT AMOUNTED TO

09:35.175 --> 09:37.877
BASICALLY A SLUSH FUND FOR

09:37.877 --> 09:39.612
PRESIDENT KARZAI OF AFGHANISTAN

09:39.612 --> 09:41.014
AND HIS OFFICE, THEY USED THIS

09:41.014 --> 09:43.116
MONEY TO PAY OFF VARIOUS WAR

09:43.116 --> 09:44.617
LARDS ON AND OTHER PEOPLE TO

09:44.617 --> 09:47.153
KEEP ON OUR SIDE AND THINGS THAT

09:47.153 --> 09:48.621
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO DO ON THE

09:48.621 --> 09:50.690
BOOKS, SO A FEW YEARS EARLIER,

09:50.690 --> 09:52.826
IN 2008, AN AFGHAN DIPLOMAT HAD

09:52.826 --> 09:55.094
BEEN KIDNAPPED, THE AFGHANS WERE

09:55.094 --> 09:57.397
NEGOTIATING A RANSOM TO GET HIM

09:57.397 --> 09:58.631
BACK, FINALLY A PRICE WAS

09:58.631 --> 10:01.668
SETTLED OF $5 MILLION, AND THEY

10:01.668 --> 10:02.769
NEEDED $5 MILLION IN CASH, SO

10:02.769 --> 10:04.103
THEY WENT TO A SLUSH FUND THEY

10:04.103 --> 10:05.705
HAD AND THEY HAD ABOUT A MILLION

10:05.705 --> 10:07.340
THERE THEY PUT ASIDE AND TOOK

10:07.340 --> 10:10.043
THAT, THE REST OF THE 4 MILLION

10:10.043 --> 10:11.478
THEY GOT FROM IRAN AND PAKISTAN

10:11.478 --> 10:12.779
AND SOME OF THE GULF STATES THAT

10:12.779 --> 10:15.215
HELPED THEM OUT WITH CASH, AND

10:15.215 --> 10:16.249
IT ALL ENDED UP WITH AL QAEDA.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.785
>> AND WHEN YOU SAY CASH, YOU

10:18.785 --> 10:21.087
MEAN ACTUAL DOLLAR BILLS IN BAGS

10:21.087 --> 10:23.022
DROPPED OFF AT THE PALACE?

10:23.022 --> 10:23.823
>> YES.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.425
EVERY MONTH THEY WOULD GO THERE

10:25.425 --> 10:27.594
WITH SUIT CASES, BACKPACKS,

10:27.594 --> 10:29.162
SOMETIMES EVEN PLASTIC SHOPPING

10:29.162 --> 10:30.597
BAGS, AS IF THEY WERE COMING

10:30.597 --> 10:32.599
FROM SAFE WAY AND WOULD DROP OFF

10:32.599 --> 10:35.635
THE CASH FROM A FEW HUNDRED

10:35.635 --> 10:36.870
THOUSANDS OR MAYBE A FEW MILLION

10:36.870 --> 10:38.238
AT TIMES AND WENT TO A VARIETY

10:38.238 --> 10:39.072
OF PURPOSES.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.707
>> AND SO HOW DO WE KNOW THAT AL

10:40.707 --> 10:42.408
QAEDA ACTUALLY GOT SOME OF THOSE

10:42.408 --> 10:43.076
DOLLARS?

10:43.076 --> 10:46.980
>> WE KNOW BECAUSE WHEN THE NAVY

10:46.980 --> 10:48.681
NAVY, NAVY SEALS KILLED OBAMA,

10:48.681 --> 10:50.717
ON ON THEY SEIZED COMPUTERS AND

10:50.717 --> 10:52.085
DOCUMENTS FROM HIS COMPOUND AND

10:52.085 --> 10:54.521
A SERIES OF LETTERS BETWEEN BIN

10:54.521 --> 10:56.155
LADEN AND ONE OF HIS CHIEF

11:03.196 --> 11:04.697
THESE LETTERS BIN BEN AND ONE OF

11:04.697 --> 11:06.933
HIS LIEUTENANTS ARE DISCUSSING

11:06.933 --> 11:08.201
GETTING A RANSOM AND BUYING

11:08.201 --> 11:11.638
WEAPONS WITH IT AND THEN ALL

11:11.638 --> 11:13.907
KINDS OF WEIRD CONCERNS, BIN

11:13.907 --> 11:15.141
LADEN IS WANTING HIM TO BE

11:15.141 --> 11:16.509
CAREFUL WITH THE AMERICANS, THEY

11:16.509 --> 11:18.211
COULD BE TRACKING THIS AND MAYBE

11:18.211 --> 11:19.312
PUT RADIATION OR SOME SUBSTANCE

11:19.312 --> 11:21.180
ON IT AND HE ACTUALLY SEEMS MUCH

11:21.180 --> 11:23.716
MORE CONCERNED, IT SEEMS TO GIVE

11:23.716 --> 11:26.886
AMERICANS A LOT MORE CREDIT FOR

11:26.886 --> 11:27.987
TRACKING THEIR SPENDING THAN HAS

11:27.987 --> 11:29.489
EVER BEEN IN THE CASE IN IRAQ OR

11:29.489 --> 11:30.189
AFGHANISTAN.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.558
>> SO-SO THOSE LETTERS ALSO

11:31.558 --> 11:33.426
POINT OUT THAT THESE FUNDS WERE

11:33.426 --> 11:35.862
GOING TO BE USED TO BUY WEAPONS

11:35.862 --> 11:37.330
FOR THEIR FIGHT?

11:37.330 --> 11:38.665
>> YES.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.234
THEY WERE GOING TO HELP SUPPORT

11:41.234 --> 11:42.735
PEOPLE WHOSE FAMILIES, FIGHTERS

11:42.735 --> 11:44.370
WERE IN PRISON, HELP SUPPORT

11:44.370 --> 11:45.538
THEIR FAMILIES, SOME WAS GOING

11:45.538 --> 11:47.173

11:48.408 --> 11:49.709
THIS CASH DELIVERY CAME, THIS

11:49.709 --> 11:51.744
INFUSION OF CASH TO AL QAEDA

11:51.744 --> 11:53.079
CAME AT A CRUCIAL MOMENT, IN

11:53.079 --> 11:55.882
KIND OF 2010, THE DRONES FROM

11:55.882 --> 11:58.217
PAKISTAN AND THE HIDEOUTS IN

11:58.217 --> 11:59.919
PAKISTAN DESIGNATED THE RANKS OF

11:59.919 --> 12:01.955
THE ORGANIZATION, THEY WERE

12:01.955 --> 12:03.256
HAVING TROUBLE RAISING MONEY, I

12:03.256 --> 12:06.225
DON'T WANT TO SAY THIS HELPED TO

12:06.225 --> 12:07.060
REINVIGORATE THEM BUT HELPED

12:07.060 --> 12:08.294

12:08.294 --> 12:11.264
PART OF A BIGGER PICTURE IT

12:11.264 --> 12:13.266
HELPED THEM SURVIVE AND EVEN BIN

12:13.266 --> 12:15.568
LADEN THE THREAT TODAY, IT IS

12:15.568 --> 12:16.769

12:18.304 --> 12:18.972
COMPLETELY DISSIPATED.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.740

CREATE FIVE THOUSAND JOBS.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.661
ADMINISTERS MATTERS IN THE WEST

17:22.141 --> 17:24.277
HARDLY FINANCIALLY.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.312

20:23.722 --> 20:25.224
YEAR BEHIND SCHEDULE.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.759
AND THE REASON IS, THERE'S NO

20:26.759 --> 20:27.893
WATER.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.395
THIS IS A FURNISHED SHOW

20:30.529 --> 20:32.031
IT LOOKS GRAND AND IMPRESSIVE.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.834
FOR CLOSE TO A YEAR, ISRAELI

CHANNEL WATER TO RAWABI, WHICH

20:39.171 --> 20:42.141
SLOWED DOWN DEVELOPMENT HERE.
