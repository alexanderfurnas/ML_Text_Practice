00:12.145 --> 00:16.183
JUDY WOODRUFF: Violence
escalates in Eastern Ukraine, a
cease-fire on the brink after
rebels

00:16.183 --> 00:17.985
clash with troops.

00:17.985 --> 00:19.553
Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.556
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:22.556 --> 00:26.994
Also ahead this Thursday: Our
running series continues, with
South Carolina Senator Lindsey

00:26.994 --> 00:31.031
Graham and his bid for the
Republican nomination.

00:31.031 --> 00:36.937
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: cracking
Ebola's code. Scientists search
for live samples of deadly

00:36.937 --> 00:42.676
diseases to uncover how
infections spread among animals
and jump into humans.

00:42.676 --> 00:46.046
DR. PARDIS SABETI, Harvard
University: There are likely
some versions of Ebola that
don't

00:46.046 --> 00:49.549
make you sick at all. There are
some versions that probably
don't infect humans at all.

00:49.549 --> 00:53.553
And there are some that may
infect humans, but not spread
the way this does.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.088
GWEN IFILL: Those are some of
the stories we're covering on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:55.088 --> 00:56.990
(BREAK)

00:56.990 --> 01:01.295
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's word
this evening of an extensive new
government data breach.

01:01.295 --> 01:07.000
It's widely reported that
suspected Chinese hackers broke
into the Interior Department

01:07.000 --> 01:11.571
and the Office of Personnel
Management, which handles
security clearances. OPM says
data

01:11.571 --> 01:15.676
for four million people
may be compromised.

01:15.676 --> 01:21.815
Meanwhile, The New York Times
and ProPublica report that the
National Security Agency
expanded

01:21.815 --> 01:28.422
its Internet spying in 2012 to
cover foreign cyber-attacks.
The surveillance is not
regulated

01:28.422 --> 01:32.459
by the USA Freedom Act
just signed into law.

01:32.459 --> 01:37.731
GWEN IFILL: Floods and fire
rocked the West African state of
Ghana early today, killing

01:37.731 --> 01:44.271
at least 150 people. The
victims were sheltering at a gas
station in the capital city of
Accra.

01:44.271 --> 01:49.042
It exploded when flames from a
nearby fire reached fuel that
spilled into the floodwaters.

01:49.042 --> 01:53.580
Cell phone footage showed
fires burning out of control.

01:53.580 --> 01:57.117
Ghana's president blamed the
disaster partly on homes that
blocked drainage systems and

01:57.117 --> 01:58.752
led to the flooding.

01:58.752 --> 02:03.123
JOHN DRAMANI MAHAMA, President
of Ghana: We will have to take
some measures to be able

02:03.123 --> 02:09.129
to avoid this happening in the
future. And, often, when these
measures are drastic, you

02:09.129 --> 02:14.101
have a lot of sympathy and
pressure not to take those
measures. But I think that the

02:14.101 --> 02:19.206
time has come, you know, for us
to remove houses out of water
waste.

02:19.206 --> 02:22.676
GWEN IFILL: In addition to
those killed in the explosion,
local accounts said many

02:22.676 --> 02:26.213
others drowned in
the high water.

02:26.213 --> 02:31.485
JUDY WOODRUFF: In China,
recovery teams began work to
right a cruise ship that
capsized

02:31.485 --> 02:37.157
Monday on the Yangtze River.
More than 200 divers have
searched the ship, and recovered

02:37.157 --> 02:43.196
77 bodies, including some pulled
from holes cut into the hull.
But more than 360 people

02:43.196 --> 02:45.465
are still missing.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.435
XU CHENGGUANG, Spokesman,
Chinese Ministry of
Transportation (through
translator): The

02:48.435 --> 02:51.705
reason why we have decided to
upright the ship is that, first,
we haven't been able

02:51.705 --> 02:56.109
to find any more survivors after
the recent rescue work, and,
second, according to experts'

02:56.109 --> 03:00.580
analysis, there is very slim
hope of finding any survivors in
the ship.

03:00.580 --> 03:05.285
JUDY WOODRUFF: Communist Party
leaders promised today there
will be no cover-up in the
disaster.

03:05.285 --> 03:11.124
But they also directed police
to -- quote -- "safeguard social
stability," all of this

03:11.124 --> 03:17.197
as thousands in Hong Kong marked
26 years since government tanks
and troops crushed

03:17.197 --> 03:21.802
protests in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square. It is the only place in
China where such vigils

03:21.802 --> 03:23.904
are allowed.

03:23.904 --> 03:28.708
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, the family of a Boston
man killed by police said
reports

03:28.708 --> 03:33.246
that he'd become an Islamist
radical are a complete shock.
They called for a thorough

03:33.246 --> 03:39.186
investigation of his fatal
shooting. Usaama Rahim had been
under surveillance in a terror

03:39.186 --> 03:43.590
investigation. Police say they
fired when he came at them with
a knife.

03:43.590 --> 03:48.862
JUDY WOODRUFF: Public tributes
began in Delaware today for Beau
Biden, the vice president's

03:48.862 --> 03:53.500
eldest son. He died last
weekend of brain cancer. The
former state attorney general

03:53.500 --> 03:57.571
lay in honor in the
Delaware Senate chamber.

03:57.571 --> 04:02.175
Vice President Biden and other
family members attended a brief
service and spent much of

04:02.175 --> 04:06.546
the afternoon greeting mourners.
The funeral will be held
Saturday.

04:06.546 --> 04:10.817
GWEN IFILL: Former Texas
Governor Rick Perry today
formally opened his second bid
for the

04:10.817 --> 04:16.690
Republican presidential
nomination. His first attempt
collapsed in 2012 after a series

04:16.690 --> 04:21.895
of gaffes. Perry made his
declaration at an airport hangar
in Addison, Texas. Perry

04:21.895 --> 04:28.034
was flanked by former Navy SEALs
as he declared the end of an era
of failed leadership.

04:28.034 --> 04:32.873
RICK PERRY (R), Presidential
Candidate: We don't have to
accept slow growth that leaves

04:32.873 --> 04:37.777
behind the middle class, that
leaves millions of Americans out
of work. We don't have

04:37.777 --> 04:43.550
to settle for crumbling
bureaucracies that target
taxpayers and harm our veterans.
We

04:43.550 --> 04:48.421
don't have to resign ourselves
to debt and decay and slow
growth. We have the power

04:48.421 --> 04:51.358
to make things new again.

04:51.358 --> 04:56.229
GWEN IFILL: Also today, aides
to former Florida Governor Jeb
Bush confirmed he will

04:56.229 --> 05:02.602
formally announce his own
presidential run June 15. And
on the campaign trail,
Democratic

05:02.602 --> 05:06.840
front-runner Hillary Clinton
called for automatic voter
registration for 18-year-olds,
while

05:06.840 --> 05:11.578
denouncing Republican efforts
to enact voter I.D. laws.

05:11.578 --> 05:17.984
The U.S. House of
Representatives voted today to
keep restrictions on travel to
Cuba. Majority

05:17.984 --> 05:22.989
Republicans attached the
provision to a transportation
bill. It's a direct rebuff to
President

05:22.989 --> 05:27.394
Obama's diplomatic opening to
Havana, and the White House has
threatened a veto, if

05:27.394 --> 05:30.397
the bill gets
through the Senate.

05:30.397 --> 05:35.635
The government has concluded
that hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, doesn't do widespread

05:35.635 --> 05:40.540
harm to drinking water. That's
in a draft report today from the
Environmental Protection

05:40.540 --> 05:44.511
Agency. The study tracked water
injected deep underground, in
fracking, to open oil

05:44.511 --> 05:47.280
and gas deposits.

05:47.280 --> 05:53.787
JUDY WOODRUFF: Doctors in Texas
have performed the world's first
partial skull and scalp

05:53.787 --> 05:59.359
transplant. The recipient was
Jim Boysen, a 55-year-old cancer
patient from Austin.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.996
Radiation treatments had
destroyed part of his skull, and
he also needed a new kidney

06:02.996 --> 06:06.833
and pancreas because
of diabetes.

06:06.833 --> 06:11.338
At a Houston hospital today, he
said he opted for an
experimental 15-hour operation
to do

06:11.338 --> 06:13.473
everything at once.

06:13.473 --> 06:17.644
JIM BOYSEN, Transplant Patient:
I mean, I couldn't get
transplant surgery I needed

06:17.644 --> 06:24.451
for the organs without fixing my
scalp, but I couldn't fix my
scalp because of the failure

06:24.451 --> 06:28.188
of the organs. So I was in a
catch-22, like between a rock
and a hard place. And so

06:28.188 --> 06:31.091
I said, sure, I'm open to that.

06:31.091 --> 06:35.028
JUDY WOODRUFF: The operation
was performed on May 22.

06:35.028 --> 06:40.100
GWEN IFILL: And it was a long
day on Wall Street. Stocks fell
after Greece announced

06:40.100 --> 06:44.137
it won't make a payment due
tomorrow to the IMF and other
creditors, this after days of

06:44.137 --> 06:47.641
talks that seemed to be
headed to a resolution.

06:47.641 --> 06:54.214
The Dow Jones Industrials
dropped 170 points to close back
near 17900. The Nasdaq fell

06:54.214 --> 06:58.051
40 points, and the
S&P 500 was down 18.

06:58.051 --> 07:03.890
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour": unrest in
Ukraine, violence in the east
shatters

07:03.890 --> 07:10.363
a cease-fire; Senator Lindsey
Graham on his presidential bid;
scientists search for elusive

07:10.363 --> 07:16.803
live samples of Ebola in animals
to uncover how humans become
infected; front-runners

07:16.803 --> 07:21.474
and underdogs in the world of
sports; and personal butlers for
the masses, a service

07:21.474 --> 07:27.347
that can cater to
your every need.

07:27.347 --> 07:39.626
GWEN IFILL: Ukrainian president
Petro Poroshenko told his
military today to prepare for a
possible

07:39.626 --> 07:45.565
full-scale invasion from Russia.
The remarks came one day after a
new outbreak of fighting

07:45.565 --> 07:49.235
in Eastern Ukraine, which
claimed the lives of more than
25 people and injured dozens

07:49.235 --> 07:51.938
more.

07:51.938 --> 07:56.443
Speaking to the Ukrainian
Parliament, Poroshenko described
what he called a colossal threat

07:56.443 --> 08:01.548
of the resumption of large-scale
hostilities by Russian and
terrorist forces. And he

08:01.548 --> 08:08.088
said, contrary to Moscow's
denials, those Russian troops
are in rebel-controlled areas.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.758
PETRO POROSHENKO, Ukrainian
President (through translator):
In Ukrainian territory, there

08:11.758 --> 08:17.864
are 14 Russian battalions,
tactical groups that include
over 9,000 Russian military
servicemen.

08:17.864 --> 08:20.967
The concentration of Russian
servicemen along the national
border with Ukraine is

08:20.967 --> 08:25.138
1.5 times bigger
than a year ago.

08:25.138 --> 08:31.144
The military must be ready as
much for a renewal of an
offensive by the enemy in the
Donbass

08:31.144 --> 08:34.514
as they are for a full-scale
invasion along the whole length
of the border with Russia.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.851
We must be truly ready for this.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.955
GWEN IFILL: A cease-fire signed
in February has been steadily
crumbling, as international

08:41.955 --> 08:45.992
monitors report
regular violations.

08:45.992 --> 08:50.096
David Herszenhorn of The New
York Times has been following
the story from Moscow.

08:50.096 --> 08:53.633
Those were pretty strong words
from Petro Poroshenko today,
David. And they were backed

08:53.633 --> 08:56.770
up from what NATO -- by what
NATO has been saying as well.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.773
DAVID HERSZENHORN, The New York
Times: There's no question,
Gwen.

08:59.773 --> 09:03.643
What we see is that we have
entered a very tense, in fact,
obviously quite dangerous

09:03.643 --> 09:08.615
period of time, where Ukraine's
Western allies, especially
France and Germany, have become

09:08.615 --> 09:13.987
extremely frustrated by the slow
pace, the failure actually to
implement that Minsk 2

09:13.987 --> 09:17.157
cease-fire accord signed
back in February.

09:17.157 --> 09:21.261
And so what we see is an
increase in hostilities, as both
sides are trying to show that
the

09:21.261 --> 09:25.665
other is responsible for these
violations, for the increase in
violence and for the failure

09:25.665 --> 09:29.502
to move forward with political
compromises need for a long-term
settlement.

09:29.502 --> 09:33.907
GWEN IFILL: What has happened
between -- since February,
between now and then, that's
resulted

09:33.907 --> 09:37.644
in this latest kind of
explosion of violence?

09:37.644 --> 09:42.782
DAVID HERSZENHORN: Well, what
we see now is that the European
Union has begun to consider

09:42.782 --> 09:46.386
whether to extend economic
sanctions against Russia. Those
are set to expire without

09:46.386 --> 09:49.589
any further action
by the end of July.

09:49.589 --> 09:54.194
The cease-fire had been mostly
holding, but as each side tries
to position itself, of

09:54.194 --> 09:58.798
course, we expect that this kind
of violence will flare up. At
the same time, Petro Poroshenko

09:58.798 --> 10:02.735
has now come upon a full year
since his inauguration. It's
been a very tough year for
Ukraine.

10:02.735 --> 10:05.438
He made that clear
in his speech today.

10:05.438 --> 10:09.576
The country is suffering
greatly. And the economy is on
the verge of collapse. They

10:09.576 --> 10:13.980
feel this constant threat of
war. And so the tensions really
are running high. And

10:13.980 --> 10:18.084
now, as we push toward this
question of a renewal of
sanctions, each side wants to
show

10:18.084 --> 10:22.222
that the other is more at fault,
laying the groundwork for what
could be tough talks ahead.

10:22.222 --> 10:28.061
GWEN IFILL: What, if any,
evidence does Poroshenko or NATO
or anyone have of the presence

10:28.061 --> 10:31.531
of Russian activity
along the border?

10:31.531 --> 10:34.167
DAVID HERSZENHORN: Well, there
is no question, amid all the
finger-pointing, there are
certain

10:34.167 --> 10:37.804
things that we know
in fact are true.

10:37.804 --> 10:43.643
There's a lot of heavy
equipment, tanks, weaponry that
is on the ground still in
Eastern Ukraine.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.013
Most of that appears, if not
all of it, to have come from
Russia across the border,

10:47.013 --> 10:52.118
which is unsecured. That border
is open. There are vehicles,
fighters able to pass

10:52.118 --> 10:56.789
back and forth, whether they're
volunteers, as Russia has
insisted, or regular forces

10:56.789 --> 11:01.928
of the Russian Federation, as
Mr. Poroshenko is suggesting.

11:01.928 --> 11:06.399
So we have that evidence. We
also have the international
monitors from the Organization

11:06.399 --> 11:10.236
for Security and Cooperation in
Europe pointing out the other
day that they'd actually
encountered

11:10.236 --> 11:14.307
some fighters in Russian
uniform. They have not said
that before, where they actually

11:14.307 --> 11:18.344
see the insignias of
the Russian military.

11:18.344 --> 11:23.950
At the same time, Ukraine has
captured two soldiers, fighters
that it said were regular

11:23.950 --> 11:28.888
duty active Russian military
personnel. They have said the
same thing. Of course, they're

11:28.888 --> 11:33.326
in captivity. They're being
held in a military hospital in
Kiev, the hospital, and so there

11:33.326 --> 11:37.931
is increasing evidence that in
fact Russia's intervention in
Ukraine continues.

11:37.931 --> 11:42.235
GWEN IFILL: So does that mean
that the cease-fire that was so
painstakingly hammered out is

11:42.235 --> 11:45.572
basically no longer worth
the paper it's printed on?

11:45.572 --> 11:51.177
DAVID HERSZENHORN: Well, the
cease-fire has been precarious
all along.

11:51.177 --> 11:55.915
What we have seen now is that
certainly Ukraine will be
pressuring its allies, the
United

11:55.915 --> 11:59.385
States and Europe, to make sure
that there is no letup in
economic sanctions against

11:59.385 --> 12:03.323
Russia. There is obviously
fatigue in the West. Some of
the European countries are

12:03.323 --> 12:07.694
suffering quite a great deal
themselves from countersanctions
that Russia has imposed.

12:07.694 --> 12:11.130
So I think we will see again
quite a bit of tension as we
move toward this question

12:11.130 --> 12:14.434
in Brussels of whether to
renew sanctions or not.

12:14.434 --> 12:18.037
GWEN IFILL: So, no matter how
you look at it, whether the
sanctions are working or not,

12:18.037 --> 12:22.075
whether Russia is there or not,
it sounds like there is another
spiral under way.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.877
DAVID HERSZENHORN: There's no
question there's another spiral
under way.

12:24.877 --> 12:29.983
And what the West is grappling
with is really a lack of will on
both sides to implement

12:29.983 --> 12:34.354
that cease-fire accord that was
signed in February. For each
side, it seems that the

12:34.354 --> 12:37.991
status quo is preferable to
moving forward with the really
tough political decisions

12:37.991 --> 12:40.326
that need to be made.

12:40.326 --> 12:45.231
One of the things Mr. Poroshenko
has been pushing for is a
decentralization process

12:45.231 --> 12:50.436
in Ukraine, which would give
more power to mayors,
essentially making governors and
officials

12:50.436 --> 12:55.174
at the regional level sort of an
intermediary between the federal
government and local government.

12:55.174 --> 12:59.345
Of course, in Eastern Ukraine,
what the separatists,
pro-Russian side, and Russia

12:59.345 --> 13:03.983
would like to see, are very
strong governors, perhaps even
presidents of the autonomous

13:03.983 --> 13:08.721
regions of Donetsk and Luhansk,
who are potentially more loyal
to Moscow than they are to Kiev.

13:08.721 --> 13:12.692
So there are very different
views of what the future
politically ought to look like

13:12.692 --> 13:15.561
in Ukraine. And pushing off
those tough questions seems to
be what a lot of these

13:15.561 --> 13:17.930
new hostilities are about.

13:17.930 --> 13:21.334
GWEN IFILL: David Herszenhorn,
reporting from Moscow for The
New York Times tonight,

13:21.334 --> 13:24.103
thank you.

13:24.103 --> 13:30.476
DAVID HERSZENHORN: Thank you.

13:30.476 --> 13:39.152
JUDY WOODRUFF: The 2016 race
for president reached a clear
critical mass, with four more

13:39.152 --> 13:44.157
candidates announcing this week.
The first of those came Monday
in a small town in South

13:44.157 --> 13:49.128
Carolina from the state's
senior senator, Lindsey Graham.

13:49.128 --> 13:54.400
As part of our series of
interviews with presidential
candidates, he joins me now from
New York.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.569
Senator Graham, thank
you for being with us.

13:56.569 --> 13:57.203
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC),
Presidential Candidate: Thank
you.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.571
You're going to be interviewing
people all year, it looks like.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.473
(LAUGHTER)

14:00.473 --> 14:05.311
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Senator, in
your announcement speech this
week, you talked about wanting

14:05.311 --> 14:11.150
to be the president to protect
America. You talked about
serious threats, about the world

14:11.150 --> 14:16.522
exploding in terror and
violence. And you said there
are forces trying to kill us.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.926
Just how vulnerable and weak
do you believe America is?

14:19.926 --> 14:22.328
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think,
the stronger they get over
there, the more exposed we are

14:22.328 --> 14:24.230
here.

14:24.230 --> 14:30.002
There's more terrorist
organizations with safe havens,
weapons capability, men and
money

14:30.002 --> 14:36.042
to attack us since 9/11. I'm
very worried. We need to make
them poor, small and on

14:36.042 --> 14:39.779
the run, because they're large,
rich and entrenched. And if we
don't up our game against these

14:39.779 --> 14:42.515
groups, we're going
to get hit hard here.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.952
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, you have
talked about being prepared to
send troops, American troops

14:45.952 --> 14:47.120
to Iraq.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.187
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM:
Yes. Absolutely.

14:48.187 --> 14:50.389
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why is
that the right answer?

14:50.389 --> 14:52.925
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, we
need lines of defenses over
there so they can't come

14:52.925 --> 14:55.828
here.

14:55.828 --> 15:02.034
The ISIL safe havens in Ramadi
and Mosul and in Syria present a
threat to us. I think

15:02.034 --> 15:06.038
foreign fighters flowing in to
join the ranks of ISIL with
Western passports, it's just

15:06.038 --> 15:10.476
a matter of time before somebody
penetrates our network and hits
us here.

15:10.476 --> 15:15.314
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Senator, as
you know, you're not the only
candidate talking tough,

15:15.314 --> 15:20.186
in effect, about ISIS. A number
of the other Republicans are
saying President Obama hasn't

15:20.186 --> 15:21.020
done enough.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.222
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.

15:23.222 --> 15:27.960
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marco Rubio, Jeb
Bush, Rick Perry today. Rick
Santorum is agreeing with

15:27.960 --> 15:28.461
you, sends troops.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.296
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes. Yes.

15:30.296 --> 15:34.267
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why wouldn't one
of them be a more capable leader
than you would be?

15:34.267 --> 15:37.537
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well,
they're all fine people, but, at
the end of the day, I have

15:37.537 --> 15:41.474
been to Iraq and Afghanistan as
a reservist and as a United
States senator over 30 times.

15:41.474 --> 15:45.678
I have been in the Air
Force for 33 years.

15:45.678 --> 15:50.950
I would put my credentials up
against anyone in terms of
understanding the region, the

15:50.950 --> 15:55.121
players. I know almost
everybody over there, and, most
importantly, they know me. So

15:55.121 --> 15:58.524
I have learned the hard way. I
have spent a lot of time on the
ground. I have made

15:58.524 --> 16:03.496
my fair share of mistakes.
Disbanding the Iraqi army after
the invasion of Iraq in 2003,

16:03.496 --> 16:07.867
clearly, in hindsight,
was a mistake.

16:07.867 --> 16:12.505
When Bush got it wrong, Senator
McCain and myself spoke up. At
the end of the day,

16:12.505 --> 16:17.310
I think I understand the dynamic
that we face. And I'm best
prepared to be commander in

16:17.310 --> 16:21.948
chief on day one, with all due
respect to my other colleagues,
including Hillary Clinton.

16:21.948 --> 16:25.751
JUDY WOODRUFF: But how would
you persuade the American people
it's the right thing to

16:25.751 --> 16:32.158
do, after fighting two wars,
Iraq, Afghanistan, after the
fact that Defense Secretary
Ashton

16:32.158 --> 16:36.796
Carter has said the Iraqi troops
themselves have not been willing
to fight; neighboring

16:36.796 --> 16:40.066
countries are not sending
troops in there?

16:40.066 --> 16:43.369
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I
think the American people pretty
well understand that radical

16:43.369 --> 16:48.541
Islam has an agenda that
includes us. They want to do
three things, purify their
religion

16:48.541 --> 16:51.744
-- and they're killing every
Muslim they get their hands on
that doesn't agree with them

16:51.744 --> 16:55.281
-- destroy the Christian faith
-- they're doing a pretty good
job of that -- and destroy

16:55.281 --> 16:58.384
the state of Israel and
eventually come after us.

16:58.384 --> 17:03.356
I think most Americans
understand that radical Islam
can't be compromised with or
appeased.

17:03.356 --> 17:08.361
And the only way we can be safe
is to form partnerships over
there that will protect

17:08.361 --> 17:12.231
us over here. And we left Iraq
too soon. And if we don't leave
at least 10,000 troops

17:12.231 --> 17:15.902
behind in Afghanistan,
then it will fall apart.

17:15.902 --> 17:20.406
So, my belief is that a line of
defense over there is necessary
to protect us here.

17:20.406 --> 17:23.709
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn you
to something else, Senator. You
have spoken yourself

17:23.709 --> 17:26.646
-- you came from a modest
background. Both of your
parents died when you were still
in

17:26.646 --> 17:30.216
college. You raised
your younger sister.

17:30.216 --> 17:34.587
She gives you credit for being
her big brother and her father
and her mother at the same

17:34.587 --> 17:36.522
time. How did that
experience shape you?

17:36.522 --> 17:38.624
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes,
it shaped me a lot.

17:38.624 --> 17:44.363
I mean, one day, everything is
great. The next day, my life is
turned upside down. Most

17:44.363 --> 17:48.834
people, Judy, are one car wreck
away from needing somebody's
help. So, I don't take

17:48.834 --> 17:53.706
anything for granted much
anymore. Everything was fine.
My mom got diagnosed with
Hodgkin's

17:53.706 --> 17:57.977
disease. Six months later, she
passes. The medical bills wiped
us out.

17:57.977 --> 18:03.449
Fifteen months after that, my
dad dies. I'm 22. My sister is
13. Our life is turned

18:03.449 --> 18:07.853
upside down. An aunt and uncle
helped me raise my sister. They
never made over $25,000

18:07.853 --> 18:09.822
in their life.

18:09.822 --> 18:15.161
If it weren't for Social
Security survivor benefits
coming into my family, to my
sister

18:15.161 --> 18:19.632
as a minor, we'd have had a hard
time paying the bills. Student
loans helped my sister

18:19.632 --> 18:24.403
go to college. So, I would do
almost anything to save Social
Security. I'm 59 years old.

18:24.403 --> 18:28.207
I'm not married. I don't have
any kids, and I'm really doing
really well financially.

18:28.207 --> 18:32.578
If I need to give up some
benefits, change my COLA, I
would to save Social Security.

18:32.578 --> 18:37.683
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of that, you know, give us some
specifics on that. How

18:37.683 --> 18:40.186
high would you raise the
retirement age? You have talked
about younger workers working

18:40.186 --> 18:40.853
longer.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.488
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.

18:42.488 --> 18:46.359
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have talked
about raising Social Security
premiums, asking people to

18:46.359 --> 18:49.428
take a cut. How big a cut?

18:49.428 --> 18:53.499
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, what
I would do is I would take
Simpson-Bowles out and

18:53.499 --> 18:58.871
dust it off, adjust the age of
retirement based on the
actuarial needs of the country.

18:58.871 --> 19:04.677
It goes to 67. Ronald Reagan
went from -- and Tip O'Neill
went from 65 to 67. We need

19:04.677 --> 19:10.182
to adjust it again because we're
living so much longer. Social
Security is a system

19:10.182 --> 19:14.887
that keeps half of today's
seniors out of poverty. And
people on my income level are

19:14.887 --> 19:18.057
going to have to give up some of
their benefits to protect the
system, because it's running

19:18.057 --> 19:20.226
out of money.

19:20.226 --> 19:25.531
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two other
things, Senator. You have taken
positions on climate change,

19:25.531 --> 19:30.536
on immigration that many
Republicans disagree with. You
have opponents today who are
talking

19:30.536 --> 19:34.640
about toughening their
position on immigration.

19:34.640 --> 19:40.613
At the same time, you have long
advocated a legal path to
citizenship for undocumented

19:40.613 --> 19:44.750
immigrants. Are your opponents
making a mistake by toughening
their position?

19:44.750 --> 19:47.386
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM:
Absolutely.

19:47.386 --> 19:52.358
In my view, you have got to
secure your border or you will
never fix this problem. But

19:52.358 --> 19:57.430
you're not going to just fix the
problem by building a wall. The
reason we have 11 million

19:57.430 --> 20:02.268
illegal immigrants is they come
here to get jobs. They come
from poor and corrupt countries,

20:02.268 --> 20:05.071
and it's an economic problem.
You have got to increase legal
immigration, not restrict

20:05.071 --> 20:07.139
it.

20:07.139 --> 20:11.877
Eighty million baby boomers are
going to die out in the next 20,
30 or 40 years. And

20:11.877 --> 20:16.615
who is going to replace us in
the work force? We're a
declining population. We're
down

20:16.615 --> 20:20.352
to two workers for every retiree
in the next 20 years. We're
going to need a viable legal

20:20.352 --> 20:22.888
immigration system.

20:22.888 --> 20:28.127
So those people who want to
restrict legal immigration are
not looking at the demographic.

20:28.127 --> 20:31.931
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally,
Senator, if you were elected
president, you would be first

20:31.931 --> 20:34.400
bachelor to take office since
Grover Cleveland in 1885.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.468
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM:
Yes, that's right.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.502
(LAUGHTER)

20:36.502 --> 20:39.238
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is
that a disadvantage?

20:39.238 --> 20:42.675
And I ask because the role of
the spouse of the president has
become a very full role.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.677
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.646
JUDY WOODRUFF: Serious issues,
the first ladies have taken on,
Michelle Obama, Laura

20:47.646 --> 20:49.882
Bush, Nancy Reagan.

20:49.882 --> 20:54.420
Would you need someone to fill
that role, were you to be
elected?

20:54.420 --> 20:58.090
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I
think we will find a way to
accommodate that particular

20:58.090 --> 21:01.694
need. But I think
America can handle this.

21:01.694 --> 21:06.432
Here's the test for me: What
can I do for your family? What
can I do to help you and

21:06.432 --> 21:12.171
your kids, if you have children?
What can I do to keep America
safe and to keep us prosperous

21:12.171 --> 21:16.542
and secure at home and deal with
the retirement of the baby
boomers?

21:16.542 --> 21:21.380
I have got no problems. The
people of South Carolina have
elected me for the last 20
years.

21:21.380 --> 21:26.552
And I'm proud. I do have
family. I'm not married. I
don't have kids, but I do

21:26.552 --> 21:30.122
understand family, and I
understand how precious family
is. So I think America can
handle

21:30.122 --> 21:32.224
this. But we will see.

21:32.224 --> 21:38.130
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Lindsey
Graham, we thank you very much
for talking with us.

21:38.130 --> 21:45.271
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you.

21:45.271 --> 21:52.478
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we
launch a series of reports on
the Ebola crisis.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.948
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien traveled to West Africa
to examine how the deadly virus

21:55.948 --> 21:58.684
took hold.

21:58.684 --> 22:02.087
DR. LINA MOSES, Tulane
University Viral Hemorrhagic
Fever Program: Kenema became
the epicenter

22:02.087 --> 22:05.424
of the outbreak in July.

22:05.424 --> 22:10.963
MILES O'BRIEN: Lina Moses is
back at it, on the trail of a
killer virus near Kenema,

22:10.963 --> 22:15.467
Sierra Leone. She is still
haunted by memories of the worst
days of the Ebola epidemic last

22:15.467 --> 22:17.303
year.

22:17.303 --> 22:20.105
DR. LINA MOSES: We didn't go
searching for Ebola. Ebola came
to us. It came with

22:20.105 --> 22:21.907
a vengeance.

22:21.907 --> 22:26.445
MILES O'BRIEN: She took us to
the remote villages of Kpalu.

22:26.445 --> 22:29.915
DR. LINA MOSES: This is the
first time we have trapped for a
while since the Ebola outbreak

22:29.915 --> 22:32.251
started.

22:32.251 --> 22:38.457
MILES O'BRIEN: An
epidemiologist and disease
ecologist with Tulane
University's Viral Hemorrhagic

22:38.457 --> 22:46.031
Fever Program, Lina leads a team
focused primarily on a virus
with Ebola-like symptoms, Lassa

22:46.031 --> 22:54.039
fever. Lassa and Ebola are
so-called zoonotic diseases
caused by viruses, parasites or
bacteria

22:54.039 --> 22:58.244
that are normally spread among
animals, but occasionally spill
over to humans, often causing

22:58.244 --> 23:02.081
severe disease.

23:02.081 --> 23:06.719
Understanding how these viruses
make the jump into humans is at
the core of her research.

23:06.719 --> 23:11.890
DR. LINA MOSES: Any time you're
looking at zoonotic disease, you
have to start looking

23:11.890 --> 23:16.128
at the animal that carries it,
the animal that maintains it in
nature, and that's the

23:16.128 --> 23:18.931
only way you can
start to control it.

23:18.931 --> 23:24.536
MILES O'BRIEN: We are hoping to
trap the Lassa virus inside its
animal host, or reservoir,

23:24.536 --> 23:27.673
a common African rat.

23:27.673 --> 23:32.011
DR. LINA MOSES: We estimate
that 80 percent of all Lassa
fever cases come directly from

23:32.011 --> 23:35.347
rodent to human. So, really,
what we're trying to do is break
that rodent-to-human

23:35.347 --> 23:38.017
relationship.

23:38.017 --> 23:44.857
MILES O'BRIEN: Lina's team
baits two dozen traps with
peanut butter, oats, palm oil
and

23:44.857 --> 23:51.297
dried fish, and leaves them
overnight. And while we all
sleep, our night-vision camera

23:51.297 --> 23:57.770
catches a curious rat known as
Mastomys natalensis, the
reservoir species for Lassa
fever. This

23:57.770 --> 24:01.640
one didn't take the bait.

24:01.640 --> 24:07.680
But another one does, as we
discover on our return the next
morning. James Koninga quickly

24:07.680 --> 24:11.483
suits up for a field necropsy.

24:11.483 --> 24:17.289
He works inside a roped-off
area, a safe distance from the
center of the village. He is a

24:17.289 --> 24:25.030
seasoned a hand at this
dangerous task. There is good
reason for the caution. Ebola
may

24:25.030 --> 24:31.904
get all the media attention, but
Lassa fever is nearly as deadly,
in this part of Sierra

24:31.904 --> 24:35.307
Leone, a fatality rate
of nearly 70 percent.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.743
JAMES KONINGA, Lassa Fever
Program, Kenema Government
Hospital: It's the most
dangerous

24:37.743 --> 24:40.012
part of it. I have
to be very careful.

24:40.012 --> 24:44.950
MILES O'BRIEN: What is the risk
here if the rat has the Lassa
fever virus? How dangerous

24:44.950 --> 24:47.653
or potentially dangerous is it?

24:47.653 --> 24:52.691
DR. LINA MOSES: Well, it's
similar to -- I liken it to
health care workers in an Ebola

24:52.691 --> 24:59.131
treatment center. They get
urinated on. They could get bit
if the rodent is not

24:59.131 --> 25:02.468
properly anesthetized. So, the
risks of actually getting --
getting infected from

25:02.468 --> 25:05.003
are Lassa just as high.

25:05.003 --> 25:09.875
MILES O'BRIEN: Koninga has been
doing this since the 1970s. For
the past 20 years,

25:09.875 --> 25:14.146
he has helped in the frustrating
hunt for the Ebola virus as
well.

25:14.146 --> 25:20.719
JAMES KONINGA: We collected up
to 3,000 animals, birds,
rodents, bats, you name them,

25:20.719 --> 25:23.989
even domesticated animals.

25:23.989 --> 25:29.862
MILES O'BRIEN: They even looked
at mosquitoes and bedbugs. All
that, and there's never

25:29.862 --> 25:34.800
been a smoking gun, never
any sign of the live virus.

25:34.800 --> 25:41.874
But there is a prime suspect:
fruit bats. That's because
researchers found Ebola
antibodies

25:41.874 --> 25:47.613
in several bat species, meaning
they must have been infected
with the virus or some

25:47.613 --> 25:52.351
version of the virus. Fruit
bats also are host to Marburg
virus, in the same family

25:52.351 --> 25:57.756
as Ebola. The first person
known to die of Ebola in this
epidemic, the so-called index

25:57.756 --> 26:02.327
case, in December 2013, was a
young Guinean boy who played
beneath this tree, which was

26:02.327 --> 26:05.030
infested with bats.

26:05.030 --> 26:09.968
It has since burned, making it
impossible to know for sure if
this was where and how

26:09.968 --> 26:15.607
he got sick. Researchers know
much less about Ebola than Lassa
fever.

26:15.607 --> 26:21.180
DR. LINA MOSES: You get hot
spots. So you will get villages
that have a lot of cases

26:21.180 --> 26:25.651
for maybe one or two years,
and then they quiet down.

26:25.651 --> 26:28.353
MILES O'BRIEN: If you ever saw
Ebola in a rat here, that would
be significant, yes.

26:28.353 --> 26:31.156
DR. LINA MOSES: I would be
nervous, yes, definitely
nervous.

26:31.156 --> 26:35.527
MILES O'BRIEN: Historically,
Ebola has been a cold case
investigation for
epidemiologists.

26:35.527 --> 26:41.099
It appeared and vanished,
sometimes for years, all in very
remote places, until this

26:41.099 --> 26:43.469
outbreak.

26:43.469 --> 26:50.309
This time, better roads and
deeper human encroachment into
the bush sent Ebola on a
dangerous journey,

26:50.309 --> 26:57.316
into teeming places dense with
potential victims. This was the
first time Ebola came to cities,

26:57.316 --> 27:03.088
and that was a big part of the
problem. This is the Kroo Bay
slum in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

27:03.088 --> 27:06.892
There's no electricity, no
running water, and you really
don't have to use your
imagination

27:06.892 --> 27:13.065
to understand that Ebola here
could quickly spread out of
control.

27:13.065 --> 27:16.702
But is it simply demographics
that made the outbreak so
deadly? Or is it biology as

27:16.702 --> 27:18.604
well?

27:18.604 --> 27:21.073
DR. PARDIS SABETI, Harvard
University: There are likely
some versions of Ebola that
don't

27:21.073 --> 27:24.810
make you sick at all. There are
some versions that probably
don't infect humans at all.

27:24.810 --> 27:28.747
And there are some that may
infect humans, but not spread
the way this does.

27:28.747 --> 27:33.151
MILES O'BRIEN: Computational
genomicist Pardis Sabeti is a
Harvard professor in the

27:33.151 --> 27:39.224
vanguard of efforts to better
understand Ebola by studying its
genetic characteristics.

27:39.224 --> 27:42.227
She led the study that
made the genetic link

27:42.227 --> 27:48.066
between the index case to the
thousands that followed, all
from human-to-human contact.

27:48.066 --> 27:53.872
It's a family tree of virus
cousins, but with 99 distinct
Ebola genomes, hundreds of

27:53.872 --> 27:56.241
mutations, making
them different.

27:56.241 --> 28:00.078
DR. PARDIS SABETI: They are
replicating through each
transmission, every eight-day

28:00.078 --> 28:03.715
cycle, as a new set of viruses
that are going to be able to
released to another individual.

28:03.715 --> 28:09.154
And so we are just talking
about a much faster time period
in which evolution can

28:09.154 --> 28:13.959
happen. It's changing, not just
between individuals, but within
individuals.

28:13.959 --> 28:18.030
It starts replicating and it's
making lots of copies of itself
and, every once in a while,

28:18.030 --> 28:22.034
will make a mistake and these
mutations emerge. And so we do
have to pay attention, because

28:22.034 --> 28:25.404
we are not always dealing with a
single entity. We are dealing
with a changing entity.

28:25.404 --> 28:30.375
MILES O'BRIEN: Back in Sierra
Leone, Lina Moses is wondering
what it will look like

28:30.375 --> 28:37.783
next time. While the epidemic
was unprecedented, Ebola, as it
turns out, wasn't a new visitor

28:37.783 --> 28:42.854
to West Africa. Researchers
recently took a fresh look at
old blood samples from patients

28:42.854 --> 28:48.226
here with previously unknown
diseases, and they found Ebola
antibodies.

28:48.226 --> 28:52.598
DR. LINA MOSES: So, it looks
like this is not the first
introduction of Ebola into
Sierra

28:52.598 --> 28:56.401
Leone and into this region, and
it's not going to be the last.

28:56.401 --> 29:00.973
MILES O'BRIEN: At the
government hospital where Lina
is based, they are getting ready

29:00.973 --> 29:06.378
for the next time, building a
U.S. Pentagon funded-research
facility and isolation ward.

29:06.378 --> 29:10.983
Beside it is the grave of one
of Sierra Leone's leading
epidemiologists, who died

29:10.983 --> 29:14.453
here last year treating
Ebola patients.

29:14.453 --> 29:19.958
DR. LINA MOSES: It was pretty
awful, actually. There were --
people who really scared.

29:19.958 --> 29:25.130
What they call IPC, infection
prevention and control, wasn't
in place to any measure

29:25.130 --> 29:28.100
that would protect people, and
a lot of people got sick.

29:28.100 --> 29:36.608
MILES O'BRIEN: Friends?
How many did you lose?

29:36.608 --> 29:46.585
DR. LINA MOSES: The people that
I worked with for several years,
we lost nine of our

29:46.585 --> 29:53.358
staff, most of them very good
and personal friends of mine.
So...

29:53.358 --> 30:01.299
MILES O'BRIEN: In Freetown, the
main cemetery is now filled, too
many fresh graves. The

30:01.299 --> 30:08.340
crisis may have waned, but the
virus lives on, a threat that
can't be easily buried.

30:08.340 --> 30:13.178
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Freetown, Sierra
Leone.

30:13.178 --> 30:17.749
GWEN IFILL: Tune in tomorrow
night, as Miles explores how
health workers are trying to

30:17.749 --> 30:23.221
develop a rapid test for Ebola.

30:23.221 --> 30:34.800
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, we take a
look at a big sports weekend
coming up, with several

30:34.800 --> 30:38.937
championship playoffs and a
high-stakes horse race in the
offing.

30:38.937 --> 30:45.410
And, as William Brangham tells
us, in some places, it's already
begun.

30:45.410 --> 30:49.915
For a closer look at this
smorgasbord of contests, I am
joined by two longtime sports
writers.

30:49.915 --> 30:53.819
Kevin Blackistone is a
professor of sports journalism
at the University of Maryland,

30:53.819 --> 30:57.889
as well as a panelist on ESPN.
And Mike Pesca is host of
Slate's daily podcast "The

30:57.889 --> 31:00.158
Gist" and a contributor to NPR.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.827
Gentlemen, welcome.
Welcome. Join us.

31:01.827 --> 31:04.763
KEVIN BLACKISTONE, University
of Maryland: Thank you.

31:04.763 --> 31:08.934
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Kevin, let's
talk about the NBA first. These
are two long-suffering

31:08.934 --> 31:11.970
teams, two long-suffering towns.
LeBron James' greatness, it's a
given.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.905
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Right.

31:13.905 --> 31:18.043
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But can he
carry his team past Golden
State?

31:18.043 --> 31:21.179
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Well, if he
does, he certainly will have
etched his name in the

31:21.179 --> 31:27.052
pantheon of NBA greats, because
this is the most likely -- most
-- the least likely team

31:27.052 --> 31:32.057
that he's been with that he
could take to a championship.

31:32.057 --> 31:37.996
He was brought there or went
back there, and he was
celebrated by the city. The
team

31:37.996 --> 31:44.236
imported Kevin Love, another
superstar player, to play
alongside him. He's hurt. The

31:44.236 --> 31:50.408
other superstar player in
Cleveland, Kyrie Irving, has
been injured for quite some time

31:50.408 --> 31:53.912
and is going to be a little
bit labored in this series.

31:53.912 --> 31:58.083
And so if he can deliver a
championship to Cleveland, he
will literally have done so

31:58.083 --> 32:01.086
carrying this franchise
on his back.

32:01.086 --> 32:04.990
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mike Pesca,
what do you think about that?
Is this an issue of one

32:04.990 --> 32:07.993
man having to beat 12 men?

32:07.993 --> 32:10.462
MIKE PESCA, National Public
Radio: Well, I would say -- and
I bet Kevin agrees -- that

32:10.462 --> 32:13.698
LeBron is already a
pantheon etcher.

32:13.698 --> 32:17.269
But it's just such a big task,
because we haven't even
mentioned any of the Golden
State

32:17.269 --> 32:22.908
Warriors. And Steph Curry is
the reigning MVP, a deserved
MVP. I'm not going to say

32:22.908 --> 32:26.444
that LeBron is not the best
player in the NBA, but Steph had
a great year, scoring 29

32:26.444 --> 32:28.947
points a game in the playoffs.

32:28.947 --> 32:34.286
And it's every player after him
on the Golden State roster that
is better than their equal

32:34.286 --> 32:40.025
number on the Cleveland roster.
So, I really do think Golden
State not only has a tremendous

32:40.025 --> 32:44.229
edge, plays great defense, and
is a big favorite in Las Vegas,
and the guys who do the advanced

32:44.229 --> 32:47.666
stats say they're an even bigger
favorite than the bettors would
have you believe. It's

32:47.666 --> 32:50.769
a huge task for LeBron.
That's why we watch.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.238
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's right.

32:53.238 --> 32:57.075
All right, let's talk about the
Belmont Stakes. American
Pharoah, this is a huge
potential

32:57.075 --> 32:58.310
accomplishment for this horse.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.611
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Sure.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.414
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's been 40
years since a horse has won the
Triple Crown. Why is

33:02.414 --> 33:05.350
this such a tough
thing to crack?

33:05.350 --> 33:09.221
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Well,
because it's a hard race. You
have to win two races to

33:09.221 --> 33:14.492
get there, and then, in this
final weekend, you have to run,
the horse does, a
mile-and-a-half.

33:14.492 --> 33:18.196
And it's a grueling
mile-and-a-half.

33:18.196 --> 33:22.968
And I just think it's the weight
of history. I have been to
these things several times,

33:22.968 --> 33:29.507
from Smarty Jones and, was it
Funny Cide, and the anticipation
is great. Everybody

33:29.507 --> 33:35.146
in the world is watching. And
it's almost like Lucy and
Charlie Brown and the football.

33:35.146 --> 33:40.252
You know, we get suckered into
this thing, and then once again
it just doesn't happen.

33:40.252 --> 33:45.023
But it's a great anticipatory
sporting event, and that's why
people tune in. That's why

33:45.023 --> 33:52.197
usually about 2.5 times more
people tune in to watch a Triple
Crown possibility than would

33:52.197 --> 33:54.532
watch the Belmont Stakes
if nothing was going on.

33:54.532 --> 33:56.401
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mike Pesca.

33:56.401 --> 33:58.803
MIKE PESCA: I would also add
that it might be -- well, I was
going to say, it might be

33:58.803 --> 34:00.772
a little bit more about Snoopy,
because these are animals,
right?

34:00.772 --> 34:02.474
(LAUGHTER)

34:02.474 --> 34:07.145
MIKE PESCA: And they're just
bred differently than they were
125 years ago, where horses

34:07.145 --> 34:11.549
were more robust. It's not a
knock against the modern horse.
The modern horse is like

34:11.549 --> 34:16.221
a Ferrari. It's like a
high-speed car, but the recovery
time is such that it is quite

34:16.221 --> 34:19.057
unlikely that any horse will
ever win the Triple Crown again,
I think.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.692
It's happened what, a dozen
times since Affirmed

34:20.692 --> 34:21.426
won it in '78.

34:21.426 --> 34:22.160
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Right.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.495
MIKE PESCA: And a dozen times,
we have been disappointed.

34:23.495 --> 34:26.498
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
OK. Let's move on.

34:26.498 --> 34:31.703
Saturday, we're going to see the
women's World Cup. This is
obviously a huge deal here

34:31.703 --> 34:36.942
in the U.S. But we can't
overlook the fact that there's
this controversy around FIFA.

34:36.942 --> 34:40.145
How much do you think the cloud
of that is going to tarnish this
tournament, or will

34:40.145 --> 34:42.180
it have no bearing?

34:42.180 --> 34:44.649
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: You know, I
don't think it will have any
bearing. I think American

34:44.649 --> 34:49.487
sports fans overlook scandal.
If look at the National Football
League and Deflategate,

34:49.487 --> 34:52.390
I don't think anybody
cared at the end.

34:52.390 --> 34:58.196
If you look at Major League
Baseball and the steroids era, I
don't think anybody cared

34:58.196 --> 35:04.469
in the end. The big debate is
among sportswriters, in terms of
what this will mean, and maybe

35:04.469 --> 35:09.774
some people within the industry,
but I don't think anybody is
going to conflate what has

35:09.774 --> 35:14.479
happened with FIFA's executive
leadership and the corruption
and what has happened with

35:14.479 --> 35:17.115
the women's game.

35:17.115 --> 35:21.219
I don't think Amy (sic) Wambach
is going to have to suffer any
of those slings and arrows.

35:21.219 --> 35:26.458
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mike Pesca,
the president of FIFA, Sepp
Blatter, despite his litany

35:26.458 --> 35:32.697
of sexist comments, really did
reign over a period of
incredible growth in women's
soccer.

35:32.697 --> 35:37.235
Is that a silver lining, do you
think, to his career, amidst all
this controversy?

35:37.235 --> 35:40.839
MIKE PESCA: Oh, I think, like a
lot of the accomplishments of
Sepp Blatter, it happened

35:40.839 --> 35:46.478
on his watch. Maybe it was a
correlation, but not causality.

35:46.478 --> 35:50.749
I think women's sports, Title IX
in America is what one of the
huge reasons that made

35:50.749 --> 35:54.386
soccer big. And, you know, he
up until a couple of years ago
was talking about having

35:54.386 --> 35:57.088
the women wear tighter shorts.

35:57.088 --> 36:00.191
And, you know, they're playing
this World Cup. I totally agree
with Kevin. This

36:00.191 --> 36:03.628
is not -- that nothing should be
taken away from the women, and I
don't think it will

36:03.628 --> 36:10.669
be, but FIFA is making them play
on artificial turf. And this is
unfair. Unlike the NFL,

36:10.669 --> 36:14.606
where the problem is actually
with the league and concussions,
the sport of soccer is
brilliant.

36:14.606 --> 36:18.209
The sport of soccer is pristine.

36:18.209 --> 36:22.781
It's just these crooks -- I will
say it at the top -- even as
regards the women's game,

36:22.781 --> 36:25.950
that we should have a lot of
horrible feelings about. We
should be really concerned about

36:25.950 --> 36:27.685
that.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.421
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's not
forget the Stanley Cup is, of
course, going on.

36:29.421 --> 36:30.288
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Right.

36:30.288 --> 36:33.558
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Some very
enjoyable hockey going on there.

36:33.558 --> 36:37.362
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: And it is.
I watched last night's game.
And everything turned

36:37.362 --> 36:43.768
in less than two minutes at the
end. The Lightning are a fun
team to watch, assemble

36:43.768 --> 36:50.775
a lot of speed, a lot of
up-tempo hockey, if you can
actually have that. And the
Blackhawks

36:50.775 --> 36:55.346
are an old-school type of
team. They're grinders.

36:55.346 --> 37:00.985
And last night, they ground out
an improbable win. But if there
is one reason to turn

37:00.985 --> 37:07.325
into this NHL Stanley Cup
Finals, it's to watch the
skaters with the Tampa Bay
Lightning.

37:07.325 --> 37:12.397
They are really a lot of fun to
watch. We mentioned earlier
Steph Curry. Mike did.

37:12.397 --> 37:18.403
Well, Tyler Johnson is kind of
a Steph Curry in the NHL,
undersized, which is why people

37:18.403 --> 37:21.439
passed on him in the draft,
always doubted him. And he's
turned into a fabulous, exciting

37:21.439 --> 37:23.942
scorer in the league.

37:23.942 --> 37:28.746
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mike Pesca,
Chicago, this is -- they're in
their third Cup in six years.

37:28.746 --> 37:31.549
And this is during the salary
cap era in hockey. This is a
pretty big accomplishment.

37:31.549 --> 37:34.219
MIKE PESCA: It is.

37:34.219 --> 37:40.425
And they have done it -- the NHL
might never have another
dynasty, because the salary cap

37:40.425 --> 37:45.230
era makes it so hard to resign
stars. They do give teams a
little bit of leeway resigning

37:45.230 --> 37:49.801
their own stars, but this core
of players has been around and
contributing. They do

37:49.801 --> 37:54.539
have some young players, but if
you want to talk about Toews --
their goalie, Corey Crawford,

37:54.539 --> 37:58.176
he's -- he spans not
all the Stanley Cups.

37:58.176 --> 38:03.448
But it's an example, if you get
to know a team, that team could
really win the heart

38:03.448 --> 38:07.352
of a city. And I think every so
often, Tampa Bay looks and says,
hey, we got a hockey team,

38:07.352 --> 38:09.821
whereas Chicago lives and
dies with these Blackhawks.

38:09.821 --> 38:12.690
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's right.

38:12.690 --> 38:15.760
OK. Kevin Blackistone, Mike
Pesca, thank you both very much
for joining us.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.796
KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Thank you.

38:18.796 --> 38:23.034
MIKE PESCA: You're welcome.

38:23.034 --> 38:30.542
GWEN IFILL: We will be back
with our weekly feature Making
Sense. Paul Solman looks

38:30.542 --> 38:33.011
at an app that brings butler
service to the masses. It's
something you won't want to

38:33.011 --> 38:34.846
miss.

38:34.846 --> 38:39.517
But, first, it's pledge week on
PBS. This break allows your
public television station

38:39.517 --> 38:43.221
to ask for your support. And
that support helps keep programs
like ours on the air.

38:43.221 --> 38:45.690
(BREAK)

38:45.690 --> 38:53.064
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
an on-demand assistant for those
with too much to do and

38:53.064 --> 38:55.033
too little time.

38:55.033 --> 38:58.203
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman has the story. It's
part of our ongoing reporting

38:58.203 --> 38:58.870
Making Sense, which airs every
Thursday on the "NewsHour."

38:58.870 --> 39:01.139
DR. EMMA STANTON, Hello Alfred
Client: As a single person
living on my own, the only

39:01.139 --> 39:04.175
reason I have so much stuff in
my fridge is because somebody
else has bothered to do the

39:04.175 --> 39:06.578
shopping for me.

39:06.578 --> 39:09.647
PAUL SOLMAN: When Dr. Emma
Stanton moved to Boston this
spring, work left little time

39:09.647 --> 39:12.550
for prepping her new apartment.

39:12.550 --> 39:17.722
DR. EMMA STANTON: It was
cleaned when I moved in, which
was about nine days ago.

39:17.722 --> 39:21.359
PAUL SOLMAN: Or choosing
a new coffee maker.

39:21.359 --> 39:25.230
DR. EMMA STANTON: I just asked
for particular recommendations,
and this was one of three

39:25.230 --> 39:26.497
they suggested.

39:26.497 --> 39:29.000
PAUL SOLMAN: Cleaning
her clothes.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.438
DR. EMMA STANTON: This is my
laundry. I just chuck it in
here. The Alfred comes

39:33.438 --> 39:36.341
and picks it up.

39:36.341 --> 39:40.812
PAUL SOLMAN: And who exactly is
Alfred? A new online service,
the company's name,

39:40.812 --> 39:43.147
Hello Alfred, inspired by
Batman's ultimate butler.

39:43.147 --> 39:46.985
MICHAEL CAINE, Actor: A problem
with the graphite, sir.

39:46.985 --> 39:50.555
PAUL SOLMAN: Who caters to
needs you didn't even know you
had.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.790
MICHAEL CAINE: May I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your
head?

39:52.790 --> 39:57.128
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, if you really
want to outsource your chores
these days, there are

39:57.128 --> 40:00.498
apps galore, among them
Instacart for shopping, Homejoy
for cleaning. But Stanton's
Alfred

40:00.498 --> 40:02.967
does it all.

40:02.967 --> 40:09.674
DR. EMMA STANTON: Hello Alfred
were able to be here last week,
when I had my Wi-Fi

40:09.674 --> 40:13.611
installed in my new apartment.
Hello Alfred were able to be
here when a storage company

40:13.611 --> 40:18.049
came to pick up a box that I
needed to go to storage, and
deal with some of the other

40:18.049 --> 40:20.919
hassles that happen
when you move house.

40:20.919 --> 40:25.523
PAUL SOLMAN: Hello Alfred was
conceived by Marcela Sapone and
Jess Beck, who both

40:25.523 --> 40:37.535
pulled out of Harvard Business
School last year to scale up the
business of butlering.

40:33.631 --> 40:36.834
WOMAN: And the winner of the
2014 Disrupt San Francisco
Battlefield Competition is
Alfred.

40:36.834 --> 40:39.037
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

40:39.037 --> 40:41.939
PAUL SOLMAN: Sapone's case in
point in pitching Alfred at a
high-powered startup competition

40:41.939 --> 40:44.776
was harried, hypothetical Dan.

40:44.776 --> 40:50.615
MARCELA SAPONE, CEO, Hello
Alfred: The butler you never
had, for the very first time,
the

40:50.615 --> 40:56.421
luxury of personal service for
the rest of us. For $99 a
month, Dan can get his very

40:56.421 --> 40:59.991
own Alfred that visits once a
week, every week, on set days to
take care of his household

40:59.991 --> 41:01.759
chores.

41:01.759 --> 41:06.097
PAUL SOLMAN: Alfred was
suddenly on the app map. And
within months, Sapone and Beck

41:06.097 --> 41:09.434
had more than $12 million in
funding, for an idea they'd come
up with while working

41:09.434 --> 41:11.569
on Wall Street.

41:11.569 --> 41:14.539
MARCELA SAPONE: We were working
90-hour workweeks. I mean, you
barely saw the light

41:14.539 --> 41:19.577
of day. I wasn't doing a good
job of taking care of myself.

41:19.577 --> 41:23.481
PAUL SOLMAN: So far, Alfred is
taking care of clients who can
easily afford an extra

41:23.481 --> 41:29.420
$25 a week only in New York and
Boston. But Sapone already has
a waiting list and plans

41:29.420 --> 41:32.857
to expand wherever there are
dense clusters of customers.

41:32.857 --> 41:36.894
MARCELA SAPONE: I'm giving
people back time. Life is
actually becoming unmanageable.

41:36.894 --> 41:39.764
And the hours that we're
working are going up, and the
amount of complexity in our
lives

41:39.764 --> 41:42.500
is only going up.

41:42.500 --> 41:49.974
PAUL SOLMAN: So, a good deal
for clients, but what about the
Alfreds? Eeva Lee moved

41:49.974 --> 41:55.113
to New York from Finland last
summer. A psychologist, she now
works part-time, 25

41:55.113 --> 41:58.249
hours a week or more, as an
Alfred, perambulating Greenwich
Village with as much as 50
pounds

41:58.249 --> 42:00.418
in tow.

42:00.418 --> 42:04.889
EEVA LEE, Alfred Client Manager:
Sometimes, you have a lot to
carry on you. You can

42:04.889 --> 42:08.059
take it as an exercise, and
don't have to go to the gym
later.

42:08.059 --> 42:09.060
(LAUGHTER)

42:09.060 --> 42:12.029
PAUL SOLMAN: Especially
given the flights of stairs.

42:12.029 --> 42:16.868
EEVA LEE: Usual day, it's like
anywhere from 20 to 40,
depending on how many elevator

42:16.868 --> 42:22.740
buildings I have. I don't know
if my iPhone has a jinx on it,
but it claims to me that

42:22.740 --> 42:27.812
there's one day that I have done
80. But that sounds crazy, even
in this job.

42:27.812 --> 42:32.150
PAUL SOLMAN: Would you not
rather be practicing psychology
than doing what you're doing?

42:32.150 --> 42:36.087
EEVA LEE: Of course I would
like to do what I have the
education for. But I understand

42:36.087 --> 42:42.326
how important, wherever you work
in the world, it is to know the
culture and the people and

42:42.326 --> 42:46.697
the ways of working. And I'm
getting that education all the
time as I work. The other

42:46.697 --> 42:50.168
very nice thing is that
I sleep like a baby.

42:50.168 --> 42:53.171
PAUL SOLMAN: Unlike other
on-demand services, which rely
on low-paid contract workers,
CEO

42:53.171 --> 42:56.874
Sapone says Alfreds are
employees who earn $18 to $30 an
hour. But how do the economics

42:56.874 --> 42:59.877
work if clients
only pay $25 week?

42:59.877 --> 43:01.946
MARCELA SAPONE: You're
essentially sharing the cost of
a personal assistant. That
Alfred

43:01.946 --> 43:03.648
is serving multiple people.

43:03.648 --> 43:06.350
PAUL SOLMAN: How many clients
do you need in an area before
it's economically viable?

43:06.350 --> 43:08.786
MARCELA SAPONE: Anywhere
from four to seven.

43:08.786 --> 43:12.490
PAUL SOLMAN: Boston tech
entrepreneur Nick Relas (ph) got
off the Hello Alfred waiting

43:12.490 --> 43:22.300
list four months ago. A
favorite feature for him,
freshly pressed shirts from the
dry cleaners down the street.

43:22.300 --> 43:25.803
PAUL SOLMAN: So you
couldn't do this yourself?

43:25.803 --> 43:32.743
NICK RELAS, Hello Alfred Client:
That's what my mother asks me.
It's not about proximity.

43:32.743 --> 43:40.551
It's about what time it closes
every day. I don't leave work
until at least 9:00 or

43:40.551 --> 43:48.893
10:00, and I never have time
to get here before it closes.

43:48.893 --> 43:54.899
PAUL SOLMAN: So, Relas'
Alfred takes care of it.

43:54.899 --> 44:03.541
NICK RELAS: You can see
here, it closes at 7:00.

44:03.541 --> 44:14.385
PAUL SOLMAN: And before
wrapping up for the day, she --
real name Lauren -- leaves

44:14.385 --> 44:17.922
him a handwritten summary
of tasks completed.

44:17.922 --> 44:29.934
NICK RELAS: She cleaned up the
apartment a little today, took
out the garbage, fluffed

44:29.934 --> 44:37.475
the bed. Here's what I love
about Alfred. She noticed I was
out of garbage bags.

44:37.475 --> 44:38.910
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes?

44:38.910 --> 44:41.779
NICK RELAS: And she's going
to pick some up for me.

44:41.779 --> 44:45.283
PAUL SOLMAN: But wait a second.
Should we outsource everything?

44:45.283 --> 44:59.297
EVAN SELINGER, Rochester
Institute of Technology: How is
it that we have all become so
pinched, that

44:59.297 --> 45:07.371
we feel we can't do very
much for ourselves?

45:07.371 --> 45:22.320
PAUL SOLMAN: Evan Selinger
teaches philosophy at the
Rochester Institute of
Technology,

45:22.320 --> 45:27.592
is skeptical of outsourcing
apps like Hello Alfred.

45:27.592 --> 45:33.364
EVAN SELINGER: Instead of
actually giving us our time
back, they just open up more
time

45:33.364 --> 45:56.754
for us to be imprisoned in other
ways, often for us to work
longer hours. What kind of

45:56.754 --> 46:04.095
character do we develop, the
more that we outsource? How
does outsourcing change our

46:04.095 --> 46:07.765
interactions with
more and more people?

46:07.765 --> 46:14.338
PAUL SOLMAN: But, on the other
hand, Alfred could free up more
time for professional
interactions,

46:14.338 --> 46:19.410
as folks like Emma Stanton
subcontract lesser tasks.

46:19.410 --> 46:26.817
DR. EMMA STANTON: "We noticed
one of your shirts still had
some small stains on it.

46:26.817 --> 46:36.327
We took it back to the dry
cleaners. Thank you. Have a
great weekend."

46:36.327 --> 49:10.714
So I probably would never even
have noticed that my shirt had

49:10.714 --> 51:15.205
a stain on it. So, I kind of
like

51:15.205 --> 51:35.926
the fact that

51:35.926 --> 52:09.693
they just

52:09.693 --> 52:11.695
picked that up and
dealt with it.

52:11.695 --> 52:16.567
PAUL SOLMAN: And to CEO Marcela
Sapone, it's just a division of
labor that allows

52:16.567 --> 52:20.104
anyone in a dense
neighborhood to buy a butler.

52:20.104 --> 52:25.476
MARCELA SAPONE: There's no
reason you or I can't be just as
extraordinary as Batman.

52:25.476 --> 52:29.079
PAUL SOLMAN: Economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting for the "PBS NewsHour"
from

52:29.079 --> 52:33.751
Boston and New York.

52:33.751 --> 52:44.261
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: It's not just the NSA.
Corporations have been

52:44.261 --> 52:48.999
storing massive troves of our
data, and it's not about
national security. It's about

52:48.999 --> 52:54.438
making money. The new book "All
You Can Pay" paints an Orwellian
future, where big

52:54.438 --> 52:59.076
data reigns. We have an excerpt
from the book on our home page.
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:59.076 --> 53:00.911
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
the "NewsHour" for tonight.

53:00.911 --> 53:02.112
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:02.112 --> 53:04.281
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:04.281 --> 53:08.919
We will see you online and again
here tomorrow evening, with Mark
Shields and David Brooks.

53:08.919 --> 53:10.320
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you, and good
night.
