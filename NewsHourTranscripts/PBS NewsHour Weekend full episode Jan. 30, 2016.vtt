MATH, IS IT?

02:18.705 --> 02:19.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FIRST.

02:24.244 --> 02:25.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:02.635 --> 20:04.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT YOU DISCOVERED IS THAT IT

20:04.470 --> 20:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOES FARTHER THAN THAT.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE PRODUCT OF THIS GENE.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THESE RESULTS IS THAT THAT

20:18.384 --> 20:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCESS SOMEHOW GOES AWRY, AND

20:20.986 --> 20:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TREAT JUST ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS

20:37.803 --> 20:39.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:44.276 --> 20:46.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE ARE ACTUALLY JUST ONE OF

20:46.045 --> 20:48.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:50.249 --> 20:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS THAT MOST

20:51.750 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SAYING, THE IDEA IS THIS GENETIC

21:12.771 --> 21:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPONENT IS A WAY TO IDENTIFY

21:15.541 --> 21:16.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DISEASE BEFORE YOU EVEN HAVE

21:16.609 --> 21:18.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DEAL WITH THE SYMPTOMS.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE GENETICS IS A WAY

21:20.212 --> 21:21.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO UNDERSTAND THE DISEASE.

21:21.747 --> 21:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE IN

21:22.915 --> 21:25.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL, WE LEARNED... GENETICS

21:25.017 --> 21:26.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE LEARNED WAS THIS VERY

21:26.585 --> 21:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMPLE GENETICS-- BIG "B,"

LITTLE "B."

21:29.021 --> 21:30.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT TURNS OUT THAT ALMOST NO

21:30.789 --> 21:32.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMON DISEASES ACTUALLY WORK

21:32.391 --> 21:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAY.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE SHAPED BY THE INTERPLAY

21:34.627 --> 21:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF HUNDREDS OF GENES.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DISCOVERING THOSE GENES IS A

21:39.231 --> 21:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY OF TELLING US WHAT THOSE KEY

21:40.533 --> 21:43.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES ARE SO THAT

21:43.002 --> 21:44.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN POINT DRUG DEVELOPMENT

21:44.336 --> 21:45.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOWARD THE RIGHT BIOLOGICAL

21:45.638 --> 21:46.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCESSES.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

GENES IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT

21:49.675 --> 21:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TEACH YOU ANYTHING.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AT ALL.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE KEY THING IS GOING TO BE

21:56.215 --> 21:57.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTANDING THE DISEASE WELL

21:57.850 --> 22:00.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENOUGH TO DEVELOP NEW MEDICINES

22:00.753 --> 22:01.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
