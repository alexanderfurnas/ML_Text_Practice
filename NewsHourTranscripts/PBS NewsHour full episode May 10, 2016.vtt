Judy Woodruff.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
the first primary day with just
one Republican

00:11.712 --> 00:16.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running for president, as West
Virginians
choose between two Democrats.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Tuesday:

00:18.185 --> 00:21.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President-Elect:
I would like to reach my hand to
my opponents.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let us begin the healing now.

00:24.258 --> 00:29.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A look at the
new likely
president of the Philippines,
Rodrigo Duterte,

00:29.529 --> 00:34.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how his tough-talking, shock
politics
may shape a new era for the
country.

00:34.368 --> 00:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what happens
when you combine
a day care center with a nursing
home? One

00:39.873 --> 00:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seattle-based residence is
finding the benefits
of creating a space for young
and old alike.

00:45.145 --> 00:48.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARRIET THOMPSON, Senior
Citizen: This is
what makes me happy. And you get
to know them,

00:48.916 --> 00:54.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and watch them, and act silly
with them. It's
good to feel like you're 3 years
old again.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:57.524 --> 01:01.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.795 --> 01:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The presidential
primary season
is winding toward a close with
two of the

01:14.675 --> 01:17.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
final states taking their turns
tonight.

01:17.878 --> 01:23.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
West Virginia has 29 Democratic
delegates
to offer. Overall, Hillary
Clinton needs just

01:23.450 --> 01:30.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
155 more to lock up the party's
nomination.
Republicans have races today in
both West

01:30.524 --> 01:36.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Virginia and Nebraska, even
though the outcomes
are now just a formality.

01:36.997 --> 01:43.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was West Virginians' turn to
head to the
polls today, but the candidates
were elsewhere.

01:43.603 --> 01:49.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, a near lock to be
the Republican
nominee, was in New York,
reportedly working

01:49.643 --> 01:55.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to join forces with the
Republican National
Committee on fund-raising. But
he still faces

01:55.682 --> 01:59.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hurdles winning support from
party leaders.

01:59.319 --> 02:04.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Speaker Paul Ryan has so
far refused
an endorsement. He's scheduled
to meet with

02:04.624 --> 02:06.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump on Thursday.

02:06.860 --> 02:10.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ryan spoke this afternoon in an
online interview
with The Wall Street Journal:

02:11.064 --> 02:13.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
The point I have been making is,
we shouldn't

02:13.967 --> 02:17.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just pretend that our party is
unified, when
we know it is not.

02:17.838 --> 02:22.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think what we want to
do is sit down
together and talk about how we
can unify the

02:22.209 --> 02:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Party, so that we can
be at full
strength in the fall, because if
we just pretend

02:26.179 --> 02:29.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're unified, without actually
unifying,
then we will be at half-strength
in the fall,

02:29.416 --> 02:31.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that won't go well for us.

02:31.351 --> 02:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump's former
rival Ted Cruz
also declined today to say if
he'd back the

02:37.657 --> 02:43.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presumptive nominee. The Texas
senator's name
is still on the ballot in
Nebraska, but he

02:43.630 --> 02:48.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
played down the chance that a
victory there
might prompt him to reenter the
race.

02:48.802 --> 02:51.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R), Texas:
Listen, we have
suspended the campaign. We have
suspended

02:51.705 --> 02:56.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the campaign because I can see
no viable path
to victory. Of course, if that
changed, we

02:57.010 --> 03:00.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would reconsider things. But
let's be clear.
We are not going to win Nebraska
today. There

03:00.147 --> 03:02.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should be no mystery, no
excitement in that.

03:02.916 --> 03:08.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have withdrawn from the
campaign and it's
in the hands of the voters. If
circumstances

03:08.522 --> 03:10.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change, we will always assess
changed circumstances.

03:10.524 --> 03:15.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the Democratic
side, Hillary
Clinton stumped in Kentucky,
next door to

03:15.929 --> 03:22.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
West Virginia. She called for
paying child
care workers more, while curbing
child care

03:22.169 --> 03:24.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
costs for families.

03:24.237 --> 03:26.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I don't think any family should
have to pay

03:26.740 --> 03:31.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 10 percent of their
income for child
care. That ought to be just a
rule, and you

03:31.478 --> 03:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ought to get help if you're
getting too close
to that or going above that. So,
we need to

03:36.450 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start thinking about family
issues as investment
issues, investments in the
future, investment

03:43.457 --> 03:45.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our children.

03:45.459 --> 03:50.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton's rival,
Bernie Sanders,
pressed ahead with his underdog
campaign in

03:50.931 --> 03:56.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a California city still
suffering from the
housing market meltdown in 2008.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
When you have this grotesque
level of income

03:58.105 --> 04:07.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and wealth inequality, when you
have a situation
where, over the last 25 years,
trillions of

04:07.447 --> 04:14.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dollars have left the hands of
working families
and have gone into the top
one-tenth of 1

04:14.855 --> 04:20.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent, don't tell me we don't
have the resources
to rebuild Stockton, California.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:22.429 --> 04:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: California's
delegate-rich
contest, almost at the end of
the Democrats'

04:26.867 --> 04:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
primary calendar, is set for
June 7.

04:31.404 --> 04:35.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders has vowed to take his
campaign all
the way to the Democratic
Convention in Philadelphia

04:35.809 --> 04:37.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in late July.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
The people of Central and
Southern Oklahoma

04:40.881 --> 04:45.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surveyed the damage and began
recovery operations
after a barrage of tornadoes.
Two people were

04:45.752 --> 04:51.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed by separate storms that
struck near
the town to the south of
Oklahoma City.

04:51.391 --> 04:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Storm chasers captured footage
of the twisters,
one reportedly up to a
mile-wide. The twisters

04:56.229 --> 05:00.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ripped through homes, tossed
cars aside and
scattered debris for miles.

05:01.034 --> 05:05.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fire that swept through Fort
McMurray,
Canada, is still burning, but
it's moved away

05:05.639 --> 05:09.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the city, and repairs are
beginning.
Officials and journalists toured
the area

05:09.743 --> 05:15.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday, and found some blocks
were burned
to their foundations, destroying
2,400 buildings.

05:15.749 --> 05:20.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But about 90 percent of the town
survived
intact. Still, it will be weeks
before nearly

05:21.021 --> 05:24.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
90,000 evacuees are allowed to
return.

05:24.524 --> 05:29.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, oil sands companies
are trying
to resume production, but many
staffers and

05:29.162 --> 05:30.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suppliers are displaced.

05:30.931 --> 05:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
will become
the first sitting U.S. president
to visit

05:35.368 --> 05:38.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hiroshima, Japan, when he
travels to Asia
later this month.

05:39.072 --> 05:44.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United States carried out
the world's
first atomic bombing on
Hiroshima in August

05:44.377 --> 05:50.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
1945. It's estimated that
140,000 people were
killed.

05:50.717 --> 05:54.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spokesman Josh Earnest announced
the visit
today, but said the president
doesn't plan

05:54.955 --> 05:56.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to offer an apology while he's
there.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
The president intends the visit
to send a

05:59.993 --> 06:09.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much more forward-looking signal
about his
ambition for realizing the goals
of a planet

06:09.536 --> 06:16.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without nuclear weapons. This
also is an opportunity
for the visit to highlight the
remarkable

06:16.643 --> 06:20.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
transformation in the
relationship between
Japan and the United States.

06:20.680 --> 06:25.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president's
week-long visit
to Asia will include a Group of
Seven summit

06:25.719 --> 06:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Japan and a stop in Vietnam.

06:27.988 --> 06:33.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In North
Korea, a mass,
tightly choreographed parade
capped the first

06:33.226 --> 06:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ruling party Congress in nearly
40 years.
Hundreds of thousands gathered
in Pyongyang's

06:37.664 --> 06:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
main square with floats and
patriotic banners
to pay tribute to the country's
leader, Kim

06:42.168 --> 06:48.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jong-un. After nightfall,
torchbearers formed
designs and phrases, including
one that read

06:48.375 --> 06:50.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"The Nuclear-Powered State."

06:50.610 --> 06:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United States
Navy staged
a new challenge today to China's
sweeping

06:55.649 --> 07:01.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
claims in the South China Sea,
and Beijing
scrambled fighter jets in
response. A U.S.

07:01.821 --> 07:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guided missile destroyer sailed
within 12
nautical miles of Fiery Cross
Reef, now occupied

07:08.295 --> 07:10.030 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the Chinese.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LU KANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman
(through translator): This is
out and out

07:12.766 --> 07:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a military challenge to the new
marine order.
The United States has flexed its
military

07:17.304 --> 07:22.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
muscles by sending warships and
military planes
close to and even into the
related islands

07:22.609 --> 07:26.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and reefs and their surrounding
sea and airspace
for provocation.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is but the biggest threat
to the peace
and stability and the freedom of
navigation

07:30.083 --> 07:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and flight on the South China
Sea.

07:31.918 --> 07:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of
State John Kerry
brushed aside the Chinese
objections, saying

07:36.756 --> 07:40.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
again that the U.S. is
determined to maintain
freedom of navigation.

07:40.393 --> 07:45.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also today, a
Chinese labor
panel ruled against a fired
worker in the

07:45.265 --> 07:50.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country's first transgender job
bias case.
The claimant argued he was let
go unfairly

07:50.136 --> 07:56.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for living as a man when he was
born a woman.
The arbitration panel granted
$62 in back

07:57.043 --> 07:59.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wages, but found the employer
broke no laws.

07:59.879 --> 08:03.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the U.S.
Justice Department has opted not
to seek the

08:03.950 --> 08:09.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
death penalty for the alleged
mastermind in
the attacks on U.S. diplomats in
Benghazi,

08:09.422 --> 08:15.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Libya. Ahmed Abu Khattala was
captured in
Libya two years ago, and brought
to the U.S.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's charged with murder and
supporting terrorists.

08:18.832 --> 08:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. ambassador and three
other Americans
were killed in the attacks in
2012. Militants

08:24.637 --> 08:27.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stormed a U.S. compound and a
CIA complex.

08:27.140 --> 08:33.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A Baltimore
police officer
chose today to go before a judge
rather than

08:33.213 --> 08:37.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a jury in the Freddie Gray case.
Edward Nero
is charged with assault,
reckless endangerment

08:38.084 --> 08:42.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and misconduct in office. He was
involved
in arresting Gray, who died of
injuries in

08:42.989 --> 08:47.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
custody, touching off riots. The
first case
resulting from the arrest ended
in a hung

08:47.861 --> 08:49.562 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jury.

08:49.662 --> 08:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wall Street,
stocks had
their biggest day since March,
boosted in

08:53.133 --> 08:59.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part by China's efforts to
stimulate its economy.

President Obama welcomed
the Huskies today to celebrate
their fourth

09:16.589 --> 09:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
straight national title and the
school's 11
overall. The president said
UConn has defied

09:23.029 --> 09:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the old saying that you can't
win all of the
time.

09:26.966 --> 09:30.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
change in
the Philippines -- voters elect
a controversial

09:30.970 --> 09:37.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new president; the educational
benefits of
preschoolers interacting with
senior citizens;

09:37.410 --> 09:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an organization that's training
people to
talk about race; and much more.

09:52.525 --> 09:59.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The man who will next lead the
Philippines
was lauded as a no-nonsense
tough guy and

09:59.799 --> 10:04.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
derided as a looming dictator
throughout a
fiery election campaign.

10:04.771 --> 10:10.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, it became clear, after
his two closest
rivals conceded, that, whatever
the labels,

10:10.610 --> 10:16.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rodrigo Duterte will soon be
called Mr. President.
With China flexing its muscles
in the South

10:16.516 --> 10:21.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China Sea, the United States is
looking to
deepen its security relationship
with Manila,

10:21.321 --> 10:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while Duterte has said his
priorities are
to lift up the large numbers of
Filipinos

10:26.559 --> 10:31.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in poverty and crack down on
crime.

10:31.331 --> 10:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rodrigo Duterte is known for his
tough talk
and bombastic style, but he was
decidedly

10:36.536 --> 10:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more humble on a pre-dawn trip
today to his
parents' tomb in Manila. Social
media video

10:42.509 --> 10:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
showed him sobbing as he said,
"Help me, mom.
I'm just a nobody."

10:48.248 --> 10:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That may once have been true,
but Monday's
election has now catapulted
Duterte to president-elect.

10:54.287 --> 10:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He won about 40 percent of the
vote, pledging
to eliminate poverty, corruption
and crime.

10:59.592 --> 11:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The outcome delighted supporters
in Davao
City, where he's long been
mayor.

11:04.130 --> 11:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I am
happy and feel
privileged. The mayor prevailed.

11:08.434 --> 11:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Duterte's path
to the presidency
was anything but conventional,
featuring crude

11:13.673 --> 11:18.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sex jokes, which included making
light of
the rape and murder of an
Australian woman,

11:18.144 --> 11:20.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and incendiary rhetoric,
especially about
criminals.

11:21.047 --> 11:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippines
President-Elect:
All of you who are into drugs,
you sons of

11:24.617 --> 11:25.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(EXPLETIVE DELETED).

11:25.151 --> 11:26.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

11:27.020 --> 11:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE: I will really
kill you. I
have no patience for that. I
have no middle

11:29.556 --> 11:32.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ground there. Either you kill
me, or I will
kill you idiots.

11:33.026 --> 11:37.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That kind of
talk has led
some to draw comparisons to
Donald Trump,

11:37.764 --> 11:41.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee
in the U.S.

11:41.834 --> 11:45.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Karen Lema is a Manila
correspondent for Reuters,
who spoke with us via Google
Hangouts.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN LEMA, Reuters: I think
it's probably
because of their unconventional
ways, their

11:48.908 --> 11:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unorthodox ways. Here, people
tend to look
at those that are in the
political establishment

11:55.548 --> 12:00.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as weak, inefficient and
corrupt. And, again,
Duterte I think has successfully
differentiated

12:01.087 --> 12:05.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself from the pack. And
that's where his
appeal lie.

12:05.325 --> 12:10.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Duterte
inherits a Philippine
economy that grew an average of
6.2 percent

12:10.563 --> 12:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the past six years. But
with nearly a
third of the population still
below the poverty

12:15.568 --> 12:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
line, voters said they were
ready for change.

12:18.371 --> 12:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
need someone
who can make the prices of goods
go down,

12:23.009 --> 12:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that for us who are poor, we
can make a
better living.

12:26.613 --> 12:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I
hope, whoever
becomes the president, they will
help the

12:30.617 --> 12:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
homeless, provide work for our
husbands and
run the Philippines well.

12:34.087 --> 12:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Today, a
Duterte spokesman
laid out plans to federalize the
government.

12:38.891 --> 12:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Karen Lema says it's a bid to
help neglected
regions far removed from the
country's power

12:43.896 --> 12:45.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
center.

12:45.865 --> 12:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN LEMA: He want to devolve
functions away
from Central Manila to the
provinces. He wanted

12:50.803 --> 12:55.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to empower these provinces and
make sure that
the wealth is more evenly
distributed. And,

12:55.575 --> 13:01.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
like he said, he wants to
benefit what he
calls the -- those who have been
left behind.

13:01.781 --> 13:06.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On foreign
policy, Duterte
has said he'd talk to China
about its expanding

13:06.919 --> 13:12.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
claims and military activity in
the South
China Sea. But, if nothing
changed, he said

13:12.725 --> 13:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he'd sail to one of Beijing's
new artificial
islands and plant the Philippine
flag.

13:18.064 --> 13:22.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, China's Foreign Ministry
voiced hope
for progress with the new
leader.

13:22.168 --> 13:25.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LU KANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman
(through translator): China and
the Philippines

13:25.571 --> 13:29.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a traditional friendship.
We indeed hope
that the new government of the
Philippines

13:29.776 --> 13:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would meet China halfway, taking
concrete
measures to properly deal with
the disputes.

13:34.747 --> 13:39.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Duterte has
also expressed
wariness about closer security
ties with the

13:39.952 --> 13:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S., but, yesterday, he called
for talks
to include the U.S., Japan and
Australia.

13:45.124 --> 13:50.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE: I do not think
that anybody
now is interested in getting to
war. And so

13:50.930 --> 13:57.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are allied with America. We
will agree
to a multilateral participation,
if there

13:57.437 --> 13:59.138 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is one coming.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Washington,
a White House
spokesman said today -- quote --
"We look

14:01.574 --> 14:05.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward to strengthening and
deepening ties
with the Philippines."

14:05.745 --> 14:11.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, policy questions aside,
Duterte's hard-line
approach has sparked concerns
that he could

14:11.684 --> 14:16.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a dictator in the making in a
country with
an authoritarian past.

14:16.756 --> 14:22.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1972, President Ferdinand
Marcos declared
martial law in the Philippines,
and ruled

14:22.862 --> 14:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unchallenged for years. He was
ousted in 1986
by Corazon Aquino, the widow of
a fierce Marcos

14:31.137 --> 14:33.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
critic, and she became
president.

14:33.806 --> 14:39.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now her son Benigno Aquino is
leaving office
after serving the single
six-year term allowed

14:39.645 --> 14:45.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
under the country's
constitution. He opposed
Duterte and instead backed
former Interior

14:45.284 --> 14:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Mar Roxas. Aquino also
campaigned
against Ferdinand Marcos Jr.,
who trailed

14:51.624 --> 14:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by a narrow margin in the vice
presidential
race.

14:54.994 --> 14:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement today, Aquino
said, "Our people
have spoken and their verdict is
accepted

14:59.766 --> 15:00.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and respected."

15:01.000 --> 15:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now back to the
presidential
campaign.

15:18.151 --> 15:23.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump may be the
presumptive Republican
nominee, but he still has
considerable work

15:23.456 --> 15:28.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to do to bring essential
elements of the GOP
and the conservative movement on
board to

15:28.861 --> 15:30.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
support him.

15:30.663 --> 15:35.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To explore that, we are joined
now by two
Republicans, Ken Cuccinelli, who
until last

15:35.334 --> 15:42.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
week served as delegate
operations director
for the Ted Cruz campaign, and
Corey Stewart,

15:42.241 --> 15:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Virginia state campaign chair
for Donald Trump.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, gentlemen, we welcome you
both to the
program.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ken Cuccinelli, let me start
with you.

15:50.283 --> 15:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You worked your heart out for
Ted Cruz. He
dropped out. He is now today
saying he's ruling

15:56.055 --> 15:58.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out a third-party bid. Where
does this leave
you?

15:59.025 --> 16:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH CUCCINELLI (R), Former
Virginia Attorney
General: Well, you know, we were
15-1, but

16:02.595 --> 16:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have to go undefeated to be
the nominee.
And it's disappointing.

16:07.767 --> 16:13.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, I wonder if I'm
watching my country
commit political suicide. But,
you know, there

16:14.006 --> 16:18.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is five months until the
election, and we
will see how things go at the
convention and

16:18.344 --> 16:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we will see where things go
between now and
November.

16:20.613 --> 16:26.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he didn't
entirely today,
we noticed, rule out getting
back in the race.

16:26.118 --> 16:27.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you think that's a
possibility?

16:27.987 --> 16:32.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH CUCCINELLI: Not -- not
realistically,
no. I think that was more along
the lines

16:32.391 --> 16:36.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of a statement of, if an
asteroid hits New
York City and Donald Trump is
dead, then I

16:36.762 --> 16:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will get back in the race.

16:38.631 --> 16:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, short of that, no, this
race is -- we
have hit the point where Trump
is going to

16:44.871 --> 16:50.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hit the 1,237 mark and get over
the majority
needed to be the nominee, and so
that's what

16:50.409 --> 16:54.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I expect is going to happen. We
still have
other things to do. There's
always a debate

16:54.747 --> 17:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the platform. What does it
-- on an
ideal day, what does it mean to
be a Republican?

17:02.188 --> 17:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we also want to recover --
and I think
this is an area where Cruz and
Trump delegates

17:06.025 --> 17:10.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may have a lot in common -- we
want to recover
these rules back from the
establishment and

17:11.063 --> 17:16.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
return them much more to the
grassroots than
they have been structured today
and than they

17:16.602 --> 17:18.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been for decades.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, and I do
want to ask you
about that in a moment.

17:20.006 --> 17:23.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Corey Stewart, let me turn
to you. What
do you say? You have been
supporting Donald

17:23.109 --> 17:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump for months now. What do
you say to conservatives
who are still struggling with
whether or not

17:29.015 --> 17:32.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is really a
conservative who
believes what they do?

17:32.285 --> 17:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY STEWART, Trump Campaign
Virginia State
Chairman: Well, he is a
conservative. We stand

17:35.621 --> 17:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by a conservative platform at
the convention.

17:39.058 --> 17:44.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the Cruz supporters would
like to strengthen
it, we will support that. In
fact, there are

17:45.064 --> 17:50.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some parts of the platform we
would like to
make stronger, especially on
illegal immigration.

17:50.836 --> 17:55.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think where there could be
some disagreement
is perhaps on international
trade. We don't

17:55.775 --> 18:03.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel that the TPP, or the TTIP,
or some of
the past international trade
agreements have

18:03.616 --> 18:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been fair to American workers
and American
small businesses.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, overall, I think we are
going to have
a lot of agreement with other
conservatives

18:09.789 --> 18:11.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the party.

18:11.657 --> 18:13.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's
interesting you
point those things out,,
because, as you know,

18:13.626 --> 18:16.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the last few days, there has
been a lot
of attention on some of Mr.
Trump's statements.

18:16.862 --> 18:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are saying, well, just
how conservative
is he, because he's come out
with positions

18:21.400 --> 18:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on trade, on issues like Social
Security where
-- that really not I think what
people view

18:29.108 --> 18:31.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as part of the conservative
orthodoxy?

18:31.944 --> 18:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you -- how are you,
yourself, how comfortable
are you when you hear him, say,
take positions

18:39.518 --> 18:42.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where aren't necessarily where
maybe you thought
conservatives were?

18:42.722 --> 18:45.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COREY STEWART: Well, I think
there is a question,
well, what is conservative?

18:45.491 --> 18:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Donald Trump, he is
pro-life. He's
conservative on the social
issues. He's conservative

18:51.430 --> 18:56.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on taxation. He's conservative
on releasing,
you know -- on deregulation and
making it

18:56.736 --> 19:04.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
easier for small business
people. So, I mean,
but, look, if we attack some of
these agreements,

19:04.377 --> 19:08.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TTIP and TPP, that are hollowing
out the manufacturing
sector in America...

19:08.180 --> 19:10.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These are some of
the agreements
the Obama administration has
worked on.

19:11.017 --> 19:14.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY STEWART: Right, some of
the international
trade agreements that are really
hurting American

19:14.253 --> 19:16.122 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
workers.

19:16.222 --> 19:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what is -- I don't consider
that conservative
or liberal. It's just common
sense. We need

19:20.860 --> 19:22.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to protect our own workers and
our own businesses.

19:22.928 --> 19:25.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ken Cuccinelli,
how conservative
is Donald Trump?

19:25.998 --> 19:31.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH CUCCINELLI: Well, I
mean, I appreciate
Corey's comments, but I don't
think it's really

19:31.370 --> 19:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accurate to characterize him as
a conservative.

19:34.140 --> 19:39.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is someone who has spoken
about higher
taxes and higher minimum wage
being enforced

19:39.412 --> 19:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the federal level. And
maybe he is supportive
today of socially conservative
positions,

19:48.187 --> 19:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's hard to have a lot of
faith in that,
given the history.

19:51.724 --> 19:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's one of those things
where actions
are going to speak louder than
some words,

19:56.462 --> 20:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that's going to take some
time to see
and to develop, and as the
campaign progresses.

20:03.836 --> 20:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we will -- you know, a lot of
us are just
hanging back, not casting
judgment on him

20:08.641 --> 20:10.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a nominee at this point.

20:10.576 --> 20:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as I told Corey Lewandowski
when I talked
to him this weekend, is, we
really want the

20:15.214 --> 20:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see overlap on positions and on
beliefs and
some credibility put behind
those positions,

20:22.221 --> 20:27.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we can rely on them. This
is a -- to
put it in Trump-ese, this is the
deal. You

20:27.359 --> 20:32.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want me to vote for you, and
that comes first.
And what I get is the positions
when you're

20:32.364 --> 20:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president. That comes second.

20:34.400 --> 20:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there's no taking my vote
back in November.
So, in addition to taking
conservative positions,

20:41.107 --> 20:46.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not just calling things
conservative and declaring
it to be so, actual movement
conservative

20:46.512 --> 20:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
positions, then you have got to
back it up.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH CUCCINELLI: And one good
way to back
it up is with personnel who you
say is going

20:51.517 --> 20:54.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to implement any particular
given policy.

20:54.920 --> 20:59.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I should say,
Corey Lewandowski
being the campaign manager.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COREY STEWART: The other Corey.

21:00.359 --> 21:01.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other Corey
in all this.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENNETH CUCCINELLI: Yes, yes.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Corey
Stewart, what about
the points that we just heard
from Ken Cuccinelli,

21:06.499 --> 21:12.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that Mr. Trump has made
statements about higher
taxes on the wealthy, on raising
the minimum

21:12.304 --> 21:16.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
wage? I mean, are those
positions you think
he's going to stay with?

21:16.675 --> 21:19.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY STEWART: Well, I think
what you're going
the find is, Donald Trump is
going to be a

21:20.045 --> 21:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot more conservative than the
Republican
Party has been in the past.

21:23.449 --> 21:28.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Take illegal immigration. The
party has said
for years and years that they're
for a secure

21:28.420 --> 21:33.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
border, but no presidential
candidate has
-- on the Republican side has
taken such a

21:33.759 --> 21:39.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong position on both internal
enforcement
of our immigration laws and on
the border.

21:39.431 --> 21:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason he's doing that
and the reason
he's doing so well among
blue-collar workers

21:43.869 --> 21:48.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and he's tied with Hillary
Clinton in Pennsylvania,
something no Republican
candidate has done

21:48.507 --> 21:53.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in recent history -- is because
he's doing
this to protect American workers
and American

21:53.679 --> 21:55.414 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs.

21:55.514 --> 21:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
that it's
OK if he takes some of these
other positions

21:58.017 --> 22:02.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it comes to minimum wage,
when it comes
to higher taxes on the wealthy,
because he's

22:02.488 --> 22:08.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expanding the pie, so to speak,
of the voters
he can attract to vote for him
in the Republican

22:08.928 --> 22:10.563 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Party?

22:10.663 --> 22:13.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY STEWART: Well, I think the
important
thing to recognize is that he is
anti-tax.

22:13.265 --> 22:18.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to keep taxes low on
business.
He understands, as a
businessperson, that

22:18.604 --> 22:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for business will thrive in
America, one,
you have got to protect it from
unfair trade

22:22.942 --> 22:24.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
practices from China and
elsewhere.

22:24.810 --> 22:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two, you have got to have low
taxation. You
have got to have low regulation.
He's for

22:28.547 --> 22:31.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of those things. And he's
also for protecting
American jobs.

22:31.116 --> 22:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if that's the
case, Ken
Cuccinelli, is that a package
that you can

22:38.390 --> 22:40.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- a deal, I should say, that
you can live
with?

22:40.359 --> 22:43.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH CUCCINELLI: Yes, if all
of those things
hold up, I think that's going
the make a lot

22:43.896 --> 22:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of conservatives a lot more
comfortable.

22:45.798 --> 22:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the challenge is that a
lot of us
in the last 10 months feel like
those positions

22:51.704 --> 22:57.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have waxed and waned and come
and gone and
changed today and been different
tomorrow.

22:57.843 --> 23:04.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're going to want to see
some consistency
through the battle now with
Hillary Clinton

23:04.149 --> 23:09.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without moving those positions,
along the
lines of what you heard Corey
just describe.

23:10.089 --> 23:15.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That kind of consistency is one
way that he
can start to make conservatives
comfortable

23:15.661 --> 23:17.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pulling the lever for Donald
Trump.

23:17.496 --> 23:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Corey
Stewart, do you
expect Donald Trump will be
consistent on

23:20.866 --> 23:21.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these things?

23:21.767 --> 23:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COREY STEWART: Absolutely. He
is.

23:23.636 --> 23:27.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you go back to interviews of
Donald Trump
from back in the 1980s, he's
been talking

23:27.239 --> 23:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a stronger border. He's
been talking
about being better to business
and protecting

23:31.110 --> 23:35.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American workers since the
1980s. He's as
constant as the Northern Star on
these issues.

23:35.914 --> 23:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to...

23:37.416 --> 23:38.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

23:38.851 --> 23:41.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ken Cuccinelli,
you -- you're
laughing now. Why?

23:41.553 --> 23:48.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH CUCCINELLI: Look, I
appreciate what
Corey Stewart has to say, but
consistency

23:49.061 --> 23:52.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has not been a hallmark when it
comes to policy
of Donald Trump.

23:53.098 --> 23:58.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, take taxes. Take minimum
wage. Take
abortion. Take gay marriage.
It's a long and

23:59.038 --> 24:05.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
varying list. And even
immigration, where
he made his first mark in the
presidential

24:05.778 --> 24:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign, is not -- he is not
today -- and
I basically appreciate where I
think he is

24:11.884 --> 24:14.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today -- in the same place where
he has been
in the past.

24:14.953 --> 24:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is this just
quickly, just
quickly, Ken Cuccinelli,
something you plan

24:18.424 --> 24:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to argue at the convention rules
committee?

24:20.426 --> 24:22.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENNETH CUCCINELLI: No. No.

24:22.294 --> 24:27.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that Corey's point about
platform
and strengthening the party
position on illegal

24:27.132 --> 24:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immigration is one there will be
a lot of
agreement on. But let's face it.
The platform

24:32.338 --> 24:38.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a statement of ideals and
principles. Will
they be acted on? And I think in
the area

24:38.410 --> 24:40.245 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of...
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I need to...

24:40.346 --> 24:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH CUCCINELLI: ... illegal
immigration,
I have the most confidence in
Donald Trump.

24:41.847 --> 24:43.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the other areas where I
wonder more.

24:43.749 --> 24:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, I just --
literally two
words on whether -- it looks
like you're going

24:47.453 --> 24:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to come to some agreement at the
convention.

24:48.787 --> 24:49.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COREY STEWART: We are. We're
going to have
an agreement.

24:49.621 --> 24:51.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY STEWART: There's going to
be a strong
conservative coalition coming
together in

24:53.325 --> 24:54.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
November to defeat Hillary.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Corey Stewart, Ken Cuccinelli,
thank you both.

24:58.497 --> 25:05.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KENNETH CUCCINELLI: Good to be
with you.

25:05.237 --> 25:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new report due
out later
this week from the National
Institute on Early

25:19.651 --> 25:24.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Education Research finds that a
number of
states are struggling to find
ways to improve

25:26.692 --> 25:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we look at a unique
approach taken
by a preschool in Seattle,
Washington. It's

25:32.831 --> 25:38.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving children life lessons
that go beyond
the classroom, and providing a
unique opportunity

25:38.203 --> 25:40.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to seniors.

25:40.172 --> 25:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise

26:04.663 --> 26:06.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY MCGOVERN: Red. Everybody
knows that.

26:06.732 --> 26:12.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Luckily for Mary, she
doesn't need
to go any further than down the
hall to find

26:12.337 --> 26:13.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her young friends.

26:13.839 --> 26:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY MCGOVERN: Oh, see, look in
here is the
little kids in there.

26:16.508 --> 26:18.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Oh, yes.

26:18.410 --> 26:23.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McGovern lives at Providence
Mount St. Vincent,
a nursing home in Seattle,
Washington, that

26:23.248 --> 26:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also houses a day care for
children up to
5 years of age.

26:28.287 --> 26:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Thank you, honey. Thank
you. There
you go. Thank you very much.

26:37.830 --> 26:45.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Every weekday, 500
residents are
joined by 125 children in the
facility affectionately

26:45.704 --> 26:47.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
called The Mount.

26:47.306 --> 26:48.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Peekaboo.

26:48.307 --> 26:49.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Peekaboo.

26:49.308 --> 26:51.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: I see you.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Administrator Charlene Boyd:

26:53.378 --> 26:54.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHARLENE BOYD, Regional
Administrator, Providence
Mount St. Vincent: We wanted to
create a place

26:54.847 --> 26:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for people to come to live, and
not come to
die.

26:59.351 --> 27:04.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: So, in 1991, Boyd and
other administrators
added a high-quality preschool
to the nursing

27:04.256 --> 27:10.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
home and created an
intergenerational learning
center, a community for the very
old and very

27:10.462 --> 27:11.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
young.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why is there is this railing
here?

27:13.232 --> 27:16.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLENE BOYD: This railing is
here not for
the kids, but it's here for
residents. And

27:16.201 --> 27:23.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it's a safety piece for a
resident in a wheelchair
to push themselves up and to
hold on and to

27:23.742 --> 27:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring themselves to a standing
position and
watch the children through the
window.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: So, they can stand
here and look
in?

27:28.180 --> 27:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLENE BOYD: They can stand
here and look
in.

27:29.982 --> 27:37.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's putting high-quality child
care in a
setting that link old and young
together,

27:37.222 --> 27:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making the magic between these
two ages together,
bringing joy to the residents
and joy to those

27:44.530 --> 27:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young children. It's just like
this magical
formula that happens every day.

27:48.367 --> 27:55.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Can I get a high-five?
There. He knows
how to do a high-five.

27:55.340 --> 28:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY MCGOVERN: Most of them,
they're curious
about me. Why are you here? I
tell them I'm

28:01.680 --> 28:08.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here because, when I was living
in my house,
when I got too old, I wasn't
always walking

28:08.787 --> 28:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
straight, and sometimes I would
fall. And
if fell, I had to have some help
to get up,

28:15.327 --> 28:16.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because I couldn't get off the
floor.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I want to hug your baby doll.

28:18.764 --> 28:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAUREEN MCGOVERN, Daughter of
Mary McGovern:
I think there are things that
both parties

28:20.832 --> 28:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take away from the interactions.
It's not
like a lifelong relationship,
but just for

28:26.972 --> 28:33.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that moment in time, they're
both enjoying
each other's company, and
getting something

28:33.845 --> 28:36.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of their relationship with
that person
in that moment.

28:36.815 --> 28:39.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY MCGOVERN: Give me a hug.
Come on.

28:39.184 --> 28:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLENE BOYD: All of us have
common needs
to be recognized. All of us have
common needs

28:43.722 --> 28:49.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be loved, and all of us have
common needs
to share life together. And so
these children

28:49.628 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bring life and vibrancy and
normalcy. It's
a gift. It's a gift in exposing
young families

28:55.100 --> 29:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to positive aspects of aging,
and it's a gift
of also having children seeing
frailty, normalcy

29:01.740 --> 29:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that's part of that full
circle of life.

29:07.679 --> 29:09.548 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(SINGING)

29:09.648 --> 29:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Intergenerational
activities can
be spontaneous or planned, like
this sing-a-long.

29:14.319 --> 29:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIE HOOVER, Providence Mount
St. Vincent:
There's 36 visit possible each
week, so each

29:18.957 --> 29:24.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
classroom, six classrooms, has
at least three
visits, up to six visits.

29:24.429 --> 29:30.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The director of the
center, Marie
Hoover, says children become
comfortable with

29:30.902 --> 29:33.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
elderly residents at an early
age.

29:33.205 --> 29:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIE HOOVER: Whether they're in
a wheelchair,
or in a walker, or maybe they're
hard to understand,

29:38.810 --> 29:44.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or you have to speak louder, it
is just about
who that individual is, and they
adjust. The

29:44.249 --> 29:48.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids just don't -- they really
don't blink
an eye. This is normal. This is
just who this

29:48.620 --> 29:50.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
resident is.

29:50.522 --> 29:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Ninety-three-year-old
Harriet Thompson
joined this sing-a-long on her
way to the

29:56.128 --> 29:57.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dining hall.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARRIET THOMPSON, Senior
Citizen: I usually
like to go sit down for a while
before dinner,

30:00.332 --> 30:02.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but I heard them singing, so in,
we went.

30:02.834 --> 30:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: What do you experience
internally
when you're around these
children?

30:07.139 --> 30:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARRIET THOMPSON: Happiness,
just plain old
happiness. You know, yes, it
beats anything

30:14.680 --> 30:16.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
else. Beats television.

30:16.682 --> 30:22.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLENE BOYD: Boredom and
loneliness at sort
of the plagues of older adults.
There's nothing

30:22.354 --> 30:30.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more delightful than seeing
young children
with noise, with laughter. You
see the residents,

30:30.595 --> 30:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they hear the sound of the
kids coming
down the hall, and it's as
though sunlight

30:35.667 --> 30:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just came through the window.

30:37.569 --> 30:42.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARRIET THOMPSON: I'm a
great-great-grandmother,
but they're in another town. I
can't hold

30:42.107 --> 30:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my own little girl because she's
far away.
And so this is what makes me
happy. You get

30:48.146 --> 30:54.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to know them, and watch them,
and act silly
with them. And it's good to feel
like you're

30:55.053 --> 30:57.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
3 years old again.

30:57.122 --> 31:01.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Teachers see
similarities in the
ways these two very different
age groups communicate.

31:01.359 --> 31:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIE HOOVER: The brain of a
toddler, and
as somebody is beginning to
have, you know,

31:07.833 --> 31:15.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some signs of dementia, the
brains are similar,
and their development, or their
decline, is

31:15.307 --> 31:17.142 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
similar.

31:17.242 --> 31:21.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: That was apparent in
this art class,
where resident John Goss, a
retired surgeon,

31:21.246 --> 31:24.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and 5-year-old William Kraynek
(ph) teamed
up as painting partners.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN GOSS, Senior Citizen: This
is a junk
brush?

31:26.184 --> 31:26.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHILD: A giant.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN GOSS: Giant, yes.

31:28.787 --> 31:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's operating on my plain, and
I'm operating
on his plain, and so we have an
attachment.

31:38.196 --> 31:39.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He helped me, and we were
working together.

31:40.065 --> 31:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: I used blue, and he used
blue, and
I used green, and he used green.

31:46.071 --> 31:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN GOSS: It's wonderfully fun,
because things
come out of your hand, rather
than your mouth.

31:51.443 --> 31:56.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIE HOOVER: The kids are
certainly of that
age where this there isn't this
sense of,

31:56.648 --> 32:01.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oh, that's weird or something to
be scared
of, and I think that's happening
on both sides

32:01.753 --> 32:02.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the age.

32:02.387 --> 32:03.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: What's your name?

32:03.755 --> 32:05.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNIE CARTER, Senior Citizen:
Annie Carter.

32:05.690 --> 32:09.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Later the same day,
William Kraynek
visited the skilled nursing
section of The

32:09.895 --> 32:12.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mount to help make sandwiches
for the homeless.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILD: I had three sandwiches.

32:14.566 --> 32:16.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANNIE CARTER: Oh, I see.

32:16.434 --> 32:20.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: Here, William
partnered with 92-year-old
Annie Carter.

32:20.372 --> 32:26.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNIE CARTER: We just talk about
our work,
just like anybody else on a job.
That's our

32:26.411 --> 32:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job, so we have to do the right
thing.

32:29.881 --> 32:33.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: This is Alex.

32:33.251 --> 32:34.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hi, Alex.

32:34.920 --> 32:35.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: How you doing?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.589 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Hi.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: How do the children
deal with difficult
situations, like a resident that
might be

32:40.058 --> 32:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
declining or even death? How do
the children
deal with those situations?

32:43.895 --> 32:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIE HOOVER: Developmentally,
it's not really
something they can
conceptualize. Even our

32:49.334 --> 32:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oldest kids, at 5, kids don't
quite get that
whole death concept.

32:54.306 --> 32:59.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the kids bring that up to the
teachers,
then the teacher's response is
going to be,

32:59.344 --> 33:02.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I miss Mary too. What's your
favorite memory
about what she did?

33:02.981 --> 33:06.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those are the kinds of
things they're
going to focus in on, as opposed
to somebody

33:06.351 --> 33:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
died. They're just not quite
ready to get
that concept.

33:09.921 --> 33:15.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Child care at The
Mount is competitively
priced with similar high quality
preschools

33:16.027 --> 33:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the area. Currently, 400
families are on
the wait list.

33:21.399 --> 33:25.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Administrators believe The
Mount's model can
be replicated across the
country, and they

33:25.570 --> 33:30.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expect interest to peak this
summer, when
a documentary featuring their
work called

33:30.742 --> 33:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"Present Perfect" is released.

33:32.911 --> 33:39.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat
Wise in Seattle.

33:39.417 --> 33:47.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

33:47.993 --> 33:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
mining operation
that environmentalists say is
threatening

33:52.163 --> 33:54.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Land of 10,000 Lakes.

33:54.366 --> 33:58.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, we turn to our on
going series
Race Matters.

33:58.870 --> 34:03.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, documentary film
maker Ken Burns
received the nation's highest
honor for intellectual

34:03.441 --> 34:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
achievement in the humanities.
He delivered
the annual Jefferson Lecture at
the Kennedy

34:08.213 --> 34:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Center, his focus, race in
America.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here, he addresses recent
killings of young
African-Americans.

34:14.352 --> 34:19.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEN BURNS, Documentary
Filmmaker: Like the
amputated limb felt long after
it has been

34:19.391 --> 34:26.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cut off, I miss Trayvon Martin.
I was once
a 17-year-old who wore a hooded
sweatshirt

34:26.564 --> 34:32.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
walking through unfamiliar
neighborhoods,
but I was never gunned down.

34:32.203 --> 34:40.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I miss Tamir Rice too. I was 11
once and played
with plastic guns, but no cop
ever shot me.

34:40.946 --> 34:48.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are missing many hundreds, if
not thousands,
of African-Americans, lost only
because of

34:48.286 --> 34:57.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the color of their skin in just
the last decade.
Most of the occurrences we
documented in our

34:57.896 --> 35:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recent Jackie Robinson film, as
Brough (ph)
said -- he crossed the color
line, by the

35:02.033 --> 35:09.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, 69 years ago last month --
are happening
again in our present day:
Confederate Flag

35:09.140 --> 35:16.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues, driving while black,
stop and frisk,
burned black churches,
integrated suburban

35:16.781 --> 35:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
swimming pool problems, housing
bias, racial
taunts, cynical political
calculations that

35:24.189 --> 35:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ignore African-Americans, and a
version of
Black Lives Matter, to name just
a few.

35:33.064 --> 35:43.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do not believe, ladies and
gentlemen, there
is a hell, as most of our
religions reliably

35:43.375 --> 35:49.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
report, just the one we humans
make for ourselves
and each other right here.

35:49.414 --> 35:54.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now we
continue with "NewsHour"
special correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault's

35:54.152 --> 35:58.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ongoing look at solutions to
America's enduring
race problem.

35:58.456 --> 36:02.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, she talks with Reverend
David Billings
of the People's Institute for
Survival and

36:02.927 --> 36:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beyond, an organization that
assists other
groups trying to overcome racism
and its impact.

36:08.633 --> 36:13.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: We
caught up with
Reverend Billings at one of his
organization's

36:13.171 --> 36:18.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
workshops in New Orleans,
Louisiana, where
he and other trainers discuss
their work against

36:18.343 --> 36:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
racism there and around the
country.

36:20.478 --> 36:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We need to be continuing
to do this
organizing work.

36:22.881 --> 36:26.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: The
institute has
conducted over a half-million
workshops with

36:26.117 --> 36:31.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organizations and institutions
ranging from
hospitals, local and regional
government,

36:31.656 --> 36:38.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to prisons and churches, all
dealing with
how to identify and combat
racism.

36:38.229 --> 36:39.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reverend Billings, thank you for
joining us.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS, People's
Institute for
Survival and Beyond: Well, it's
my honor.

36:42.067 --> 36:44.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Your
organization
is over 30 years old, and it was
founded to

36:45.003 --> 36:49.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
combat racism, among other
things. How do
you define racism?

36:49.641 --> 36:54.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: We define
it as race
prejudice, plus power.

36:54.946 --> 36:59.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Individual racism, like how we
feel about
each other and what we might
call each other,

36:59.851 --> 37:05.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is just a byproduct of an
arrangement that
goes all the way back before the
nation's

37:05.623 --> 37:06.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
founding.

37:06.624 --> 37:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: What do
you mean?

37:08.493 --> 37:12.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: One of the
founders'
greatest fears was that poor
Europeans who'd

37:12.664 --> 37:17.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come over here as indentured,
there was a
great a fear that they would
join up with

37:18.002 --> 37:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Africans who were being
enslaved and indigenous
people and overthrow before they
even got

37:25.610 --> 37:27.312 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
started.

37:27.412 --> 37:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it would be the creation of
race that
will compromise poor and what we
today we'd

37:32.884 --> 37:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
call working-class whites. And
it makes us
hesitant, has always made us
hesitant to organize

37:41.860 --> 37:44.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with people of color, especially
black people.

37:44.996 --> 37:51.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This country constantly and
still does treats
racism as it were just a matter
of personal

37:52.003 --> 37:57.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationships. And it's not, you
know? That's
why so many of us who are white
can say, well,

37:57.976 --> 38:02.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not racist, you know, I have
got friends
who are black, all the sort of
things.

38:02.680 --> 38:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But
there were Civil
Rights Act, Voting Rights Act.
Didn't that

38:07.185 --> 38:08.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
change things a little bit?

38:09.087 --> 38:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: Oh, it
changed -- you
know, they had great impact, the
Voting Rights

38:11.890 --> 38:15.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Act and everything, but we have
to -- we are
fighting today to preserve it.

38:15.693 --> 38:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the People's Institute, I
will speak to
people that are white like me.
There's a bitterness,

38:25.970 --> 38:29.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there's an anger about equal
rights, you know?

38:29.140 --> 38:30.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You
experience that?
People tell you that?

38:30.975 --> 38:34.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.

38:34.312 --> 38:40.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When we first started, no
systems were asking
us to work with them. None of
the great systems

38:40.585 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like universities or hospitals
or health care
would even admit that racism was
an issue

38:47.192 --> 38:48.693 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for them.

38:48.793 --> 38:50.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Tell me
what you and
your organization are doing.

38:50.929 --> 38:58.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: We get
invited now to
be a part of symposiums, to be a
part of long-term

38:58.770 --> 39:07.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organizing effort within --
given large systems
to work with them for a period
of months,

39:07.111 --> 39:15.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even years, to analyze how race
and racism
is impacting their outcomes,
their work.

39:16.087 --> 39:25.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's taking off all around
the country.
We start off, usually, with a
small group

39:25.230 --> 39:32.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people within a larger system
who say,
we want to go through one of the
undoing racism

39:32.737 --> 39:41.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workshops, because the purpose
of the undoing
racism workshop is to eventually
be the foundation

39:41.613 --> 39:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a longer organizing effort
within the
institution, understanding
racism, its history,

39:50.188 --> 39:58.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, its impact today, and
how the nation
is as it changes, how the racism
begins to

39:58.997 --> 40:06.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resist the structural racism,
begins to resist
societal change.

40:06.271 --> 40:15.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do an ongoing community
organizing/undoing
racism workshop, because it
takes us a year

40:15.179 --> 40:22.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or two to cover, say, hundreds
of people in
the schools of social work of
New York City,

40:22.220 --> 40:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we work with every one of
them.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And you
find that
these people don't know about
race?

40:26.591 --> 40:27.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: Yes.

40:27.625 --> 40:29.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And what
do you find?

40:29.494 --> 40:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: What we
find is that
people understand race, but they
don't understand

40:35.133 --> 40:37.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organizing.

40:37.201 --> 40:42.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't teach racism away. A
lot of us think
you can. You can't legislate it
away, as important

40:42.140 --> 40:47.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the Voting Rights Act and
things like that
are. There's not one institution
in this country

40:48.012 --> 40:55.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they can say: There's no
racism here.
We have solved it.

40:55.219 --> 41:02.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I come out of the church. You
would think
the church would be in the lead
around tackling

41:03.027 --> 41:04.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
racism.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Are
white churches
doing what they should be doing?
I know we're

41:07.332 --> 41:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
generalizing, but in general?

41:09.200 --> 41:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: Very few.
Very few, maybe
less than there were a
generation ago.

41:13.504 --> 41:19.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: I think
just about
everybody agrees there's a very
toxic atmosphere

41:19.177 --> 41:23.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today. Are you getting more
people coming
to you or fewer?

41:23.981 --> 41:25.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: Yes, we are
getting more.

41:25.983 --> 41:32.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I -- I hear your question.
It's usually,
like, people will say, well,
you're speaking

41:32.990 --> 41:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the choir. And we say, yes,
but the choir
has to practice every Wednesday
night, you

41:38.796 --> 41:43.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know? That's what you got to do.
You got to
keep going at it.

41:43.134 --> 41:51.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we're to confront the
racism that is
out there in this country, we
have to -- to

41:51.309 --> 41:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have our act together. We have
got to know
what we are doing.

41:54.879 --> 41:58.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're hopeful. You have got to
stay hopeful
to do this work.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So,
what's the solution?

42:00.151 --> 42:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: You have
got to keep
the work going. You have got to
transfer it.

42:03.121 --> 42:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm other -- hopeful is that --
see, white
kids need to be taught very
early on. We have

42:10.461 --> 42:16.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to quit protecting white people,
even white
children, about the realities of
race in this

42:16.434 --> 42:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country. You know, children are
very conscious
and in tune with things being
fair. You will

42:24.108 --> 42:28.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hear, that's not fair. You know,
we're talking
a brother and sister.

42:28.179 --> 42:35.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, those children are --
could be -- you
know, will understand race. They
will understand

42:35.153 --> 42:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of these things. They are
not given the
opportunity because we protect
our children

42:41.259 --> 42:45.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as whites, you know, that that
will somehow
make them feel bad. I think
it'll make them

42:45.596 --> 42:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feel good, because it'll help
them explain
some things.

42:49.100 --> 42:51.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Reverend Billings,
thank you for joining us.

42:51.436 --> 42:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REV. DAVID BILLINGS: Thank you
for having
me.

42:53.504 --> 42:58.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You can see
more our Race
Matters reporting on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

42:58.876 --> 43:04.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, tune in later tonight. On
"Point Taken,"
they explore the question,
should the U.S.

43:04.382 --> 43:06.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pay reparations to
African-Americans?

43:06.551 --> 43:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We head now to
Northern Minnesota,
where new technology has renewed
a battle

43:21.966 --> 43:25.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over mining a vast mineral
deposit.

43:25.169 --> 43:32.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Iowa Public TV's program
"Market to Market,"
Joshua Buettner has the story.

43:32.910 --> 43:40.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSH BUETTNER: Last fall,
demonstrators pressured
Minnesota's Saint Louis County
Board to publicly

43:40.551 --> 43:47.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
acknowledge a proposed
copper-nickel sulfide
mine would threaten the health
of their local

43:47.158 --> 43:48.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
watershed.

43:48.860 --> 43:51.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: It's crazy to clean the
river, only
to allow it to be polluted
again.

43:51.762 --> 43:58.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Mining is less than 1
percent of Minnesota's
economy.

43:58.202 --> 44:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BUETTNER: Opponents allege
newly unearthed
sulfur-bearing rock will create
acid mine

44:03.608 --> 44:10.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drainage, diluting previous
efforts to restore
the Saint Louis River, a
waterway once crippled

44:10.414 --> 44:14.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by iron ore pollution.

44:14.151 --> 44:19.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 2008, applications to
conduct exploratory
drilling have surged in the Land
of 10,000

44:19.957 --> 44:26.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lakes. And Toronto, Canada-based
PolyMet Mining
Corporation is first in line to
unlock precious

44:26.130 --> 44:31.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
metals from the Duluth complex,
a vast mineral
deposit in the Arrowhead of
Minnesota.

44:31.969 --> 44:36.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mining proponents say geologists
have known
about the formation for over 60
years, but

44:36.974 --> 44:43.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
new technology will allow
excavation of four
billion tons of raw material
worth an estimated

44:43.347 --> 44:45.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$1 trillion.

44:45.249 --> 44:47.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATISHA GIETZEN, Director of
Public Affairs,
PolyMet: It's kind of a closed
loop system.

44:47.118 --> 44:50.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BUETTNER: Latisha Gietzen,
director of
public affairs for PolyMet, says
new mining

44:51.088 --> 44:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
techniques and rehabilitated
infrastructure
will mitigate past damages.

44:55.760 --> 44:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATISHA GIETZEN: Because we're
using a Legacy
site, we will actually be able
to clean up

44:59.797 --> 45:04.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the issues that are
currently going
on and bring modern technology
to the process.

45:04.969 --> 45:09.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BUETTNER: Additionally,
corporate officials
say any water released from
their proposed

45:09.206 --> 45:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NorthMet site will be treated to
meet state
and federal guidelines.

45:12.610 --> 45:21.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, for some, the mining
industry's track
record is suspect. A
well-established hub

45:21.786 --> 45:27.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for agriculture, forestry and
mining exports,
the Port of Duluth sits between
the contested

45:27.124 --> 45:33.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
estuary and Lake Superior. Ships
from North
America's furthest inland port
traditionally

45:33.264 --> 45:38.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transported taconite, a mineral
used to make
steel, to mills around the Great
Lakes Rust

45:39.036 --> 45:41.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Belt and the world.

45:41.539 --> 45:48.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The finite resource is mined
exclusively in
the state's Mesabi Iron Range.
In the 1980s,

45:48.713 --> 45:53.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two steel making facilities on
the banks of
the Saint Louis River became so
polluted,

45:53.351 --> 45:57.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they became qualified for EPA's
Superfund
program.

45:57.688 --> 46:02.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With corporate- and
taxpayer-funded cleanup
continuing today,
environmentalists such as

46:02.259 --> 46:04.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Aaron Klemm (ph) fear relapse.

46:04.395 --> 46:08.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: This river has been
designated as one
of the top 10 most endangered
rivers in the

46:08.733 --> 46:10.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

46:10.635 --> 46:13.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BUETTNER: Though the battle
is not over,
the Minnesota Department of
Natural Resources

46:13.738 --> 46:17.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently gave its final blessing
to the NorthMet
site.

46:17.408 --> 46:21.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Natural PolyMet's Latisha
Gietzen says the
company will comply with the new
mining requirements.

46:21.912 --> 46:26.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LATISHA GIETZEN: It has been
proven that we
can meet water quality
standards, both surface

46:26.884 --> 46:31.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and ground water, here at the
site. If we
can't show that through
environmental review

46:31.589 --> 46:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and permitting, we won't get a
permit to operate.

46:34.158 --> 46:38.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BUETTNER: PolyMet expects
to produce
3.6 billion pounds of copper
equivalent over

46:38.963 --> 46:40.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
20 years.

46:40.865 --> 46:47.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At 32,000 tons of ore per day,
that's a fraction
of the 100,000 tons of taconite
that once

46:47.672 --> 46:57.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rolled through daily. But the
bounty on precious
metals far outweighs that of
low-grade ores.

46:57.281 --> 47:03.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During a decade-long process,
PolyMet has
jumped through various state and
federal hoops

47:03.554 --> 47:07.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
described as the most stringent
in the world.

47:07.858 --> 47:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Project backers say copper and
nickel, chief
components in cell phones,
hybrid car batteries,

47:13.164 --> 47:18.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solar panels and wind turbines,
are essential
building blocks for a high-tech
clean-energy

47:18.135 --> 47:24.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future, a future some say the
U.S. should
secure now, before less
climate-minded competitors,

47:24.341 --> 47:30.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like China, are allowed to
dominate the market.

47:30.314 --> 47:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State senator David Tomassoni
backs the project
and says Minnesota's
environmental regulations

47:35.553 --> 47:37.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will protect its citizens.

47:37.221 --> 47:39.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID TOMASSONI, Minnesota State
Senator:
Minnesota's laws are the
strictest in the

47:39.623 --> 47:44.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country when it comes to the
environment.
And, plus, we live here. We live
here, we

47:44.895 --> 47:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play here, we drink the water,
we breathe
the air. We want this to be done
right, and

47:49.266 --> 47:51.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it will be done right.

47:51.202 --> 47:55.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BUETTNER: PolyMet predicts
roughly 1,000
direct and indirect jobs would
result from

47:55.272 --> 48:01.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its project, a forecast welcomed
with open
arms by some in a region sapped
by economic

48:01.679 --> 48:03.814 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
slump.

48:03.914 --> 48:08.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adding to layers of complexity,
the NorthMet
mine sits within territory ceded
to the government

48:08.686 --> 48:15.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Native Americans. In 1854,
the Lake Superior
Chippewa entered into a treaty,
giving the

48:16.093 --> 48:21.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. ownership of their lands in
exchange
for hunting, fishing and wild
rice harvesting

48:21.198 --> 48:25.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rights in perpetuity.

48:25.269 --> 48:29.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wild rice is sacred to area
tribes and protected
by law.

48:30.040 --> 48:33.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korey Northrup is a member of
the Lake Superior
Chippewa.

48:33.778 --> 48:38.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KOREY NORTHRUP, Lake Superior
Chippewa: My
main focus is making sure that
the wild rice

48:38.215 --> 48:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is protected. And we need to
understand that,
without water, there will be no
life, including

48:44.255 --> 48:45.489 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human life.

48:45.589 --> 48:47.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

48:47.158 --> 48:51.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOSH BUETTNER: PolyMet is
confident it will
meet standards for wild rice.

48:51.428 --> 48:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Senator David Tomassoni
says there has
to be a happy medium between all
parties.

48:55.633 --> 48:59.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID TOMASSONI: You worry about
the water,
you worry about the rice, but
you also worry

48:59.737 --> 49:01.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about the jobs and the
industries.

49:01.605 --> 49:06.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BUETTNER: Even though
various national
authorities have given the
go-ahead, those

49:06.110 --> 49:11.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opposed say corporate profits
and tax revenues
are the only thing PolyMet will
dig up.

49:11.482 --> 49:13.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Protect. Don't pollute.

49:13.350 --> 49:17.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BUETTNER: And the battle
over risks and
benefits will continue as rivals
work their

49:17.221 --> 49:21.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way through the scrutiny of
precious metals
development in Northern
Minnesota.

49:21.592 --> 49:24.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: That's what we want for our
Saint Louis
River.

49:24.361 --> 49:33.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BUETTNER: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Josh Buettner in Duluth,
Minnesota.

49:33.204 --> 49:42.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now for our
"NewsHour"
Shares, something that caught
our eye that

49:42.847 --> 49:45.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we thought might be of interest
to you, too.

49:45.316 --> 49:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this increasingly fast-paced
world, it
can sometimes be hard to
appreciate the beauty

49:50.321 --> 49:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and complexity of nature. But
one German research
team decided to slow things down
with high-speed

49:57.094 --> 50:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cameras in order to capture the
impressive
gymnastic feats of tree frogs.

50:03.200 --> 50:06.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
explains.

50:06.303 --> 50:13.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: The toe pads of
an Amazon milk
frog can hold up to 14 times the
animal's

50:13.878 --> 50:23.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
body weight. That's like an
average American
man holding a Honda Civic with
his toes.

50:23.120 --> 50:28.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amazon milk frogs live in the
trees of South
American rain forests. Like most
tree frogs,

50:28.893 --> 50:34.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have adhesive toe pads made
of hexagonal
cells and mucus that allow them
to cling to

50:34.765 --> 50:36.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
surfaces.

50:36.767 --> 50:40.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers at Kiel University
in Germany
found the frogs can swing from a
branch with

50:41.005 --> 50:47.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just one toe, which, when it
makes contact,
doesn't slip. The frogs then use
a variety

50:47.278 --> 50:50.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of acrobatic maneuvers to slow
their momentum.

50:51.081 --> 50:55.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Having multiple landing
techniques is important,
because missing your mark 30
feet up in the

50:55.753 --> 51:01.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
air could mean death for a tree
frog, though,
sometimes, a belly flop is still
the best

51:01.825 --> 51:02.993 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bet.

51:03.093 --> 51:05.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Julia Griffin.

51:05.629 --> 51:08.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We can all aspire
to do this.

51:08.232 --> 51:08.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:08.866 --> 51:09.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

51:09.767 --> 51:17.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have got an update for
you.

51:17.107 --> 51:26.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right. She was saying getting
old is a state
of mind. Now she's 91, "badly
crippled, but

51:26.884 --> 51:27.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I still feel like I'm 15."

51:27.851 --> 51:29.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then the question was...

51:29.687 --> 51:32.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is
91-year-old Flossie,
whom we featured on the program
the other

51:32.823 --> 51:34.558 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night.

51:34.658 --> 51:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes. And she
was asking
if, in fact, it was going to go
viral. And

51:36.794 --> 51:38.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it did go viral.

51:38.696 --> 51:41.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're pleased to report to you,
Flossie, and
everyone else, our Brief But
Spectacular take

51:41.932 --> 51:47.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from her has been viewed more

times on Facebook, proof that a
youthful spirit

51:47.638 --> 51:49.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is timeless, even on the
Internet.

51:49.106 --> 51:50.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Flossie Lewis,
you're a star.

51:50.874 --> 51:51.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

51:51.375 --> 51:53.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

51:53.210 --> 51:55.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also, on the

tonight online right now: A
classic American

51:55.279 --> 51:57.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

51:57.281 --> 52:02.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"The Scarlet Letter,"

52:09.493 --> 52:13.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, again, the
day's top stories.

52:13.597 --> 52:18.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two of the final states in the
presidential
primary season took their turn.
Democrat Bernie

52:18.736 --> 52:24.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders aimed to win in West
Virginia, but
Republican races in West
Virginia and Nebraska

52:24.641 --> 52:29.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were a formality, with Donald
Trump virtually
assured of the nomination. Towns
in Central

52:30.080 --> 52:36.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Southern Oklahoma began
cleaning up after
tornadoes on Monday that killed
two people

52:36.286 --> 52:41.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and tore up homes. And Wall
Street rallied,
with the Dow Industrials gaining
more than

52:41.725 --> 52:43.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
220 points.
