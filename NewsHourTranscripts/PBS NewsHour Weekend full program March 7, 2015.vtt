00:10.210 --> 00:11.078
>> Sreenivasan: ON THIS EDITION

00:11.078 --> 00:13.447
FOR SATURDAY MARCH, 7: 50 YEARS

00:13.447 --> 00:15.015
AFTER THE MARCHES IN SELMA, HOW

00:15.015 --> 00:16.416
THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT HAS SHAPED

00:16.416 --> 00:19.219
BOTH MODERN POLITICAL PARTIES;

00:19.219 --> 00:21.688
SUICIDE BOMBINGS ROCK NIGERIA;

00:21.688 --> 00:23.223
AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT, IT

00:23.223 --> 00:24.925
WAS THE FIRST STATE TO LEGALIZE

00:24.925 --> 00:27.060
ASSISTED SUICIDE NEARLY 20 YEARS

00:27.060 --> 00:27.828
AGO.

00:27.828 --> 00:28.762
>> I THOUGHT I HAD MORE TIME

00:28.762 --> 00:31.031
WITH HIM, BUT HE SAID TO ME,

00:31.031 --> 00:34.067
"PAM, I WANT TO TAKE IT ON

00:34.067 --> 00:35.435
FRIDAY OF THAT WEEK."

00:35.435 --> 00:36.436
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:36.436 --> 00:38.272
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.073
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS OF

00:40.073 --> 00:41.775
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:41.775 --> 00:43.377
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.211
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:44.211 --> 00:44.945
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.346
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS IN ALABAMA

00:46.346 --> 00:47.848
TODAY ALONG WITH ABOUT 100

00:47.848 --> 00:49.116
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND OTHER

00:49.116 --> 00:50.417
DIGNITARIES TO COMMEMORATE THE

00:50.417 --> 00:53.020
50th ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARCH ON

00:53.020 --> 00:53.687
SELMA.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.955
HE SPOKE AT THE EDMUND PETTUS

00:54.955 --> 00:56.156
BRIDGE, THE SITE WHERE POLICE

00:56.156 --> 00:57.791
AND STATE TROOPERS BEAT AND

00:57.791 --> 00:59.559
TEAR-GASSED PEACEFUL PROTESTERS

00:59.559 --> 01:01.228
DEMANDING VOTING RIGHTS.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.796
THAT INCIDENT SHOCKED THE NATION

01:02.796 --> 01:04.364
AND SPARKED THE PASSAGE OF THE

01:04.364 --> 01:06.867
1965 VOTING RIGHTS ACT.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.035
THE PRESIDENT TOUCHED ON VOTER

01:08.035 --> 01:09.670
APATHY, PROTESTS IN FERGUSON,

01:09.670 --> 01:11.705
AND THE HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE OF

01:11.705 --> 01:13.273
THE MARCH ON SELMA.

01:13.273 --> 01:14.074
>> THE AMERICANS WHO CROSSED

01:14.074 --> 01:15.442
THIS BRIDGE, THEY WERE NOT

01:15.442 --> 01:17.711
PHYSICALLY IMPOSING, BUT THEY

01:17.711 --> 01:21.615
GAVE COURAGE TO MILLIONS.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.851
THEY HELD NO ELECTED OFFICE, BUT

01:24.851 --> 01:26.353
THEY LED A NATION.

01:26.353 --> 01:30.057
BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID, THE

01:30.057 --> 01:31.758
DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY SWUNG OPEN

01:31.758 --> 01:33.593
NOT JUST FOR BLACK FOLKS, BUT

01:33.593 --> 01:36.563
FOR EVERY AMERICAN.

01:36.563 --> 01:37.597
WOMEN MARCHED THROUGH THOSE

01:37.597 --> 01:38.799
DOORS.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.000
LATINOS MARCHED THROUGH THOSE

01:40.000 --> 01:41.134
DOORS.

01:41.134 --> 01:43.603
ASIAN-AMERICANS, GAY AMERICANS,

01:43.603 --> 01:45.339
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES,

01:45.339 --> 01:46.740
THEY ALL CAME THROUGH THOSE

01:46.740 --> 01:47.841
DOORS.

01:47.841 --> 01:48.875
WHAT HAPPENED IN FERGUSON MAY

01:48.875 --> 01:50.143
NOT BE UNIQUE, BUT IT'S NO

01:50.143 --> 01:52.512
LONGER ENDEMIC OR SANCTIONED BY

01:52.512 --> 01:54.748
LAW AND CUSTOM; AND BEFORE THE

01:54.748 --> 01:56.183
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, IT MOST

01:56.183 --> 01:57.718
SURELY WAS.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.419
WHAT'S OUR EXCUSE TODAY FOR NOT

01:59.419 --> 02:01.922
VOTING?

02:01.922 --> 02:03.657
HOW DO WE SO CASUALLY DISCARD

02:03.657 --> 02:05.592
THE RIGHT FOR WHICH SO MANY

02:05.592 --> 02:08.095
FOUGHT?

02:08.095 --> 02:09.629
HOW DO WE SO FULLY GIVE AWAY OUR

02:09.629 --> 02:11.698
POWER, OUR VOICE, IN SHAPING

02:11.698 --> 02:12.833
AMERICA'S FUTURE?

02:12.833 --> 02:13.667
>> Sreenivasan: GEORGIA

02:13.667 --> 02:14.601
REPRESENTATIVE JOHN LEWIS

02:14.601 --> 02:15.535
INTRODUCED THE PRESIDENT.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.738
IN 1965, HE LED THE MARCH AND

02:17.738 --> 02:20.107
WAS BADLY INJURED IN THE CLASH.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.208
>> BECAUSE IN THE FINAL

02:21.208 --> 02:23.176
ANALYSIS, WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE

02:23.176 --> 02:24.945
FAMILY, THE HUMAN FAMILY.

02:24.945 --> 02:28.615
WE ALL LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE,

02:28.615 --> 02:29.950
AN AMERICAN HOUSE.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.218
>> Sreenivasan: SO, HOW MUCH DID

02:31.218 --> 02:32.586
THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT CHANGE THE

02:32.586 --> 02:33.954
POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OVER THE

02:33.954 --> 02:35.889
PAST 50 YEARS?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.157
JOINING US NOW FOR SOME INSIGHT

02:37.157 --> 02:38.291
JOHN HARWOOD, CHIEF WASHINGTON

02:38.291 --> 02:39.659
CORRESPONDENT FOR CNBC AND

02:39.659 --> 02:40.660
POLITICAL WRITER FOR THE "NEW

02:40.660 --> 02:41.061
YORK TIMES."

02:41.061 --> 02:42.429
SO, WE'VE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BIG

02:42.429 --> 02:43.897
PICTURE, THE MARCH THAT IS

02:43.897 --> 02:46.066
SEARED IN PEOPLE'S MINDS.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.067
WHAT KIND OF CHANGES HAPPENED

02:47.067 --> 02:48.201
SINCE THEN, ESPECIALLY FOR

02:48.201 --> 02:49.569
VOTING RIGHTS?

02:49.569 --> 02:51.071
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU'VE

02:51.071 --> 02:54.341
SEEN A COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF

02:54.341 --> 02:56.076
REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AMONG AFRICAN

02:56.076 --> 02:56.543
AMERICANS.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.412
THAT HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.513
RICHARD NIXON GOT ABOUT A THIRD

02:59.513 --> 03:01.615
OF THE BLACK VOTE IN 1960.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.450
BARRY GOLDWATER GOT 6%.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.484
REPUBLICANS HAVE NEVER

03:04.484 --> 03:05.752
APPROACHED THAT NIXON LEVEL

03:05.752 --> 03:07.454
SINCE.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.990
SECOND, YOU'VE HAD BLACKS AND

03:09.990 --> 03:11.625
NON-WHITES IN GENERAL, INCLUDING

03:11.625 --> 03:13.760
HISPANICS AND LATINOS, EXPAND AS

03:13.760 --> 03:15.595
A PROPORTION OF THE ELECTORATE.

03:15.595 --> 03:17.964
AND OVER TIME, THAT HAS WORKED

03:17.964 --> 03:18.732
TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE

03:18.732 --> 03:20.600
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.868
1964, WHEN LYNDON JOHNSON WAS

03:21.868 --> 03:23.770
RE-ELECTED, WHITES PROVIDED

03:23.770 --> 03:26.206
ABOUT 95% OF ALL THE VOTES CAST

03:26.206 --> 03:27.441
IN THE ELECTION.

03:27.441 --> 03:31.678
IN 2012, WHITES WERE ABOUT 72%,

03:31.678 --> 03:34.448
AND THAT GROWTH, GIVEN THE

03:34.448 --> 03:36.349
SHIFT OF WHITES TO VERY

03:36.349 --> 03:38.385
DOMINANT SUPPORT FOR THE

03:38.385 --> 03:41.154
REPUBLICAN PARTY, NON-WHITES FOR

03:41.154 --> 03:42.522
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HAS

03:42.522 --> 03:44.157
PRODUCED A RACIALLY POLARIZED

03:44.157 --> 03:45.559
ELECTORATE, BUT ONE THAT, GIVEN

03:45.559 --> 03:47.694
THE GROWTH OF NON-WHITES, HAS

03:47.694 --> 03:48.662
WORKED TO THE DEMOCRATS'

03:48.662 --> 03:49.563
ADVANTAGE IN PRESIDENTIAL

03:49.563 --> 03:50.363
ELECTIONS LATELY.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.364
>> Sreenivasan: THERE ARE

03:51.364 --> 03:52.399
DEMOCRATS AND SOME REPUBLICANS

03:52.399 --> 03:53.667
THAT WILL BE THERE TODAY OR

03:53.667 --> 03:55.435
THROUGH THE WEEKEND IN SELMA,

03:55.435 --> 03:56.870
BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY GO

03:56.870 --> 03:58.972
BACK TO WASHINGTON?

03:58.972 --> 03:59.673
>> WHEN THEY GO BACK TO

03:59.673 --> 04:00.607
WASHINGTON, THEY'RE GOING TO

04:00.607 --> 04:02.442
TAKE THE PLACES THAT THEY'VE

04:02.442 --> 04:03.844
BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IN THIS

04:03.844 --> 04:05.412
POLARIZED ENVIRONMENT THAT

04:05.412 --> 04:07.747
WE'RE... HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH

04:07.747 --> 04:08.648
FOR SOME TIME.

04:08.648 --> 04:09.749
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH IS

04:09.749 --> 04:12.552
GOING TO REPRESENT REPUBLICANS,

04:12.552 --> 04:13.553
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE REPUBLICAN

04:13.553 --> 04:15.689
LEADERS IN CONGRESS GOING DOWN.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.591
ALTHOUGH, INTERESTINGLY, SENATE

04:17.591 --> 04:19.526
MAJORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL

04:19.526 --> 04:22.062
HIMSELF WAS A SUPPORTER OF CIVIL

04:22.062 --> 04:24.097
RIGHTS AT THE TIME OF SELMA, AS

04:24.097 --> 04:26.733
WAS SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN

04:26.733 --> 04:28.168
POLITICIANS THAT HE WORKED FOR

04:28.168 --> 04:29.903
IN KENTUCKY AT THAT TIME.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.905
BUT WE'VE SEEN A PRETTY DRAMATIC

04:31.905 --> 04:34.241
SHIFT IN THE PARTY'S STANCE ON

04:34.241 --> 04:36.276
CIVIL RIGHTS-RELATED ISSUES.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.311
REPUBLICANS HAVE BECOME ALMOST

04:38.311 --> 04:40.614
ENTIRELY A CONSERVATIVE PARTY,

04:40.614 --> 04:42.949
DEMOCRATS LEFT OF CENTER, AND

04:42.949 --> 04:44.918
THAT IS THE... THOSE ARE THE

04:44.918 --> 04:47.020
CONTOURS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

04:47.020 --> 04:48.054
RESUME WHEN THEY GET BACK TO

04:48.054 --> 04:48.855
WASHINGTON.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.257
>> Sreenivasan: HOW HAVE SOME OF

04:50.257 --> 04:51.324
THE RECENT EVENTS-- THE 2013

04:51.324 --> 04:52.459
SUPREME COURT DECISION, AND THE

04:52.459 --> 04:54.327
VOTING RIGHTS AMENDMENT ACT THAT

04:54.327 --> 04:55.962
ARE TRYING TO WORK THEIR WAY

04:55.962 --> 04:57.030
THROUGH CONGRESS-- HOW ARE THEY

04:57.030 --> 04:58.598
IMPACTING THIS CONVERSATION?

04:58.598 --> 05:00.767
>> WELL, YOU'VE SEEN SOUTHERN

05:00.767 --> 05:03.303
STATES TRY TO GET OUT FROM UNDER

05:03.303 --> 05:05.038
THE AEGIS OF THE VOTING RIGHTS

05:05.038 --> 05:07.274
ACT, AND THEY'VE HAD SOME

05:07.274 --> 05:08.608
SUCCESS IN THE COURTS AT DOING

05:08.608 --> 05:10.810
THAT, REDUCING THE BURDEN OF

05:10.810 --> 05:12.512
PROOF ON SOUTHERN STATES TO

05:12.512 --> 05:14.281
JUSTIFY THEIR ELECTORAL

05:14.281 --> 05:16.550
ARRANGEMENTS AND PROCESSES.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.919
WHILE THAT'S GONE ON, YOU'VE HAD

05:18.919 --> 05:22.756
A REVERSAL IN THE MAKEUP OF

05:22.756 --> 05:24.624
LEGISLATURES AND ALSO

05:24.624 --> 05:25.659
CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATIONS FROM

05:25.659 --> 05:27.527
SOUTHERN STATES WHERE PRETTY

05:27.527 --> 05:29.296
MUCH ALL THE DEMOCRATS NOW ARE

05:29.296 --> 05:32.432
BLACK FROM SOUTHERN STATES, AND

05:32.432 --> 05:34.000
THERE ARE NO WHITE SOUTHERN

05:34.000 --> 05:36.102
DEMOCRATS LEFT IN THE CONGRESS.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.904
VERY FEW, IF ANY.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.839
AND THAT HAS CHANGED THE

05:39.839 --> 05:41.107
POLITICAL CONVERSATION.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.776
IT'S MADE THE SOUTH THE

05:42.776 --> 05:43.977
EPICENTER OF THE MODERN

05:43.977 --> 05:45.445
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.547
AND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES FOR

05:47.547 --> 05:49.149
REPUBLICANS GOING FORWARD IS

05:49.149 --> 05:50.450
TRYING TO BREAK OUT OF THAT

05:50.450 --> 05:52.552
BASE, EXPAND THEIR SUPPORT IN

05:52.552 --> 05:54.087
THE NORTHEAST AND THE MIDWEST,

05:54.087 --> 05:55.622
IF NOT THE PACIFIC COAST, WHICH

05:55.622 --> 05:57.891
IS VERY STRONGLY IN THE

05:57.891 --> 05:59.192
DEMOCRATS' FAVOR AT THE MOMENT.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.293
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, JOHN

06:00.293 --> 06:01.728
HARWOOD, JOINING US FROM

06:01.728 --> 06:02.529
WASHINGTON, D.C., THANKS SO

06:02.529 --> 06:03.430
MUCH.

06:03.430 --> 06:04.598
>> YOU BET.

06:04.598 --> 06:05.365
>> Sreenivasan: AN UNARMED TEEN

06:05.365 --> 06:06.666
WAS SHOT BY POLICE IN MADISON,

06:06.666 --> 06:08.101
WISCONSIN, LAST NIGHT, PROMPTING

06:08.101 --> 06:09.169
PROTESTS.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.437
19-YEAR-OLD TONY ROBINSON WAS

06:10.437 --> 06:12.239
SPOTTED JUMPING INTO TRAFFIC.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.207
THE POLICE CHIEF SAYS THE

06:14.207 --> 06:15.775
RESPONDING OFFICER FOLLOWED

06:15.775 --> 06:17.344
THE SUSPECT TO AN APARTMENT,

06:17.344 --> 06:18.111
HEARD A DISTURBANCE AND THEN

06:18.111 --> 06:18.945
FORCED HIS WAY INSIDE.

06:18.945 --> 06:19.980
THE TEEN REPORTEDLY ASSAULTED

06:19.980 --> 06:21.381
THE OFFICER, WHICH LED TO THE

06:21.381 --> 06:22.182
SHOOTING.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.583
ROBINSON HAD BEEN A SUSPECT IN A

06:23.583 --> 06:24.884
RECENT BATTERY CASE.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.486
MADISON MAYOR PAUL SOGLIN CALLED

06:26.486 --> 06:27.520
THE INCIDENT "A TRAGEDY BEYOND

06:27.520 --> 06:28.922
DESCRIPTION."

06:28.922 --> 06:30.023
STATE INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING

06:30.023 --> 06:31.124
INTO THE CASE.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.525
ANOTHER VEHICLE RECALL WAS JUST

06:32.525 --> 06:33.927
ANNOUNCED, THIS TIME FROM FIAT-

06:33.927 --> 06:34.661
CHRYSLER.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.196
THE COMPANY IS RECALLING MORE

06:36.196 --> 06:38.832
THAN 702,000 S.U.V.s AND

06:38.832 --> 06:40.333
MINIVANS TO FIX DEFECTIVE

06:40.333 --> 06:41.868
IGNITION SWITCHES.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.136
CERTAIN ROAD CONDITIONS COULD

06:43.136 --> 06:44.771
UNEXPECTEDLY TURN OFF THE

06:44.771 --> 06:47.340
ENGINE, DISABLING THE AIRBAGS,

06:47.340 --> 06:49.442
POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKES.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.111
THE RECALL COVERS CERTAIN MODELS

06:51.111 --> 06:53.179
OF THE DODGE GRAND CARAVAN, THE

06:53.179 --> 06:54.714
CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY

06:54.714 --> 06:56.816
MINIVAN, AND THE DODGE JOURNEY

06:56.816 --> 06:57.951
S.U.V.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.119
YOU CAN FIND THE SPECIFICS ON

06:59.119 --> 07:02.389
OUR WEB SITE, pbs.org/newshour.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.390
IN ARIZONA, FRIENDS AND FAMILY

07:03.390 --> 07:04.924
HELD A FINAL MEMORIAL SERVICE

07:04.924 --> 07:06.459
FOR THE 26-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN

07:06.459 --> 07:07.994
WOMAN KILLED AFTER BEING

07:07.994 --> 07:09.863

07:16.069 --> 07:17.737
ISIS LEADERS CLAIM SHE DIED IN A

07:17.737 --> 07:19.706
JORDANIAN AIR STRIKE, BUT U.S.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.641
OFFICIALS HAVE NOT YET CONFIRMED

07:21.641 --> 07:22.108
THAT.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.710
MUELLER IS THE FOURTH AMERICAN

07:23.710 --> 07:25.412
KILLED AFTER BEING TAKEN HOSTAGE

07:25.412 --> 07:26.946
BY ISIS FIGHTERS.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.581
AS MANY AS FIVE SEPARATE BOMB

07:28.581 --> 07:30.417
BLASTS REPORTEDLY KILLED AT

07:30.417 --> 07:32.786
LEAST 54 PEOPLE AND WOUNDED 143

07:32.786 --> 07:34.788
OTHERS IN NORTHEASTERN NIGERIA.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.122
SOME OF THE VICTIMS WERE

07:36.122 --> 07:36.956
CHILDREN.

07:36.956 --> 07:37.957
SUICIDE BOMBERS TARGETED A

07:37.957 --> 07:39.426
COUPLE OF CROWDED MARKETS AND A

07:39.426 --> 07:40.694
BUSY BUS STATION.

07:40.694 --> 07:41.895
A CAR BOMB WENT OFF AT A

07:41.895 --> 07:43.430
MILITARY CHECKPOINT.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.364
FOR THE LATEST, WE'RE JOINED VIA

07:44.364 --> 07:46.132
SKYPE BY NIGERIAN BUREAU CHIEF

07:46.132 --> 07:47.167
WITH THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,

07:47.167 --> 07:47.901
MICHELLE FAUL.

07:47.901 --> 07:48.601
SO, WHAT YOU CAN TELL US ABOUT

07:48.601 --> 07:50.203
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

07:50.203 --> 07:51.638
>> WE'RE TOLD BY THE POLICE THAT

07:51.638 --> 07:53.707
AT LEAST 54 PEOPLE WERE KILLED

07:53.707 --> 07:58.078
AND ANOTHER 143 ARE IN HOSPITALS

07:58.078 --> 07:59.713
IN MAIDUGURI.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.814
>> Sreenivasan: AND THIS IS IN

08:00.814 --> 08:04.117
THE CONTEXT OF ADVANCES THAT THE

08:04.117 --> 08:05.285
NIGERIAN MILITARY SEEMS TO BE

08:05.285 --> 08:06.753
MAKING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

08:06.753 --> 08:08.688
STATE AGAINST BOKO HARAM, RIGHT?

08:08.688 --> 08:10.790
>> THE NIGERIAN MILITARY AND

08:10.790 --> 08:13.593
CHADDIAN TROOPS WHO... THE

08:13.593 --> 08:14.961
CHADDIANS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

08:14.961 --> 08:19.466
LEADING THIS MULTINATIONAL

08:19.466 --> 08:21.935
EFFORT TO WREST TOWNS AND

08:21.935 --> 08:23.203
VILLAGES BACK FROM BOKO HARAM.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.238
AND BOKO HARAM'S WAY OF DEALING

08:25.238 --> 08:27.374
WITH THIS HAS BEEN WITH MANY

08:27.374 --> 08:29.409
MORE SUICIDE BOMBINGS AND

08:29.409 --> 08:32.112
ATTACKS ON REMOTE VILLAGES.

08:32.112 --> 08:37.050
NOW, MAIDUGURI IS THE BIRTHPLACE

08:37.050 --> 08:39.085
OF BOKO HARAM.

08:39.085 --> 08:41.154
IT'S THE CITY WHERE BOKO HARAM

08:41.154 --> 08:44.257
WOULD LIKE TO FORM AN ISLAMIC

08:44.257 --> 08:46.326
CALIPHATE, WITH MAIDUGURI AS THE

08:46.326 --> 08:46.993
CAPITAL.

08:46.993 --> 08:49.129
SO, IT HAS GREAT SIGNIFICANCE

08:49.129 --> 08:52.065
FOR THE ISLAMIC UPRISING.

08:52.065 --> 08:52.999
>> Sreenivasan: AND OVER THE

08:52.999 --> 08:54.434
PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS OR MONTHS,

08:54.434 --> 08:55.735
WE'VE ALSO UNFORTUNATELY HAD

08:55.735 --> 08:56.770
TO REPORT THAT SOME OF THESE

08:56.770 --> 08:59.472
SUICIDE BOMBERS ARE YOUNG GIRLS

08:59.472 --> 09:00.640
OR EVEN WOMEN.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.075
>> GIRLS AS YOUNG AS TEN YEARS

09:02.075 --> 09:04.644
OLD, WE'VE BEEN TOLD.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.347
ONE OF THEM, A TEN-YEAR-OLD, SO

09:07.347 --> 09:09.649
SHE APPEARED TO WITNESSES, WAS

09:09.649 --> 09:11.184
RESPONSIBLE FOR BOMBING A MARKET

09:11.184 --> 09:14.220
IN MAIDUGURI JUST LAST MONTH.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.290
THERE ARE FEARS THAT THE WOMEN

09:17.290 --> 09:18.658
THAT ARE BEING USED AND THE

09:18.658 --> 09:20.093
GIRLS THAT ARE BEING USED IN

09:20.093 --> 09:22.529
THESE ATTACKS MAY BE KIDNAP

09:22.529 --> 09:23.530
VICTIMS.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.564
AS YOU KNOW, BOKO HARAM HAS

09:24.564 --> 09:27.634
KIDNAPPED HUNDREDS OF YOUNG

09:27.634 --> 09:30.770
WOMEN, GIRLS, BOYS, YOUNG MEN.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.572
NOBODY KNOWS HOW MANY.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.274
I THINK THE MOST FAMOUS ONE

09:34.274 --> 09:36.910
YOU'LL REMEMBER WERE NEARLY 300

09:36.910 --> 09:39.078
GIRLS FROM A SCHOOL IN CHIBOK.

09:39.078 --> 09:39.879
>> Sreenivasan: AND WHERE IS

09:39.879 --> 09:41.915
NIGERIAN PUBLIC OPINION ON THIS

09:41.915 --> 09:42.916
NOW?

09:42.916 --> 09:44.484
>> NIGERIAN PUBLIC OPINION IS

09:44.484 --> 09:46.753
VERY MIXED.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.621
I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE VERY

09:48.621 --> 09:50.390
UPSET WITH PRESIDENT GOODLUCK

09:50.390 --> 09:53.927
JONATHAN'S FAILURE TO CURTAIL

09:53.927 --> 09:56.596
THIS UPRISING.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.498
AND WE HAVE PRESIDENTIAL

09:58.498 --> 10:01.501
ELECTIONS COMING UP ON MARCH 28,

10:01.501 --> 10:03.203
A VERY IMPORTANT ELECTION FOR

10:03.203 --> 10:05.338
PRESIDENT JONATHAN, WHO WANTS TO

10:05.338 --> 10:06.706
BE RE-ELECTED.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.575
BUT WE'RE TOLD BY ANALYSTS THAT

10:08.575 --> 10:10.577
THIS IS SO CLOSE THAT IT IS TOO

10:10.577 --> 10:11.678
CLOSE TO CALL.

10:11.678 --> 10:12.512
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

10:12.512 --> 10:13.546
MICHELLE FAUL, NIGERIAN BUREAU

10:13.546 --> 10:14.681
CHIEF OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

10:14.681 --> 10:16.015
JOINING US VIA SKYPE, THANKS SO

10:16.015 --> 10:17.383
MUCH.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.185
>> YOU'RE MOST WELCOME.

10:19.185 --> 10:19.819
>> Sreenivasan: RUSSIAN

10:19.819 --> 10:20.954
INVESTIGATORS HAVE DETAINED TWO

10:20.954 --> 10:22.622
SUSPECTS IN THE MURDER OF ONE OF

10:22.622 --> 10:23.857
VLADIMIR PUTIN'S MOST VOCAL

10:23.857 --> 10:25.758
CRITICS, BORIS NEMTSOV.

10:25.758 --> 10:26.893
SECURITY OFFICERS ARE NOT

10:26.893 --> 10:28.595
COMMENTING ON HOW THE TWO MEN

10:28.595 --> 10:29.929
MAY BE LINKED TO LAST MONTH'S

10:29.929 --> 10:31.130
ASSASSINATION OUTSIDE THE

10:31.130 --> 10:31.631
KREMLIN.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.533
ACCORDING TO ONE UNIDENTIFIED

10:33.533 --> 10:34.968
SOURCE, INVESTIGATORS TRACED THE

10:34.968 --> 10:36.302
SUSPECTS THROUGH CELL PHONE

10:36.302 --> 10:38.338
ACTIVITY AND D.N.A. EVIDENCE IN

10:38.338 --> 10:39.806
THE GETAWAY CAR.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.040
NEMTSOV'S POLITICAL ALLIES ARE

10:41.040 --> 10:42.675
REPORTEDLY SKEPTICAL OF THE

10:42.675 --> 10:44.110
INVESTIGATION AND SUSPECT

10:44.110 --> 10:45.879
RUSSIAN LEADERS WERE INVOLVED IN

10:45.879 --> 10:46.846
THE SHOOTING.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.982
THE KREMLIN DENIES INVOLVEMENT

10:48.982 --> 10:50.450
IN THE MURDER.

11:00.460 --> 11:01.694
>> Sreenivasan: THIS TIME OF

11:01.694 --> 11:02.462
YEAR, MANY PUBLIC TELEVISION

11:02.462 --> 11:03.530
STATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY TAKE

11:03.530 --> 11:05.231
TIME OUT TO ASK FOR YOUR

11:05.231 --> 11:06.099

11:06.099 --> 11:07.333
WITH THAT IN MIND, WE ARE TAKING

RECENT MONTHS.

11:12.438 --> 11:13.540
TONIGHT, WE RETURN TO THE ISSUE

11:13.540 --> 11:14.908
OF ASSISTED SUICIDE.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.709
THE DEBATE OVER ASSISTED SUICIDE

11:16.709 --> 11:18.311
HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN THIS COUNTRY

11:18.311 --> 11:20.780
FOR DECADES BUT RESURFACED LAST

11:20.780 --> 11:22.215
FALL AFTER A YOUNG CALIFORNIA

11:22.215 --> 11:24.083
WOMAN WITH BRAIN CANCER BECAME

11:24.083 --> 11:25.652
THE SUBJECT OF A NATIONAL

11:55.315 --> 11:56.516
I STUDIED, ESPECIALLY THE LAST

11:56.516 --> 11:58.217
TIME I SAW THAT VIDEO.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.852
I DON'T THINK I LEFT HER EYES.

11:59.852 --> 12:00.820

12:23.343 --> 12:24.944
HER OWN LIFE IN NOVEMBER, WAS

12:24.944 --> 12:26.713
FEATURED IN A MEDIA CAMPAIGN BY

12:26.713 --> 12:28.281
A GROUP CALLED COMPASSION AND

12:28.281 --> 12:29.282
CHOICES.

12:29.282 --> 12:30.650
20 YEARS EARLIER, ITS

12:30.650 --> 12:32.418
PREDECESSOR GROUP PLAYED A KEY

12:42.495 --> 12:44.063
DEATH WITH DIGNITY ACT.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.665
SO, YOU VOTED FOR IT, BUT YOU

12:45.665 --> 12:47.266
NEVER THOUGHT, "THIS HAS TO DO

12:47.266 --> 12:48.134
WITH ME."

12:48.134 --> 12:49.235
>> NO, NO.

12:49.235 --> 12:51.504
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE OUT OF

12:51.504 --> 12:52.805
COMPASSION.

12:52.805 --> 12:54.207
THE IDEA THAT, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE

12:54.207 --> 12:55.842
GETS IN THIS SITUATION, THEY

DESERVE A RIGHT, YOU KNOW, TO

IN 2012, THE GROUP CONNECTED

14:49.789 --> 14:51.891
THEM WITH TWO DOCTORS WHO SIGNED

14:51.891 --> 14:53.659
OFF ON BEN'S WISHES.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.328
>> MONDAY, BEN GOT THE ORDER FOR

14:55.328 --> 14:58.397
THE PRESCRIPTION, SO IT MEANT WE

14:58.397 --> 15:01.601
COULD PICK IT UP ON WEDNESDAY.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.469
AND I THOUGHT, AT THAT POINT, WE

15:03.469 --> 15:06.706
WOULD HAVE IT, AND THEN WE WOULD

15:06.706 --> 15:07.874
JUST KIND OF SEE.

15:07.874 --> 15:08.674
I THOUGHT I HAD MORE TIME WITH

15:08.674 --> 15:11.210
HIM.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.247
BUT HE SAID TO ME, "PAM, I WANT

15:14.247 --> 15:15.548
TO TAKE IT ON FRIDAY OF THAT

15:15.548 --> 15:16.749
WEEK."

15:16.749 --> 15:18.484
>> Reporter: PORTLAND PHYSICIAN

15:18.484 --> 15:20.386
BILL TOFFLER ALSO FOLLOWED THE

15:20.386 --> 15:21.888
CASE OF BRITTANY MAYNARD;

15:21.888 --> 15:23.356
BRITTANY'S STORY STRUCK A CHORD

15:23.356 --> 15:25.057
WITH HIM, TOO.

15:25.057 --> 15:27.026
TOFFLER'S WIFE OF 40 YEARS WAS

15:27.026 --> 15:30.263
DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER IN 2009.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.430
>> WE WERE BLESSED WITH FIVE

15:31.430 --> 15:32.932
YEARS AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS WAS

15:32.932 --> 15:35.234
MADE, AND SHE DIED JUST FOUR AND

15:35.234 --> 15:36.369
A HALF MONTHS AGO.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.037
>> Reporter: FOR DR. TOFFLER AND

15:38.037 --> 15:40.273
HIS WIFE, ASSISTED SUICIDE WAS

15:40.273 --> 15:41.607
NEVER AN OPTION.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.643
HE LEADS A GROUP, PHYSICIANS FOR

15:43.643 --> 15:45.378
COMPASSIONATE CARE EDUCATION

15:45.378 --> 15:47.380
FOUNDATION, THAT OPPOSES

15:47.380 --> 15:49.182
PRESCRIBING LETHAL DRUGS TO

15:49.182 --> 15:51.017
TERMINAL PATIENTS.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.151
>> EVERY DAY WE LIVED

15:52.151 --> 15:54.287
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT

15:54.287 --> 15:55.521
WE HAD A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME

15:55.521 --> 15:57.056
IN A WAY THAT I NEVER PERCEIVED

15:57.056 --> 15:59.091
BEFORE I HAD A WIFE WITH THAT

15:59.091 --> 16:01.627
CLEAR DIAGNOSIS.

16:01.627 --> 16:02.495
AND I'D HOPE THAT PATIENTS

16:02.495 --> 16:04.096
RECOGNIZE THAT I VALUE THEM AS A

16:04.096 --> 16:05.765
DOCTOR REGARDLESS OF HOW

16:05.765 --> 16:07.400
DISABLED THEY ARE, REGARDLESS OF

16:07.400 --> 16:08.935
HOW SICK THEY ARE, THAT THEIR

16:08.935 --> 16:10.036
LIFE STILL HAS MEANING AND

16:10.036 --> 16:10.603
VALUE.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.938
AND I WANT TO REFLECT THAT EVEN

16:11.938 --> 16:13.239
WHEN THEY DON'T SEE IT

16:13.239 --> 16:14.173
THEMSELVES.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.208
>> Reporter: BUT WHAT ABOUT THE

16:15.208 --> 16:17.310
FEAR AND THE PAIN THAT CAN

16:17.310 --> 16:18.778
SURROUND DYING?

16:18.778 --> 16:19.946
WHY NOT HELP, I ASKED DR.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.415
TOFFLER, IF A PATIENT ASKS?

16:22.415 --> 16:24.183
>> IT IS A VERY SCARY TIME.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.384
AND AT THAT TIME, I WANT TO COME

16:25.384 --> 16:26.152
AROUND THE PERSON.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.353
I WANT TO WALK ALONGSIDE THEM.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.521
I WANT TO BE THE BEST DOCTOR I

16:28.521 --> 16:29.121
CAN BE.

16:29.121 --> 16:29.989
I'M CALLED TO BE MORE OF A

16:29.989 --> 16:31.958
DOCTOR THAN EVER.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.492
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THE

16:33.492 --> 16:34.927
PERSON WHO HELPS HER TO KILL

16:34.927 --> 16:35.661
HERSELF.

16:35.661 --> 16:36.963
THAT'S ALL TOO EASY.

16:36.963 --> 16:37.697
>> Reporter: IN A POLICY

16:37.697 --> 16:39.332
OPINION, THE AMERICAN MEDICAL

16:39.332 --> 16:41.200
ASSOCIATION SAYS "PHYSICIAN-

16:41.200 --> 16:42.802
ASSISTED SUICIDE IS

16:42.802 --> 16:45.104
FUNDAMENTALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH

16:45.104 --> 16:47.373
THE PHYSICIAN'S ROLE AS HEALER."

16:47.373 --> 16:48.674
AND SOME RELIGIOUS GROUPS, MOST

16:48.674 --> 16:50.042
NOTABLY THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF

16:50.042 --> 16:52.044
CATHOLIC BISHOPS, HAVE STRONGLY

16:52.044 --> 16:54.447
OPPOSED THE PRACTICE.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.648
ACCORDING TO THE GALLUP POLLING

16:55.648 --> 16:57.583
ORGANIZATION, A SLIM MAJORITY OF

16:57.583 --> 16:59.719
AMERICANS SUPPORTS ASSISTED

16:59.719 --> 17:01.220
SUICIDE.

17:01.220 --> 17:02.622
IT'S ONLY LEGAL IN OREGON,

17:02.622 --> 17:04.624
WASHINGTON AND VERMONT.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.025
BUT SINCE BRITTANY MAYNARD'S

17:06.025 --> 17:07.593
DEATH, DOZENS OF STATES HAVE

17:07.593 --> 17:10.029
INTRODUCED OR ARE RECONSIDERING

17:10.029 --> 17:12.598
DEATH WITH DIGNITY LEGISLATION.

17:12.598 --> 17:13.866
AND ADVOCATES HAVE MADE PROGRESS

17:13.866 --> 17:15.234
IN THE COURTS.

17:15.234 --> 17:16.636
DECISIONS IN MONTANA AND NEW

17:16.636 --> 17:18.437
MEXICO HAVE OPENED THE DOOR TO

17:18.437 --> 17:19.805
ASSISTED DYING.

17:19.805 --> 17:21.240
LAST MONTH, PLAINTIFFS FILED

17:21.240 --> 17:22.775
SUIT TO ALLOW THE PRACTICE IN

17:22.775 --> 17:24.911
CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK, AND

17:24.911 --> 17:26.679
CANADA'S SUPREME COURT STRUCK

17:26.679 --> 17:28.281
DOWN THAT COUNTRY'S NATIONAL BAN

17:28.281 --> 17:30.016
ON ASSISTED DYING.

17:30.016 --> 17:32.018
BIOETHICIST ARTHUR CAPLAN, WHO

17:32.018 --> 17:33.953
WAS AN OPPONENT OF THE PRACTICE

17:33.953 --> 17:35.755
BUT NOW SUPPORTS IT, SAYS THE

17:35.755 --> 17:37.290
TERMS OF THE DEBATE HAVEN'T

17:37.290 --> 17:39.158
REALLY CHANGED OVER THE PAST 20

17:39.158 --> 17:40.960
YEARS, EVEN WITH THE PUBLICITY

17:40.960 --> 17:42.561
SURROUNDING BRITTANY MAYNARD'S

17:42.561 --> 17:43.596
CASE.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.531
WE SPOKE TO HIM BEFORE MAYNARD

17:45.531 --> 17:47.133
DIED LATE LAST YEAR.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.567
>> I THINK WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN

17:48.567 --> 17:50.469
THIS DEBATE IS THAT BRITTANY

17:50.469 --> 17:53.439
MAYNARD IS 29, ATTRACTIVE,

17:53.439 --> 17:56.142
ARTICULATE, ALMOST PASSIONATE

17:56.142 --> 17:58.978
ABOUT HER RIGHT TO CHOOSE HERE.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.980
THAT'S MAKING THE DEBATE FOCUS

18:00.980 --> 18:02.481
FOR A GROUP THAT DIDN'T PAY

18:02.481 --> 18:04.717
ATTENTION, YOUNGER PEOPLE.

18:04.717 --> 18:05.718
>> Reporter: CAPLAN SAYS FEARS

18:05.718 --> 18:07.053
OF FIGURES LIKE DR. JACK

18:07.053 --> 18:09.288
KEVORKIAN HELPED DERAIL THE

18:09.288 --> 18:10.489
RIGHT-TO-DIE MOVEMENT IN THE

18:10.489 --> 18:12.925
1990S AND THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN

18:12.925 --> 18:14.360
END-OF-LIFE CARE HAVE EASED

18:14.360 --> 18:16.095
AMERICANS' CONCERNS OVER

18:16.095 --> 18:17.663
SUFFERING AT DEATH.

18:17.663 --> 18:19.465
>> I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU THE

18:19.465 --> 18:20.933
AMOUNT OF RELIEF THAT IT

18:20.933 --> 18:21.834
PROVIDES ME.

18:21.834 --> 18:22.535
>> Reporter: BUT HE SAYS

18:22.535 --> 18:23.970
BRITTANY MAYNARD'S CASE MAY

18:23.970 --> 18:25.304
PROVIDE NEW MOMENTUM FOR

18:25.304 --> 18:27.773
SUPPORTERS OF ASSISTED SUICIDE.

18:27.773 --> 18:28.841
>> I THINK SHE'S SHIFTING THE

18:28.841 --> 18:30.676
POLITICS IN A WAY THAT WE MAY

18:30.676 --> 18:33.012
SEE SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO GOT

18:33.012 --> 18:35.381
TIED UP IN, SAY, TRYING TO

18:35.381 --> 18:37.583
BROADEN MARRIAGE LAWS AND TRYING

18:37.583 --> 18:40.252
TO SEE HOMOSEXUALITY GAIN WIDER

18:40.252 --> 18:42.722
ACCEPTANCE MOVE TO SAY "THIS IS

18:42.722 --> 18:43.689
A CHOICE I WANT.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.358
THIS IS SOMETHING I CARE ABOUT

18:45.358 --> 18:46.625
BECAUSE IT'S HER."

18:46.625 --> 18:49.295
>> Reporter: ON MAY 4, 2012, PAM

18:49.295 --> 18:50.796
AND BEN WALD GATHERED THEIR

18:50.796 --> 18:52.098
CLOSEST FRIENDS IN THE LIVING

18:52.098 --> 18:53.165
ROOM.

18:53.165 --> 18:54.867
THEY SANG SONGS TOGETHER, AND,

18:54.867 --> 18:56.335
AFTERWARD, IN THE BEDROOM THEY

18:56.335 --> 18:58.270
SHARED, PAM HANDED BEN THE

18:58.270 --> 18:59.472
MEDICATION THAT WOULD END HIS

18:59.472 --> 19:00.673
LIFE.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.908
HE TOOK IT WITHOUT HESITATING.

19:02.908 --> 19:03.676
>> EARLY ON, WHEN I GOT TOGETHER

19:03.676 --> 19:05.111
WITH MY HUSBAND AND WE WERE

19:05.111 --> 19:06.812
FIRST TOGETHER, WE'D BE LAYING

19:06.812 --> 19:07.947
IN BED TOGETHER, AND HE WAS

19:07.947 --> 19:09.281
THINKING, HE'D GO LIKE THIS WITH

19:09.281 --> 19:10.916
HIS HANDS.

19:10.916 --> 19:11.751
HIS HANDS WERE ALWAYS MOVING.

19:11.751 --> 19:12.852
IT'S KIND OF LIKE, IT'S WHEN HE

19:12.852 --> 19:13.853
WAS THINKING KIND OF THING AND

19:13.853 --> 19:14.653
EVERYTHING.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.756
BUT WHAT I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN IS

19:16.756 --> 19:18.257
HIS HANDS WERE LIKE THIS ON HIS

19:18.257 --> 19:21.360
CHEST, AND I HELD MY HANDS ON

19:21.360 --> 19:24.997
TOP OF HIS.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.365
BUT HIS HANDS NEVER WENT LIKE

19:26.365 --> 19:27.633
THAT, AND THEY JUST STAYED

19:27.633 --> 19:30.536
BECAUSE HE WAS JUST AT PEACE.

19:30.536 --> 19:35.541
AND HIS LAST WORDS WERE "THANK

19:35.541 --> 19:36.842
YOU."

19:39.845 --> 19:43.849
AND HE DIED IN TWO HOURS.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.087
>> Reporter: BEN WALD WAS 75

19:48.087 --> 19:50.222
YEARS OLD.

19:50.222 --> 19:52.091
SO, WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM

19:52.091 --> 19:55.094
OREGON'S EXPERIENCE?

19:55.094 --> 19:56.095
KATRINA HEDBERG OF THE STATE

19:56.095 --> 19:58.097
HEALTH AUTHORITY, WHO'S NEUTRAL

19:58.097 --> 19:59.899
ON THE ISSUE, TRACKS STATISTICS

19:59.899 --> 20:01.834
ON OREGON'S DEATH WITH DIGNITY

20:01.834 --> 20:02.935
LAW.

20:02.935 --> 20:03.869
>> INITIALLY, THERE WERE A

20:03.869 --> 20:04.970
NUMBER OF CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE

20:04.970 --> 20:07.873
HAD AROUND, WOULD THIS BE

20:07.873 --> 20:10.409
DISPROPORTIONATELY USED BY

20:10.409 --> 20:12.378
PEOPLE WHO WERE DISENFRANCHISED?

20:12.378 --> 20:14.413
SO, UNEDUCATED OR PEOPLE WHO

20:14.413 --> 20:16.115
MIGHT HAVE HAD DISABILITIES OR

20:16.115 --> 20:17.349
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

20:17.349 --> 20:18.584
AND WE'VE REALLY FOUND THAT THE

20:18.584 --> 20:20.286
PEOPLE WHO ARE PARTICIPATING ARE

20:20.286 --> 20:22.288
PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO

20:22.288 --> 20:23.923
CONTROL THE TIMING AND MANNER

20:23.923 --> 20:25.424
SURROUNDING THEIR DEATH.

20:25.424 --> 20:26.459
>> Reporter: STILL, DR. TOFFLER

20:26.459 --> 20:28.327
SAYS THOSE FINAL MONTHS AND DAYS

20:28.327 --> 20:30.529
SHOULD NEVER BE CUT SHORT, AS HE

20:30.529 --> 20:31.964
LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE WITH HIS

20:31.964 --> 20:33.232
OWN WIFE.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.934
>> WE WERE MARRIED FOR 40 YEARS,

20:34.934 --> 20:36.802
AND, IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, I

20:36.802 --> 20:38.337
THINK WE HAD THE BEST YEARS OF

20:38.337 --> 20:39.805
OUR LIFE WHEN SHE ACTUALLY HAD A

20:39.805 --> 20:41.173
TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS.

20:41.173 --> 20:44.143
AND I... I WOULDN'T TRADE THOSE

20:44.143 --> 20:46.178
FIVE YEARS FOR ANYTHING.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.346
>> Reporter: AS FOR PAM, SHE'S

20:47.346 --> 20:49.048
NOW VOLUNTEERING FOR COMPASSION

20:49.048 --> 20:50.716
AND CHOICES, GUIDING OTHER

20:50.716 --> 20:52.151
FAMILIES THROUGH A PROCESS SHE

20:52.151 --> 20:54.887
NOW KNOWS FIRSTHAND.

20:54.887 --> 20:55.921
>> NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT

20:55.921 --> 20:59.158
DYING AND DEATH, BUT ONCE WE GET

20:59.158 --> 21:03.262
INTO THAT, IT REALLY BECOMES AN

21:03.262 --> 21:04.730
ACT OF LOVE.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.332
IT REALLY DOES.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.068
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT'S THE STATE

21:09.068 --> 21:10.569
OF ASSISTED SUICIDE LAWS ACROSS

21:10.569 --> 21:11.871
THE UNITED STATES?

21:11.871 --> 21:14.773
VISIT www.pbs.org/newshour.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.312
FINALLY TONIGHT, A PAIR OF

21:20.312 --> 21:21.580
HOODED GUNMEN KILLED FIVE

21:21.580 --> 21:22.515
PEOPLE, INCLUDING A FRENCH

21:22.515 --> 21:24.049
CITIZEN AND A BELGIUM SECURITY

21:24.049 --> 21:26.185
WORKER IN AN ATTACK IN MALI.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.453
TWO SWISS SOLDIERS WERE

21:27.453 --> 21:28.621
CRITICALLY INJURED AND A PAIR OF

21:28.621 --> 21:31.023
U.N. EXPERTS WERE ALSO WOUNDED.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.358
NIGERIA'S MILITANT ISLAMIC

21:38.631 --> 21:39.932
BOKO HARAM HAS DEPLOYED SUICIDE

21:39.932 --> 21:41.300
BOMBERS AND ORGANIZED MASS

21:41.300 --> 21:42.601
KIDNAPPINGS OVER THE PAST SIX

21:47.873 --> 21:49.408
ON THE WAY TO SELMA, ALABAMA

21:49.408 --> 21:50.843
TODAY, PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNED
