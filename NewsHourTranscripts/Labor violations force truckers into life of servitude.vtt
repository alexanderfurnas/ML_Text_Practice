TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

00:35.668 --> 00:36.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE TRUCKERS?

00:36.603 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE COMPANIES FOUND A

00:38.505 --> 00:41.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOPHOLE IN THE LABOR LAW.

00:41.141 --> 00:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY CALLING THESE GUYS

00:42.475 --> 00:44.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INSTEAD

00:44.077 --> 00:46.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF EMPLOYEES, NO REAL RULES

APPLY.

00:47.547 --> 00:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN KIND OF DO WHATEVER

00:48.748 --> 00:50.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT-- OR THEY THINK THEY

00:50.383 --> 00:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WHAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO

00:52.685 --> 00:54.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS SORT OF FIND A LARGE

00:54.921 --> 00:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULATION OF TRUCK DRIVERS,

00:56.189 --> 00:58.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSTLY IMMIGRANTS, ABOUT 16,000

00:58.525 --> 01:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRANT DRIVERS.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN THE STATE TOLD THESE

01:01.961 --> 01:03.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANIES THAT THEY HAD TO USE

01:03.063 --> 01:04.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEWER, CLEANER TRUCKS, INSTEAD

01:04.998 --> 01:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF PAYING FOR IT THEMSELVES,

01:06.066 --> 01:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF

01:07.534 --> 01:09.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEASE-TO-OWN CONTRACTS,

01:09.169 --> 01:10.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEASE-TO-OWN AGREEMENTS.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN THE DRIVERS CAME INTO

01:11.738 --> 01:13.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORK ONE DAY, JUST LIKE THEY HAD

01:13.273 --> 01:15.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN FOR DECADES, THE COMPANY

01:15.108 --> 01:16.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID, "IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR

01:16.376 --> 01:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOB HERE, IF YOU WANT TO KEEP

DRIVING, YOU NEED TO SIGN THIS

01:19.212 --> 01:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTRACT."

01:20.146 --> 01:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DIDN'T TRANSLATE IT.

01:20.847 --> 01:21.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DIDN'T EXPLAIN IT.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE GUYS THOUGHT THAT THEY

01:23.383 --> 01:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD JUST BE GETTING A NEW

01:24.417 --> 01:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUCK AFTER FIVE OR SEVEN YEARS,

01:26.352 --> 01:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF THEY WORKED HARD, THEY'D

01:27.220 --> 01:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET GOOD PAY, JUST LIKE THEY'D

01:28.221 --> 01:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALWAYS HAD.

01:28.721 --> 01:29.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO, THERE'S

01:29.456 --> 01:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOTHING WRONG WITH INHERENTLY

01:30.557 --> 01:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LEASE-TO-OWN MODEL.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW ARE THESE DRIVERS BEING

01:34.194 --> 01:35.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF?

01:35.562 --> 01:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> BECAUSE THEY OWE MONEY TO

01:37.997 --> 01:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR BOSS EVERY WEEK, THE

01:40.934 --> 01:42.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANIES USE THAT AS SORT OF A

01:42.435 --> 01:45.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTANT THREAT OF PUNISHMENT OR

01:45.238 --> 01:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RETALIATION.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, FOR INSTANCE, IF THEY DON'T

01:48.007 --> 01:50.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO WORK 14 OR 16 HOURS, THE

01:50.577 --> 01:51.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOSS MIGHT SAY, "WELL, THEN, YOU

01:51.845 --> 01:53.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN'T WORK TOMORROW."

01:53.113 --> 01:54.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THEY USE IT AS A CONTROL TO

01:54.547 --> 01:56.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE THEM WORK AROUND THE CLOCK.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ARE LOOKING AT GUYS DOING 100

01:58.151 --> 02:00.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOURS A WEEK, 120 HOURS A WEEK.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND EVEN IF THE PAY IS SO BAD

02:02.088 --> 02:03.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY'RE TAKING HOME PENNIES

02:03.123 --> 02:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE HOUR, THEY HAVE NO CHOICE

02:04.958 --> 02:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT TO SAY YES.

02:05.925 --> 02:07.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THEY FALL BEHIND, FOR

02:07.594 --> 02:09.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTANCE, ON A WEEK, THE DEBT

02:09.295 --> 02:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARRIES OVER TO THE NEXT WEEK.

02:10.530 --> 02:11.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY OWE THEIR

02:11.598 --> 02:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOSS MONEY COME FRIDAY.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE SAW CASES WHERE GUYS

02:15.268 --> 02:16.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD COME HOME AFTER DOUBLE

02:16.503 --> 02:18.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIFTS-- 16, 18 HOURS A DAY--

02:18.338 --> 02:20.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WOULD TRY TO GO HOME, YOU

02:20.106 --> 02:20.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES,

02:20.874 --> 02:21.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE TIRED.

02:21.841 --> 02:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE BOSS WOULD ACTUALLY LOCK

02:22.842 --> 02:24.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GATES TO THE PARKING LOT AND

02:24.010 --> 02:25.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY, "NO, YOU NEED TO GO BACK.

02:25.845 --> 02:26.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU NEED TO GO BACK ON TO THE

02:26.913 --> 02:27.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROAD AND DELIVER MORE

02:27.780 --> 02:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTAINERS."

02:28.915 --> 02:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THEY'RE CONSTANTLY IN THESE

02:29.916 --> 02:30.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATIONS WHERE THEY HAVE

02:30.984 --> 02:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY NO AGENCY OR OPTIONS.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN'T TAKE THE TRUCK AND GO

02:35.622 --> 02:37.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORK FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

02:37.023 --> 02:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE REALLY TIED TO IT.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR WHOLE INVESTMENT GETS TIED

02:39.459 --> 02:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP INTO THIS TRUCK.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WENT BANKRUPT, HOUSES GOT

02:43.997 --> 02:46.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORECLOSED ON, ALL BECAUSE THEY

02:46.065 --> 02:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE POURING THEIR LIFE SAVINGS

02:47.167 --> 02:48.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THIS THING THAT THEY REALLY

02:48.768 --> 02:49.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEVER QUALIFIED FOR TO BEGIN

02:49.836 --> 02:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH.

02:50.303 --> 02:50.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE

02:50.904 --> 02:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREDITWORTHINESS.

02:51.804 --> 02:52.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT THE COMPANIES KNEW

02:52.739 --> 02:53.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THEY WERE DRAWING UP THE

02:53.506 --> 02:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREEMENTS, AND THAT'S WHY THEY

02:54.507 --> 02:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPPED IN TO KIND OF BE THE

02:56.242 --> 02:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIDDLE MAN.

02:56.843 --> 02:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHEN YOU SAY

02:57.510 --> 02:58.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORKING DOUBLE SHIFTS AND

02:58.745 --> 03:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
120 HOURS A WEEK SOMETIMES,

03:00.380 --> 03:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREN'T THERE RULES IN THE

03:01.581 --> 03:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUCKING INDUSTRY THAT PREVENT

03:02.949 --> 03:04.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUCKERS FROM WORKING TOO MANY

03:04.584 --> 03:05.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOURS SO THAT THEY'RE STILL

03:05.585 --> 03:07.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALERT BEHIND THE WHEEL?

03:07.921 --> 03:08.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> EXACTLY, YEAH.

03:08.721 --> 03:10.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A DRIVER IS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE

03:10.223 --> 03:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRIVING FOR 11 HOURS IN A SINGLE

03:11.858 --> 03:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAY.

03:13.092 --> 03:14.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE LOOKING AT GUYS WHO ARE

03:14.127 --> 03:15.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALMOST DOING DOUBLE THAT.

03:15.461 --> 03:17.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS THEY

03:17.730 --> 03:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COOK THEIR LOG BOOKS.

03:18.965 --> 03:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DOCTOR THEIR MANIFESTS.

03:20.967 --> 03:22.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LOT OF THE COMPANIES NOT

03:22.135 --> 03:23.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY KNOW THAT THEIR DRIVERS ARE

03:23.503 --> 03:25.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING THAT, BUT THEY REQUIRE IT.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE FOUND INSTANCES OF

03:26.773 --> 03:28.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISPATCHERS WITHHOLDING

03:28.608 --> 03:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAYCHECKS UNTIL DRIVERS DOCTORED

03:31.077 --> 03:32.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR LOG BOOKS.

03:32.312 --> 03:33.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAD MANAGERS WHO WERE

03:33.313 --> 03:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY SHOWING THEM HOW TO DO

03:34.647 --> 03:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT EVERY FRIDAY.

03:36.182 --> 03:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S REALLY ILLEGAL, AND

03:38.151 --> 03:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS.

03:38.818 --> 03:39.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, SO

03:39.519 --> 03:40.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GOODS THAT ARE BEING

03:40.286 --> 03:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSPORTED BY THESE TRUCKS ARE

THINK THEY REALLY WERE IN A

04:22.862 --> 04:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
