UDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.641 --> 00:11.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: While
the candidates
are in Florida battling for
Sunshine State

00:11.445 --> 00:17.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes, a look at how rising
premiums under
the Affordable Care Act could
play into the

00:17.284 --> 00:19.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

00:19.186 --> 00:22.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: the international stakes
of the United
States' election -- what the
rest of the world

00:22.923 --> 00:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is thinking during one of the
nation's most
contentious presidential races.

00:27.194 --> 00:32.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The coming U.S.
election
has created a level of
apprehension not experienced

00:32.733 --> 00:34.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for decades.

00:34.468 --> 00:39.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
first-generation college
students take on more than just
tests and

00:39.439 --> 00:42.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all-nighters -- the bigger
obstacles these
students face.

00:42.976 --> 00:45.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YUKI BURTON, Educational
Opportunities Program:
I have students who are living
day by day,

00:45.979 --> 00:50.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, in that surviving model
and thinking
about, how do I meet tomorrow's
need and tomorrow's,

00:50.784 --> 00:52.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and not thinking about my
long-term wellness.

00:52.753 --> 01:00.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:00.994 --> 01:03.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.830 --> 01:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. director
of national
intelligence voiced doubt today
that North

01:13.507 --> 01:16.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Korea will ever give up nuclear
weapons.

01:16.677 --> 01:20.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a Washington speed, James
Clapper said
-- quote -- "The notion of
getting the North

01:20.914 --> 01:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Koreans to denuclearize is
probably a lost
cause.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are not going to do that."

01:26.787 --> 01:31.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The State Department quickly
disputed his
statement and insisted U.S.
policy is both

01:31.591 --> 01:33.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unchanged and realistic.

01:33.493 --> 01:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY, U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State:
Our policy is to seek, to obtain
a verifiable,

01:41.802 --> 01:45.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
verifiable denuclearization of
the Korean
Peninsula.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is the policy.

01:47.574 --> 01:51.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is both the goal and what
we want to
see, and there's a way to do
that.

01:51.745 --> 01:57.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
has repeatedly
said the U.S. will never accept
a nuclear-armed

01:57.084 --> 01:58.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
North Korea.

01:58.919 --> 02:03.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the communist state has
stepped up its
nuclear and ballistic missiles
tests in recent

02:03.123 --> 02:04.825 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
months.

02:04.858 --> 02:10.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Militants in Pakistan stormed a
police academy
overnight, killing at least 61
people.

02:10.263 --> 02:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It happened in the southwestern
city of Quetta.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of the dead were police
cadets and recruits.

02:16.036 --> 02:21.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 120 others were
wounded in one of
the deadliest attacks on
Pakistan's security

02:21.775 --> 02:23.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
forces in recent years.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cadets told of being hunted
down.

02:25.879 --> 02:30.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDUL SATTAR, Police Cadet
(through translator):
Last night, we were getting
ready to sleep

02:30.484 --> 02:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when suddenly we heard sounds of
gunfire,
and the firing continued, volley
after volley,

02:35.689 --> 02:37.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
two or three times.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then they entered the building
and hurled
grenades and kept firing.

02:40.761 --> 02:44.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They looked under the beds,
shone torches
and fired on people under the
beds.

02:44.731 --> 02:50.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Islamic State
group claimed
responsibility, but so did a
breakaway faction

02:50.037 --> 02:52.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Pakistani Taliban.

02:52.606 --> 02:59.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The death rate for migrants
crossing the Mediterranean
has soared this year to three
times last year's

02:59.379 --> 03:00.781 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rate.

03:00.814 --> 03:05.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. Refugee Agency blames
smugglers using
flimsy inflatable rafts.

03:05.118 --> 03:09.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It says the numbers trying to
reach Europe
have fallen dramatically.

03:09.289 --> 03:13.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But despite that, the number of
deaths is
on track to top last year's
total.

03:13.827 --> 03:17.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM SPINDLER, United Nations
High Commissioner
for Refugees: At least 3,740
lives are reported

03:17.597 --> 03:24.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lost, and we might see this
figure rise in
the next few days.

03:24.638 --> 03:31.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is just short of the
3,771 deaths
reported for the whole of 2015.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is by far the worst we ever
have seen
in the Mediterranean.

03:34.648 --> 03:39.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, in
Northern France,
workers today began dismantling
a makeshift

03:39.953 --> 03:43.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
camp in Calais known as the
Jungle.

03:43.290 --> 03:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some 6,300 migrants there are
being relocated
across France.

03:48.829 --> 03:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the
Pentagon ran into
new criticism over demands that
California

03:53.433 --> 03:57.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Guard troops return
their enlistment
bonuses.

03:57.237 --> 04:03.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Audits have found nearly 10,000
Iraq and Afghanistan
war veterans were overpaid in an
effort to

04:03.944 --> 04:05.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fill the ranks.

04:05.712 --> 04:10.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, House Speaker Paul Ryan
insisted the
National Guard suspend efforts
to collect

04:10.317 --> 04:13.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bonuses until Congress can
act.

04:13.520 --> 04:18.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge in San Francisco
has approved
a record settlement in
Volkswagen's emissions

04:18.959 --> 04:20.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cheating scandal.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's worth nearly $15 billion.

04:22.996 --> 04:31.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under the terms, the company
agrees to buy
back 475,000 V.W.s and Audis or
pay for repairs.

04:31.138 --> 04:36.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, well over 330,000 owners
have registered
for the deal.

04:36.610 --> 04:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average lost 53 points to close
at 18169.

04:43.450 --> 04:48.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 26 and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
eight.

04:48.488 --> 04:53.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
bracing for
a double-digit hike in health
care premiums;

04:53.593 --> 04:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what people in other countries
think of the
U.S. election; a water fight
between Iowa's

04:59.666 --> 05:13.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
farmers and city-dwellers; and
much more.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Two weeks and counting.

05:15.582 --> 05:21.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With 14 days to go, the
presidential battleground
is narrowing, and one state is
emerging as

05:21.588 --> 05:23.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
critical to the result.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

05:25.525 --> 05:30.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, the race for
the White House
seemed like a contest to be
president of Florida.

05:30.931 --> 05:35.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump was spending his
third day in
that state, which he says is
make-or-break.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: That is a must-win for
you.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.606 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Correct?

05:39.639 --> 05:40.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I believe Florida is a must-win,
and I think

05:40.540 --> 05:41.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we are winning it.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we are winning it big.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Public polls show
that Trump and
Hillary Clinton are in a close
race in the

05:47.280 --> 05:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state, which explains why they
were just an
hour's drive apart.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton was making her case that
Trump is
unfit to be president.

05:54.888 --> 05:58.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
The first thing a president does
is to take

05:58.692 --> 06:02.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an oath to preserve, protect and
defend the
Constitution.

06:02.562 --> 06:09.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have serious doubts
whether about Donald
Trump even understands what that
means.

06:09.102 --> 06:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In America, we don't say we're
going to keep
you in suspense about whether we
will respect

06:16.509 --> 06:18.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the outcome of an election.

06:18.478 --> 06:23.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump seized on the
insurance premium
spike in President Obama's
health care program.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare is just
blowing up.

06:25.418 --> 06:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to repeal and
replace Obamacare,
and I can say all of my
employees are having

06:29.823 --> 06:32.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a tremendous problem with
Obamacare.

06:32.392 --> 06:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later, the manager of
that Trump
club said that most of the
workers have company-provided

06:37.931 --> 06:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
insurance, not Obamacare.

06:39.666 --> 06:45.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's campaign spokeswoman
rejected Trump's
call to repeal the health care
law.

06:45.505 --> 06:50.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Trump questions the integrity
of the election,
the Justice Department said it
be monitoring

06:50.443 --> 06:53.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polling places around the
country on Election
Day.

06:53.413 --> 06:58.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But their oversight will be
curtailed this
year because of the 2013 Supreme
Court decision

06:58.952 --> 07:02.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
striking down key provisions of
the Voting
Rights Act.

07:02.822 --> 07:08.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Clinton scored
another major endorsement
today from a Cabinet secretary
in a Republican

07:08.528 --> 07:09.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

07:09.996 --> 07:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former Secretary of State Colin
Powell said
he will be voting for her.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

07:16.836 --> 07:21.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And late today,
The Washington
Post reported that the Trump
campaign has

07:21.541 --> 07:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ended its joint fund-raising
with the Republican
Party.

07:25.145 --> 07:28.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That could hurt the party's
get-out-the-vote
efforts.

07:28.882 --> 07:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as we just heard, the state
and fate of
the health insurance law, or
Obamacare, is

07:34.487 --> 07:36.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
front and center today.

07:36.423 --> 07:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's because, as the new
enrollment season
for coverage is about to begin,
the administration

07:41.127 --> 07:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced that premiums will
rise by 25 percent
on average for a benchmark
mid-level plan

07:48.335 --> 07:50.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through the federally run
market.

07:50.537 --> 07:53.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At the same time, choices are
decreasing.

07:53.573 --> 07:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One in five consumers will have
a single insurer
to choose from.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a simple picture.

08:00.013 --> 08:04.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Federal subsidies for most
people getting
coverage this way will increase.

08:04.784 --> 08:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help us understand more about
it, and how
this all plays into the
campaign, I'm joined

08:09.022 --> 08:11.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by two following this closely.

08:11.624 --> 08:16.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mary Agnes Carey covers the
marketplace for
Kaiser Health News, and Reid
Wilson covering

08:16.863 --> 08:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the politics of it for The Hill
newspaper.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We welcome you both.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, Mary Agnes, to you first.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How many people are affected by
this?

08:25.438 --> 08:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What percent of the population
overall?

08:27.307 --> 08:30.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY, Kaiser Health
News: Of all
the people who buy health
insurance, 5 percent

08:30.176 --> 08:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
buy on the ACA exchanges.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of us get our coverage
either through
work or through the Medicaid
program or the

08:36.950 --> 08:38.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Medicare program.

08:38.184 --> 08:42.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's about 20 million people
on the individual
market.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About two-thirds of those get
marketplace
plans.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important to them, of
course, but you
have to look at it in
perspective with the

08:47.894 --> 08:49.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overall numbers.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And these are
people who live
across the country?

08:51.398 --> 08:53.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Across the
country, all
50 states.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The federal government sells --
of the health
insurance exchange, there are
plans are in

08:56.803 --> 09:00.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about 38 states, and rest and
the District
of Columbia are state-run plans.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the range of
-- the percentage
of increase differs from state
to state?

09:04.978 --> 09:06.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: All over the
place.

09:06.813 --> 09:12.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, in Arizona, you had
116 percent
increase in premiums, monthly
premiums, $196

09:12.786 --> 09:13.987 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to $422.

09:14.020 --> 09:16.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we should say these are
before the subsidies
kick in.

09:16.589 --> 09:20.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And these are premiums for a
27-year-old male.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we have to look at it from
that perspective.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nebraska, we're talking about a
51 percent
increase.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ohio, a 2 percent increase.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Massachusetts, actually a 3
percent decrease.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's really depending on
where you live.

09:32.138 --> 09:36.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you live in an urban area or
a rural area,
that's also going to affect the
number of

09:36.609 --> 09:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
providers and the networks and
that sort of
thing.

09:39.078 --> 09:43.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Reid, as we
see, this is
already having an effect on the
presidential

09:43.049 --> 09:44.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard Donald Trump a few
minutes ago saying
this is the end of Obamacare.

09:46.653 --> 09:51.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON, The Hill: And it's
played a role
in Republican campaigns who are
running for

09:51.991 --> 09:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senate and House seats around
the country.

09:54.194 --> 09:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In New Hampshire, Senator Kelly
Ayotte is
already up with an ad attacking
Governor Maggie

09:58.765 --> 10:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hassan, one of the most watched
Senate races
in the country, over Governor
Hassan's support

10:02.936 --> 10:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the Affordable Care Act.

10:04.838 --> 10:09.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's notable, though, is that
the amount
of advertising specifically
around the Affordable

10:09.576 --> 10:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Care Act is actually down
significantly from
earlier years.

10:12.979 --> 10:17.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's almost as if public opinion
on this matter
has been baked in for the last
five years

10:18.017 --> 10:21.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- or six years really since
it's been debated.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there aren't that many
people who are
willing to change their minds.

10:23.890 --> 10:27.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just because
I know it's
complicated, Mary Agnes, but why
has this

10:27.126 --> 10:28.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
happened?

10:28.495 --> 10:30.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Well, it's
happened for
a variety of reasons.

10:30.497 --> 10:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Insurers may have gotten in
early and underpriced
their products to try to get
more market share.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now they are going to have
to even that
out.

10:36.636 --> 10:40.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We may have had -- likely have
had a lot of
sicker people get in first.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone sort of knew that when
they did the
Affordable Care Act.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The sickest people come first.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are the most expensive
people.

10:46.079 --> 10:52.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You also have an ability of some
plans manage
costs better than other plans.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so now we're going to hear
more about
these things called narrow
networks and other

10:55.288 --> 10:57.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tightening of costs.

10:57.123 --> 11:01.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also some federal programs
to help insurers
balance out the cost of these
really sick

11:02.028 --> 11:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, two of them are going
away next year,
and the other hasn't necessarily
worked as

11:06.699 --> 11:09.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intended, so it's sort of a
combined effect.

11:09.068 --> 11:11.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And different factors have a
different effect
depending on where you live.

11:11.971 --> 11:16.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So we talked to
several people
around the country affected by
these rate

11:16.709 --> 11:17.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
increases.

11:17.710 --> 11:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's begin with a woman named
Beth Plein.

11:18.945 --> 11:19.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She lives in Maryland.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BETH PLEIN, Maryland: My name is
Beth Plein.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I'm 64.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I live in Cockeysville,
Maryland.

11:25.485 --> 11:31.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am one of the small number of
people who
self-insures and doesn't qualify
for a subsidy,

11:32.025 --> 11:36.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so my insurance premiums are
very high, bordering
on the unaffordable.

11:36.162 --> 11:41.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have actually tracked my
insurance even
in the years before the
Affordable Care Act,

11:41.167 --> 11:49.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they were rising gradually,
but after
2014, they were spiking
dramatically.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I started with a $548 premium.

11:52.412 --> 11:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I changed the plan, went down
to a $411
premium with a higher
deductible.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then next year, I don't know
what it will
be.

12:02.689 --> 12:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't change it again, because
this is the
least expensive plan.

12:06.593 --> 12:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know what can be done
because it's
such a complex issue.

12:10.897 --> 12:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At this point, you have to
depend on the government
to iron it out.

12:15.501 --> 12:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, hopefully, that's what they
will do.

12:18.037 --> 12:19.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mary Agnes, how
typical is
she?

12:19.872 --> 12:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Well, we're
hearing more
and more from these people who
don't qualify

12:23.543 --> 12:25.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a subsidy.

12:25.411 --> 12:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's roughly in the ballpark of
five to seven
million people who are buying on
the individual

12:29.916 --> 12:30.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
market or in the exchanges.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't qualify for a
subsidy.

12:32.952 --> 12:38.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's really difficult,
because while many
people, something like 85
percent, of individuals

12:38.057 --> 12:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the exchange can get that
subsidy that
can help lower the premium,
there are folks

12:42.562 --> 12:44.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that don't have that.

12:44.364 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I received an e-mail this
week from a
small business person who said
he felt like

12:47.400 --> 12:52.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had absolutely no hope for
the Affordable
Care Act for him to be able to
afford the

12:52.071 --> 12:53.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
premiums.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, we have this
requirement for
coverage.

12:55.074 --> 13:01.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Reid, we
just heard her
say, she said, I wish -- she
says it's now

13:01.214 --> 13:02.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up to the federal government to
fix it.

13:02.849 --> 13:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what's the likelihood that
that can happen?

13:04.951 --> 13:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Well, the question
really depends
on what happens in November, two
weeks from

13:09.255 --> 13:11.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now, on Election Day.

13:11.224 --> 13:15.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Hillary Clinton wins the
presidency, Democrats
win the Senate, and Democrats
win the House,

13:15.695 --> 13:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, there's a real good shot
that the Democrats
will do something to repair the
Affordable

13:20.633 --> 13:22.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Care Act on a wholesale basis.

13:22.568 --> 13:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But taking back the House is a
really steep
hurdle for Democrats, and we
have seen Republicans

13:27.306 --> 13:32.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in control of the House vote to
repeal the
Affordable Care Act 50-plus
times.

13:32.679 --> 13:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is -- the Republicans in
the House have
been unwilling to even make
technical corrections

13:36.649 --> 13:38.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the bill.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, unless there is some massive
sea change
within the Republican Party,
which I don't

13:41.854 --> 13:45.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see happening, it's going to be
very difficult
for even the smallest
corrections to be made.

13:45.925 --> 13:50.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we also
talked to a single
mother with two children in
Greensboro, North

13:50.897 --> 13:52.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Carolina.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is one of the states where
so many insurers
have pulled out.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATALIE CUNNINGHAM, North
Carolina: My name
is Natalie Cunningham.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm 30 years old.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I live in Greensboro, North
Carolina.

14:01.574 --> 14:05.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I have Coventry health
insurance, where I
pay just $9 a month.

14:05.611 --> 14:08.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the subsidy on it is $237.

14:08.848 --> 14:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I recently found out that my
insurer, Coventry,
was not going to be part of the
marketplace,

14:15.354 --> 14:17.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obamacare, anymore.

14:17.090 --> 14:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so now I'm at the point of,
you know,
OK, now I'm going to be
switching to Blue

14:21.661 --> 14:25.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cross/Blue Shield, but whether I
will be able
to afford it, because I don't
know how much

14:25.364 --> 14:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the plans are going to go up,
and they had
already just about doubled at
the end of 2015.

14:31.037 --> 14:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just going by what I can handle,
because when
you want to pick between buying
school shoes

14:36.976 --> 14:41.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or, you know, paying extra money
into the
health insurance plan, as a
mother, sometimes,

14:41.180 --> 14:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have got to make those
decisions and cut
out the health insurance.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mary Agnes, why
are so many
insurers pulling out?

14:48.855 --> 14:52.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Well,
sometimes, they just
didn't make the money that they
wanted to

14:52.492 --> 14:57.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make or they have had a hard
time managing
the sicker folks who have come
in initially,

14:57.563 --> 14:59.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and trying balance out the risk
pool.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's really interesting I
think about
this example is that it
illustrates states

15:02.902 --> 15:07.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where insurers are leaving the
market causing
some problems.

15:07.039 --> 15:08.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's from North Carolina.

15:08.808 --> 15:13.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In about -- about 230,000 people
in North
Carolina are going to have a
change with their

15:13.079 --> 15:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan because two or three
insurers are dropping
out.

15:16.249 --> 15:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alabama and South Carolina,
there's one insurer
statewide.

15:20.319 --> 15:24.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one word of encouragement,
if I could
offer, is that her subsidy is
going to increase

15:24.123 --> 15:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the plans increase in price.

15:25.792 --> 15:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You mentioned this in your
introduction.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

15:28.161 --> 15:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: For that
benchmark plan,
that will also increase.

15:30.696 --> 15:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, she may find it not as
unmanageable as
she thinks.

15:34.133 --> 15:38.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, for all of these
consumers,
getting on healthcare.gov, or
your state-based

15:38.771 --> 15:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exchange to shop, you might be
able to go
to a plan in that same category,
whether it's

15:44.043 --> 15:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a silver or a bronze or gold or
a platinum,
and you might find something at
a lower price

15:48.214 --> 15:49.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that still works for you.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's just
going to take
some time for them to figure it
out.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Absolutely.

15:53.986 --> 15:56.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally,
let's hear -- this
is a young woman who lives in
Brooklyn.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She happens to be healthy.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's looking for an affordable
policy.

15:59.158 --> 16:01.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURA BRICKMAN, New York: I'm
Laura Brickman.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a 27-year-old who lives in
Brooklyn, New
York.

16:05.064 --> 16:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm working as a freelance
journalist doing
video and print work.

16:08.901 --> 16:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, because it's freelance, I
don't have
an insurance plan through my
employer.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I'm currently uninsured.

16:16.275 --> 16:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me to buy a plan is a little
bit frustrating,
because I feel that I don't use
it personally,

16:22.348 --> 16:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the amount of money I would
be spending
on insurance is things that I
could divert

16:26.886 --> 16:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to non-health care issues,
because I honestly
don't have many health care
expenses.

16:33.759 --> 16:38.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the chances of me really
taking advantage
of the plan are very low, I
think.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have any chronic health
issues.

16:41.200 --> 16:46.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only thing I would use
medical care for
at this point is like a major
medical emergency,

16:46.739 --> 16:48.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which has not happened,
fortunately.

16:48.641 --> 16:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Mary Agnes,
this reminds
us these tough choices for young
people like

16:54.046 --> 16:58.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her who know they do have to pay
a fine if
they're not in the system.

16:58.451 --> 16:59.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Right.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's really important to
remember.

17:00.953 --> 17:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For next year, it's $695, or 2.5
percent of
income, whichever is greater.

17:05.691 --> 17:08.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have got to remember,
even if you
think, I can afford to pay that,
you still

17:08.327 --> 17:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't have health insurance, and
you're going
to be on the hook if something
happens to

17:11.530 --> 17:12.565 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So there are some things that
she can consider.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a catastrophic plan for
people under
30.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are some other options.

17:18.471 --> 17:22.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, you should really go to
the marketplace
and check it out to see if
something works.

17:22.108 --> 17:27.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Reid, just
finally, before
we wrap this up, talk about what
it is that

17:27.346 --> 17:33.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
have said
they want to do to either fix or
adjust the

17:33.719 --> 17:35.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Affordable Care Act.

17:35.221 --> 17:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON: Well, neither have
offered a
lot of specifics on the matter.

17:38.925 --> 17:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has talked about
allowing insurance
plans to be purchased across
state lines,

17:43.195 --> 17:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which has been a staple of the
Republican
policy for quite a long time.

17:47.099 --> 17:50.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, on the other
hand, has talked
about the positive aspects of
the Affordable

17:50.336 --> 17:54.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Care Act, being able to stay on
your parents'
insurance plan until you're 26,
some of the

17:54.941 --> 18:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other positives that are broadly
favorable,
broadly popular across the
country.

18:00.513 --> 18:05.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's clear is that the
next president
is going to have to deal with
some kind of

18:05.151 --> 18:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fix for the Affordable Care Act.

18:06.886 --> 18:11.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is what will they
be able to
get through what is likely to be
a divided

18:11.123 --> 18:12.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the idea of
unwinding it
completely, which is what Donald
Trump talks

18:15.761 --> 18:17.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about, how practical?

18:17.530 --> 18:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: That -- just like
Republicans
going along with changes to the
Affordable

18:20.800 --> 18:25.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Care Act is unlikely for a
Democratic president,
unwinding the Affordable Care
Act is going

18:25.338 --> 18:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be very unlikely for a
Republican president,
whether it Donald Trump or
whoever comes next,

18:31.243 --> 18:34.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because there is a significant
Democratic
presence in the Senate, and
they're able to

18:34.447 --> 18:36.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
block that.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, this is a
subject we
have been talking about from the
beginning

18:38.084 --> 18:40.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this campaign until right
down to the end.

18:40.953 --> 18:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Reid Wilson, Mary Agnes Carey,
thank you both.

18:47.860 --> 18:53.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY AGNES CAREY: Thanks.

18:53.366 --> 19:00.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president of
the United
States is often called the
leader of the free

19:00.106 --> 19:01.874 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

19:01.907 --> 19:06.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with just two weeks left in
the campaign,
it can be relatively safely said
that many

19:06.045 --> 19:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eyes overseas are keeping close
tabs on the
race for the White House.

19:10.416 --> 19:15.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant has
been sampling opinion on his
recent travels

19:15.121 --> 19:17.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through Europe, and he sent us
what he found.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
She's playing chicken.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.359 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look, Putin...

19:20.393 --> 19:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS WALLACE, Moderator: Wait,
but...

19:21.927 --> 19:25.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: ... from
everything I see, has
no respect for this person.

19:25.631 --> 19:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, that's because he'd rather
have a puppet

19:29.035 --> 19:30.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as president of the United
States.

19:30.269 --> 19:31.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: No puppet.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No puppet.

19:32.271 --> 19:33.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And it's
pretty clear...

19:33.272 --> 19:34.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You're the puppet.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: It's
pretty clear...

19:36.075 --> 19:37.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: There's little
doubt that
the world is watching the battle
between Hillary

19:37.610 --> 19:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton and Donald Trump with a
combination
of fascination and trepidation.

19:41.013 --> 19:48.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Greece, the land that
invented democracy,
hostility towards Germany has
replaced anti-Americanism

19:48.120 --> 19:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during the financial crisis.

19:50.089 --> 19:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in a nation that is Europe's
frontier
with the Islamic world, leading
foreign analyst

19:55.127 --> 19:59.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thanos Dokos is concerned about
the possibility
of a Trump presidency.

19:59.231 --> 20:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THANOS DOKOS, Foreign Analyst:
He will most
likely be an isolationist
president, which

20:03.702 --> 20:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is never good news for the rest
of the world.

20:06.138 --> 20:10.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: American-led
invasions of
Afghanistan and Iraq divided
Europe.

20:10.976 --> 20:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of George W. Bush's
staunchest allies
in the coalition of the willing
was Danish

20:15.214 --> 20:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Prime Minister Anders Fogh
Rasmussen.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He went on to become the NATO
secretary-general.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's dismissive of this
November's Republican
candidate.

20:22.988 --> 20:26.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDERS FOGH RASMUSSEN, Former
NATO Secretary-General:
The American electorate have a
choice between

20:26.692 --> 20:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two very different candidates,
one who made
a clear statement that he
doesn't want the

20:34.800 --> 20:46.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
U.S. to be the world's
policeman, and another
candidate who I know from four
years of cooperation

20:46.045 --> 20:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when she was secretary of state
who has the
will to lead the world.

20:50.349 --> 20:52.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: What do you
think of her
as a potential leader?

20:52.952 --> 21:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDERS FOGH RASMUSSEN: Well,
seen from a foreign
policy perspective, I have full
confidence

21:00.392 --> 21:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that she will be engaged, she
will take the
lead.

21:08.000 --> 21:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's necessary, because we
know from
experience that, if the United
States retreats,

21:15.674 --> 21:21.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or is perceived to retreat, it
will leave
behind a vacuum, and that vacuum
will be filled

21:21.680 --> 21:23.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the bad guys.

21:23.549 --> 21:27.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: At the
supposedly neutral
United Nations in Geneva, the
High Commissioner

21:27.319 --> 21:32.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad
Al-Hussein, has
waded in with his take on the
presidential

21:32.892 --> 21:34.760 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
contest.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZEID BIN RA'AD ZEID AL-HUSSEIN,
United Nations
High Commissioner for Human
Rights: If Donald

21:36.562 --> 21:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is elected, on the basis
of what he
has said already, and unless
that changes,

21:40.766 --> 21:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's, without any doubt,
that he would
be dangerous, from an
international point

21:47.106 --> 21:48.874 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of view.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Russia's
relations with the
United States have descended
towards Cold

21:51.610 --> 21:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
War levels as a result of its
aggression in
Ukraine and devastating attacks
in Syria on

21:56.949 --> 22:02.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behalf of President Assad, not
to mention
American claims that Russia
hacked the Democratic

22:02.521 --> 22:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party's computer system and
accusations that
Moscow is interfering in the
election.

22:08.694 --> 22:12.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has said he could
do business
with Vladimir Putin, who was
making conciliatory

22:12.932 --> 22:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
noises during this appearance.

22:14.767 --> 22:18.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): The American people
will make

22:18.771 --> 22:20.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the choice they consider
necessary.

22:20.973 --> 22:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No matter what the result is, we
will work
with any leader of the United
States, whoever

22:24.843 --> 22:29.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this president is, if, of
course, the new
U.S. leader wishes to work with
our country.

22:29.848 --> 22:34.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Putin said
he was troubled
by American reaction to
allegations that Russia

22:34.987 --> 22:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hacked Democratic Party e-mails.

22:36.855 --> 22:41.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN (through
translator): About
a decade ago, they wouldn't
mention Russia

22:41.627 --> 22:43.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

22:43.462 --> 22:45.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would say it wasn't even
worth talking
about Russia, because it is such
a third-rate

22:45.864 --> 22:48.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regional power and not
interesting at all.

22:48.701 --> 22:52.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now Russia is problem number one
in the entire
election campaign.

All they do is keep talking
about us.

22:54.106 --> 22:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But Trump does
have vocal
European supporters, like Morten
Uhrskov.

22:58.544 --> 23:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Uhrskov heads Danish Unity, one
of several
new right-wing parties fighting
for voters'

23:04.650 --> 23:06.385 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
support.

23:06.418 --> 23:10.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He dislikes Trump's character,
but supports
his policies, despite the
tycoon's lack of

23:10.823 --> 23:12.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
foreign affairs experience.

23:12.658 --> 23:16.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORTEN UHRSKOV JENSEN, Leader,
Danish Unity:
He has said things there I don't
follow, like

23:16.061 --> 23:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting in doubt whether the
Baltic countries
should be defended.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Of course they should,
naturally.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm a European.

23:22.534 --> 23:24.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm concerned about Russia's
foreign policy,
actually.

23:24.536 --> 23:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, he has been incoherent,
but bottom
line is stop endless wars and
use more on

23:31.310 --> 23:33.112 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
defense.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But isn't the
key, though,
to being the commander in chief
the fact that

23:35.047 --> 23:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have got a character that is
worthy of
that position?

23:39.218 --> 23:41.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many people would say that
he doesn't
actually have the character.

23:41.887 --> 23:45.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't like his character, so
how can you
support him when he's supposed
to be the leader

23:45.591 --> 23:46.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the free world?

23:46.959 --> 23:50.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MORTEN UHRSKOV JENSEN: How could
I support
anyone other than Trump?

23:50.095 --> 23:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I could not support Clinton, who
wants to
continue endless wars, as I
said.

23:54.667 --> 24:00.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And may I remind, he -- you have
Congress,
you have the Supreme Court, you
have the best

24:00.572 --> 24:02.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
advisers in the whole wide
world.

24:02.875 --> 24:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, I know he's inexperienced
in foreign
policy, but he will not be a
dictator.

24:08.247 --> 24:12.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's ridiculous when I hear
people say he
can press the nuclear button,
things like

24:12.284 --> 24:13.252 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's ridiculous.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Britain four
months ago,
as Brexit supporters celebrated
an unexpected

24:18.457 --> 24:20.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
victory.

24:20.192 --> 24:23.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's backers will be hoping
that the U.S.
will deliver a similar surprise
result.

NIGEL FARAGE, Former U.K.
Independence Party
Leader: If I was an American
citizen, I wouldn't

24:26.799 --> 24:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote for Hillary Clinton if you
paid me.

24:28.767 --> 24:30.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

24:30.669 --> 24:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The most
influential foreign
right-winger in Trump's camp is
Nigel Farage,

24:34.173 --> 24:39.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
former head of the U.K.
Independence Party,
UKIP, who convinced British
voters to leave

24:39.945 --> 24:41.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the European Union.

24:41.680 --> 24:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIGEL FARAGE: I think that you
have a fantastic
opportunity here with this
campaign.

24:46.385 --> 24:57.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can go out, you can beat the
pollsters,
you can beat the commentators,
you can beat

24:57.763 --> 24:59.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Washington.

24:59.064 --> 25:04.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you will do it by doing what
we did for
Brexit in Britain.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

25:05.838 --> 25:09.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Greece is
currently having
a taste of an aggressive
right-wing party.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's called Golden Dawn.

25:11.677 --> 25:22.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, one of its lawmakers
lashed out at parliamentary
opponent Liana Kanelli.

25:22.554 --> 25:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chain-smoking Kanelli has a
reputation as
one of Greece's more colorful
politicians,

25:27.025 --> 25:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and she despairs of what America
is becoming.

25:29.395 --> 25:33.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LIANA KANELLI, Greek
Parliamentarian: I mean,
what the hell is the personality
of someone

25:33.465 --> 25:35.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voting for him?

25:35.234 --> 25:42.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the other hand, I think
there must
be a lot of men like Clinton in
the states,

25:42.641 --> 25:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they would like to have a
lady in their
life like Hillary.

25:48.313 --> 25:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She can absorb any marital or
other problem.

25:52.084 --> 25:56.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: There's a hoary
old expression
that, when America sneezes,
people on this

25:56.255 --> 25:58.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
side of the Atlantic catch a
cold.

25:58.891 --> 26:03.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many Europeans believe that the
world was
made a more dangerous place
after George W.

26:03.529 --> 26:07.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bush's military campaigns in
Afghanistan and
Iraq.

26:07.232 --> 26:12.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, the current refugee
crisis is seen
as a partial legacy of those
wars, because

26:12.771 --> 26:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the large numbers of Iraqis
and Afghans
seeking asylum alongside
Syrians.

26:18.377 --> 26:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regardless of history's judgment
of Barack
Obama's presidency, there's a
popular view

26:23.649 --> 26:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that his administration has done
much to improve
America's international
reputation.

26:29.254 --> 26:36.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the coming election has
generated levels
of apprehension not experienced
for decades.

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant

JUDY WOODRUFF: You will probably
be surprised
to hear that hunger and
homelessness is a

JUDY WOODRUFF: You will probably
be surprised
to hear that hunger and
homelessness is a

26:58.817 --> 27:04.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growing problem for thousands of
college students
across the country, particularly
among those

27:04.122 --> 27:07.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are the first in their
families to pursue
a degree.

27:07.693 --> 27:12.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is forcing some
universities to figure
out new ways of keeping
low-income students

27:12.798 --> 27:14.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in school.

27:14.666 --> 27:18.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story from
the University
of California, Berkeley, as part
of our weekly

27:18.770 --> 27:21.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education series Making the
Grade.

ANTHONY CARRASCO, College
Student: Oh, darn.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These tortillas are not very
good.

27:25.511 --> 27:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Every Sunday
night, Anthony
Carrasco prepares the food he
will eat for

27:29.581 --> 27:34.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the week ahead, setting himself
a quota of
one meal a day.

27:34.186 --> 27:39.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY CARRASCO: I can skip
breakfast, skip
lunch, and even skip dinner.

27:39.391 --> 27:42.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have just saved myself
close to $30
or $40.

27:42.528 --> 27:46.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I, like many folks, come to
college to get
out of poverty.

27:46.298 --> 27:50.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really thought that was the
end of the line
when we got the admission
letter.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, it wasn't.

27:52.104 --> 27:55.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Anthony is a
junior at the
University of California,
Berkeley, one of

27:55.140 --> 27:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the nation's leading public
universities.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's the first in his family
to attend
college.

28:01.079 --> 28:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was hard to get in, and now
hard to stay
in, but maybe not for a reason
many people

28:07.252 --> 28:09.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have considered.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY CARRASCO: We were
expecting long nights
in the libraries and tough
exams, but what

28:11.023 --> 28:16.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're really facing is, you
know, just, you
know, sleepless nights worried
about rent

28:16.228 --> 28:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and really distracting lecture
halls, when
you just cannot stop thinking
about food.

28:21.366 --> 28:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Today, almost a
third of all
students entering two- and
four-year colleges

28:26.872 --> 28:28.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are first-generation.

28:28.407 --> 28:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're more likely to be
minorities and come
from low-income families.

28:33.278 --> 28:37.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by the estimate of one
advocacy group,
more than half of them lack
reliable access

28:37.983 --> 28:39.117 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to food.

28:39.151 --> 28:42.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that contributes to their
lower graduation
rates.

28:42.754 --> 28:45.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many years ago, I myself was a
student here
at Berkeley.

28:45.824 --> 28:50.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was fortunate enough to have
the means so
I could concentrate on my
studies, my grades,

28:50.295 --> 28:53.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, yes, the fun side of
college life.

28:53.198 --> 28:58.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But more and more these days,
many students
find they have to worry about
more basic needs,

28:58.203 --> 28:59.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
including food and shelter.

28:59.705 --> 29:04.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A beautiful campus, world-class
academics
and now a new reality.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Is there any stock on
Friday?

29:06.778 --> 29:10.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We're going to restock on
Friday, so
everything is going to be here
on Friday.

29:10.682 --> 29:16.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A campus food
pantry, where
twice a month students can stock
up on staples.

29:16.488 --> 29:22.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The University of California
system has worked
hard to bring in
first-generation, low-income

29:22.561 --> 29:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and what are called
nontraditional students,
such as veterans and those with
families.

29:27.766 --> 29:31.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But more work is required to
help these students
survive and graduate.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUBEN CANEDO, University of
California, Berkeley:
Twenty-five bags today.

29:34.172 --> 29:38.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ruben Canedo is a
first-generation
graduate from Berkeley.

29:38.110 --> 29:43.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now a leading advocate for
student food
security, and oversees the
campus food pantry.

29:43.248 --> 29:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUBEN CANEDO: What we're doing
on our campus
is making sure that campus
becomes basic need

29:48.420 --> 29:50.188 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
secure.

29:50.222 --> 29:54.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have the recession, you have
the increasing
cost of living, and students are
caught in

29:54.860 --> 29:56.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the middle of that.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you see
students falling
through the cracks, I mean,
having to leave

29:59.798 --> 30:00.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school?

30:00.799 --> 30:02.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUBEN CANEDO: Absolutely.

30:02.567 --> 30:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We definitely have students that
said, you
know what, at this moment, I
can't do this.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And they left.

30:06.405 --> 30:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it wasn't because of their
academic challenges.

30:09.975 --> 30:14.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was because of the living
cost of the area.

30:14.079 --> 30:17.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were saying, I can't afford
my rent and
I can't afford to eat.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Therefore, I can't stay here.

30:19.418 --> 30:23.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Berkeley, sitting
in the midst
of the notoriously expensive San
Francisco

30:23.955 --> 30:28.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bay area, is among the most
costly college
towns in the country.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Financial aid can cover tuition
and books,
but, sometimes, it's not enough
for rent or

30:33.031 --> 30:34.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
food.

30:34.199 --> 30:36.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for some students, there are
barriers
beyond money.

30:36.902 --> 30:41.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TEJAE DUNNIVANT, College
Student: When you
get here, you're also coming
into a higher

30:41.073 --> 30:47.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
level of academia that
especially sometimes
more nontraditional students are
not used

30:47.879 --> 30:49.648 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

30:49.681 --> 30:54.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: TeJae Dunnivant
is another
first-generation student and a
mother of five.

30:54.219 --> 30:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After serving in the Army
Reserve, she decided
to earn a degree.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she's struggled to catch up
to her classmates.

31:00.192 --> 31:04.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TEJAE DUNNIVANT: You're reading
all new material
that you're not familiar at all
with.

31:04.796 --> 31:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it takes a lot to be able
to, you know,
get that in.

31:08.500 --> 31:12.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Have you had
times where you
think you couldn't get by, you
might have

31:12.037 --> 31:13.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to drop out of school?

31:13.371 --> 31:15.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TEJAE DUNNIVANT: Yes.

31:15.140 --> 31:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I don't understand exactly
where to go
to get the help, there are times
like that.

31:20.145 --> 31:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now that I'm in my third
year, I know
where to go to get the help.

31:26.384 --> 31:32.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: TeJae regularly
meets advisers
at Berkeley's Educational
Opportunities Program,

31:32.224 --> 31:34.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a campus resource for
disadvantaged students.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YUKI BURTON, University of
California, Berkeley:
What's going on?

31:36.161 --> 31:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How's the beginning of the
semester been so
far?

31:38.363 --> 31:39.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TEJAE DUNNIVANT: It hasn't been
bad.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I feel like I'm doing better at
keeping up

31:41.833 --> 31:46.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yuki Burton is
another Berkeley
graduate who now works to help
those who followed.

31:46.071 --> 31:50.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YUKI BURTON: I have students who
are living
day by day, again, in that
surviving model

31:50.442 --> 31:54.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and thinking about, how do I
meet tomorrow's
need and tomorrow's, and not
thinking about

31:54.112 --> 31:55.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
my long-term wellness.

31:56.014 --> 31:59.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Actually, just earlier this
morning, a student
who told me they are skipping
meals, and they

31:59.417 --> 32:03.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't realize that they'd been
skipping meals
until they verbalized it with me
in a session.

32:03.789 --> 32:08.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Having talked to
so many students
and worked with them, what
separates those

32:08.927 --> 32:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who make it from those who
don't?

32:10.562 --> 32:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YUKI BURTON: Community and
support.

32:12.831 --> 32:17.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, to some folks, that
sounds very trivial,
right, like it's not a concrete
resource.

32:17.836 --> 32:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's really having a group
of peers, of
staff, of faculty who understand
my story

32:23.875 --> 32:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and who get it, that they don't
have to overexplain
themselves.

32:27.179 --> 32:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAYLOR HARVEY, College Student:
The person
that's experiencing these things
might be

32:30.448 --> 32:32.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sitting next to you in class,
and you might
not even realize.

32:32.984 --> 32:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In her art class
recently,
Taylor Harvey told fellow
students about her

32:37.589 --> 32:39.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own plight.

32:39.257 --> 32:44.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Taylor has worked since age 13
and spent parts
of her youth in homeless
shelters.

32:44.262 --> 32:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's experienced tough times in
college as
well.

32:46.865 --> 32:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAYLOR HARVEY: I would stay in a
homeless
shelter, but it's pretty unsafe
for a young

32:52.304 --> 32:54.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
woman to stay in a homeless
shelter.

32:54.239 --> 33:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a number of students
who sleep in
their cars, because it's
cheaper, or sleep

33:01.246 --> 33:08.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in university buildings,
libraries, places
that close at night, because
it's safer that

33:08.353 --> 33:10.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

33:10.155 --> 33:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Taylor shares an
apartment,
for now, until school closes for
holiday breaks

33:14.159 --> 33:16.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or her financial aid is spent.

33:16.061 --> 33:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she's now trying to raise
awareness on
campus of the homeless problem.

33:20.699 --> 33:24.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAYLOR HARVEY: We admit that we
don't know
what the solution will be.

33:24.069 --> 33:29.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we know what our endgame is,
and that's
to eliminate student
homelessness, and to

33:29.674 --> 33:33.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help first-generation college
students stay
in college and graduate.

33:33.445 --> 33:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This summer, the
University
of California system approved a
new $3.3 million

33:39.417 --> 33:44.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fund to help students access
food on and off
campus.

33:44.322 --> 33:49.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The difficult situations many
students find
themselves in have forced
Berkeley and other

33:49.127 --> 33:52.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
institutions to re-ask some
basic questions.

33:52.397 --> 33:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FABRIZIO MEJIA, University of
California,
Berkeley: If we are a public
institution,

33:55.000 --> 33:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what does it mean to educate the
public?

33:59.170 --> 34:02.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does it mean to educate
Californians?

34:02.107 --> 34:05.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what does it mean that
education is an
engine for social change?

34:05.810 --> 34:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Fabrizio Mejia is
the assistant
vice chancellor for student
equity and success

34:10.649 --> 34:12.550 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at Berkeley.

34:12.584 --> 34:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FABRIZIO MEJIA: What it means
for our institution,
in particular, and the U.C.
system is that

34:15.687 --> 34:20.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we have to invest in the
programs that are
going to welcome the students
in, that are

34:20.091 --> 34:23.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to get them through, that
are going
to get them to succeed at the
level that we

34:23.795 --> 34:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say is required for everybody
across the board.

34:27.232 --> 34:32.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: As more
first-generation students
pursue degrees, colleges and
universities

34:32.437 --> 34:36.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
will have to address the
challenges these
students bring with them.

34:36.541 --> 34:45.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Berkeley, California, I'm
Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS NewsHour."

34:45.216 --> 34:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yesterday,
Charlotte television
reporter Steve Crump accepted an
apology from

34:55.260 --> 35:00.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yesterday,
Charlotte television
reporter Steve Crump accepted an
apology from

35:00.432 --> 35:02.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Brian Eybers.

35:02.300 --> 35:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two men were involved in a
confrontation
last week during which Eybers
used the N-word.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Crump recorded it.

35:09.374 --> 35:14.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Crump was on assignment in
Charleston, South
Carolina, reporting on hurricane
recovery

35:14.112 --> 35:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when he walked past Eybers.

35:15.547 --> 35:19.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: The next two
videos include
use of the N-word.

35:19.884 --> 35:22.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE CRUMP, WBTV: What did you
call me?

35:22.520 --> 35:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRIAN EYBERS, South Carolina:
What?

35:24.189 --> 35:26.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE CRUMP: What did you just
call me?

35:26.825 --> 35:28.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIAN EYBERS: I called you sir.

35:28.827 --> 35:31.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE CRUMP: No, you didn't call
me sir.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You called me the N-word, right?

35:33.598 --> 35:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRIAN EYBERS: I did.

35:35.033 --> 35:37.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I believe I did call you the
N-word.

35:37.702 --> 35:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're a (EXPLETIVE DELETED)
idiot.

35:38.703 --> 35:39.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're ignorant.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you really are a nigger,
then.

35:41.473 --> 35:41.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the N-word
is one of
the most contentious words in
the English

35:41.840 --> 35:43.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
language.

35:43.608 --> 35:47.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault
its origins and use with Harvard
Law School

35:47.679 --> 35:52.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Professor Randall Kennedy as
part of our year-long
Race Matters Solutions series.

35:52.550 --> 35:55.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Professor Kennedy,
thank you for joining us.

35:55.754 --> 35:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY, Professor,
Harvard Law School:
Thank you.

35:57.555 --> 36:00.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: I don't
have to tell
you we are dealing with a very
contentious

36:00.291 --> 36:02.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
word, but it wasn't always that
way.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, take us back when it was
more benign.

36:05.363 --> 36:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: It's like many
words.

36:07.132 --> 36:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has a mysterious -- it sort
of rises from
the midst.

36:11.870 --> 36:19.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for instance, in 1619, when
there are
reports about the first blacks
brought to

36:19.144 --> 36:24.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
British North America, they are
referred to
as N-I-G-G-U-H-S.

36:24.582 --> 36:29.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it doesn't seem that that
was meant
in a derogatory way.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It seems merely descriptive.

36:31.122 --> 36:36.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: When did
it become
the kind of word that is so
controversial

36:36.494 --> 36:38.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today?

36:38.296 --> 36:42.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: Go back and
take a look at
what some black writers were
saying in the

36:42.567 --> 36:44.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
1820s, the 1830s.

36:44.669 --> 36:53.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They make mention of how some
white people
would tell their children, if
you don't behave,

36:53.745 --> 36:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're going to put you in the
nigger seat.

36:57.148 --> 37:03.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you don't behave, we are
going to make
you sit with the niggers.

37:03.888 --> 37:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why we know that, by
then, the word
had become a slur.

37:07.725 --> 37:11.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, why
are people,
like, you know, a very
successful, popular

37:11.763 --> 37:17.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comedian like Larry Wilmore, who
addressed
the president with the word at
the White House

37:17.202 --> 37:18.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Correspondents Dinner.

37:18.636 --> 37:22.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LARRY WILMORE, Comedian: So Mr.
President,
I'm going the keep it 100.

37:22.207 --> 37:24.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yo, Barry, you did it, my
nigger.

37:24.642 --> 37:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But also
a lot of
the rappers and people, what
don't they know?

37:29.414 --> 37:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are using it as almost a
term of endearment.

37:32.117 --> 37:37.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: The infamy of
nigger is -- it's
a word that has been used to
terrorize people,

37:37.922 --> 37:39.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to put people down.

37:39.657 --> 37:43.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it has also been used in
other ways.

37:43.361 --> 37:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's also been used as a way of
putting a
mirror up to racism.

37:48.633 --> 37:55.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Dick Gregory titled his
memoir "Nigger:
An Autobiography."

37:55.840 --> 38:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Richard Pryor had a number of
albums, "That
Nigger's Crazy," "Bicentennial
Nigger."

38:00.211 --> 38:05.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is he using nigger to put black
people down?

38:05.383 --> 38:07.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No, he's using it ironically.

38:07.152 --> 38:09.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's sometimes using it
playfully.

38:09.854 --> 38:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's using it often as a mirror
to shame racism.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD PRYOR, Comedian: And I
don't want
them hip white people coming up
to me and

38:18.930 --> 38:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calling me no nigger or telling
me nigger
jokes.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't like it.

38:23.134 --> 38:28.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: Then you have
got people
who have the idea of taking
nigger back.

38:28.406 --> 38:33.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you have some people who
say, well, nigger
has been used to take us down.

38:33.144 --> 38:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we are going to do is grab
this word
and we are going to use it for
our own purposes.

38:39.184 --> 38:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But do
they know the
history of it?

38:41.319 --> 38:45.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: Well, one of
the reasons
I wrote a book about this was
because I got

38:45.290 --> 38:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sense that there were
especially young
people who were using the word
who didn't

38:54.065 --> 38:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have an understanding of the
history behind
the word.

38:58.503 --> 39:04.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I spent 40 pages just giving
instance
after instance after instance of
the way in

39:05.009 --> 39:08.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which this word has been used to
hurt black
people.

39:08.313 --> 39:14.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Hasn't
it also been
used against other ethnic
groups, Chinese,

39:14.352 --> 39:15.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mormons, Jews?

39:15.787 --> 39:21.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: It's the atomic
bomb of racial
slurs.

39:21.693 --> 39:32.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the racial slur that has
been used in
other contexts, so, for
instance, Palestinians,

39:32.670 --> 39:38.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the niggers of the Middle East,
the Irish,
the niggers of Europe.

39:38.543 --> 39:42.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a term that has been
generalized around
the world.

39:42.780 --> 39:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you want to put somebody
down, analogize
them to the nigger.

39:48.486 --> 39:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Given
the power of
this particular word that we are
discussing,

39:52.523 --> 39:56.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the power of it to wound, what
is the solution
to that?

39:56.127 --> 39:59.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: I don't think
there is a
solution, other than education.

39:59.130 --> 40:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People ought to know that even
if you are
using the word without
malevolence, even if

40:05.970 --> 40:11.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you are attempting to use the
word in an ironic
way or as a term of endearment,
there's always

40:11.976 --> 40:13.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the problem of mistake.

40:13.878 --> 40:22.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I have gotten hundreds of
e-mails over
the years from white kids who
say the following:

40:22.887 --> 40:26.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm running around with my black
friends,
and we are listening to rap.

40:26.524 --> 40:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it OK if I say nigger because
we are shouting
the lyrics of these rap songs?

40:33.931 --> 40:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I say to people often that
it may very
well be that you're with your
friend.

40:39.070 --> 40:42.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It may very well be that you
have no bad intentions.

40:42.373 --> 40:48.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you are out in public,
and especially
if you are white, and you use
this word, there

40:48.479 --> 40:54.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the problem of the person
who's right next
to you who doesn't know you at
all, who doesn't

40:54.886 --> 40:59.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know what your intentions are,
who doesn't
know about your friendship with
your black

40:59.457 --> 41:01.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
buddy over here.

41:01.292 --> 41:07.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as soon as the word nigger
comes out of
your mouth, this person slaps
you, or worse.

41:07.498 --> 41:15.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simple prudence would dictate
that you use
this term very carefully, if
ever.

41:15.306 --> 41:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Some of
these younger
people using it are not using
the full word.

41:21.112 --> 41:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are abbreviating it.

41:23.348 --> 41:27.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: There are some
people who
make a big distinction between
nigga, which

41:28.019 --> 41:31.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they say is OK, and nigger.

41:31.255 --> 41:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in my view, it's important
to know about
that distinction, because some
people put

41:37.428 --> 41:38.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a lot of weight on it.

41:38.429 --> 41:40.198 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I don't.

41:40.231 --> 41:44.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, how
should people
who find it so offensive and who
understand

41:44.235 --> 41:47.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hurt associated with it
respond?

41:47.538 --> 41:57.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: What people
should do is
explain to their friends, to
their neighbors

41:57.115 --> 42:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how they feel when they confront
the word
nigger and why they feel the way
they feel.

42:03.254 --> 42:09.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a number of years ago, I was
in a book
store talking about my book
"Nigger."

42:09.761 --> 42:18.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a man said to me: Professor,
I have heard
all that you have to say and,
you know, your

42:18.202 --> 42:24.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- all of your analysis about
why it is that
sometimes nigger should be
tolerated.

42:24.542 --> 42:28.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have heard it, but I'm going
tell you something.

42:28.346 --> 42:35.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I hear the word nigger, I
remember when
that word was used by people who
wouldn't

42:35.319 --> 42:40.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allow me to vote and who put me
at the back
of the bus.

42:40.124 --> 42:45.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I hear that word,
that's what I think
about.

42:45.663 --> 42:46.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was very powerful.

42:46.664 --> 42:47.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Absolutely.

42:47.665 --> 42:51.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: That was very
powerful.

42:51.469 --> 42:55.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what I said to him was: Sir,
I understand.

42:55.206 --> 42:58.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand why you do not want
to hear this
word.

42:58.843 --> 43:06.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that people are
going to have
to talk with one another and
share these stories

43:06.384 --> 43:08.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and share these feelings.

43:08.152 --> 43:15.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that that's the only
way in which
we are going to come to a
higher, a deeper

43:15.193 --> 43:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understanding of why people have
the feelings
they have with respect to this,
the infamous

43:21.699 --> 43:23.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
N-word.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Professor Randall
Kennedy, I'm sure you're going
to get some

43:25.770 --> 43:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reactions to this, but thank you
for joining
us and being as honest as you
have been.

43:29.807 --> 43:34.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RANDALL KENNEDY: Thank you.

43:34.946 --> 43:48.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last week, we
aired a report
about new and old technologies
being used

43:48.926 --> 43:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to help clean up water runoff in
the nation's
heartland.

43:52.029 --> 43:58.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, a second report about
water and the
tensions between rural
agriculture and urban

43:58.336 --> 44:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
areas over keeping it clean.

44:00.271 --> 44:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Detroit Public Television,
David Biello
reports, as part of the
documentary "The Ethanol

44:05.676 --> 44:07.411 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Effect."

44:07.445 --> 44:10.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO, Detroit Public
Television: In
Des Moines, Iowa, Adam Mason is
preparing

44:10.748 --> 44:12.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dinner, washing vegetables with
tap water.

44:12.817 --> 44:16.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM MASON, Iowa: For a lot of
folks, it's
easy just to turn on the tap and
trust that

44:16.087 --> 44:17.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have clean water.

44:18.022 --> 44:21.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's nearly a half-million
Iowans who are
drinking water and who are
vulnerable.

44:21.592 --> 44:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Part of the cause
of Adam's
concern can be found 150 miles
away from Des

44:25.930 --> 44:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Moines in Storm Lake, Iowa.

44:29.033 --> 44:32.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Storm Lake is located in Buena
Vista County,
home to some of the richest
farmland in the

44:32.937 --> 44:34.739 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

44:34.772 --> 44:40.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Corn is king here, grown mostly
for animal
feed and ethanol.

44:40.678 --> 44:44.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Corn doesn't like to have its
feet wet, and
to keep the fields dry, pipes
have been installed

44:44.682 --> 44:46.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to drain water off the fields.

44:46.817 --> 44:50.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with that water goes the
fertilizer, fertilizer
laden with nitrate.

44:50.988 --> 44:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL STOWE, CEO, Des Moines
Water Works: We
have eight units here
constructed in about

44:55.626 --> 44:58.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1990-1992, before they became
operational.

44:58.329 --> 45:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Bill Stowe is the
chief executive
officer of the Des Moines Water
Works.

45:02.199 --> 45:09.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL STOWE: The big challenge
cleaning up
the water in the Raccoon and Des
Moines Rivers,

45:09.407 --> 45:14.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rivers that we take from,
they're surface
waters going through 10,000
square miles of

45:14.946 --> 45:20.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industrial agriculture upstream,
is the effects
of that industrial agriculture
on water quality.

45:20.918 --> 45:25.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're seeing water that's so
dirty, that we
have to build facilities like
this, which

45:25.289 --> 45:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arguably is the world's largest
nitrate-removal
facility, to be able to clean up
the water

45:30.361 --> 45:33.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to deliver it safely to our
customers here
in Central Iowa.

45:33.898 --> 45:39.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Nitrate is a
dangerous chemical
in drinking water; it stops
oxygen from entering

45:39.203 --> 45:41.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the human bloodstream.

45:41.238 --> 45:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nitrate-removal facility is
at capacity
and aging, and it may soon be
overwhelmed.

45:47.211 --> 45:51.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Des Moines Water Works wants
to have the
fertilizer runoff regulated as
pollution under

45:51.248 --> 45:56.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the federal Clean Water Act, and
has filed
a lawsuit against three rural
Iowa counties,

45:56.787 --> 46:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
claiming that the nitrate
they're removing
is a result of runoff from
fields upstream.

46:00.625 --> 46:04.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DALE ARENDS, Board of
Supervisors, Buena Vista
County: This is not Iowa nice.

46:04.362 --> 46:08.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Dale Arends is a
member of the
Board of Supervisors in Buena
Vista County.

46:08.933 --> 46:10.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's named in the lawsuit.

46:10.768 --> 46:14.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DALE ARENDS: This would change
agriculture
if Des Moines Water Works gets
what they want.

46:14.505 --> 46:19.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they were able to come out
here and tell
us how much water we could
remove from our

46:19.176 --> 46:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soils to make them farmable, you
would turn
Central Iowa back into a swamp,
which is what

46:24.782 --> 46:26.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it was 150 years ago.

46:26.651 --> 46:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: For the lawsuit to
be successful,
a court must first decide if the
fertilizer-rich

46:31.889 --> 46:35.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
water running off the fields
comes from under
the ground.

46:35.126 --> 46:40.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If a court decides it is
groundwater, then
Bill Stowe and the Des Moines
Water Works

46:40.164 --> 46:42.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have a valid case.

46:42.133 --> 46:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If a court decides the runoff is
storm water
running off the surface of the
fields, then

46:46.904 --> 46:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Des Moines Water Works has no
case.

46:50.708 --> 46:54.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Doug Gross is the legal counsel
for the Agribusiness
Association of Iowa.

46:54.311 --> 46:56.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG GROSS, Legal Counsel,
Agribusiness Association
of Iowa: This is like a prairie
fire in Iowa,

46:56.881 --> 47:01.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that we haven't seen anything
like this
for a long time, where one
component of the

47:01.652 --> 47:05.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
state is really directly
challenging the most
important industry in our state,
and has been

47:05.589 --> 47:08.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since the founding of the state
of Iowa, which
is agriculture.

47:08.092 --> 47:12.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BIELLO: Around the
country, environmental
activists are watching the
lawsuit, and big

47:12.363 --> 47:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ag has raised a lot of money to
help the counties
fight it.

47:15.466 --> 47:21.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's because Iowa isn't the
only state feeling
the effects of agricultural
pollution.

47:21.505 --> 47:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Great Lakes, excess
fertilizer spills
into Lake Erie near Toledo,
where charter

47:26.310 --> 47:28.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
boat captain Paul Pacholski
makes a living.

47:28.679 --> 47:34.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL PACHOLSKI, Charter Boat
Captain: Within
24 hours of the water coming out
a drain tile

47:34.552 --> 47:38.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a farm, it can be at the
mouth of the Lake
Erie.

47:38.289 --> 47:39.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's called the nutrient
superhighway.

47:39.957 --> 47:41.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Great for algae.

47:41.292 --> 47:42.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL PACHOLSKI: Great for algae.

47:42.393 --> 47:44.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: That algae is
toxic.

47:44.462 --> 47:47.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It thrives on the fertilizer
running off the
farm fields.

47:47.431 --> 47:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2014, a massive algal bloom
shut down the
city of Toledo's water supply
for three days.

47:53.437 --> 47:55.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's also bad for Paul's
business.

47:55.439 --> 47:59.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL PACHOLSKI: Do you want to
go to an area
that you have got to worry about
your health

47:59.944 --> 48:06.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afterwards, or do you want to go
to an area
that is pristine and beautiful
with the good

48:06.283 --> 48:08.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
clear water?

48:08.052 --> 48:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Some Great Lakes
states have
begun to take steps to control
fertilizer

48:11.722 --> 48:16.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
runoff, and Iowa has a voluntary
program in
place, called the Iowa Nutrient
Reduction

48:16.360 --> 48:18.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Strategy.

48:18.062 --> 48:20.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bill Northey is Iowa's secretary
of agriculture.

48:20.264 --> 48:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL NORTHEY, Iowa Secretary of
Agriculture:
Our nutrient reduction strategy
started four

48:23.033 --> 48:24.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years ago.

48:24.034 --> 48:25.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The lawsuit started a year ago.

48:25.503 --> 48:27.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we were in process of
engaging folks.

48:27.805 --> 48:31.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: So, would you
encourage Des
Moines Water Works to just drop
the suit?

48:31.776 --> 48:34.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL NORTHEY: I would be very
glad if the
suit went away.

48:34.211 --> 48:35.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's a big distraction.

48:35.813 --> 48:37.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it's expensive.

48:37.615 --> 48:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that money could be
better spent on
engaging producers and engaging
urban areas

48:43.187 --> 48:44.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on water quality.

48:44.655 --> 48:47.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL STOWE: It's the ag folks
that really
are driving this problem.

48:47.291 --> 48:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in this state, we regulate,
and some
would argue over-regulate,
cities and towns.

48:52.963 --> 48:55.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we leave unregulated
industrial agriculture.

48:55.232 --> 48:59.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, agriculture is
the king of
the block.

48:59.436 --> 49:06.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Therefore, leave it alone, and
hopefully a
voluntary system will bring in
conservation

49:06.043 --> 49:09.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
practices that will improve
water quality.

49:09.480 --> 49:13.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We say, no pun intended, hogwash
to that,
hasn't worked, won't work.

49:13.417 --> 49:18.355 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
DALE ARENDS: They have forced
themselves to
spend over
three-quarters-of-a-million
dollars.

49:18.389 --> 49:22.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have forced us to spend
over a million
dollars, and nothing has really
changed.

49:22.660 --> 49:25.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Dale Arends isn't
the only one
raising his voice.

49:25.796 --> 49:31.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Bill Stowe forced a
double-digit
increase in water fees, while he
is set to

49:31.435 --> 49:33.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
receive a $500,000 bonus.

49:33.270 --> 49:36.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: A group called the
Iowa Partnership
for Clean Water is fighting the
lawsuit like

49:36.640 --> 49:38.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a political campaign.

49:38.442 --> 49:41.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's running anti-Stowe TV ads.

49:41.912 --> 49:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The lawsuit could be tied up in
court for
years, maybe even a decade.

49:45.883 --> 49:49.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That leaves the fate of Adam
Mason and other
customers of the Des Moines
Water Works up

49:49.687 --> 49:51.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the air.

49:51.055 --> 49:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM MASON: It's no longer
whether or not
we have a water crisis.

49:53.891 --> 49:56.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone acknowledges we're in a
water crisis
now.

49:56.493 --> 49:58.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is, how do we fix
it and who's
going to pay?

49:58.696 --> 50:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: For the "PBS
NewsHour, I'm David
Biello in Des Moines, Iowa.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And to learn
about technologies
farmers in the Nebraska and Iowa
are using

to reduce agricultural
contaminants in water,
visit PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:16.447 --> 50:22.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now, revisit
a 2012 conversation between our
own Margaret

50:22.052 --> 50:27.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Warner and former Supreme Court
Justice David
Souter, where they discussed
what he then

50:27.358 --> 50:30.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saw as the greatest threat to
the republic.

50:30.561 --> 50:32.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's an excerpt:

50:32.263 --> 50:35.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SOUTER, Former Supreme
Court Justice:
What I worry about is that, when
problems

50:35.432 --> 50:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not addressed, people will
not know who
is responsible.

50:41.238 --> 50:47.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when the problems get bad
enough, as they
might do, for example, with
another serious

50:47.745 --> 50:55.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorist attack, as they might
do with another
financial meltdown, some one
person will come

50:55.185 --> 51:01.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward and say, give me total
power and I
will solve this problem.

51:01.859 --> 51:05.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is how the Roman republic
fell.

51:05.062 --> 51:13.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Augustus became emperor not
because he arrested
the Roman Senate.

51:13.904 --> 51:18.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He became emperor because he
promised that
he would solve problems that
were not being

51:18.742 --> 51:20.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
solved.

51:21.011 --> 51:29.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we know who is responsible, I
have enough
faith in the American people to
demand performance

51:29.820 --> 51:31.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from those responsible.

51:31.388 --> 51:35.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we don't know, we will stay
away from the
polls.

51:35.125 --> 51:41.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will not demand it, and the
day will come
when somebody will come forward,
and we and

51:41.832 --> 51:46.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the government will, in effect,
say, take
the ball and run with it.

51:46.437 --> 51:49.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do what you have to do.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is the way democracy dies.

51:51.408 --> 51:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You can watch
Margaret's entire
conversation with Justice Souter

And that's the "NewsHour" for

explores political
bots, how computer programs are
helping shape

52:11.795 --> 52:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the conversation around the
election on Twitter.

52:15.332 --> 52:16.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.
