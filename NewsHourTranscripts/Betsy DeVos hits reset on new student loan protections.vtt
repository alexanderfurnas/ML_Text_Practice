JUDY WOODRUFF: Since
her nomination as U.S.
Secretary of Education,
Betsy DeVos has become

00:05.233 --> 00:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the more polarizing
figures in the Trump Cabinet,
often over school choice.

00:12.166 --> 00:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But her early tenure marks a big
departure from her predecessors
when it comes to higher

00:16.466 --> 00:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
education and student loans.

00:18.100 --> 00:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's the focus
of our Making the Grade
conversation tonight.

00:21.933 --> 00:23.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has more.

00:23.966 --> 00:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Late in the Obama
administration, new rules were
established to allow student

00:26.600 --> 00:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
borrowers to have their debt
erased if they'd been victims
of fraud by for-profit schools.

00:33.633 --> 00:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as the new rules were set
to take effect this month,
the new administration called

00:36.166 --> 00:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a freeze, with Secretary
DeVos saying they were created
in a -- quote -- "muddled

00:41.100 --> 00:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
process that's unfair to
students and schools."

00:44.333 --> 00:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Days ago, 18 states and
the District of Columbia
responded to that with
a lawsuit challenging

00:50.233 --> 00:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Education Department.

00:52.366 --> 00:56.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The freeze is just one
in a series of moves by
the new administration
that take a different

00:56.066 --> 00:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approach to student loans
from its predecessor.

00:59.433 --> 01:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anya Kamenetz covers education
for NPR, and joins us now.

01:03.533 --> 01:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Anya, first, remind us
the extent of this problem, of
students on the hook with loans

01:10.133 --> 01:13.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to for-profit colleges
and all the criticisms
of predatory practices.

01:13.200 --> 01:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANYA KAMENETZ, NPR: So,
for-profit colleges at
their height enrolled
about one in 10 students

01:19.600 --> 01:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nationwide, and they're not just
your old cosmetology school.

01:23.166 --> 01:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are national and in many
cases online programs that
targeted working families.

01:28.100 --> 01:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, without painting the entire
sector with the same brush, we
did see over the last decade

01:35.633 --> 01:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many, many different
actions against for-profit
colleges, accusing them of
predatory and fraudulent

01:40.266 --> 01:42.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
treatment.

01:42.333 --> 01:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there were two large
colleges that shut down in the
last two years, Corinthian and

01:45.533 --> 01:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ITT Tech, with collectively
tens of thousands of students.

01:48.733 --> 01:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All
right, so I mentioned
the Obama administration,
they put in rules to

01:52.500 --> 01:56.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
address the problem, and
they created a so-called
borrower defense.

01:56.466 --> 01:58.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Explain that.

01:58.533 --> 02:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ: So, borrower
defense to repayment had been
a law on the books for a while.

02:04.633 --> 02:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it was sort of a
case-by-case ability or
pathway for a borrower
who had been defrauded

02:10.166 --> 02:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by a college to be able
to escape their loans.

02:13.400 --> 02:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what happened was,
with tens of thousands of
students affected by the
ITT Tech and Corinthian

02:18.133 --> 02:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shutdown, there was a real
need to clarify and to
simplify that regulation.

02:25.066 --> 02:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, after a very
long negotiated public
process, borrower
defense to repayment was

02:28.933 --> 02:30.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
put in place.

02:30.900 --> 02:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And basically what it said
was that students could have
their repayment automated, they

02:35.766 --> 02:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wouldn't have to
apply case by case.

02:37.733 --> 02:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it included a really
important clause that students
wouldn't have to agree to waive

02:43.933 --> 02:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
their rights through
arbitration, so that
when -- you know, many
of these for-profit

02:46.833 --> 02:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colleges had a rule on the
books that when you applied,
you said, we're not -- I'm not

02:50.300 --> 02:53.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to sue you and I
agree to arbitration.

02:53.100 --> 02:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something that
borrower defense included as
well, which is pretty important

02:56.766 --> 02:58.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
so that was supposed to
go into effect on July 1.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Betsy DeVos put that on hold.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is her argument?

03:04.366 --> 03:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then, of course, the states
jumped in with a lawsuit.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So what's the counterargument?

03:09.333 --> 03:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ: So, we should
mention that, in addition to
pressing pause or hitting reset

03:13.066 --> 03:18.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on borrowed defense
to repayment, which is
like the remedy, Betsy
DeVos also has rolled

03:20.066 --> 03:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back something called gainful
employment, which you might
think of as the prevention.

03:22.566 --> 03:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And gainful employment
also regulates for-profit
colleges and other
career programs based on

03:27.933 --> 03:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the debt-to-income
ratio of their students.

03:30.033 --> 03:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, with those two in mind, the
lawsuit essentially says that
it's a violation of law for the

03:36.200 --> 03:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Education Department to
unilaterally strike down this
rule after this very, very long

03:40.733 --> 03:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and public negotiation process.

03:43.333 --> 03:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with the reset button
being hit, what we saw this
week is consumer advocates and

03:50.366 --> 03:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students once again taking to
the podium to testify and talk
about their experiences and

03:55.966 --> 03:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why they believe that these
two rules should stay in place.

03:58.533 --> 04:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, just in
our last minute now, I just
want to expand to more generally

04:02.333 --> 04:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
look at the overall
student loan problem.

04:05.100 --> 04:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where do you see the major
differences and the major
flash points now with
the new administration?

04:10.033 --> 04:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANYA KAMENETZ: Well, I think we
saw, with Obama taking office
right around the financial

04:17.133 --> 04:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
crisis, the creation of
the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau, which
became a major watchdog

04:20.066 --> 04:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on behalf of students, and many,
many actions taken against the
for-profit sector, but really

04:26.266 --> 04:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also against student
lenders in general.

04:28.500 --> 04:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been a real atmosphere
of, I would say, crackdown
in regulation and consumer

04:34.100 --> 04:36.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
advocacy.

04:36.566 --> 04:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the tenor has
certainly changed in
terms of the announcements
coming out of the DeVos

04:40.066 --> 04:42.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

04:42.166 --> 04:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has hired former for-profit
college students - - sorry --
she has hired former for-profit

04:45.700 --> 04:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
college executives to advise
her, as well as putting in
charge of federal student aid

04:51.866 --> 04:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the CEO of a private
student loan company.

04:53.966 --> 04:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She has made a lot of
announcements on behalf
of things that will
save taxpayers money and

05:00.733 --> 05:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lead to less burden on
colleges and universities,
including for-profit colleges.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so a lot of her statements
really made clear that she
doesn't intend to impose onerous

05:08.266 --> 05:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulatory burdens
on either for-profit
colleges or other types of
colleges, as well as the

05:14.133 --> 05:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
student loan industry as well.

05:15.666 --> 05:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Anya Kamenetz
of NPR, thank you very much.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANYA KAMENETZ:
Thank you, Jeffrey.

05:19.633 --> 05:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And thanks
to Jeff and to Anya.
