07:05.825 --> 07:08.028
GOTTEN TICKETS FOR TWO TRAFFIC

07:08.028 --> 07:09.996
INFRACTIONS AND BOTH WERE

07:09.996 --> 07:11.231
ORDERED TO APPEAR IN THE

07:11.231 --> 07:12.365
CHILDERSBURG MUNICIPAL COURT.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.000
THE FUGATTS TOLD THE JUDGE ABOUT

07:14.000 --> 07:15.669
THEIR HOSPITALIZED SON AND WERE

07:15.669 --> 07:16.836
BOTH FOUND "NOT GUILTY", AS

07:16.836 --> 07:17.904
THESE COURT DOCUMENTS SHOW.

07:17.904 --> 07:21.675
BUT THE JUDGE RULED THAT THE TWO

07:21.675 --> 07:23.243
STILL HAD TO PAY COURT COSTS OF

07:23.243 --> 07:25.178
ABOUT $500.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.413
DURING THIS PERIOD, TIMOTHY

07:26.413 --> 07:27.847
FUGATT SAYS HE WAS SPENDING SO

07:27.847 --> 07:29.182
MUCH TIME AT THE HOSPITAL WITH

07:29.182 --> 07:30.317
HIS SON THAT HE COULDN'T HOLD

07:30.317 --> 07:31.318
DOWN A JOB, AND WITH HIS WIFE

07:31.318 --> 07:33.086
ALSO NOT WORKING, THEY COULDN'T

07:33.086 --> 07:34.554
AFFORD TO PAY THE COURT COSTS.

07:34.554 --> 07:35.955
SO THEIR CASE WAS TURNED OVER TO

07:35.955 --> 07:37.424
JUDICIAL CORRECTIONS SERVICES, A

07:37.424 --> 07:39.292
PRIVATE COMPANY THAT COLLECTS

07:39.292 --> 07:42.762
FINES FOR THE CITY.

07:42.762 --> 07:43.430
FUGATT SAYS THAT JUDICIAL

07:43.430 --> 07:45.932
CORRECTIONS SERVICES, KNOWN AS

07:45.932 --> 07:47.634
J.C.S., TOLD HIM THAT HE AND HIS

07:47.634 --> 07:49.302
WIFE COULD BE JAILED IF THEY

07:49.302 --> 07:51.871
DIDN'T PAY WHAT THEY OWED.

07:51.871 --> 07:53.306
>> THEY WOULD JUST PLAIN OUT

07:53.306 --> 07:54.407
SAY, YOU KNOW, "IF YOU CAN'T PAY

07:54.407 --> 07:55.642
THEN THEY'LL ISSUE YOU A WARRANT

07:55.642 --> 07:58.878
FOR YOUR ARREST."

07:58.878 --> 08:00.980
>> Reporter: DID THAT SCARE YOU?

08:00.980 --> 08:02.615
>> OF COURSE.

08:02.615 --> 08:03.883

08:03.883 --> 08:04.918
THE BEST HE COULD TO PAY OFF HIS

08:04.918 --> 08:06.019
FAMILY'S FINES, BUT SAYS WHEN HE

08:06.019 --> 08:07.187
COULDN'T CONTINUE TO PAY AND HE

08:07.187 --> 08:08.788
AND HIS WIFE MISSED AT LEAST ONE

08:08.788 --> 08:09.889
COURT DATE, THEY WERE ARRESTED

08:09.889 --> 08:11.791
AND JAILED.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.159
>> I FELT COMPLETELY LIKE A

08:13.159 --> 08:14.394
CRIMINAL.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.829
I MEAN I DIDN'T SELL DRUGS.

08:15.829 --> 08:16.696
I DIDN'T BREAK INTO ANYONE'S

08:16.696 --> 08:18.031
HOME.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.666
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.068
I HAD AN EXPIRED TAG.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.169
>> Reporter: SO YOU AND YOUR

08:23.169 --> 08:24.304
WIFE WERE FOUND NOT GUILTY OF

08:24.304 --> 08:25.238

08:25.238 --> 08:27.407
STILL YOU WERE BEING ARRESTED.

08:27.407 --> 08:30.877
>> WE WERE BEING ARRESTED, YES.

08:30.877 --> 08:33.880
I WAS VERY UPSET, VERY ANGRY.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.315

08:35.315 --> 08:36.416
SEVERAL HOURS LATER WHEN A

08:36.416 --> 08:37.250

08:37.250 --> 08:40.086
THEY OWED.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.388
THAT INCIDENT CONTRIBUTED TO THE

08:41.388 --> 08:42.622
FUGATTS' DECISION TO BECOME PART

08:42.622 --> 08:44.257
OF A LAWSUIT AGAINST JUDICIAL

08:44.257 --> 08:46.259
CORRECTIONS SERVICES AND THE

08:46.259 --> 08:48.395
TOWN OF CHILDERSBURG.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.462
THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT

08:49.462 --> 08:52.031
INCARCERATING PEOPLE WHO CAN'T

08:52.031 --> 08:53.400
PAY THEIR FINES VIOLATES THE

08:53.400 --> 08:53.900
CONSTITUTION.

08:53.900 --> 08:54.801
THOUGH SOME EXPERTS ARGUE THAT

08:54.801 --> 08:55.702
JAIL TIME IS LEGAL FOR THOSE WHO

08:55.702 --> 08:56.603
DON'T MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT

08:56.603 --> 08:57.704
TO PAY THEIR FINES, IN 1971 THE

08:57.704 --> 08:58.805
SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE

08:58.805 --> 08:59.739
CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS IMPOSING

08:59.739 --> 09:00.774
"A JAIL TERM SOLELY BECAUSE THE

09:00.774 --> 09:01.775
DEFENDANT IS INDIGENT AND CANNOT

09:01.775 --> 09:02.742
FORTHWITH PAY THE FINE IN FULL."

09:02.742 --> 09:03.710

09:03.710 --> 09:04.677
HAPPENING HERE.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.352
SIMILAR SITUATIONS.

09:15.488 --> 09:18.057
AFFORD TO PAY A FINE.

09:18.057 --> 09:18.992

09:18.992 --> 09:19.759
PRISON IS OVER.

09:19.759 --> 09:20.527
IT'S BEHIND US.

09:20.527 --> 09:21.194
IT ISN'T.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.395
AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE, AND IN

09:22.395 --> 09:23.763
SOME CASES, POLICY, THE COURTS

09:23.763 --> 09:26.065
ASK ONE QUESTION, "CAN YOU PAY

09:26.065 --> 09:27.434
THE FINE?"

09:27.434 --> 09:31.838
IF YOU CAN'T THEN YOU HAVE TO

09:31.838 --> 09:32.605
WHAT'S CALLED, "SIT IT OUT IN

09:32.605 --> 09:33.773
JAIL."

09:33.773 --> 09:34.808
THAT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNLESS

09:34.808 --> 09:35.875
THE COURT FIRST CONDUCTS AN

09:35.875 --> 09:36.776
INQUIRY INTO WHETHER THEY'RE

09:36.776 --> 09:38.011
INDIGENT AND THE CAUSES FOR

09:38.011 --> 09:39.479
THEIR INABILITY TO PAY THE FINE.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.480
ROUTINELY WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE

09:40.480 --> 09:41.448
IS THAT NO SUCH INQUIRY IS

09:41.448 --> 09:43.016
UNDERTAKEN.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.717
>> DID ANYONE IN THE COURT EVERY

09:44.717 --> 09:45.418
TRY AND ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT

09:45.418 --> 09:47.020
YOU COULD AFFORD THE PAY THE

09:47.020 --> 09:51.724
FEES?

09:51.724 --> 09:53.326
>> NO, SIR.

09:53.326 --> 09:53.993
IT WAS JUST PASS AND GO.

09:53.993 --> 09:54.994
IT WAS REALLY FAST.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.063
IT WAS REALLY FAST.

09:57.063 --> 09:57.997
>> Reporter: COLLECTING FINES IS

09:57.997 --> 09:58.965
MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BECAUSE

09:58.965 --> 09:59.833
MANY CITIES FACE BUDGET

09:59.833 --> 10:00.533
SHORTFALLS.

10:00.533 --> 10:01.534

THE PERSONNEL TO COLLECT THE

WHAT ARE KNOWN AS PRIVATE

10:05.972 --> 10:07.407
PROBATION COMPANIES.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.608
THAT'S WHERE JUDICIAL

MORE EFFICIENT, AND THEY'RE

10:39.639 --> 10:40.707

13:19.599 --> 13:20.633
SERVICES AND YOU WOULD'VE SHOWN

13:20.633 --> 13:21.634
UP FOR ALL OF YOUR APPOINTMENTS

13:21.634 --> 13:22.735
WITH THEM AND TO THE COURTS,

13:22.735 --> 13:23.770
NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE EVER

13:23.770 --> 13:26.239
HAPPENED?

13:26.239 --> 13:29.375
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.610
IT WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED, BUT,

13:30.610 --> 13:34.414
YOU KNOW, THE SITUATION I WAS

13:34.414 --> 13:35.281
IN, I WAS DOING WHAT I COULD DO,

13:35.281 --> 13:38.051
YOU KNOW?

13:38.051 --> 13:39.252
I HAD A DYING CHILD, NO STEADY

13:39.252 --> 13:40.119
JOB AT THAT POINT BECAUSE WE

13:40.119 --> 13:44.157
WERE BACK AND FORTH TO THE

13:44.157 --> 13:45.124
HOSPITAL, I WAS DOING WHAT I

13:45.124 --> 13:46.359
COULD DO.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.460
>> Reporter: DAVID DINELLI OF

13:47.460 --> 13:48.561
THE SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER

13:48.561 --> 13:49.562
SAYS THAT PEOPLE LIKE THE

13:49.562 --> 13:50.630
FUGATTS END UP PAYING J.C.S. OFF

13:50.630 --> 13:51.698
FOR YEARS BECAUSE OF ALL THE

13:51.698 --> 13:52.565
ADDITIONAL FEES AND ADDED FINES

13:52.565 --> 13:53.566
THAT THEY OFTEN ACCRUE.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.701
>> THEY'RE IN A SYSTEM IN WHICH

13:54.701 --> 13:55.968
ALL THEY ARE DOING IS PAYING

13:55.968 --> 13:57.170
J.C.S., JUDICIAL COLLECTION

13:57.170 --> 13:57.937
SERVICES ON A MONTHLY BASIS FOR

13:57.937 --> 13:59.005
THE PRIVILEGE OF STAYING OUT OF

13:59.005 --> 14:01.374
JAIL.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.642
>> Reporter: WE ASKED LEGAL

14:02.642 --> 14:04.177
SCHOLAR AND COLUMBIA LAW

14:04.177 --> 14:05.445
PROFESSOR GILLIAN METZGER TO

14:05.445 --> 14:07.647
TAKE A LOOK AT THE LAWSUIT AND

14:07.647 --> 14:08.648
TO EVALUATE THE

14:08.648 --> 14:09.682
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF PRIVATE

14:09.682 --> 14:10.650
COMPANIES, LIKE JUDICIAL

14:10.650 --> 14:11.684
CORRECTION SERVICES, COLLECTING

14:11.684 --> 14:12.652
FINES FOR CITIES LIKE

14:12.652 --> 14:13.252
CHILDERSBURG.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.220
SHE HAS NO INVOLVEMENT IN THE

14:14.220 --> 14:15.655
CASE.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.091
>> PART OF WHAT DUE PROCESS

14:18.091 --> 14:18.858
REQUIRES IS THAT YOU HAVE AN

14:18.858 --> 14:20.326
IMPARTIAL DECISION MAKER.

14:20.326 --> 14:21.227
AND IF THE COMPANY THAT IS

14:21.227 --> 14:22.195
IMPOSING THE FEES AND CONTINUING

14:22.195 --> 14:23.296
YOUR SUPERVISION HAS A FINANCIAL

14:23.296 --> 14:24.397
INTEREST IN YOUR STAYING UNDER

14:24.397 --> 14:27.734
SUPERVISION, THEN THAT REALLY

14:27.734 --> 14:29.135
CALLS THEIR IMPARTIALITY INTO

14:29.135 --> 14:30.269
QUESTION.

14:30.269 --> 14:31.104
AND THEY HAVE A FINANCIAL

14:31.104 --> 14:32.872
MOTIVE.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.940
>> Reporter: METZGER ALSO SAYS

14:33.940 --> 14:35.108
THE COURT IS OBLIGATED TO

14:35.108 --> 14:36.142
PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS FOR

14:36.142 --> 14:37.710
AN INDIVIDUAL TO PAY OFF A DEBT

14:37.710 --> 14:38.678
TO SOCIETY, SUCH AS COMMUNITY

14:38.678 --> 14:39.412
SERVICE, IF HE OR SHE IS

14:39.412 --> 14:40.980
INDIGENT.

14:40.980 --> 14:41.814
>> IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING BECAUSE

14:41.814 --> 14:42.815
YOU'RE JUST TOO POOR TO PAY,

14:42.815 --> 14:43.750
THEN THE COURT CAN'T

14:43.750 --> 14:44.851
AUTOMATICALLY IMPRISON YOU.

14:44.851 --> 14:45.985
THEY HAVE TO DO AN INVESTIGATION

14:45.985 --> 14:48.955
ABOUT ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

14:48.955 --> 14:50.223
IN ORDER TO ALLOW YOU TO WORK

14:50.223 --> 14:50.990
OFF THE FINE IN SOME OTHER WAY.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.192
>> Reporter: WE REACHED OUT TO

14:53.192 --> 14:54.694
J.C.S. MULTIPLE TIMES FOR AN

14:54.694 --> 14:56.395
INTERVIEW, BUT WE NEVER RECEIVED

14:56.395 --> 14:57.497
A REPLY.

14:57.497 --> 15:03.002
BUT ON ITS WEBSITE J.C.S. SAYS

15:03.002 --> 15:04.771
THE LAWSUIT IS BASELESS.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.240
WE ALSO TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY

15:07.240 --> 15:11.911
SEVERAL TIMES TO ASK THE MAYOR

15:11.911 --> 15:13.279
OF CHILDERSBURG, "B.J." MEEKS,

15:13.279 --> 15:14.280
IF HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE

15:14.280 --> 15:15.214
SERVICES J.C.S. HAS BEEN

15:15.214 --> 15:15.915
PROVIDING THE CITY, BUT CITY

15:15.915 --> 15:16.916
HALL NEVER RESPONDED TO OUR

15:16.916 --> 15:17.717
REQUEST.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.785
SO WE WENT TO A CITY COUNCIL

15:18.785 --> 15:22.455
MEETING TO ASK.

15:22.455 --> 15:23.556
AFTER SPEAKING TO SOME OF THE

15:23.556 --> 15:24.457
RESIDENTS HERE, THEY FEEL LIKE

15:24.457 --> 15:25.358
THEY'VE BEEN THREATENED WITH A

15:25.358 --> 15:26.192
JAIL SENTENCE IF THEY DON'T PAY

15:26.192 --> 15:27.126
THEIR FINES AND I WONDER IF YOU

15:27.126 --> 15:28.161
HAD A COMMENT.

15:28.161 --> 15:28.995
>> WELL, THEN THAT'S UP TO THE

15:28.995 --> 15:29.695
COURT SYSTEM.

15:29.695 --> 15:35.034
IS, YOU KNOW...

15:35.034 --> 15:36.102
>> Reporter: I MEAN, IS IT NOT

15:36.102 --> 15:37.336
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO JAIL

15:37.336 --> 15:38.704
SOMEBODY WHO CANNOT PAY THEIR

15:38.704 --> 15:41.741
FEE?

15:41.741 --> 15:43.276
>> I DON'T KNOW.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.544
AGAIN, IF THE COURT SYSTEM IS

15:44.544 --> 15:45.678
SATISFIED WITH IT UNDER STATE

15:45.678 --> 15:46.813
SUPREME COURT JURISDICTION, I

15:46.813 --> 15:49.782
KNOW THAT WE CONTRACT, WE ARE

15:49.782 --> 15:50.917
ONE OF THE MANY, MANY CITIES IN

15:50.917 --> 15:52.018
ALABAMA THAT USES CONTRACT

15:52.018 --> 15:52.919
SERVICE, AND THE REASON BEING

15:52.919 --> 15:54.053
BECAUSE OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH

15:54.053 --> 15:55.688
PERSONNEL, WE HAVE.

15:55.688 --> 15:56.489
>> Reporter: EVEN STATE SENATOR

15:56.489 --> 15:57.323
CAM WARD, WHO SUPPORTS THE

15:57.323 --> 15:58.291
PRIVATE PROBATION INDUSTRY, HAS

15:58.291 --> 15:59.125
CONCERNS.

15:59.125 --> 15:59.992
>> WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN EXISTENCE

15:59.992 --> 16:00.893
IS ALMOST LIKE THE WILD WEST.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.596
THERE IS NO REGULATION.

16:03.596 --> 16:07.767
IF YOU'RE GONNA CREATE A SYSTEM

16:07.767 --> 16:10.203
THAT IS A "DEBTORS PRISON," ALL

16:10.203 --> 16:11.904
YOU'RE DOING IS INVITING

16:11.904 --> 16:13.039
YOURSELF TO A FEDERAL LAWSUIT,

16:13.039 --> 16:17.210
IS WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.277
>> Reporter: AS FOR THE FUGATTS,

16:18.277 --> 16:19.312
AFTER BEING CHARGED AN INITIAL

16:19.312 --> 16:20.246
COURT COST OF ABOUT $500 FOR

16:20.246 --> 16:21.280
TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS OF WHICH THEY

16:21.280 --> 16:22.181
WERE FOUND NOT GUILTY.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.049
COURT DOCUMENTS PROVIDED BY THE

16:23.049 --> 16:24.083
FUGATTS' LAWYERS SHOW THAT

16:24.083 --> 16:25.351
THEY'VE PAID ALMOST $1,300 TO

16:25.351 --> 16:26.285
THE CHILDERSBURG COURT.

16:26.285 --> 16:27.386
IT'S A NUMBER THAT DOESN'T EVEN

16:27.386 --> 16:28.254
INCLUDE ALL THE ADDITIONAL

16:28.254 --> 16:29.155
MONTHLY FEES THEY PAID TO

16:29.155 --> 16:31.724
JUDICIAL CORRECTION SERVICES.

16:31.724 --> 16:32.925
A FIGURE THE CITY OF

16:32.925 --> 16:34.260
CHILDERSBURG DECLINED TO PROVIDE

16:34.260 --> 16:39.265
US DUE TO PENDING LITIGATION.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.967
>> Reporter: TIMOTHY FUGATT SAYS

16:40.967 --> 16:42.168
THAT HIS FAMILY STILL OWES MORE

16:42.168 --> 16:43.603
MONEY TO JUDICIAL CORRECTIONS

16:43.603 --> 16:44.370
SERVICES.

16:44.370 --> 16:45.304
HOW MUCH?

16:45.304 --> 16:46.405
HE'S NOT SURE.

16:46.405 --> 16:48.374
HE SAYS J.C.S. STOPPED

16:48.374 --> 16:50.243
CONTACTING HIM AFTER THE LAWSUIT

16:50.243 --> 16:53.179
WAS FILED.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.747
WHILE THE FUGATT'S CASE IS STILL

16:54.747 --> 16:55.982
PENDING, SINCE OUR STORY AIRED

16:55.982 --> 16:57.617
LAST SPRING THE CHILDERSBURG

16:57.617 --> 17:02.154
MUNICIPAL COURT RECENTLY ISSUED

17:03.189 --> 17:04.156
"IN NO CASE SHALL AN INDIGENT

17:19.739 --> 17:20.873
IN A STATEMENT TO NEWSHOUR THE

17:20.873 --> 17:22.708
CITY OF CHILDERSBURG SAYS IT IS

"PLEASED WITH THE ACTIONS TAKEN

17:24.010 --> 17:26.479

PRESS ATTENTION, INTO A MODEL

17:29.282 --> 17:31.550
FOR OTHER COURTS TO FOLLOW.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.185

THE CITY OF MONTGOMERY, THAT

17:34.420 --> 17:35.621
ALSO HIRED JUDICIAL CORRECTION

17:47.934 --> 17:50.036
UNLAWFULLY JAILED.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.904
THE SETTLEMENT REQUIRES

MONTGOMERY TO STOP CONTRACTING

17:53.105 --> 17:54.807
WITH JUDICIAL CORRECTION

18:13.526 --> 18:15.027
HEARD EXPERTS PREDICT THAT

18:15.027 --> 18:16.362
CONSUMERS WOULD USE THE MONEY

18:16.362 --> 18:18.064
THEY'RE SAVING ON GAS TO SPEND

18:18.064 --> 18:18.931
MORE ON CHRISTMAS GIFTS.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.232
DID IT TURN OUT THAT WAY?

18:20.232 --> 18:21.200
FOR MORE ABOUT THE CHRISTMAS

18:21.200 --> 18:22.635
SHOPPING SEASON, WE ARE JOINED

18:30.309 --> 18:31.677
SO CONSIDERING WE HAVE A

18:31.677 --> 18:32.378
COUPLE OF DAYS LEFT IN THE

18:32.378 --> 18:33.245
CALENDAR YEAR BUT REALLY THE

18:33.245 --> 18:34.380
RETAIL SEASON STARTS AROUND

18:34.380 --> 18:36.015
THANKSGIVING, HOW DID WE DO

18:36.015 --> 18:36.916
SO FAR?

18:36.916 --> 18:39.118
>> SO FAR, SO GOOD.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.219
WE ARE REALLY STARTING TO

18:40.219 --> 18:42.855
SEE THE RESULTS INTO JANUARY

18:42.855 --> 18:44.890
AND ONCE THE GOVERNMENT

18:44.890 --> 18:46.392
REPORTS ITS SPENDING DATA

18:46.392 --> 18:48.094
AND SOME OF THE LARGEST

18:48.094 --> 18:48.728
RETAILERS REPORT THEIR

18:48.728 --> 18:50.763
QUARTERLY EARNINGS-- EARNINGS.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.131
BUT EARLY INDICATIONS SHOW

18:52.131 --> 18:53.532
THAT SO FAR CHRISTMAS

18:53.532 --> 18:54.900
SHOPPERS, HOLIDAY SHOPPERS

18:54.900 --> 18:56.268
WERE COMING OUT IN FOR ITS

18:56.268 --> 18:58.371
THIS SEASON AND SPENDING A

18:58.371 --> 18:59.338
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THEY

18:59.338 --> 19:00.706
HAVE IN SEASON'S PAST.

19:00.706 --> 19:01.674
>> SO HOW MUCH OF THIS IS

19:01.674 --> 19:03.576
RELATED TO KIND OF AN

19:03.576 --> 19:04.810
INCREASED CONSUMER

19:04.810 --> 19:06.245
CONFIDENCE COMBINED WITH

19:06.245 --> 19:07.980
THAT DECREASE IN GAS PRICES

19:07.980 --> 19:09.248
THAT WE TALKED ABOUT?

19:09.248 --> 19:10.016
>> YEAH.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.350
EVERYONE LOVES TO TALK ABOUT

19:11.350 --> 19:12.985
THE GAS PRICES.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.487
THEY'VE BEEN DOWN.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.956
THEY'RE NOW DOWN BELOW $2 IN

19:16.956 --> 19:17.556
SOME STATES.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.959
AND THAT'S PUTTING ABOUT

19:19.959 --> 19:22.128
$450 MILLION A DAY INTO

19:22.128 --> 19:23.662
AMERICAN'S POCKETS.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.364
YOU KNOW, CONSUMERS WE'VE

19:25.364 --> 19:26.665
SPOKEN WITH HAVE SAID THAT

19:26.665 --> 19:28.501
HAVING THAT EXTRA BIT TO

19:28.501 --> 19:30.469
SPEND IS GOING A LONG WAY.

19:30.469 --> 19:31.904
ALTHOUGH SOME CONSUMERS ARE

19:31.904 --> 19:33.172
ALSO SAYING THEY'RE BEING A

19:33.172 --> 19:34.640
LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFUL WITH

19:34.640 --> 19:35.641
THAT EXTRA MONEY.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.343
AND SOME OF IT IS GOING TO

19:37.343 --> 19:38.010
SAVINGS.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.445
SO WE'RE REALLY STARTING TO

19:39.445 --> 19:41.313
TRY TO LOOK FOR HOW MUCH OF

19:41.313 --> 19:43.916
THAT EXTRA CASH EARNED BY

19:43.916 --> 19:45.251
FALLING GAS PRICES IS GOING

19:45.251 --> 19:46.952
TO BE PUT BACK INTO THE

19:46.952 --> 19:50.756
ECONOMY OR SAVED FOR SOME

19:50.756 --> 19:51.690
OTHER DAY.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.391
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT

19:52.391 --> 19:53.159
THAT KIND OF STANDARD

19:53.159 --> 19:54.593
QUESTION WE ASK, ARE THE

19:54.593 --> 19:56.429
ON-LINE RETAILERS TAKING

19:56.429 --> 19:57.930
BIGGER AND BIGGER CHUNKS OUT

WEB-BASED RETAILERS LIKE

THOSE ON-LINE SALES ARE

20:52.918 --> 20:54.253
GOING TO BE SHIPPED BACK.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.621
AND A LOT OF THE SHIPPING

20:55.621 --> 20:58.057

21:09.869 --> 21:11.070
RETAILERS HEADING TOWARDS

MOBILE.

21:11.637 --> 21:12.438
EVEN SMALL BUSINESSES ARE

21:12.438 --> 21:13.839
PUTTING OUT APPS NOW.

21:13.839 --> 21:14.840
IS IT MAKING A BIG

21:14.840 --> 21:15.574
DIFFERENCE.

21:15.574 --> 21:16.742
ARE PEOPLE BUYING OR

21:16.742 --> 21:19.011
SHOPPING ON THEIR CELL PHONES?

21:19.011 --> 21:20.446

21:20.446 --> 21:21.147
SOMETHING THAT IS PART OF

21:21.147 --> 21:23.048

BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS

21:26.152 --> 21:27.686
ARE TRYING TO GET BETTER AT.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.822
A LOT OF EFFORT HAS GONE

21:29.822 --> 21:32.291
INTO BUILDING BETTER MOBILE

21:32.291 --> 21:33.959
APPS FOR SHOPPING.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.695
YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF WEB

21:36.695 --> 21:38.664
ROOMING AND SHOWROOMING,

21:38.664 --> 21:39.498
BUZZWORDS WE HAVE BEEN

21:39.498 --> 21:40.533

21:52.478 --> 21:53.846
DECREASE IN IMPULSE SPENDING

22:05.858 --> 22:07.893
NOT LIKELY TO BUY OFF THE

22:07.893 --> 22:09.695

22:25.211 --> 22:26.579
ATTENDANCE NATURALLY SOARS

22:26.579 --> 22:27.780
AROUND CHRISTMAS TIME, BUT

22:27.780 --> 22:28.814
THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN ENGLAND

22:28.814 --> 22:30.349
DURING THE REST OF THE YEAR.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.584
IN FACT, MANY ANGLICAN CHURCHES

22:31.584 --> 22:32.952
HAVE CLOSED IN RECENT YEARS AS

22:32.952 --> 22:34.086
CONGREGATIONS HAVE WITHERED.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.321
NOW, AN EFFORT IS UNDERWAY TO

22:35.321 --> 22:36.622
PRESERVE SOME OF THESE HISTORIC

22:36.622 --> 22:38.090
BUILDINGS BY USING THEM IN SOME

22:38.090 --> 22:38.991
VERY UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS.

22:38.991 --> 22:39.992
NULUFAR HEDAYAT REPORTS FROM

22:39.992 --> 22:42.761
BRISTOL, ENGLAND.

22:42.761 --> 22:44.029
>> IT'S SUNDAY MORNING AND

22:44.029 --> 22:45.264
THAT COULD ONLY MEAN ONE

22:45.264 --> 22:48.100
THING, IT'S TIME FOR THE

22:48.100 --> 22:51.103
CIRCUS.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.738
♪ TAKE ME TO CHURCH

22:52.738 --> 22:54.106
>> ST. PAUL'S CHURCH WAS

22:54.106 --> 22:55.374
STRUGGLING FOR YEARS WITH

22:55.374 --> 22:56.575
DWINDLING CONGREGATIONS.

22:56.575 --> 22:58.310
SO MUCH SO THAT IT FELL OUT

22:58.310 --> 23:00.012
OF USE COMPLETELY.

23:00.012 --> 23:00.779
>> THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND

23:00.779 --> 23:03.182
WANTED TO GET ST. PAUL'S

23:03.182 --> 23:04.583
BACK INTO USE AND RESTORE IT

23:04.583 --> 23:06.285
AS A HUB FOR THE COMMUNITY.

23:06.285 --> 23:07.653
BUT THIS WOULD MEAN THAT IT

23:07.653 --> 23:09.355
COULD NO LONGER JUST BE A

23:09.355 --> 23:10.889
CHRISTIAN PLACE OF WORSHIP.

23:10.889 --> 23:16.295
IT WOULD HAVE TO DIVERSIFY.

23:16.295 --> 23:17.763
CUE-- MEDIA, A PERFORMERS

23:17.763 --> 23:18.964
GROUP THAT CALL THIS CHURCH

23:18.964 --> 23:19.632
THEIR HOME.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.667
>> THE CHURCH'S CONSERVATION

23:21.667 --> 23:23.369
TRUST ARE NOW RESPONSIBLE

23:23.369 --> 23:24.436
FOR ST. PAUL'S.

23:24.436 --> 23:27.039
THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HAS

23:27.039 --> 23:28.407
350 SITES INTO THEIR CARE.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.808
CHURCHES THAT WOULD

23:29.808 --> 23:31.010
OTHERWISE BECOME APARTMENTS

23:31.010 --> 23:32.177
OR DEMOLISHED.

23:32.177 --> 23:34.146
THE DEAL IS THAT ALL

23:34.146 --> 23:36.282
BUILDINGS REMAIN CONSECRATED

23:36.282 --> 23:37.983
AND THEREFORE CAN READILY BE

23:37.983 --> 23:39.118
TURNED BACK INTO A PLACE OF

23:39.118 --> 23:39.852
WORSHIP.

23:39.852 --> 23:40.786
>> WHAT WOULDN'T YOU HAVE IN

23:40.786 --> 23:41.387
THE CHURCH.

23:41.387 --> 23:42.454
>> OH THERE ARE PLENTY OF

23:42.454 --> 23:43.489
THINGS WE WOULDN'T HAVE.

23:43.489 --> 23:44.857
BUT CHURCH CORPORATION TRUST

23:44.857 --> 23:45.591
THINKS THAT THIS IS AN

23:45.591 --> 23:46.292
APPROPRIATE USE FOR THE

23:46.292 --> 23:46.959
CHURCH.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.361
ALL WE'VE DONE IS ADAPT AND

23:49.361 --> 23:50.462
CONVERT THIS CHURCH INTO A

23:50.462 --> 23:51.230
NEW USE.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.798
AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BE

23:52.798 --> 23:53.866
PEOPLE WHO WILL BE UNHAPPY

23:53.866 --> 23:54.500
ABOUT THAT.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.901
>> MY GRANDPARENTS ARE

23:55.901 --> 23:57.603
VICARS SO I THINK THEY MAY

23:57.603 --> 23:58.671
HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH IT.

23:58.671 --> 24:00.372
I THINK THEY WOULD FEEL IT'S

24:00.372 --> 24:02.474
NOT QUITE RIGHT BECAUSE THE

24:02.474 --> 24:03.942
BUILDING HAS GREAT RELIGIOUS

24:03.942 --> 24:04.843
IMPORTANCE FOR THEM.

24:04.843 --> 24:05.878
>> SOME MAY VIEW WHAT THE

24:05.878 --> 24:07.813
CHURCH OF ENGLAND IS DOING

24:07.813 --> 24:08.847
AS IMPROPER.

24:08.847 --> 24:10.049
BUT OTHERS ARE SAYING IT IS

24:10.049 --> 24:11.750
A PRACTICAL WAY OF AT LEAST

24:11.750 --> 24:13.252
HALTING THE DEMISE OF

24:13.252 --> 24:14.853
HISTORICAL AND RELIGIOUSLY

24:14.853 --> 24:17.389
