JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.839 --> 00:06.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.807 --> 00:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:09.710 --> 00:15.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: It is time
for us to come together as one
united people.

00:15.582 --> 00:18.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The voters have
spoken.

00:18.085 --> 00:21.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Donald J. Trump is the
president-elect of
the United States.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now the country looks for a path
forward.

00:24.024 --> 00:28.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We have seen that our nation is
more deeply

00:28.629 --> 00:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
divided than we thought, but I
still believe
in America, and I always will.

00:34.735 --> 00:39.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus, we bring
together
a variety of voices to reflect
what a Trump

00:39.506 --> 00:41.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
presidency means for the nation.

00:41.341 --> 00:46.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then, a view from
abroad -- how
the rest of the world is
reacting to Trump's

00:46.947 --> 00:48.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
win.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GILLIAN TETT, The Financial
Times: There has
also been a series of comments
from China

00:50.350 --> 00:56.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the fact that this makes
American democracy
look rather peculiar at best.

00:56.456 --> 01:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And why
prediction polls
and the media were so far off --
putting a

01:01.128 --> 01:03.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spotlight on what was missed in
election coverage.

01:03.830 --> 01:11.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:11.705 --> 01:14.574 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:14.608 --> 01:24.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
summed up her
crushing loss to Donald Trump
today, saying,

01:24.818 --> 01:28.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"This is painful, and it will be
for a long
time."

01:28.388 --> 01:33.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for the new president-elect,
he stayed
out of sight after claiming
victory in the

01:33.293 --> 01:34.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wee hours.

01:34.828 --> 01:42.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That left the national stage
today to Clinton,
for perhaps one last time.

01:42.336 --> 01:48.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sting of their shocking loss
was visible
on the faces of Clinton
supporters and staffers

01:48.041 --> 01:50.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in New York this morning as she
conceded defeat.

01:50.978 --> 01:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Last night, I congratulated
Donald Trump and

01:54.448 --> 01:58.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offered to work with him on
behalf of our
country.

01:58.385 --> 02:04.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I hope that he will be a
successful president
for all Americans.

02:04.124 --> 02:11.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen that our nation is
more deeply
divided than we thought, but I
still believe

02:11.231 --> 02:13.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in America, and I always will.

02:13.967 --> 02:21.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, if you do, then we must
accept this result
and then look to the future.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump is going to be our
president.

02:23.944 --> 02:27.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We owe him an open mind and the
chance to
lead.

02:27.414 --> 02:32.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The concession
came hours after
Trump was declared the winner,
with more than

02:32.886 --> 02:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 270 electoral votes needed
for election,
though Clinton led late today in
the popular

02:39.960 --> 02:41.461 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

02:41.495 --> 02:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She urged supporters, especially
young people
and women, not to lose heart.

02:45.699 --> 02:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I have
had successes
and I have had setbacks,
sometimes really

02:50.404 --> 02:52.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
painful ones.

02:52.873 --> 02:59.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of you are at the beginning
of your professional,
public and political careers.

02:59.813 --> 03:03.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You will have successes and
setbacks too.

03:03.750 --> 03:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This loss hurts, but please
never stop believing
that fighting for what's right
is worth it.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:15.629 --> 03:23.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I know
-- I know we
have still not shattered that
highest and

03:23.570 --> 03:30.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hardest glass ceiling, but,
someday, someone
will, and hopefully sooner than
we might think

03:30.243 --> 03:31.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:33.080 --> 03:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Roughly nine
hours earlier,
president-elect Trump had
declared victory,

03:38.185 --> 03:41.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
applauding his opponent and
calling for national
unity.

03:41.288 --> 03:46.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: Hillary
has worked very long and very
hard over a

03:46.927 --> 03:49.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
long period of time.

03:49.129 --> 03:54.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we owe her a major debt of
gratitude for
her service to our country.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean that very sincerely.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:58.338 --> 04:03.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Now it's time for
America to
bind the wounds of division.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to get together.

04:05.579 --> 04:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To all Republicans and Democrats
and independents
across this nation, I say it is
time for us

04:14.955 --> 04:18.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to come together as one united
people.

04:18.859 --> 04:25.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump also
reprised some of
the themes of his campaign,
hinting at potential

04:25.732 --> 04:28.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
priorities for his coming
administration.

04:28.034 --> 04:35.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I have spent my
entire life
in business looking at the
untapped potential

04:35.041 --> 04:39.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in projects and in people all
over the world.

04:39.346 --> 04:42.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is now what I want to do
for our country.

04:42.883 --> 04:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The forgotten men and women of
our country
will be forgotten no longer.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:50.624 --> 04:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
had gone all
out to make Clinton his
successor, but with

04:56.163 --> 04:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the question decided, he
announced he will
meet with Trump tomorrow.

04:59.966 --> 05:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The presidency and the vice
presidency is

05:03.537 --> 05:05.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bigger than any of us.

05:05.338 --> 05:10.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I have instructed my team to
follow the
example that President Bush's
team set eight

05:10.143 --> 05:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years ago, and work as hard as
we can to make
sure that this is a successful
transition

05:16.183 --> 05:23.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the president-elect, because
we are now
all rooting for his success in
uniting and

05:23.823 --> 05:25.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leading the country.

05:25.592 --> 05:29.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Like Clinton, Mr.
Obama had
argued Trump was unfit for the
White House.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, he urged Americans to
accept the result.

05:33.033 --> 05:40.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: We try really hard
to persuade
people that we are right.

05:40.473 --> 05:43.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And then people vote.

05:43.243 --> 05:46.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then, if we lose, we learn
from our mistakes.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We do some reflection.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We lick our wounds.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We brush ourselves off.

05:52.319 --> 05:55.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We get back in the arena.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We got at it.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We try even harder the next
time.

05:58.158 --> 06:03.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The election
outcome brought
out strong feelings from both
sides overnight,

06:03.263 --> 06:04.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
outside Trump Tower in New York.

06:05.031 --> 06:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We have had eight years of
a liberal
person telling us that Middle
America was

06:11.605 --> 06:13.106 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nothing.

06:13.139 --> 06:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, tonight, they came and
said, you know
what, we are -- we are America.

06:17.410 --> 06:20.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in
Washington, outside
the White House itself.

06:20.680 --> 06:24.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: As a gay, black and Latino
man, I'm scared.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.485 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It sucks.

06:25.518 --> 06:26.987 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:27.020 --> 06:32.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: This is not the way that I
envisioned
America in 2016 to be at all.

06:32.392 --> 06:37.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Republican
leaders in Congress
who kept their distance from
Trump embraced

06:37.697 --> 06:38.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the result today.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:40.500 --> 06:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: Look
at what a unified Republican
government can

06:40.800 --> 06:42.702 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
get you.

06:42.736 --> 06:47.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Wisconsin,
House Speaker
Paul Ryan lauded the ongoing
Republican majorities

06:47.040 --> 06:52.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Congress, and put supporters
of President
Obama's health care law on
notice.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.647 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: This health care law
is collapsing
under its own weight.

06:55.815 --> 07:00.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, to your specific
question about repealing
and replacing Obamacare, the
problem is, President

07:00.320 --> 07:01.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obama vetoed it.

07:01.721 --> 07:05.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we have President Trump
coming, who is
asking us to do this.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, with unified Republican
government, we
can fix this.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can fix these problems.

07:10.630 --> 07:14.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
leader in the
Senate, Mitch McConnell, was
also out today,

07:14.534 --> 07:17.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after having little to say about
Trump during
the campaign.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.205 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: Well,
I know he's really happy we
still have a Republican

07:21.574 --> 07:22.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
majority.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we look forward to working
with him.

07:25.178 --> 07:30.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think most of the things that
he's likely
to advocate, we're going to be
enthusiastically

07:30.050 --> 07:31.718 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

07:31.751 --> 07:36.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the
president-elect has
73 days to work on his agenda in
Congress

07:36.523 --> 07:41.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his transition before he
takes office
on January 20.

07:41.261 --> 07:45.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Our John Yang
and Jeffrey
Brown spent the final days on
the road following

07:45.832 --> 07:49.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump and Clinton campaigns,
and join
us now from, where it all came
to an end last

07:49.536 --> 07:50.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
night, in New York.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeff Brown, I want to start with
you.

07:52.372 --> 07:56.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You were there at the
celebration last night,
and today you were outside Trump
Tower.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you see?

07:57.177 --> 07:58.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who did you talk to?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I was at Trump
Tower this afternoon,
Hari.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Things heard calmed down by this
afternoon.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You heard last night, it was a
little bit
more dramatic.

08:04.951 --> 08:10.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon, it was a classic
New York,
New York, scene, lots of people
gawking across

08:10.490 --> 08:12.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the street.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were all held across the
street, some demonstrators,
a few demonstrators, anti-Trump.

08:14.728 --> 08:21.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few Trump supporters were
there, cops saying,
you know, take your photos and
move on, folks,

08:21.735 --> 08:24.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take your photos and move on,
folks, that
kind of situation.

08:24.070 --> 08:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most dramatic thing was
that, in front
of the Trump Tower, where I
think I counted

08:29.008 --> 08:34.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seven or eight very large dump
trucks filled
with sand, those are obviously
for protection

08:34.147 --> 08:35.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against explosives.

08:35.949 --> 08:39.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Something about the -- tells you
about the
world we live in today.

08:39.352 --> 08:44.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can't help but -- I
couldn't help but
reflect as I was there on the --
again going

08:44.557 --> 08:48.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back to thinking about last
night, the surreal
nature of much of this, to be
looking at Trump

08:48.995 --> 08:51.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tower, the wealth of Fifth
Avenue.

08:51.364 --> 08:57.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gucci is in the bottom floor of
wealth tower
-- of Trump Tower -- excuse me
-- to think

08:57.637 --> 09:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about how this wealthy New York
businessman
somehow managed to connect with
so many Americans

09:03.810 --> 09:05.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and is now our president-elect.

09:05.612 --> 09:10.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jeff, you were
telling us that
today you reached out to connect
with some

09:10.350 --> 09:15.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the people, Trump supporters
you met when
you were following him on the
campaign trail.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about that.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, I did,
Judy.

09:18.124 --> 09:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was thinking, being there
last night,
I can't help, still can't help
but think that

09:21.795 --> 09:27.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many of the people I was with
in that room
didn't think that what happened
would happen.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They of course wanted to win.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many thought there might be a
win.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't think they expected
quite what
we saw.

09:32.338 --> 09:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I went back to talk to some
of the people
that I had met over the last
week, thinking

09:36.876 --> 09:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to myself that I was surprised
by last night.

09:39.712 --> 09:44.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when I go back and think
about people
I talked to and what I saw, I'm
much less

09:44.317 --> 09:46.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
surprised.

09:46.052 --> 09:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to the Zan Bunn, who is
the head
of the North Carolina Federation
of Republican

09:49.022 --> 09:52.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Women, and she went directly to
Obamacare.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just mentioned that in your
lead-in tape
piece.

09:54.360 --> 09:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said, remember, people were
opening their
envelopes with their much higher
premium at

09:59.199 --> 10:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the exact moment when they were
opening their
ballots, their absentee ballots
to vote.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there was that disconnect
there for people.

10:06.039 --> 10:10.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said people do not want,
just decided
they didn't want more of the
same.

10:10.376 --> 10:15.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I talked to Ann Selzer, the
pollster in Iowa.

10:15.248 --> 10:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said it was just really
clear in Iowa
the trade issue was resonating.

10:19.686 --> 10:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You drive along the roads in
Iowa, you see
factories closed, towns dried
up.

10:24.557 --> 10:28.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had talked to her about
Iowa when I
was there, but what we saw last
night, it

10:28.294 --> 10:33.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
was clear that that had
connected much further
up into parts of the Midwest.

10:33.166 --> 10:37.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I talked to Jeff Kaufmann
from the Iowa
Republican Committee.

10:37.337 --> 10:42.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he just said it came down to
Americans
looking at two imperfect
candidates, but looking

10:42.809 --> 10:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and feeling like the best chance
of having
real change was through Donald
Trump.

10:47.680 --> 10:48.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
thanks, Jeff.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Also want to check in with John
Yang.

10:50.683 --> 10:54.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John, the mood looked almost
very much somber,
almost like a funeral today, at
least from

10:54.754 --> 10:57.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what we could see on TV, where
Hillary Clinton
and her supporters were.

10:57.957 --> 11:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, that wasn't
just supporters,
Hari.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was senior staff.

11:03.129 --> 11:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those were the staffers from the
Hillary for
America Organization from the
office in Brooklyn.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it was absolutely
shell-shocked in there.

11:11.070 --> 11:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one saw this coming that I
could talk to.

11:14.340 --> 11:19.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone -- I asked them when
they saw -- as
they were going in, when they
first got the

11:19.846 --> 11:27.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senses of trouble, and they all
said that
it wasn't until well into the
night last night

11:27.320 --> 11:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was that they started to get
the sense
that things were not going as
they anticipated.

11:32.559 --> 11:36.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tried to engage them and tried
to find out,
well, what do you think
happened?

11:36.095 --> 11:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think if you had
done this earlier
in Michigan, if you had done
that in another

11:41.301 --> 11:42.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state?

11:42.302 --> 11:44.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they just waved me off.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of them said, "I have never
been less
interested in talking about this
than now."

11:47.807 --> 11:51.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John, just
quickly, there was
some comment today about the
fact that Hillary

11:51.544 --> 11:56.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton waited until this
morning to give
her speech.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What about -- what was the
thinking behind
that?

11:58.451 --> 12:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, I have got a
couple of things,
one, practical.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had to get out of the
Javits Center at
2:00 a.m. this morning.

12:04.824 --> 12:09.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was another event moving
in and they
had to tear down that elaborate
setup and

12:09.729 --> 12:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
set up for the National
Association of Broadcasters.

12:13.967 --> 12:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing is that they
really weren't
ready.

12:17.303 --> 12:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had to look at the races
that were still
open, look and try to figure out
where the

12:22.342 --> 12:26.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes were, whether they had a
shot in any
of the states that were still
open.

12:26.145 --> 12:30.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also, quite frankly, I don't
think that
they were -- that she, that
Hillary Clinton

12:30.783 --> 12:35.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
was emotionally or
psychologically ready to
give that speech last night.

12:35.388 --> 12:39.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
John Yang and
Jeffrey Brown joining us from
New York tonight,

12:39.158 --> 12:40.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you so much.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're welcome.

12:41.995 --> 12:46.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the
presidential race is
decided, and Republicans will
still control

12:46.399 --> 12:50.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both houses of Congress, with
slightly smaller
majorities.

12:50.436 --> 12:55.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Senate, Republicans won
at least 51
seats, and they're favored to
win a runoff

12:55.408 --> 12:57.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Louisiana next month.

12:58.011 --> 13:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats added two more Senate
seats, including
New Hampshire.

13:02.015 --> 13:06.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrat Maggie Hassan defeated
Kelly Ayotte,
the Republican incumbent.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over in the House, Republicans
won at least
238 seats.

13:09.922 --> 13:13.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, that's down nine from their
current number.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We dig in now
on what we
learned from the presidential
results and

13:17.397 --> 13:19.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what voters said leaving the
polls.

13:19.666 --> 13:23.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn to Lisa Desjardins, who
is joined
once again by Amy Walter of The
Cook Political

13:23.469 --> 13:24.971 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Report.

13:25.004 --> 13:28.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Amy Walter,
nine hours we
were here together last night.

13:28.207 --> 13:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Imagine seeing each other again
so soon.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: I never
want to leave here.

13:32.578 --> 13:33.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you for
joining us.

13:33.579 --> 13:34.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Of course.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, America is
becoming more
diverse.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as we look at what happened
last night,
we had been talking going into
this election

13:39.585 --> 13:41.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a lot about race.

13:41.054 --> 13:44.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was supposed to help
Hillary Clinton,
but what actually happened?

13:44.223 --> 13:45.625 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we saw from the exit
polls last night
is a couple of things.

13:47.727 --> 13:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first is, Donald Trump did a
little bit
better than Mitt Romney did
among white voters.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think we have
got some
data.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But not by a whole
lot, by one
point.

13:56.769 --> 14:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will see Mitt Romney 20
points, Donald
Trump 21 points.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's another side of the
story is that
the African-American and Latino
percentage

14:04.911 --> 14:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Clinton got, impressive,
winning by 80
and 36 percent, but not the
margins that Barack

14:11.050 --> 14:12.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Obama got.

14:12.885 --> 14:16.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is another story in
there as well,
and I think that we look at
white voters.

14:16.255 --> 14:20.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been dividing white
voters into these
different groups.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have talked a lot about
white college-educated
voters.

14:23.463 --> 14:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These were the voters that the
Clinton campaign
thought were going to tip the
victory to her.

14:28.835 --> 14:33.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was going to get a
combination of the
Obama coalition, those younger,
more diverse

14:33.706 --> 14:39.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters, as well as the suburban
white women
who lived in and around big
cities.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She did better than Barack
Obama.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And this is
specifically
among white women.

14:43.649 --> 14:44.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: White women.

14:44.650 --> 14:46.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: OK.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But look at --
Donald Trump did
eight points better among those
without a

14:49.255 --> 14:50.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
college degree.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, she performed 12 points
better.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was eight points better.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it showed up on the map.

14:56.195 --> 15:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, what you're
saying here
is that she did well with
traditional Democratic

15:01.167 --> 15:04.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama coalition forces, but just
not as well
as President Obama.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Not as well as
President Obama.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I think...

15:07.406 --> 15:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And did they
show up for
her as well?

15:09.308 --> 15:13.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're saying she didn't get as
high a percentage
of those who came to show up,
who came to

15:13.312 --> 15:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the polls, but did as many
blacks, as many
Hispanics come out, or did more
whites, did

15:19.318 --> 15:20.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have higher turnout?

15:20.987 --> 15:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I was just digging
into one state
in particular, which was
Michigan.

15:23.990 --> 15:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was clear that Detroit
didn't turn
out at the level for her that it
did for Barack

15:30.229 --> 15:31.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Obama.

15:31.998 --> 15:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On top of that, she did much
worse in some
of the exurban or rural parts of
the state.

15:39.505 --> 15:43.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Michigan, Wisconsin,
Pennsylvania all tell
the same story.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's what I
wanted to get
to.

15:45.344 --> 15:49.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that was the biggest
surprise last
night was this blue wall of
Hillary Clinton's.

15:49.382 --> 15:52.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe there never was a wall
this year, or
certainly collapsed very
quickly.

15:52.318 --> 15:55.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I said this on
election night.

15:55.188 --> 15:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you had told me going into
this election
that a Democrat was going to win
Virginia

15:59.458 --> 16:04.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Colorado, I would have said,
well, that
candidate is going to probably
win the nomination.

16:04.163 --> 16:08.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are two big -- they were
two of the
closest states last time.

16:08.267 --> 16:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that what I wouldn't expect,
of course,
is that Wisconsin and Michigan,
two states

16:13.306 --> 16:18.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have gone for Democrats
since 1988, would
flip to Republican.

16:18.311 --> 16:23.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of that is built on
this, whichever
states that have more women who
graduated

16:23.416 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from college, those who have
fewer women who
graduated from college.

16:27.119 --> 16:32.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at the numbers in
those states,
you can see that, in Wisconsin
and Michigan,

16:32.859 --> 16:34.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
yes, it was a blue wall.

16:34.694 --> 16:39.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a blue wall for Democrats
when Democrats
were doing better among white
voters, and

16:39.232 --> 16:43.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
specifically white voters who
didn't live
in urban areas, or white voters
who didn't

16:43.336 --> 16:44.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have a college education.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: So, OK, all of
this is about
demographics.

16:46.439 --> 16:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I wonder, Amy, is the point
that last
night was not about
demographics, that there

16:51.277 --> 16:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is something else going on?

16:52.945 --> 16:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's absolutely
true.

16:54.780 --> 16:59.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think a lot of us in the
business, we
got really wedded to this idea
of demographics,

16:59.085 --> 17:04.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially because we watched
Barack Obama
in 2008 and 2012 with this
amazing analytics

17:04.624 --> 17:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team that told us that you could
actually
look at the demographics of an
electorate

17:09.996 --> 17:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and understand where they were
going to vote.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's
mathematical.

17:13.332 --> 17:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's all about math,
but really
it's also about message.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Barack Obama had a message.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was hope and change.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was that he had the auto
bailout.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was working for people.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton didn't have that
message.

17:25.511 --> 17:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It didn't address the rising
anxiety and frustration
and anger that's been brewing
there, the time

17:30.716 --> 17:32.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for change theme.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump did.

17:34.153 --> 17:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Amy Walter of
The Cook Political
Report, I look forward to what
you find out

17:36.222 --> 17:41.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the next week of reading
through and your
analysis.

17:41.294 --> 17:45.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Thank you.

17:45.164 --> 17:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you.

17:49.035 --> 17:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on
Donald Trump's
stunning upset and what it
means, we are joined

17:54.540 --> 17:59.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by Ellen Fitzpatrick,
presidential historian
and author of the book "The
Highest Glass

17:59.979 --> 18:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ceiling, Matt Schlapp, chairman
of the American
Conservative Union, J.D. Vance,
author of

18:06.285 --> 18:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the new book "Hillbilly Elegy,"
Betsy McCaughey,
former lieutenant governor of
New York and

18:11.724 --> 18:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an economic adviser to the Trump
campaign.

18:14.961 --> 18:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stefanie Brown James, she's the
former director
of African-American outreach for
President

18:19.765 --> 18:27.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama's 2012 campaign, and Ali
Noorani, executive
director of the National
Immigration Forum.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all of you to the
"NewsHour."

18:29.875 --> 18:34.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just want to go around the
group first and
ask you just to give me a
sentence, starting

18:35.014 --> 18:38.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with you, Matt Schlapp, on your
reaction today.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think about these
results?

18:39.785 --> 18:42.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White House
Director
of Political Affairs: Well, I
have to say

18:42.555 --> 18:44.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I feel a bit vindicated.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been a tough campaign, I
think, for both
sides.

18:46.993 --> 18:47.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's been grueling.

18:48.027 --> 18:50.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The word I kept using was raw.

18:50.930 --> 18:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think nobody expected or
very few people
expected for Trump to just
explode in the

18:57.036 --> 18:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Electoral College like he did.

18:59.438 --> 19:04.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a fantastic night for
anybody who
wanted change in Washington.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stefanie Brown
James?

19:06.645 --> 19:10.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFANIE BROWN JAMES, The
Collective PAC:
I think raw is actually a great
question -- I

19:10.549 --> 19:13.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean, a great response that Matt
gave.

19:13.185 --> 19:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of people that are in my
community are
feeling very raw today because
the wounds

19:18.557 --> 19:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Donald Trump opened when he
had so many
disparaging remarks against
minorities, against

19:23.896 --> 19:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women, we continue to have those
wounds really
rubbed into today with him now
being the president.

19:30.369 --> 19:35.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And a lot of us are
wondering,how do we tell
our children that a person who
can be, you

19:35.441 --> 19:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, a bully, who can talk
badly about women
is now the president of our
country?

19:39.912 --> 19:41.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Betsy McCaughey,
what are you
thinking today?

19:41.847 --> 19:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSY MCCAUGHEY, Former New York
Lieutenant
Governor: The results were a
repudiation of

19:45.051 --> 19:48.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's class warfare
rhetoric.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans don't hate rich
people.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They would like to be rich.

19:53.292 --> 19:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump's proposals to
lift everyone
by increasing prosperity, more
jobs, more

19:59.698 --> 20:01.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take-home pay really resounded.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ali Noorani?

20:03.402 --> 20:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI NOORANI, Executive Director,
National
Immigration Forum: I think the
Trump victory

20:05.371 --> 20:06.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has tapped an emotional nerve.

20:06.505 --> 20:09.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I would capture this as a
very emotional
day.

20:09.642 --> 20:13.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you talk -- when we're
talking to people
across the Latino community, the
Asian community

20:13.345 --> 20:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and their allies across the
broad American
public, there are a lot of raw
emotions, some

20:18.150 --> 20:22.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
obviously in favor of Trump, the
Trump win,
and others really wondering
where we're all

20:22.621 --> 20:23.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going.

20:23.622 --> 20:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: J.D. Vance, where
are you today?

20:25.424 --> 20:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE, Author, "Hillbilly
Elegy: A Memoir
of a Family and Culture in
Crisis": Well,

20:27.093 --> 20:30.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's just remarkable how
wrong the
conventional wisdom was.

20:30.529 --> 20:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was utterly shocking that
Donald Trump
won to people who live on the
coasts, but

20:34.500 --> 20:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to people who live in the areas
that I come
from, it was utterly
predictable.

20:37.670 --> 20:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that suggests something
really, really
broken about our political
culture.

20:41.474 --> 20:43.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Ellen
Fitzpatrick?

20:43.442 --> 20:47.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK, Professor of
History, University
of New Hampshire: Well, I was
surprised the

20:47.079 --> 20:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
polling with you so inaccurate,
in some sense,
and I was also -- I really
thought having,

20:54.353 --> 21:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a historian, studied the
history of women's
quest for the American
presidency over a long

21:00.159 --> 21:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
period of time, since Victoria
Woodhull ran
the for presidency first in
1872, that Hillary

21:07.600 --> 21:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton was going to break
through that glass
ceiling this time.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I did have that expectation.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I was quite stunned,
actually.

21:16.475 --> 21:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Matt Schlapp,
I wanted to
ask you, what's the message that
all these

21:20.546 --> 21:23.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
millions of voters who voted for
Trump, what
are they sending?

21:24.016 --> 21:30.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I just feel like
they feel like
they're cut out of what's
happening in Washington.

21:30.990 --> 21:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They feel like they're cut out
of the economic
opportunities that Americans
always felt was

21:35.561 --> 21:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a part of the American dream.

21:37.463 --> 21:41.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, when you don't have
your real income,
your take-home pay increase for
a decade or

21:41.934 --> 21:44.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a decade-and-a-half, it makes
you awfully
discouraged.

21:44.870 --> 21:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then when you see other
things in society
changing so rapidly, and you
think that government

21:51.277 --> 21:56.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is ineffective and unable to --
incapable
of taking steps, appropriate
steps to make

21:56.982 --> 22:02.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that America can lead, lead
on the international
stage and lead the international
economy,

22:02.655 --> 22:04.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that was so much of
this.

22:04.690 --> 22:10.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it was also -- look,
it was a
repudiation -- I think the
voters like President

22:10.062 --> 22:11.030 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Obama.

22:11.063 --> 22:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He has very high approvals.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I give him credit for that.

22:13.232 --> 22:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do think his policies have
hurt more
people.

22:15.734 --> 22:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can see that by the poverty
statistics.

22:18.103 --> 22:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think this was a bit of
repudiation
of Obamacare and his policies.

22:21.674 --> 22:26.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I also think Hillary's
corruption, she just
could never get through that.

22:26.412 --> 22:27.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look at all those exit polls.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're just astonishing.

22:29.281 --> 22:33.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The voters really made a
judgment on Hillary
Clinton's ethics.

22:33.252 --> 22:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stefanie Brown
James, I
wanted to ask, that message that
those voters

22:39.258 --> 22:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are sending, counter that with
the message
that the Hillary Clinton
campaign was sending

22:43.996 --> 22:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and which -- why didn't her
message, if she
had one that was clear, why
didn't that prevail?

22:48.033 --> 22:51.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFANIE BROWN JAMES: Well, I
think that's
a major challenge, in that a lot
of people,

22:51.604 --> 22:56.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
especially in the black
community, Latino
community, didn't feel as though
Hillary Clinton

22:56.275 --> 23:01.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a direct enough message for
them to explain
why she was the right choice,
not just based

23:01.914 --> 23:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off of experience, but what it
was that she
was going to do for these
communities to continue

23:07.219 --> 23:10.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to uplift them if she became
elected president.

23:10.389 --> 23:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the challenges that I
have been saying
for a long time is that, you
know, a campaign

23:15.261 --> 23:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is won by your infrastructure
and your ground
game.

23:17.896 --> 23:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, what we
didn't see enough
from the Clinton campaign was a
strong enough

23:22.034 --> 23:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground game to reach out to
voters, to get
real-time, real information from
people who

23:27.039 --> 23:33.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you were asking for their votes,
to be able
to determine how best to
continue to engage

23:33.545 --> 23:35.281 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

23:35.314 --> 23:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that the Clinton
campaign and
the Democrats relied too heavily
on President

23:39.084 --> 23:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama to turn out the base of
voters they
needed to get Hillary Clinton
the win.

23:43.289 --> 23:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we saw was that enough
effort wasn't
put in to make sure that those
voters who

23:47.960 --> 23:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needed to go to the polls in
strong numbers,
African-American, women, youth,
Latinos, it

23:53.165 --> 23:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just wasn't enough.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Betsy McCaughey.

23:55.968 --> 23:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSY MCCAUGHEY: I would like to
jump in on
that issue of the ground game,
because I drew

23:59.605 --> 24:05.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the opposite conclusion, that
this election
really demonstrated that
emphasis on the ground

24:05.577 --> 24:07.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
game is now obsolete.

24:07.946 --> 24:12.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump had virtually no
ground game,
although the RNC had something
of a ground

24:12.384 --> 24:14.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
game.

24:14.186 --> 24:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spent less than half as much
winning this
presidency as his opponent,
Hillary Clinton,

24:19.925 --> 24:21.660 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
did.

24:21.694 --> 24:26.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have to say, the taxpayers
are hoping
that he will be as effective at
getting his

24:26.198 --> 24:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
money's worth as president as he
was as a
candidate.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ali -- go ahead,
Stefanie.

24:31.737 --> 24:35.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFANIE BROWN JAMES: But they
were reaching
two very different audiences
with two very

24:35.874 --> 24:37.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
different tactics.

24:37.743 --> 24:42.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you are drawing upon the
emotional concerns
of voters, as Matt mentioned,
who are very

24:42.247 --> 24:46.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much concerned that the America
they know
is being taken over by people
who don't look

24:46.218 --> 24:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like them -- let's be frank --
then that's
an emotional appeal that is not
going to be

24:50.689 --> 24:55.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same as for black voters,
for example,
who you need to knock on their
doors and have

24:55.461 --> 24:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversations to say why they
need to vote
for Hillary Clinton.

24:58.397 --> 25:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not about why they
should or shouldn't
vote for Donald Trump.

25:01.567 --> 25:03.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's about, why should you vote
for Hillary
Clinton?

25:03.469 --> 25:08.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you need that ground game in
order to
have people understand why she
should be your

25:08.107 --> 25:09.441 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
choice.

25:09.475 --> 25:10.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, unfortunately, didn't
happen in
strong enough numbers.

25:11.009 --> 25:14.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to bring
Ali Noorani
in here in terms of the message.

25:14.113 --> 25:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was it a case of Hillary Clinton
not getting
that message across, or was it
that Donald

25:19.451 --> 25:23.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's appeal was just to
powerful, it overwhelmed
whatever Hillary Clinton was
doing?

25:23.756 --> 25:27.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI NOORANI: Well, when you look
at the numbers,
I mean, Hillary's message
resonated in urban

25:27.493 --> 25:29.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
areas.

25:29.261 --> 25:32.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Donald Trump clearly tapped
into a nerve
across suburban and rural
America that we

25:32.865 --> 25:35.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just haven't seen tapped in such
a powerful
way before.

25:35.834 --> 25:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He overperformed what Romney was
able to do
in 2012 and he was able to run
up those margins.

25:40.472 --> 25:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, at the end of the
day, this was
an election not just about an
emotion, but

25:44.309 --> 25:49.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this emotion of anxiety, and an
anxiety that
was triggered by economic fears,
cultural

25:49.815 --> 25:51.583 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fears.

25:51.617 --> 25:54.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have been looking, and as
we have been
thinking about this over the
last day, this

25:54.486 --> 25:55.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a moment where we...

25:55.754 --> 25:57.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the
Immigration Forum.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI NOORANI: Right, right, at
the forum, looking
at this election as one about
culture and

26:00.859 --> 26:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
values and what it means to be
an American.

26:03.495 --> 26:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you look at over the
last few months,
a lot of people, yes, they -- a
lot of Trump

26:08.000 --> 26:11.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters want to see a solution in
terms of
immigration.

26:11.036 --> 26:14.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They want to see greater
regulation, a greater,
a stronger border.

26:14.606 --> 26:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some of their solutions
actually are different
from what the candidate put
forward.

26:18.143 --> 26:21.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think Donald Trump has an
incredible
challenge to translate his
campaign promises

26:21.880 --> 26:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into a consensus-building
policy.

26:23.849 --> 26:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Betsy McCaughey,
do the rest
of Americans have something to
fear when it

26:28.754 --> 26:34.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes to this gap between what
Donald Trump
had said on the campaign trail
vs. what he

26:34.460 --> 26:35.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
might do as president?

26:35.894 --> 26:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETSY MCCAUGHEY: I don't...

26:37.796 --> 26:41.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I mean, you
see the social
conversations today, that
there's a huge group

26:41.133 --> 26:45.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people, whether it's women,
whether it's
minorities, whether it's
immigrants, who are

26:45.637 --> 26:49.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concerned that they don't know
where they
stand with the new president.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BETSY MCCAUGHEY: Yes.

26:51.009 --> 26:54.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, actually, I found most of
his message
quite unifying, because the
emphasis was on

26:54.680 --> 26:56.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prosperity.

26:56.415 --> 27:01.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I did want to touch upon
something that one
of our contributors said a
moment ago about

27:01.787 --> 27:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women and failing to break the
glass ceiling.

27:05.123 --> 27:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And here's how I see this.

27:07.726 --> 27:13.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton was urging
voters to make
history, but a lot of voters,
particularly

27:13.632 --> 27:16.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women, had trouble with her
history.

27:16.902 --> 27:22.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she was portraying herself
as a feminist,
as a glass ceiling breaker, but,
in fact,

27:22.207 --> 27:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the eyes of many women,
especially women
closer to Hillary Clinton's own
age, she had

27:26.912 --> 27:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gotten where she was primarily
on her husband's
coattails.

27:31.917 --> 27:35.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was less a Susan B. Anthony
and more an
Evita.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so they found this
unconvincing.

27:37.422 --> 27:42.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And millennial women who are out
there every
day competing with men don't see
the issue.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ellen
Fitzpatrick?

27:44.396 --> 27:51.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: I think this
kind of rhetoric
and exaggeration that has really
informed

27:51.103 --> 27:56.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this entire campaign does very
little to elevate
the political process.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's very unfortunate.

27:58.443 --> 28:04.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was amazing last night to see
Donald Trump,
who had been describing Hillary
Clinton as

28:04.983 --> 28:11.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crooked and corrupt, in a matter
of a moment,
was describing her as a fine and
dedicated

28:11.356 --> 28:14.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public servant, once he had won
the election.

28:14.826 --> 28:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, there was a kind of
barbarism all the
way around, I think, in this
political campaign,

28:20.999 --> 28:26.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in which the issues really were
boiled down
to very small sound bites.

28:26.371 --> 28:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The impact of mass media on
presidential elections,
a process in television which
really began

28:34.613 --> 28:40.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 1960, is reaching its logical
conclusion
here.

28:40.052 --> 28:44.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's -- the public
is not well-served
by it, frankly.

28:44.756 --> 28:52.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: J.D. Vance, in
your book "Hillbilly
Elegy," you deal, of course,
with white working-class

28:52.230 --> 28:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans, many of whom you
write about feeling
forgotten, disrespected.

28:56.835 --> 29:01.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think they are now
looking for
Donald Trump to do, and do you
think he can

29:01.540 --> 29:03.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deliver for them?

29:03.041 --> 29:04.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, just answer the first part
yet.

29:04.509 --> 29:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think they're
looking for from
him?

29:06.845 --> 29:12.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: Well, the first
thing that I think
they're looking for, they have
already gotten,

29:12.384 --> 29:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is a sense of vindication
that they
predicted, they knew that the
media was corrupt,

29:16.655 --> 29:20.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they were lying about the
outcome of
the election, and Donald Trump
really proved

29:20.525 --> 29:22.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them right in some ways.

29:22.494 --> 29:26.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that there should be
some soul-searching
from the press, who predicted
that Trump would

29:26.231 --> 29:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lose very, very handily.

29:27.699 --> 29:29.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, of course, that didn't
happen.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that corrodes some
of the trust
that a lot of folks back home
have in the

29:32.871 --> 29:33.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mainstream press.

29:33.872 --> 29:35.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:35.674 --> 29:37.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, if I could
just interrupt
for a second, that was based on
polls that

29:37.509 --> 29:42.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretty universally were showing
Hillary Clinton
ahead, because we don't do our
own polling.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But go ahead, please.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
J.D. VANCE: Yes.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, of course.

29:46.985 --> 29:50.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm not trying to be
hyper-critical of the
press, but I think that even the
polls suggested

29:50.656 --> 29:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a fair amount of volatility.

29:52.524 --> 29:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was a certain degree
of certainty,
even though I don't think that
certainty was

29:56.695 --> 30:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
necessarily supported by the
polls that suggested
Hillary Clinton was slightly
ahead, but not

30:00.999 --> 30:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very comfortably ahead, as a lot
of folks
talked about.

30:04.703 --> 30:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think what people want to
see from the
Trump presidency is,
fundamentally, they want

30:09.474 --> 30:13.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see a more repaired and
better path to
the middle class.

30:14.012 --> 30:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What a lot of folks feel -- and
some of the
other commenters have mentioned
this -- is

30:18.583 --> 30:23.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there isn't a very clear
way for somebody
who's working-class, who is
middle-income

30:23.121 --> 30:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to really get ahead in 21st
century America.

30:25.924 --> 30:27.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That implicates our education
system.

30:27.859 --> 30:31.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also implicates our local and
regional
economies.

30:31.129 --> 30:33.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that folks will
expect Trump to
fix a lot of those things.

30:33.665 --> 30:37.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, of course, it's a really
tall order,
and it's not going to happen
overnight.

30:37.102 --> 30:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Matt Schlapp,
sometimes,
the saying is that campaigning
is the easy

30:40.839 --> 30:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part, governing is the hard
part.

30:42.274 --> 30:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As J.D. Vance just said, there's
a lot of
expectations that people have.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All those people that put Trump
into office,
they want to see results.

30:48.780 --> 30:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now, technically speaking,
no excuses.

30:51.483 --> 30:57.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress, both the House and the
Senate, are
Republican, as well as the White
House.

30:57.155 --> 31:02.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the Trump deliverable in
the first
day, first 100 days, first year?

31:02.561 --> 31:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes, you know
what?

31:04.529 --> 31:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to be time for us to
put up or
shut up.

31:06.798 --> 31:12.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, it's hard to reverse
all of the
problems we have seen in the
economy that

31:12.404 --> 31:17.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we have seen with these
working-class voters,
these blue-collar voters that
turned out in

31:17.976 --> 31:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just droves for Donald Trump.

31:19.778 --> 31:22.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are actually some easy
things we
could do.

31:22.681 --> 31:26.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our tax -- our corporate tax
structure is
a disaster.

31:26.918 --> 31:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many of us who are small
business people
actually pay at higher rates
than corporations

31:30.689 --> 31:31.923 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

31:31.957 --> 31:33.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have some of the highest
corporate taxes
in the globe.

31:33.725 --> 31:38.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're seeing is that
corporations
are leaving America for the sole
reason of

31:38.663 --> 31:40.065 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
taxes.

31:40.098 --> 31:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second of all, we could do
something about
our regulatory structure.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, you could look at climate
change.

31:43.969 --> 31:50.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The impact of chasing after
regulating carbon
dioxide has really shed our
economy of manufacturing

31:50.342 --> 31:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
jobs and additional energy jobs.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We all know about the war on
coal.

31:54.446 --> 31:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can all have our opinions on
things like
climate change, but we can't
disagree on the

31:58.683 --> 32:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that it has shed so many
jobs in these
communities and in these states,
states that

32:03.388 --> 32:05.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump did very well in.

32:05.190 --> 32:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Republicans, of which I'm a
proud member
of that party, being in control
of Congress,

32:10.428 --> 32:13.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
although we don't have 60 votes
in the Senate
-- and it's always important to
say that,

32:13.532 --> 32:16.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is, there is still going
to be bipartisanship
and all these things -- we
really ought to

32:16.768 --> 32:20.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do something on our taxes, and
we ought to
do something on our regulatory
structure.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And ought to be more competitive
internationally.

32:22.774 --> 32:25.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the investments that
are sitting
on the sidelines would start to
flow into

32:26.011 --> 32:27.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our economy.

32:27.813 --> 32:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really think middle-class
America will be
well-served by that, and, of
course, a fix

32:31.483 --> 32:33.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Obamacare.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn to
Stefanie Brown
James, because you started out,
Stefanie,

32:35.720 --> 32:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by talking about raw feelings in
the African-American
community, the communities of
people of color

32:41.526 --> 32:43.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country.

32:43.295 --> 32:49.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If this principal focus of a new
President
Donald Trump is on economic
issues like what

32:49.734 --> 32:55.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we just heard Matt Schlapp and
Betsy McCaughey
describe, does that in some way
reassure,

32:55.574 --> 32:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assuage some of the concerns
that you expressed?

32:58.176 --> 33:02.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEFANIE BROWN JAMES: I mean,
definitely,
you know, there is no doubt
about that, you

33:02.681 --> 33:07.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, communities of color are
very much concerned
about the economy, being able to
make sure

33:07.419 --> 33:10.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they have enough food to
give their families.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, poverty is also a big issue.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the challenge comes down to
respect.

33:15.427 --> 33:20.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if there is a president who
you feel doesn't
fundamentally see you as an
equal to other

33:20.799 --> 33:26.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans, doesn't respect you,
doesn't respect
your life, then it doesn't
matter what policy

33:26.238 --> 33:30.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
position they put forward or
what plans they
put forward, because the
humanity -- you feel

33:30.976 --> 33:34.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your humanity is not being seen
by your own
president or your own
government.

33:34.813 --> 33:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, to be quite frank, you
know, I'm excited
to see what the Republican
Congress is going

33:39.517 --> 33:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do, what this new Republican
president
is going to do, because I do
think that it

33:44.556 --> 33:52.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is time to show up and to prove
that the policies
that they say they want to put
forth that's

33:52.530 --> 33:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to, you know, help the
middle class,
that it's going to actually make
a difference.

33:56.067 --> 34:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people conveniently like
to forget
that, you know, President Obama
inherited

34:01.172 --> 34:05.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a doomsday economy, so I want to
see what
this Republican-led government
is going to

34:05.443 --> 34:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do to get us into a better
shape.

34:07.612 --> 34:10.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ali Noorani, I
just wanted
to pick up on something that she
just said.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you get these communities
to feel respected?

34:13.285 --> 34:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALI NOORANI: Well, I think we're
in for an
interesting ride.

34:16.254 --> 34:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should start with, I do not
believe that
every person that voted for
Donald Trump is

34:20.258 --> 34:22.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a xenophobe or a racist.

34:22.160 --> 34:26.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, some of the
things that
Donald Trump said over the
course of the campaign

34:26.765 --> 34:31.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gave voice and gave permission
to people to
do some very, very terrible
things.

34:31.803 --> 34:36.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just today, I saw news of a
swastika being
painted on walls in
Philadelphia.

34:36.675 --> 34:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're going to unfortunately
see these
kinds of things as we move
forward through

34:40.412 --> 34:42.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this administration.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump, when he
becomes President
Trump, is going to have an
incredible opportunity

34:45.550 --> 34:48.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to heal this country and to be
able to, in
essence, take that permission
away.

34:48.820 --> 34:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Oh, just very
quickly on this
respect question, I think that's
so right.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, remember, I think actually
this really
boomeranged on Hillary Clinton.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We focused so much on Donald
Trump's rhetoric.

34:57.963 --> 35:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when she called Donald Trump
supporters
a basket of deplorables, you can
see it in

35:02.534 --> 35:03.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the exits.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It just destroyed her with these
voters.

35:05.370 --> 35:08.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when called Christians --
not her, but
her staff in these leaked
e-mails -- called

35:08.606 --> 35:12.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Catholics and Christians
backwards, you can
just see Donald Trump did -- he
actually won

35:12.811 --> 35:14.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Catholic voters.

35:14.579 --> 35:18.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, this idea of
rhetoric out of
control is something that really
hurt Hillary

35:18.483 --> 35:19.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton in this race.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: J.D. Vance, how
do you see
this playing out?

35:21.786 --> 35:26.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J.D. VANCE: Well, I think that,
first of all,
Donald Trump and the Republican
Party has

35:26.858 --> 35:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to recognize that, though they
obviously won
this election, if you look at
their low numbers

35:30.762 --> 35:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
among black voters, among Latino
voters, this
is not a long-term coalition
that they can

35:35.033 --> 35:36.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
build on.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I really do think it
comes down to
respect.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It comes down to being gracious.

35:40.005 --> 35:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It comes down to really showing
compassion
for the problems of the black
and Latino communities.

35:44.309 --> 35:48.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really hope that Donald
Trump takes
the ball that's in his court and
tries to

35:48.213 --> 35:51.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go after those voters, tries to
show some
compassion, and really offers
them something

35:51.916 --> 35:55.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
substantive to get excited about
Republican
and conservative policy.

35:55.520 --> 36:00.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just a final word
from Ellen
Fitzpatrick on bringing the
country together.

36:00.225 --> 36:01.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it possible?

36:01.426 --> 36:05.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELLEN FITZPATRICK: Of course
it's possible,
Judy.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was a very close election.

36:06.998 --> 36:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, I believe Hillary
Clinton, at
least the latest count, shows
that she won

36:11.703 --> 36:13.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the popular vote.

36:13.171 --> 36:17.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a lopsided vote in the
Electoral
College, as there often is.

36:17.275 --> 36:21.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we remain a very divided
electorate.

36:21.112 --> 36:27.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it will be, of course, an
imperative of
the new president to try to
address those

36:27.285 --> 36:31.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
divisions and to bring the
country together
in order to govern.

36:31.389 --> 36:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not a -- this is not
"The Apprentice."

36:36.027 --> 36:42.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in four years, you're fired
if you're
not able to address the concerns
of the American

36:42.400 --> 36:44.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
citizens.

36:44.202 --> 36:49.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a tall order for
someone without
experience in politics or
military service,

36:49.841 --> 36:50.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and it's a new model.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will get to see how it plays
out.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the
conversations are
just beginning.

36:55.146 --> 36:58.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is only the first day after
we have learned
the results of the election.

36:58.283 --> 37:00.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we are so glad that you were
all able
to join us.

37:00.985 --> 37:04.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ellen Fitzpatrick, Matt Schlapp,
we thank
you.

37:04.289 --> 37:13.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
J.D. Vance, Stefanie Brown
James, Betsy McCaughey,
and Ali Noorani, we thank you.

37:13.331 --> 37:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now the view
from overseas.

37:22.340 --> 37:25.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The election was watched
closely, both with
anticipation and fear.

37:25.977 --> 37:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as chief foreign affairs
correspondent
Margaret Warner reports, today,
the rest of

37:30.448 --> 37:33.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world awoke to an America
profoundly changed.

37:34.018 --> 37:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The stunning
news ricocheted
around the world from Tehran to
Tokyo, Istanbul

37:40.792 --> 37:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Berlin, met with apprehension
by some and

In Moscow, the Russian
Parliament erupted
in cheers at the announcement,
and President

37:51.536 --> 37:58.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vladimir Putin was among the
first to congratulate
Trump, who had lauded Putin as a
strong leader.

Nathan Hodge is a Wall Street
Journal correspondent
in Moscow.

38:01.546 --> 38:04.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says there is glee over the
divisive U.S.
election.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HODGE, The Wall Street
Journal: It's
a way that, basically, that
Russia, which

38:06.885 --> 38:10.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has seen lots of scolding from
the United
States and the West about the
way that it

38:10.955 --> 38:17.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conducts elections and the
authoritarian tendencies
of its leadership, they can now
point to the

38:17.061 --> 38:21.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States and say, look, you
guys, you're
not so great yourselves.

38:21.132 --> 38:25.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Russia also
left its imprint
on the election, with
allegations that it

38:25.570 --> 38:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engineered the hacking of
Democratic Party
e-mails to embarrass Hillary
Clinton.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All of this has NATO allies
nervous.

38:33.511 --> 38:38.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its member states, especially in
Eastern Europe,
rely on the U.S. as a
counterweight to Moscow

38:39.017 --> 38:42.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a guarantor of their
security.

38:42.120 --> 38:46.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alliance leaders made clear
today they are
looking for Trump to maintain a
tough line

38:46.724 --> 38:52.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Putin after Russia's
annexation of Crimea,
and to abandon his campaign talk
of putting

38:53.031 --> 38:56.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conditions on the U.S.
commitment to NATO.

The president of Latvia says
he's willing
to give the incoming president
some time.

39:01.639 --> 39:05.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAIMONDS VEJONIS, President of
Latvia (through
translator): Of course, during
the campaign,

39:05.510 --> 39:09.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump came out with many blunt
statements
on many issues, but we should
remember that

39:09.647 --> 39:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it was a pre-election time.

39:11.382 --> 39:14.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Let's see what the
administration of the president
will look like.

39:14.152 --> 39:18.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But, in France,
President
Francois Hollande said the
result -- quote

39:18.523 --> 39:22.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- "opens a period of
uncertainty."

39:22.560 --> 39:25.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reaction in nationalist quarters
of Europe
was exultant.

39:25.697 --> 39:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant
spoke to us from Copenhagen.

39:29.567 --> 39:33.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Right-wing
leaders across
Europe are basically seeing the
Trump victory

39:33.338 --> 39:35.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as a validation of their
policies.

39:35.139 --> 39:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got people like Marine
Le Pen, who
is the leader of the French
National Front,

39:40.144 --> 39:45.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she's going into a presidential
election in
six months' time.

39:45.149 --> 39:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest polls give her about
30 percent
of the vote, and she will see
what happened

39:50.021 --> 39:54.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in America as being
encouragement for French
voters, saying, if it can happen
in the United

39:55.026 --> 39:56.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States, why can't it happen
here?

39:56.728 --> 40:00.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: That
nationalism already
triumphed in Britain.

40:00.231 --> 40:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British Prime Minister Theresa
May says her
nation's special relationship
with the U.S.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.071 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
remains.

40:07.105 --> 40:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she came to office last
summer after British
citizens voted for Brexit to
abandon the European

40:12.043 --> 40:13.378 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Union.

40:13.411 --> 40:17.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump embraced the move, calling
himself Mr.
Brexit at one point.

40:17.749 --> 40:22.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also in question is America's
participation
in the Paris climate accord.

40:22.120 --> 40:26.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has called climate change
a hoax, and
while it would take four years
to formally

40:26.491 --> 40:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pull out of the agreement, there
are no sanctions
in place for ignoring it.

40:30.828 --> 40:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
German Chancellor Angela Merkel
says she watched
the U.S. election results --
quote -- "with

40:36.067 --> 40:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trepidation," but that she will
work with
Trump.

40:39.671 --> 40:44.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has called Merkel insane
for taking
in a large number of refugees.

40:44.609 --> 40:52.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The center of that refugee
crisis remains
in Syria, now in its sixth year
of civil war.

40:52.050 --> 40:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People in Aleppo, locus of the
fighting now,
say their low hopes for U.S.
protection remain

40:57.855 --> 40:59.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the same.

40:59.324 --> 41:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WISSAM ZARQA, Syrian Teacher: We
are trying
to look at the bright side.

41:03.928 --> 41:05.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has no promises at all for
the Syrian
people.

41:05.863 --> 41:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Before, we had empty promises.

41:08.032 --> 41:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, now it would make us maybe
more realistic.

41:11.936 --> 41:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Elsewhere in
the Middle East,
there's unease over Trump's
campaign calls

41:16.307 --> 41:22.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to ban many Muslims from
entering the U.S.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah
El-Sisi was

41:22.246 --> 41:28.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one the first world leaders to
telephone congratulations
overnight, but others in Egypt
struck a different

41:28.886 --> 41:29.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tone.

41:29.987 --> 41:33.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: He hate Muslims, whether he
admits it
or not.

41:33.291 --> 41:35.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's afraid of Arabs.

41:35.093 --> 41:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: On the other
hand Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu spoke with

41:38.296 --> 41:41.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump today, calling him a great
friend of
Israel.

41:42.033 --> 41:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His education minister put it
more plainly,
saying Trump's victory means --
quote -- "the

41:46.938 --> 41:50.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
era of the Palestinian state is
over."

41:50.274 --> 41:55.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Israeli government sharply
opposed the
U.S. nuclear deal with Iran, and
Trump has

41:55.113 --> 42:00.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
suggested he will try to
renegotiate the lifting
of sanctions it provided.

42:00.685 --> 42:05.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Borzou Daragahi, Middle East
correspondent
for BuzzFeed in Istanbul, said
that will be

42:05.957 --> 42:07.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
difficult.

42:07.792 --> 42:11.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BORZOU DARAGAHI, BuzzFeed: The
U.S. could,
in theory, ramp up unilateral
sanctions, but

42:11.062 --> 42:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it never really ramped them
down, except for
the ones that were kind of
imposed by the

42:15.967 --> 42:17.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
executive.

42:17.435 --> 42:20.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ones that are by Congress
are still in
place and remain in place.

42:20.705 --> 42:25.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: The
president-elect also
wants to revisit major trade
deals, such as

42:25.877 --> 42:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 12-nation Trans-Pacific
Partnership, which
has yet to be ratified.

42:30.114 --> 42:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China's President Xi Jinping
telephoned Trump
himself today, voicing hope for
-- quote -- "non-conflict

42:37.822 --> 42:39.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and non-confrontation."

42:39.624 --> 42:43.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. tensions with Beijing have
ratcheted
up over China's aggressive moves
in the contested

42:43.694 --> 42:47.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
waters of the South China Sea.

42:47.365 --> 42:52.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gillian Tett, the U.S. managing
editor for
The Financial Times in New York,
spoke of

42:52.069 --> 42:53.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Chinese reaction.

42:53.871 --> 42:56.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GILLIAN TETT, The Financial
Times: There is
certainly a lot of questioning
and a lot of

42:56.240 --> 42:58.075 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
concern.

42:58.109 --> 43:02.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has also been a series of
comments from
China about the fact that this
makes American

43:02.447 --> 43:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
democracy look rather peculiar
at best.

43:05.049 --> 43:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Closer to home,
Trump's victory
was met with alarm in Mexico
City, given his

43:10.221 --> 43:14.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk of building a border wall
and making
Mexico pay for it.

43:14.358 --> 43:19.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Mexican peso crashed
overnight, hitting
levels not seen for more than 20
years.

43:19.730 --> 43:28.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

43:28.573 --> 43:38.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the wake of
last night's
huge upset, there are many
questions about

43:38.683 --> 43:42.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the pollsters, the pundits
and many journalists
may have missed.

43:42.787 --> 43:45.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To tackle this, we are joined by
Margaret
Sullivan.

43:45.089 --> 43:47.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is the media columnist for
The Washington
Post.

43:48.025 --> 43:53.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steve Deace, he is a popular
conservative
radio talk show host in Iowa.

43:53.364 --> 43:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jim Rutenberg is a media
columnist for
The New York Times.

43:56.601 --> 43:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all of you to the
"NewsHour."

43:59.370 --> 44:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Margaret Sullivan, you're
sitting here next
to me.

44:00.838 --> 44:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to start with you.

44:02.807 --> 44:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard J.D. Vance say in that
previous discussion
in the program we saw the news
media, he said,

44:07.578 --> 44:12.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lying about what was going to
happen in this
election based on the polls.

44:12.416 --> 44:16.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I pointed out that we depend
on the polls,
but we don't do the polls
ourselves.

44:16.153 --> 44:19.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But how good a job or poor a job
did the media
do this time?

44:19.757 --> 44:21.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET SULLIVAN, The
Washington Post: Well,
I don't think that the
mainstream media was

44:21.993 --> 44:23.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lying about what was going to
happen.

44:23.828 --> 44:28.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think we missed the
overarching story to
a large extent.

44:28.165 --> 44:31.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is a failure on our
part.

44:31.469 --> 44:37.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it wasn't the result of, you
know, a plan
or a lie or anything as -- quite
as venal

44:37.441 --> 44:39.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as that.

44:39.243 --> 44:43.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Steve Deace, I
want to ask,
how much of this is a disconnect
between the

44:43.915 --> 44:47.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who write the stories and
the people
who are out living them in the
middle of the

44:47.251 --> 44:48.686 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country?

44:48.719 --> 44:50.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE DEACE, Radio Talk Show
Host: I think
it's a massive disconnect.

44:50.621 --> 44:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm someone who used to work
at a major
city newspaper which is
considered mainstream

44:55.593 --> 44:57.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or liberal media.

44:57.461 --> 45:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have done a lot of work with
USA Today and
MSNBC, which are considered the
same, because

45:01.999 --> 45:06.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I like to engage people that
have different
ideas than me and maybe even
persuade them.

45:06.103 --> 45:11.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how many people in the
newsroom here right
now at PBS, how many that work
here, how many

45:11.075 --> 45:12.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are pro-life?

45:12.310 --> 45:14.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How many of them go to church or
to mass once
a week?

45:14.812 --> 45:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How many of them voted for
Trump?

45:16.647 --> 45:19.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think there is a lot of
talk of the
lack of diversity.

45:19.817 --> 45:24.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is a huge lack of
ideological and cultural
diversity in our newsrooms.

45:24.622 --> 45:27.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's creating a
massive disconnect
nationwide.

45:27.491 --> 45:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jim Rutenberg,
connect those
two things.

45:29.994 --> 45:36.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just heard Margaret Sullivan
speak about
how the press missed the story,
and we hear

45:36.467 --> 45:39.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Steve Deace saying how
disconnected we are
from the rest of the country.

45:39.704 --> 45:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you see all of this?

45:41.606 --> 45:44.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM RUTENBERG, The New York
Times: Well, I
kind of, in a way, agree with
all of the above,

45:44.842 --> 45:49.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that it's indisputable that
America's newsrooms,
especially its mainstream
newsrooms, are not

45:49.480 --> 45:51.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
diverse with ideological
opinion.

45:51.182 --> 45:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lot of journalists are not
-- don't
consider themselves ideological,
though much

45:55.620 --> 45:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the country doesn't believe
that these
days.

45:57.855 --> 46:02.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So -- but I do believe that we
need people
with different backgrounds.

46:02.660 --> 46:06.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But mainstream newsrooms aren't
going to go
looking for people with
ideological viewpoints.

46:06.764 --> 46:07.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not what we do.

46:07.798 --> 46:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our editorial page issue should.

46:09.734 --> 46:14.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you do want people who at
least grew up
or kind of are immersed in the
kind of thinking.

46:14.639 --> 46:19.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one thing I want to argue
here, though,
is that this isn't about
geography.

46:19.276 --> 46:20.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not about the middle of the
country.

46:20.378 --> 46:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I wrote this today, that
it's a state
of mind.

46:23.247 --> 46:27.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there are people on Long
Island who
are hard-core Trump voters who I
don't think

46:27.618 --> 46:32.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are understood by most
mainstream news reporters
who live amongst them.

46:32.423 --> 46:33.624 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

46:33.658 --> 46:36.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's a psychology, as much
as it is about
geography.

46:36.761 --> 46:41.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Margaret
Sullivan, what
about the idea that there is an
affirmation

46:41.298 --> 46:47.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bias in the press, that perhaps
we went along
with the polls because it was
more palatable

46:47.204 --> 46:50.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whatever -- the prediction
was more palatable,
and that we didn't dig into the
numbers on

46:50.474 --> 46:54.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how the polls got to the way
they were, especially
considering there was such
uniformity?

46:54.578 --> 47:00.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET SULLIVAN: This was the
year of magical
thinking on the part of a lot of
journalists.

47:00.851 --> 47:08.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We thought that it would be --
it was unthinkable
that someone who was insulting
people, saying

47:08.826 --> 47:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
racist and xenophobic and sexist
and misogynist
things could become the
president.

47:15.766 --> 47:22.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we didn't really -- many
of us didn't
really deal with the idea that
this could

47:22.640 --> 47:24.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the case.

47:24.508 --> 47:31.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the polls were close enough
and the election
forecasts were often saying that
Hillary Clinton

47:31.082 --> 47:36.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would, you know, win, and you
know, she was
probable by 85 percent or
something like that.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there were a lot of factors
working for
us.

47:39.290 --> 47:45.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that we did get out into
the different
parts of the country and do some
reporting.

47:45.863 --> 47:46.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did we do enough?

47:46.864 --> 47:48.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Did we listen hard enough?

47:48.399 --> 47:50.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I wonder about that.

47:50.201 --> 47:55.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Deace, you
brought up
a moment ago journalists, the
whole disconnect

47:55.139 --> 47:56.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

47:57.007 --> 48:01.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we have strived, I
think, in newsrooms
for years to become, as we like
to put it,

48:01.912 --> 48:05.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more like America, to be more
diverse.

48:05.182 --> 48:09.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I hear you saying we have
missed a whole
chunk of the country in our
effort to be diverse.

48:09.987 --> 48:13.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE DEACE: I don't think there
is any question
about this.

48:13.190 --> 48:16.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I read something an L.A. Times
film critic
said a year ago, when "American
Sniper" was

48:16.861 --> 48:18.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the number one movie.

48:18.662 --> 48:21.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, listen, the only
people surprised
this is the number one movie are
the people

48:21.098 --> 48:24.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that live in the two coasts and
haven't visited
the 47 states in between.

48:24.668 --> 48:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, what Margaret said
about some of
the things Trump said, I mean,
that's why

48:28.105 --> 48:29.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was #NeverTrump.

48:29.206 --> 48:30.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was disturbed by those things.

48:30.674 --> 48:32.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you know what also disturbed
me?

48:32.343 --> 48:36.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To hear Hillary Clinton say that
I am her
-- quote -- "enemy," the
comments that were

48:36.347 --> 48:40.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made in the previous segment
from the WikiLeaks
e-mails calling Christians
backwards, the

48:40.518 --> 48:44.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact that those of us who think
that we shouldn't
have men in bathrooms next to
our young daughters

48:44.321 --> 48:47.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are called bigots, when we used
to just call
them parents.

48:47.792 --> 48:49.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those things create a backlash
as well.

48:49.727 --> 48:53.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't fault the media for
thinking that
Trump couldn't get elected
because of his

48:53.731 --> 48:55.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
incendiary comments.

48:55.633 --> 49:00.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fault, though, comes in the
fact that
an equal light was not shed on
Hillary's incendiary

49:00.771 --> 49:05.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comments and the backlash that
created against
her, which we saw in the vote
total last night.

49:05.709 --> 49:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jim Rutenberg,
what about that?

49:07.711 --> 49:09.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIM RUTENBERG: Yes.

49:09.480 --> 49:12.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think -- and I think that what
we learned
from the lack of reaction, I
think this is

49:12.750 --> 49:17.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where we see the disconnect, how
we ask ourselves,
and including some never-Trump
Republicans

49:17.388 --> 49:22.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- did the incendiary comment
from Mr. Trump
not create a backlash, and how
did he get

49:22.493 --> 49:24.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
elected in spite of it all?

49:24.495 --> 49:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that goes to, again,
not understanding
the level of anger in other
parts of the country

49:28.999 --> 49:32.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, to my point, certain people
everywhere.

49:32.203 --> 49:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they care much more about
the ills that
Mr. Trump was promising to cure
than they

49:38.809 --> 49:42.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cared about whatever personal
traits we were
writing about in our coverage.

49:42.580 --> 49:46.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Margaret
Sullivan, what
about this potential of almost
an observer

49:46.050 --> 49:50.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effect, having Jim's paper, The
New York Times,
or The Washington Post, having
these predictions

49:50.654 --> 49:56.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a daily basis seeing that
Hillary Clinton
is going to win by 92 percent
probability

49:56.093 --> 49:57.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or 85?

49:57.962 --> 50:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does that end up having kind of
a confirmation
effect over time, saying, well,
maybe I don't

50:02.366 --> 50:06.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to go out there and vote or
this is really
the narrative anyway?

50:06.070 --> 50:07.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Am I countering that?

50:07.371 --> 50:09.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Am I challenging that narrative
with a different
type of story?

50:09.506 --> 50:13.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET SULLIVAN: I think, when
you walk
into the voting booth, it's a
very emotional

50:13.177 --> 50:14.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

50:14.979 --> 50:19.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe that, for many
people, the idea
of the Clintons back in the
White House was

50:19.717 --> 50:23.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that, when they
actually walked
into the voting booth, they just
didn't want

50:23.454 --> 50:29.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to countenance, and that you can
talk about
experience or inexperience or
incendiary comments

50:29.693 --> 50:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or stronger together, make
America great again,
but a lot of times, it's a
purely emotional

50:36.533 --> 50:38.102 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

50:38.135 --> 50:41.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it speaks to how you feel
about your life
and the direction of the
country.

50:41.205 --> 50:44.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that's really what
we saw happening.

50:44.408 --> 50:50.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Deace, it's
such a big
subject to look at how the media
and a president

50:50.180 --> 50:51.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interact.

50:51.982 --> 50:56.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if there were mistakes made
in the campaign,
how can the media, shall we say,
be closer

50:56.854 --> 51:00.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the mark in how we approach
covering the
Trump presidency?

51:00.391 --> 51:06.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE DEACE: I think one of the
big things,
people misunderstood FOX's
original appeal

51:06.163 --> 51:08.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when it was launched 20 years
ago.

51:08.265 --> 51:14.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its original appeal is that it
looked at institutions
of America, the military,
churches, the family.

51:14.305 --> 51:19.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It didn't look or view them with
instantaneous
suspicion, because most
Americans do not.

51:19.143 --> 51:23.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, a lot of people
that live in
more progressive enclaves do.

51:23.380 --> 51:28.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I think, for example,
treating those institutions,
a lot of what you like to call
flyover country,

51:28.185 --> 51:33.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or, as the other guest pointed
out, Long Island,
would consider to be Americana,
but to deal

51:33.357 --> 51:36.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with them objectively, I think
that is key.

51:36.260 --> 51:40.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also fear that the media
has maybe made
a mistake with Trump that we
conservatives

51:40.531 --> 51:45.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made with Bill Clinton in the
'90s, where
we were so over the top, so
hysterical in

51:45.102 --> 51:49.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
our condemnations and
conspiracies and the
like, that, when something
serious came along,

51:49.773 --> 51:53.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like a president lying under
oath to a federal
grand jury, a lot of Americans
just sort of

51:53.978 --> 51:57.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waved their hand, Judy, and
said, oh, you
guys are always the boy who
cried wolf.

51:57.614 --> 52:02.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In many respects, you guys have
almost insulated
Mr. Trump from any legitimate
criticism he

52:02.453 --> 52:06.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may have as president, because
they are just
going to roll their eyes and
say, there goes

52:06.090 --> 52:07.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the media again.

52:07.324 --> 52:09.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there's
much more to
discuss here.

52:09.626 --> 52:11.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, again it's the first day
after this election.

52:11.829 --> 52:13.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are all conversations that
will continue.

52:13.664 --> 52:18.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But thank you very much, all
three, Steve
Deace, Jim Rutenberg, Margaret
Sullivan.
