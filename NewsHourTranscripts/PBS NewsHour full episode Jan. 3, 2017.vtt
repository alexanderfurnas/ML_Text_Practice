JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.372 --> 00:06.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.373 --> 00:07.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: And I'm Alison
Stewart.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
off to a rocky start.

00:10.344 --> 00:14.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican-controlled
Congress opens the
new session with a fight over
ethics.

00:14.982 --> 00:19.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Also ahead this
Tuesday, Judy
sits down for the first part of
an interview

00:19.620 --> 00:24.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with CIA Director John Brennan
to talk about
Russia, hacking and more.

00:24.324 --> 00:30.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN, CIA Director:
There are so many
ways to get into the digital
domain right

00:30.130 --> 00:31.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now and to collect information.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's one of the things that
we, as a country,
I don't think, have come to
terms with, just

00:35.702 --> 00:38.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how vulnerable we are.

00:38.438 --> 00:44.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And caught in the
aftermath
of Turkey's failed coup,
soldiers flee their

00:44.678 --> 00:48.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
homeland, while the president
demands their
return.

00:48.181 --> 00:52.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Turkey's
President Erdogan
has been ramping up the rhetoric
in relation

00:52.819 --> 00:56.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the military personnel
accused of complicity
in the coup.

00:56.456 --> 01:02.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan has said it is simply
inexcusable
to give shelter to people he
calls terrorist

01:02.262 --> 01:03.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
soldiers.

01:03.597 --> 01:10.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:10.771 --> 01:13.573 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:13.607 --> 01:21.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening, and
happy new
year.

01:21.581 --> 01:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to be having some
guests joining
me here at the "NewsHour" anchor
desk in the

01:25.886 --> 01:27.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming weeks.

01:27.788 --> 01:31.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, it's Alison Stewart,
who many of
you will recognize from the
weekend "NewsHour."

01:31.491 --> 01:32.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Alison.

01:32.492 --> 01:34.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Well, thank you,
Judy.

01:34.361 --> 01:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in our lead
story tonight:
The 115th Congress is officially
off and running,

01:39.566 --> 01:43.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but House Republicans stumbled
out of the
gate on this opening day.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

01:45.672 --> 01:50.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: For
Republicans, day one
of Congress and what they hope
is a bright

01:50.877 --> 01:55.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now era for their party started
with old issues
of internal dispute.

01:55.949 --> 02:00.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Republicans overnight
rebelled against
Paul Ryan and other leaders to
try and change

02:00.887 --> 02:02.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a House ethics panel.

02:02.422 --> 02:04.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then, this morning, they
reversed course.

02:05.025 --> 02:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The proposed change was about
the independent
Office of Congressional Ethics,
or OCE, which

02:10.564 --> 02:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reviews accusations.

02:12.499 --> 02:17.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It cannot punish members itself,
but it can
refer cases to the House Ethics
Committee.

02:17.971 --> 02:23.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The proposed revision would have
changed the
office's name to Complaint
Review and, more

02:23.377 --> 02:28.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notably, would have stripped its
independence,
putting it under the control of
the House

02:28.482 --> 02:30.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ethics Committee.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, some, like Iowa's Steve
King, were
dismayed that the measure was
pulled.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.554 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE KING (R), Iowa: I think we
should have
gone forward.

02:36.423 --> 02:40.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm going to push for the
full disbandment
and abolishment of the OCE,
because they're

02:40.761 --> 02:42.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
based upon the wrong principles.

02:42.562 --> 02:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And no one should have to be
subjected to
public criticism that's
generated by anonymous

02:47.601 --> 02:49.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accusers.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But more
Republicans, like
outgoing Ethics Committee
Chairman Charlie

02:51.738 --> 02:53.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dent, said the change would have
been a mistake.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.442 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE DENT (R), Pennsylvania:
I thought
it wasn't the right way to
proceed.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Perhaps no
coincidence, also
saying it was a mistake was
president-elect

03:00.747 --> 03:05.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, who asked on Twitter if
the change
should be a priority.

03:05.118 --> 03:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And House Democratic Leader
Nancy Pelosi slammed
Republicans, writing that the
move showed

03:09.423 --> 03:11.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
clear contempt for ethics.

03:11.792 --> 03:17.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It all led to rare tension on
what is usually
a happily bipartisan day with
members' families.

03:17.497 --> 03:22.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the roll call vote for
speaker, some
Democrats pointedly mentioned
the need for

03:22.169 --> 03:25.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strong ethics, sparking boos
from Republicans.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

03:26.573 --> 03:27.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
Paul Ryan.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:30.877 --> 03:35.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: But now
beginning his first
full term as speaker, Paul Ryan
spoke not

03:35.182 --> 03:38.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to dissatisfied members, but to
dissatisfied
voters.

03:38.318 --> 03:40.087 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: So,
I want to say to the American
people, we hear

03:42.889 --> 03:44.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will do right by you.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we will deliver.

03:48.328 --> 03:51.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the Senate,
there was
less political theater, but more
signs of

03:51.998 --> 03:56.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serious battles ahead, as new
Senate Democratic
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer
took on the

03:56.870 --> 04:01.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mantle of a key opposition voice
to president-elect-Trump
on Obamacare repeal.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Mr.
President-elect, what is your
plan to make

04:05.912 --> 04:10.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure all Americans can get
affordable health
care?

04:10.650 --> 04:15.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And a big day
today, but
an even bigger day tomorrow up
here, when

04:15.188 --> 04:20.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Obama and vice
president-elect Mike
Pence will both be here to talk
to their various

04:20.694 --> 04:22.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
parties about Obamacare -- Judy.

04:22.729 --> 04:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, what
does this split
among Republicans over the
ethics office tell

04:28.135 --> 04:29.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
us about what's coming up ahead?

04:29.636 --> 04:33.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think it has
very serious
implications.

04:33.406 --> 04:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans have long had
problems with issues
of rules and procedures, and
those continue.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a lot of unhappiness
with the conference.

04:40.147 --> 04:45.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the bigger point
here is that
they remain a divided conference
on some serious

04:45.585 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

04:47.354 --> 04:51.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one big one is coming up in
which no one
in America has really the clear
direction

04:51.491 --> 04:53.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yet, which is, how do you
replace Obamacare?

04:53.793 --> 04:59.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the House caucus with the
Republicans is
having trouble with this Office
of Congressional

04:59.166 --> 05:02.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ethics, which they have been
talking about
for years amongst themselves.

05:02.569 --> 05:08.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It raises questions about how
they will form
a plan to replace Obamacare in
the next year,

05:08.241 --> 05:10.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if that is possible.

05:10.076 --> 05:13.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, we heard
Speaker Ryan
say, among other things, "We
hear you," talking

05:13.380 --> 05:15.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the voters.

05:15.048 --> 05:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, it was some voters
who were
weighing in today that had
something to do

05:19.386 --> 05:21.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with this ethics outcome, didn't
it?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's such a
good point.

05:23.190 --> 05:27.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that what we're seeing
here is, while
voters are watching President
Trump, they're

05:27.694 --> 05:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also very closely watching this
Congress.

05:30.630 --> 05:35.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's clear that voters don't
yet trust
Republicans here in Congress
fully, and they're

05:35.202 --> 05:36.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
watching carefully.

05:36.703 --> 05:40.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They reacted very quickly,
overwhelming phone
calls here at the Capitol.

05:40.574 --> 05:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to a dozen members of
Congress who
said, Republicans and Democrats,
that their

05:45.412 --> 05:48.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
phone lines were clogged, and it
was about
that ethics change.

05:48.348 --> 05:53.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to a House operator who
told me it
was just a mess, all those calls
coming in.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Judy, what's amazing, that
change happened
late last night.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Voters got up and made those
phone calls right
away.

05:58.992 --> 06:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa, we also
heard a little
bit there from Chuck Schumer,
the incoming

06:04.030 --> 06:05.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Democratic leader in the Senate.

06:05.665 --> 06:08.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the opposition strategy
as of now?

06:08.435 --> 06:09.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Call him maybe the opposition in
chief.

06:11.771 --> 06:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats have lot of recovery
to do.

06:13.707 --> 06:18.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear who will be their
leading voice,
but right now Chuck Schumer
seems to be it.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not sure what their strategy
is yet.

06:20.680 --> 06:25.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, they tried out one, which
is to question
how Donald Trump operates.

06:25.452 --> 06:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his speech today, Chuck
assumer said it's
irresponsible the way that
Donald Trump makes

06:29.990 --> 06:30.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decisions.

06:30.957 --> 06:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He pointed to his tweets.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something we have heard
before, Judy.

06:33.827 --> 06:38.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But hearing that, I thought,
well, I'm not
sure that Trump voters, that
really hits where

06:38.598 --> 06:40.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they are about Donald Trump.

06:40.300 --> 06:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think we're going to see a
lot of different
attempts at answering Donald
Trump.

06:45.705 --> 06:49.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure Democrats have
figured out how
to do it quite yet, but Chuck
Schumer is the

06:49.509 --> 06:51.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
man to watch.

06:51.444 --> 06:54.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In just a few
seconds, Lisa,
what's the word on Republican
plans on Obamacare?

06:54.447 --> 06:56.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Watch in the next couple of
days, especially
tomorrow morning, Judy, when
President Obama

06:59.152 --> 07:04.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tries to rally his Democrat and
vice president-elect
Mike Pence tries to rally his
Republicans.

07:04.891 --> 07:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a several-step process
we're going to
be talking about for weeks.

07:08.628 --> 07:11.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa
Desjardins is going
to be right up there reporting.

07:11.698 --> 07:12.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, Lisa.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

07:14.734 --> 07:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: In the day's
other news: President-elect
Trump criticized General Motors
for building

07:18.305 --> 07:23.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compact cars in Mexico, on the
same day Ford
announced plans of its own to
invest in a

07:23.543 --> 07:25.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plant in the U.S.

07:25.412 --> 07:32.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a tweet aimed at GM, Mr.
Trump warned -- quote
-- "Make in USA or pay big
border tax."

07:32.118 --> 07:36.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company responded with a
statement that
only a tiny fraction of its
Chevy Cruze compacts

07:36.189 --> 07:38.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are made in Mexico.

07:38.058 --> 07:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past, Mr. Trump had
criticized Ford's
plans to build its Focus small
car in Mexico.

07:42.796 --> 07:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Ford shifted gears, with
its CEO pointing
to the new administration.

07:47.267 --> 07:51.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK FIELDS, CEO, Ford Motor
Company: We're
also encouraged by the
pro-growth policies

07:51.137 --> 07:57.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that president-elect Trump and
the new Congress
have indicated that they will
pursue.

07:57.210 --> 08:06.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we believe these tax and
regulatory reforms
are critically important to
boost U.S. competitiveness

08:06.186 --> 08:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and of course drive a resurgence
in American
manufacturing and high-tech
innovation.

08:12.225 --> 08:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Ford now plans
to invest $700
million in an existing Michigan
plant that

08:17.997 --> 08:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has been making the Focus.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
all of this
later in the program.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
president-elect
tapped

08:24.771 --> 08:29.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robert Lighthizer as his nominee
for U.S.
trade representative.

08:29.075 --> 08:33.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lighthizer served as a deputy in
that office
during the Reagan administration
and has called

08:33.713 --> 08:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a heavy tariff on imported
goods from
China.

08:37.050 --> 08:42.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In a statement, the
president-elect said Lighthizer
will fight for -- quote -- "good
trade deals

08:42.088 --> 08:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that put the American worker
first."

08:44.057 --> 08:47.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: In Turkey,
police spent another
day hunting for the suspect in
that deadly

08:48.027 --> 08:50.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new years attack on an Istanbul
club.

08:50.597 --> 08:56.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jonathan Rugman of Independent
Television
News has the latest.

08:56.436 --> 09:07.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: It was a new
year countdown
to a massacre; 75 minutes later,
a gunman

09:07.213 --> 09:13.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opened fire here, killing 39
people and injuring
69 others.

09:13.153 --> 09:18.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish media claimed this is
the chief suspect
filming himself in the center of
Istanbul

09:18.391 --> 09:23.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- we don't know when --
although most reporting,
including this, is based on
government leaks,

09:23.930 --> 09:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and some of it has turned out to
be false.

09:27.033 --> 09:31.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two foreign nationals have been
arrested at
Istanbul's main airport in
connection with

09:31.538 --> 09:32.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the attack.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sixteen people have been
detained in all.

09:35.208 --> 09:39.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The authorities said yesterday
they're close
to identifying the gunman.

09:39.512 --> 09:43.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, officials were silent on
that.

09:43.149 --> 09:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was only one policeman on
duty outside
one of Istanbul's most famous
nightclubs,

09:48.555 --> 09:54.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even though tens of thousands of
extra police
were supposedly deployed in the
city on New

09:54.227 --> 09:55.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Year's Eve.

09:56.029 --> 10:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This evening, hundreds joined a
protest against
the violence, and Turkey's main
opposition

10:02.735 --> 10:06.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leader called on the government
to resign.

10:06.172 --> 10:11.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
People are frightened of
criticizing President
Erdogan's increasingly
repressive administration,

10:11.778 --> 10:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
though some Turks now are.

10:13.580 --> 10:18.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
only way to
get over this kind of situation
is to bring

10:18.718 --> 10:22.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more democracy and freedom and
peace and more
secular institutions.

10:22.889 --> 10:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: And after the
latest terrorist
attack, this is an even more
febrile, volatile,

10:29.295 --> 10:34.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and divided country, in the
thrall of a government
promising security, but failing
to deliver

10:34.901 --> 10:36.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: The Islamic
State group has
claimed responsibility for the
nightclub attack.

10:40.006 --> 10:44.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Doubts are rising
about the
cease-fire in Syria, as
government forces

10:44.677 --> 10:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
press an offensive outside
Damascus.

10:47.213 --> 10:52.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rebel-held Barada Valley
controls the
water supply for millions of
people in and

10:52.318 --> 10:53.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the capital.

10:53.987 --> 10:58.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The government says it's
targeting members
of an al-Qaida affiliate who are
not part

10:58.124 --> 10:59.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the cease-fire.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Here in this
country, cleanup
crews are working across the
Deep South after

11:02.962 --> 11:05.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a night of killer storms.

11:05.265 --> 11:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four people died when a possible
tornado knocked
a tree onto their mobile home in
Rehobeth,

11:09.736 --> 11:10.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Alabama.

11:10.737 --> 11:13.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in Florida, a man drowned
in floodwater.

11:13.273 --> 11:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The line of severe thunderstorms
brought heavy
flooding rains and multiple
reports of tornado

11:18.244 --> 11:19.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sightings.

11:19.579 --> 11:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alabama, Georgia and the Florida
Panhandle
were the worst hit.

11:22.448 --> 11:27.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It turns out
investigators
have found no evidence that
Russian hackers

11:27.186 --> 11:29.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacked an electrical utility
in Vermont.

11:29.756 --> 11:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post reports that
malware found
on a laptop doesn't appear
connected to the

11:34.928 --> 11:38.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian hacking operation known
as Grizzly
Steppe.

11:38.464 --> 11:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Initial reports last week raised
fears the
Russians could be trying to
penetrate the

11:42.735 --> 11:44.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
country's electric grid.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: And the new year
got off to
a good start on Wall Street,
with a boost

11:47.774 --> 11:49.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from tech and health care
stocks.

11:50.009 --> 11:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 119
points to close at 19881.

11:55.048 --> 12:00.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 46
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added 19.

12:00.086 --> 12:05.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
my conversation with the CIA
director; Turkish

12:05.692 --> 12:15.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soldiers seeking safe haven
following a failed
coup attempt; and much more.

12:15.735 --> 12:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soldiers seeking safe haven
following a failed
coup attempt; and much more.

12:22.041 --> 12:27.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now we begin a series of
conversations with
top officials in the Obama
administration,

12:27.080 --> 12:30.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as its eight years in office
come to a close.

12:30.216 --> 12:35.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Brennan has served as
director of the
Central Intelligence Agency
since March of

12:35.321 --> 12:36.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2013.

12:36.623 --> 12:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's an agency he knew well
before his tenure
as director.

12:39.225 --> 12:45.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was a station chief overseas,
and an analyst
and executive in the agency for
25 years.

12:45.765 --> 12:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I began our conversation by
asking about the
status of the intelligence
community's report

12:51.004 --> 12:53.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Russia's hacking of the
election.

12:53.373 --> 12:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN, CIA Director: The
report is
in its final throes of
production.

12:57.310 --> 13:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the report will be shared
with the
president, who ordered up this
comprehensive

13:03.750 --> 13:06.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
review, within days.

13:06.085 --> 13:10.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the DNI, Jim Clapper, is the
one who is
leading this effort on behalf of
the intelligence

13:10.690 --> 13:12.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

13:12.458 --> 13:17.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's been a very, very
rigorous and
diligent review to make sure
that we have

13:17.864 --> 13:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
full appreciation of all the
intelligence
that's relevant.

13:20.500 --> 13:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that the story in
there, the intelligence
in there will be exactly what
the president

13:27.373 --> 13:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asked for, a comprehensive and
thorough review
about what happened during our
recent election

13:32.345 --> 13:34.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Russian involvement.

13:34.180 --> 13:38.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Will it prove
beyond a shadow
of a doubt that Russian
officials were trying

13:38.284 --> 13:40.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to interfere with the U.S.
election?

13:40.053 --> 13:44.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think, as
Jim Clapper
and Jeh Johnson said as early as
December,

13:44.157 --> 13:48.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there was clear evidence
that the Russians
were interfering in the
election.

13:48.661 --> 13:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I'm not going to reveal
the contents
of that report, because it is
still under

13:53.866 --> 13:58.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seal, and it will be provided to
the president
and to others, as appropriate.

13:58.104 --> 14:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it will address what Russia
was doing,
how it was doing it, and how we
know that.

14:04.377 --> 14:08.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I ask because, as
you know,
there are many doubters out
there.

14:08.247 --> 14:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of your former predecessors,
one of your
predecessors at the CIA, Jim
Woolsey, said

14:13.019 --> 14:16.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in an interview just this
morning that it
wasn't just the Russians.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said there were other
countries likely
involved.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He mentioned China, Iran.

14:20.893 --> 14:23.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are you convinced it was just
Russia?

14:23.996 --> 14:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, we know that
a number
of countries are involved in the
digital domain

14:28.634 --> 14:32.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and doing things in terms of
collecting information
and exposing information.

14:32.538 --> 14:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this report focuses on what
Russia specifically
did in the election.

14:37.577 --> 14:43.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so I think that the
intelligence carries
the analysis and the assessments
in it.

14:43.683 --> 14:48.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will leave it to the
president and others
to then make decisions about how
that report

14:48.654 --> 14:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to be handled, and what
information
will be shared and with whom.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you ruling
out hacking
by other countries?

14:54.327 --> 14:57.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: There is a lot of
activity that
is out there, but one of the
things that we

14:57.864 --> 15:02.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to make sure we understand
is what might
some of our adversaries be doing
to disrupt

15:02.635 --> 15:06.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the foundation tenets of
our democracy,
which is our presidential
election?

15:06.739 --> 15:10.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But let me -- I
want to continue
with the doubters, because
Donald Trump himself

15:10.610 --> 15:15.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been questioning this,
saying, how do
you know it's the Russians?

15:15.281 --> 15:19.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's pointed to the fact -- in
fact, he said
a number of times now that the
CIA has been

15:19.719 --> 15:21.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wrong before.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He keeps referring to the
allegations that
there were weapons...

15:23.623 --> 15:24.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN BRENNAN: Iraq WMD.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, Iraq weapons
of mass destruction,
which was wrong.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN BRENNAN: Right.

15:29.495 --> 15:33.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the aftermath of that,
there was a
total review of the review
process and the

15:33.533 --> 15:37.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
analytic process and the
assessments that
are done within the intelligence
community,

15:37.069 --> 15:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a number of steps that were
taken to
make sure that we are going to
be as accurate

15:42.909 --> 15:44.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as possible.

15:44.377 --> 15:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's been light-years
since that Iraq
WMD report has been done.

15:48.714 --> 15:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been tremendous, I
think, further
development of our analytic
capabilities,

15:52.952 --> 15:55.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as well as our intelligence
collection capabilities.

15:55.822 --> 16:00.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is no intelligence
community worldwide
that has the capabilities, the
expertise,

16:00.226 --> 16:03.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the analytic capability as the
U.S. intelligence
community.

16:03.930 --> 16:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I would suggest to
individuals who
have not yet seen the report,
who have not

16:08.067 --> 16:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yet been briefed on it that they
wait and
see what it is that the
intelligence community

16:13.573 --> 16:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is putting forward before they
make those
judgments.

16:15.708 --> 16:19.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were
telling me that
president-elect Trump will see
this report

16:19.312 --> 16:21.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before the public does.

16:21.047 --> 16:24.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN BRENNAN: The
president-elect will be
entitled to receiving briefings,
the report

16:24.951 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
itself, if President Obama says
that that's
what should happen.

16:29.121 --> 16:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, absolutely, as the incoming
administration
and the incoming president, he
will be entitled

16:33.559 --> 16:35.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the full report.

16:35.061 --> 16:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about WikiLeaks.

16:38.564 --> 16:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The organization that produced
these leaks
about the Democrats in this in
this -- in

16:44.670 --> 16:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the election, founded by Julian
Assange, he
told me in an interview last
fall, he reiterated

16:49.141 --> 16:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just in the last couple of days
that WikiLeaks
didn't get this information from
the Russians

16:55.815 --> 16:57.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or from any state actor.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how does that square with
what you're
saying?

16:59.452 --> 17:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, he's not
exactly a bastion
of truth and integrity.

17:04.257 --> 17:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, therefore, I wouldn't
ascribe to any
of these individual making
comments that it

17:10.696 --> 17:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is providing the whole,
unvarnished truth.

17:13.933 --> 17:18.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, this report is going to
include what
it is that we know about what
happened, what

17:18.971 --> 17:24.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was collected, what was
disclosed, and what
the purpose and intent of that
effort was.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Will it make
clear what the
connection was between the
Russians and WikiLeaks,

17:28.915 --> 17:30.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how WikiLeaks got it?

17:30.416 --> 17:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Again, I'm not
going to get
ahead of this report coming out.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are things that will be
addressed and
are addressed in the report.

17:35.721 --> 17:40.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The intelligence
community,
officials in the intelligence
community have

17:40.059 --> 17:42.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
told reporters that it wasn't
just the Democrats.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was the Republicans.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican National Committee
was also hacked.

17:46.365 --> 17:47.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Was it?

17:47.700 --> 17:51.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, if so, why wasn't that
material leaked?

17:51.237 --> 17:56.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Again, I am not
going to get
ahead of the release of this
report to the

17:56.575 --> 17:58.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president and to others.

17:58.577 --> 18:05.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is active collection
that goes on
in that cyber-realm by a number
of our adversaries

18:05.618 --> 18:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and a number of countries.

18:07.653 --> 18:12.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't think one should
think that
certain elements or entities are
protected

18:12.091 --> 18:14.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from that type of collection.

18:14.493 --> 18:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's collection and then
there's also
disclosure.

18:17.129 --> 18:22.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what it is that we do is
try to find
out what people are doing, who
is responsible

18:22.401 --> 18:27.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for it, and what their intention
is, and how
they're seeking to use it to
advantage themselves

18:27.940 --> 18:29.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and to disadvantage U.S.
national security.

18:29.675 --> 18:33.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think the
motive of
the Russians was to help Donald
Trump?

18:33.145 --> 18:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Again, that's one
of the things
that will be addressed inside
the report.

18:37.316 --> 18:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to address that in
advance of
its release.

18:39.652 --> 18:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And if I ask you
about whether
the Trump campaign was hacked,
the answer

18:44.056 --> 18:45.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would be?

18:45.858 --> 18:48.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: I would say that's
a question
to ask the Trump campaign, and
those agencies

18:48.761 --> 18:51.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that are responsible for
domestic intelligence
and homeland security.

18:51.530 --> 18:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
Trump businesses
since he became a prominent
candidate for

18:55.935 --> 18:57.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Again, that is
something for
others, not for the CIA director
to address.

18:59.538 --> 19:03.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I ask because
people are
pointing out the fact that there
are buildings

19:03.576 --> 19:08.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Trump on them, the Trump
label on them,
located all over the world.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are those buildings now a target
because Donald
Trump is the next president?

19:11.784 --> 19:17.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think
there are a lot
of identifiers of the United
States and the

19:17.189 --> 19:19.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. government, some that are
very iconic.

19:19.825 --> 19:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the Trump name is
something that
is associated more and more
today because

19:24.730 --> 19:28.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's been elected our president
that identifies
with the United States, the
United States

19:28.934 --> 19:30.803 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's one of the things that
I think those
responsible for security of
those facilities,

19:34.140 --> 19:38.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as for the systems and
networks, need
to take into account, that, in
this day and

19:39.011 --> 19:46.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
age where there are so many ways
to damage
buildings, infrastructure,
systems and networks,

19:46.786 --> 19:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they need on put in place the
appropriate
safeguards to protect themselves
from these

19:52.024 --> 19:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
types of attacks, whether they
be kinetic
attacks or cyber-attacks.

19:55.861 --> 20:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it the CIA's
or the intelligence
community's fault that this
happened, or is

20:01.033 --> 20:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it the individual political
organizations
that were hacked?

20:04.370 --> 20:06.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is it their responsibility?

20:06.205 --> 20:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think
there are so many
ways to get into the digital
domain right

20:11.877 --> 20:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now and to collect information.

20:13.646 --> 20:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's one of the things
that I really
hope that the next
administration picks up

20:17.116 --> 20:22.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on what the Obama administration
did, was
to try to better secure our
digital environments.

20:22.588 --> 20:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's one of the things we as
a country,
I don't think, have come to
terms with, just

20:27.026 --> 20:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how vulnerable we are to these
types of attacks
from adversaries, whether it's
to collect

20:33.599 --> 20:39.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
information, personal
identifying information,
or it's to bring down
infrastructure, or to

20:39.438 --> 20:43.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prevent our military services
from carrying
out their duties.

20:43.275 --> 20:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is something that I
think is going
to be sort of the wave of the
future in terms

20:47.279 --> 20:52.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what it is that we as a
country need to
do in order to protect
ourselves, our future,

20:52.618 --> 20:54.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our prosperity.

20:54.487 --> 20:59.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that environment right now
still is very
vulnerable to nation states, to
organizations,

20:59.558 --> 21:05.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to hacktivists, to individuals
who have the
talent and the capability to
navigate inside

21:05.664 --> 21:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of systems and networks and
disable or destroy
them.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But my question
is, should
the intelligence community have
prevented

21:11.871 --> 21:14.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this, have seen it coming and
stopped it?

21:14.340 --> 21:18.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: The intelligence
community has
a responsibility to provide our
policy-makers,

21:18.878 --> 21:23.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as officials with law
enforcement,
homeland security
responsibilities, the best

21:23.549 --> 21:28.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence we have about what
adversaries'
capabilities and intents are.

21:28.154 --> 21:29.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's what we do.

21:30.022 --> 21:33.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We try to make sure they
understand what types
of attacks we could be seeing in
the cyber-realm,

21:33.225 --> 21:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they might be trying to
accomplish, under
what scenarios might they be
able -- might

21:37.229 --> 21:38.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they leverage those
capabilities.

21:38.764 --> 21:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of countries have the
ability to do
damage in that cyber-domain.

21:42.168 --> 21:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They decide not to do it because
they know
that there would be steps taken
against them.

21:47.840 --> 21:54.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: My question,
though, still
is, was it the intelligence
community's responsibility

21:54.146 --> 21:55.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to prevent this from happening?

21:55.614 --> 21:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: No, not the
intelligence community's
responsibility.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We share responsibility with the
rest of the
government.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's not just the government
that has
responsibility.

22:02.788 --> 22:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about a digital
environment
that is 85 percent owned by the
private sector,

22:07.526 --> 22:09.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
owned and operated by the
private sector.

22:09.428 --> 22:15.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the government's ability to
protect that
system from those penetrations
is limited.

22:15.467 --> 22:19.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why there needs to be a
national consensus
on what the role of the
government is going

22:19.338 --> 22:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be, the law enforcement
community, what
the FBI is supposed to be doing.

22:22.608 --> 22:26.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen these battles
raging about what
the bureau is able to do with
the various

22:26.946 --> 22:29.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
devices and with this
unbreakable encryption.

22:29.815 --> 22:36.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we need to come to terms
with this reality
that, in the 21st century, these
systems are

22:36.422 --> 22:40.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be used to advance the
human condition,
but they're also going to be
used by our adversaries,

22:40.726 --> 22:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether they be terrorists,
proliferators,
pedophiles, or others.

22:44.129 --> 22:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what are we going to allow
the government
to do to protect those systems?

22:47.266 --> 22:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did the CIA, did
the intelligence
community underestimate Vladimir
Putin?

22:51.103 --> 22:52.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Underestimate?

22:52.972 --> 22:56.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, I think we always felt as
though he was
somebody who had a very
assertive and aggressive

22:56.609 --> 22:58.043 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
strain.

22:58.077 --> 23:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We see what he's done in places
like Crimea
and Ukraine and in Syria.

23:01.580 --> 23:08.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tends to flex muscles, not
just on himself,
but also in terms of Russia's
military capabilities.

23:08.354 --> 23:13.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He plays by his own rules in
terms of what
it is that he does in some of
these theaters

23:13.158 --> 23:14.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of conflict.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I don't think we
underestimated him.

23:16.695 --> 23:22.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He has sought to advance
Russia's interests
in areas where there have been
political vacuums

23:22.268 --> 23:24.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and conflicts.

23:24.136 --> 23:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he doesn't ascribe to the
same types of
rules that we do, for example,
in law of armed

23:29.575 --> 23:31.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conflict.

23:31.410 --> 23:34.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the Russians have done in
Syria in terms
of some of the scorched-earth
policy that

23:34.446 --> 23:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have pursued that have led
to devastation
and thousands upon thousands of
innocent deaths,

23:39.952 --> 23:44.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's not something that the
United States
would ever do in any of these
military conflicts.

23:44.523 --> 23:49.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Did the United
States, did
the intelligence community miss
the fact that

23:49.895 --> 23:52.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia was going to get involved
in Syria?

23:52.064 --> 23:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That wasn't known ahead of time.

23:53.299 --> 23:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Oh, well, it was.

23:54.933 --> 23:57.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia has had a 50-, 60-year
investment in
Syria.

23:57.836 --> 24:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have had military bases
there, military
advisers and facilities.

24:02.374 --> 24:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They ratcheted up the support to
the Bashar
Assad regime, as the opposition
gained strength

24:06.979 --> 24:12.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and as the Syrian regime
continued to be degraded
by the opposition forces.

24:12.217 --> 24:16.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we could see the Russians
were not going
to abandon a long-term ally.

24:16.955 --> 24:20.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were going to invest more
in protecting
that ally.

24:20.592 --> 24:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been negotiations
going on to try
to get the Russians and others
to understand

24:24.730 --> 24:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Bashar Assad is part of the
problem.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not part of the solution.

24:28.200 --> 24:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they decided to double down
and to bring
in their latest weaponry, both
in terms of

24:33.272 --> 24:37.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fixed and rotor-wing aircraft,
tanks, APCs,
other types of things.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So they have a major investment
in Syria.

24:39.978 --> 24:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the opposition was -- as
good as they
were putting up a fight against
the regime,

24:44.650 --> 24:45.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they were fighting the Syrians.

24:45.651 --> 24:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were fighting the Iranians.

24:47.019 --> 24:49.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They have been fighting
Hezbollah, as well
as the Russian military.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So the odds were stacked against
them.

24:52.257 --> 24:57.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Russians decided that
they were not
going to allow the Free Syrian
Army, the opposition,

24:57.830 --> 25:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have legitimate grievances
against the
Assad regime to prevail.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unfortunately, the Russians
painted the entire
opposition as terrorists.

25:06.372 --> 25:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why they undertook
this very bold,
and, in my mind, in many
respects, reckless

25:12.811 --> 25:16.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military action to mow down so
many Syrians.

25:16.849 --> 25:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But could the
situation in
Syria have been better by any
degree had the

25:22.154 --> 25:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. gotten more involved?

25:23.989 --> 25:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: You know, 20/20
hindsight is
quite -- you know, it's
illuminating, looking

25:29.194 --> 25:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at it in the rear-view mirror in
terms of
what could have happened, based
on the things

25:32.998 --> 25:34.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that did happen.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has been an unfortunate
turn of events
over the last several years.

25:37.403 --> 25:42.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Syrian revolution
started, the Arab
spring, there was no such thing
as ISIL.

25:42.741 --> 25:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIL was al-Qaida in Iraq and it
was just
less than 1,000 individuals.

25:47.780 --> 25:54.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There was a wave then of
developments inside
of Syria and Iraq that resulted
in current-day

25:54.920 --> 25:56.655 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

25:56.688 --> 26:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one could have envisioned
that, in terms
of the series of events that
took place.

26:01.093 --> 26:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, do we lament what has
happened in Syria?

26:04.830 --> 26:06.598 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

26:06.632 --> 26:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we had a chance to do it over
again, would
there have been some adjustments
and changes?

26:08.667 --> 26:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can't speak for policy-makers.

26:10.869 --> 26:12.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not a policy-maker.

26:12.638 --> 26:17.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when I look back, in light
of the way
things evolved, I think that
there could have

26:18.010 --> 26:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been some adjustments to some of
the policies,
not just by the United States,
but by other

26:23.849 --> 26:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries, in order to address
this question
earlier or, and not allow the
ISILs and the

26:30.656 --> 26:35.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaidas
to gain momentum
and steam and taking advantage
of the destruction

26:35.994 --> 26:37.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of that country.

26:37.729 --> 26:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, not getting
involved turns
out to be something that's
regretted?

26:40.999 --> 26:46.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BRENNAN: Well, I think the
way that the
situation unfolded was -- is
regrettable.

26:47.005 --> 26:50.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: CIA Director John
Brennan.

26:50.275 --> 26:54.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tune in tomorrow night for part
two of our
conversation, where we look
ahead to the U.S.

26:54.646 --> 27:00.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationship with Russia in the
Trump administration.

27:00.352 --> 27:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Stay with us.

27:11.163 --> 27:15.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
economics
and politics behind Ford's
decision to invest

27:15.934 --> 27:22.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more in Michigan; and President
Obama's enduring
mark on the U.S. education
system.

27:22.307 --> 27:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: In Turkey, President
Recep Tayyip
Erdogan is pushing NATO allies
to return hundreds

27:28.814 --> 27:33.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of officers and soldiers who've
sought asylum
in other countries following the
coup attempt

27:33.485 --> 27:36.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last July aimed at toppling his
government.

27:36.788 --> 27:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Greece, eight wanted Turkish
military personnel
are fighting extradition.

27:41.193 --> 27:45.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since the coup, President
Erdogan has
disputed a longstanding border
treaty between

27:45.430 --> 27:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the two countries.

27:47.299 --> 27:51.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Military analysts warn that
relations between
Greece and Turkey are at their
lowest point

27:51.169 --> 27:52.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in more than 20 years.

27:52.804 --> 27:55.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From Greece, Malcolm Brabant
reports.

27:55.140 --> 28:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The attempted
coup against
President Erdogan only lasted a
few hours

28:00.846 --> 28:02.214 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in July.

28:02.247 --> 28:06.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the clashes left about 300
dead and more
than 2,000 injured.

28:06.752 --> 28:08.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNFIRE)

28:08.554 --> 28:13.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Within hours of
President
Erdogan wrestling back control,
eight Turkish

28:13.692 --> 28:17.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military personnel flew to
Northern Greece
and sought political asylum.

28:17.863 --> 28:22.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They went to court on charges of
entering
the country illegally amid
Turkish claims

28:22.801 --> 28:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they were terrorists.

28:25.070 --> 28:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since then, they have been
fighting extradition,
arguing that they risk a death
sentence if

28:30.042 --> 28:31.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
returned.

28:31.810 --> 28:35.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The eight Turkish soldiers and
pilots are
currently being held at this
police station

28:35.080 --> 28:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the outskirts of Athens.

28:36.848 --> 28:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAVROULA TOMARA, Attorney: They
realize that
they are held here as prisoners,
basically

28:39.418 --> 28:40.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as prisoners of war.

28:40.686 --> 28:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is how I would name them.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have been extremely
depressed.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are anxious.

28:46.291 --> 28:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are frightened, scared,
extremely
scared about what's going to
happen.

28:50.262 --> 28:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Stavroula
Tomara is one of
the lawyers trying to prevent
their extradition.

28:54.666 --> 28:58.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She insists their claims for
asylum are entirely
justified.

28:58.737 --> 29:04.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STAVROULA TOMARA: These people
were persecuted
due to the reasons of political
opinions and

29:04.042 --> 29:07.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
social status they had.

29:07.045 --> 29:08.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were Kemalists.

29:08.046 --> 29:09.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are Kemalists.

29:09.348 --> 29:15.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were in a social group
that is being
persecuted.

29:15.487 --> 29:20.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Kemalists
uphold the ideals
of Kemal Ataturk, the First
World War hero

29:20.759 --> 29:26.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who modernized Turkey by turning
it into a
secular, Westward-oriented
state.

29:26.732 --> 29:32.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The army's traditional role,
buttressing secularism,
has been eroded under President
Erdogan and

29:32.404 --> 29:40.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his vision of Turkey as a
regional superpower
with conservative Islam at its
core.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Erdogan alleges that this man
orchestrated
the coup.

29:43.181 --> 29:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His name is Fethullah Gulen.

29:45.350 --> 29:50.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is living in exile in
Pennsylvania,
where he runs an organization
that purports

29:50.555 --> 29:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to promote moderate Islamic
values.

29:53.659 --> 29:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Erdogan accuses him of running a
terrorist
group.

29:57.062 --> 30:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On several occasions, he's
expressed anger
that Turkey's NATO allies refuse
to extradite

30:02.501 --> 30:08.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military personnel seeking
asylum in countries
across the alliance, from the
United States

30:08.306 --> 30:10.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Belgium.

30:10.242 --> 30:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): Belgium is now an
important center

30:14.813 --> 30:16.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for militants.

30:16.615 --> 30:21.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While important things happen,
while our mosques
are set on fire, nobody seems to
care.

30:21.053 --> 30:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of saying thank you to
my state, which
put down the attempted coup in
my country,

30:24.890 --> 30:26.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you are standing by the
plotters.

30:26.525 --> 30:29.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The mutineers are already in
your country.

30:29.127 --> 30:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Turkey's
President Erdogan
has been ramping up the rhetoric
in relation

30:32.998 --> 30:39.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the military personnel
accused of complicity
in the coup and seeking asylum
in NATO countries.

30:39.938 --> 30:45.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan has said it is simply
inexcusable
to give shelter to people he
calls terrorist

30:45.977 --> 30:47.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
soldiers.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite international concerns
about Turkey's
attitude towards human rights,
NATO has been

30:51.950 --> 30:56.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at pains not to upset Turkey and
its unpredictable
president.

30:56.588 --> 30:59.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Such is its strategic
importance.

30:59.858 --> 31:05.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a recent news conference, the
NATO secretary-general,
Jens Stoltenberg, expressed
solidarity with

31:05.697 --> 31:07.499 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Turkey.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO
Secretary-General:
It was shocking to visit the
National Assembly

31:09.434 --> 31:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Ankara, where I saw the
damage caused by
bombs from F-16s.

31:17.142 --> 31:25.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, Turkey has the
right to prosecute
those behind the failed coup
attempt.

31:25.383 --> 31:29.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: And Stoltenberg
avoided taking
sides over the extradition
question.

31:29.921 --> 31:38.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: Regarding the
Turkish officers,
it is up to the nations to
assess and to make

31:38.430 --> 31:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decisions on requests for
asylum.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not a NATO decision.

31:43.869 --> 31:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It's estimated
that 70,000
people have been arrested in
what critics

31:47.773 --> 31:50.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
describe as a post-coup purge.

31:50.976 --> 31:55.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, hundreds of Turkish
officers
serving in NATO countries have
defied orders

31:55.914 --> 31:58.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to return and have sought
asylum.

31:58.416 --> 32:03.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The highest-ranking asylum
seeker to go public
was stationed at the giant
Ramstein Base in

32:03.288 --> 32:04.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Germany.

32:04.289 --> 32:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is air force Brigadier Mehmet
Yalinalp.

32:06.191 --> 32:11.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEHMET YALINALP, Accused Turkish
Air Force
Officer: What I see is, the
number of people

32:11.596 --> 32:20.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who have this common
denominator, like having
firm belief in Ataturk's
founding principles

32:20.272 --> 32:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our state, democracy, freedom
of speech,
openness, integration with the
West in values,

32:31.483 --> 32:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course, have been pulled into
a list of
purge, and they are pushed away
from the government.

32:40.592 --> 32:44.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Vice President
Joe Biden
tasted Erdogan's anger during a
visit to Ankara

32:45.030 --> 32:50.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in August, when he was urged to
extradite
Fethullah Gulen, the man
Turkey's president

32:50.302 --> 32:52.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blames for the coup.

32:52.070 --> 32:56.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN (through
translator):
According to the extradition of
criminals

32:56.541 --> 33:01.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
treaty between the two
countries, people like
Gulen would be at least taken
under custody,

33:01.780 --> 33:04.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arrested and remain under arrest
throughout
the trial.

33:04.616 --> 33:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This person continues to manage
this terrorist
organization from where he is.

33:08.386 --> 33:12.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: We are determined to
listen to every

33:12.457 --> 33:18.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scrap of evidence that Turkey
can provide
or that we can find out about.

33:18.830 --> 33:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, I say to the people
of Turkey,
what possible motive could we
have to in fact

33:29.407 --> 33:31.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
harbor a terrorist?

33:31.243 --> 33:36.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But of all the
NATO countries
resisting Turkey's will, it is
Greece that

33:36.381 --> 33:42.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is facing greatest pressure in a
region popular
with European vacationers.

33:42.153 --> 33:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish mainland resorts like
Bodrum are just
five miles or so from the Greek
islands in

33:46.992 --> 33:48.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Aegean Sea.

33:48.860 --> 33:54.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greek airspace above the islands
is frequently
breached by Turkish warplanes
probing defenses

33:54.432 --> 33:56.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and testing Athens' resolve.

33:56.868 --> 34:02.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greece and Turkey almost went to
war 20 years
ago over a small uninhabited
islet called

34:02.340 --> 34:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Imia, which is not very far away
from here.

34:05.677 --> 34:11.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Military analysts say that the
hostile atmosphere
that prevailed then has returned
since President

34:11.249 --> 34:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan announced that he's not
happy with
the Treaty of Lausanne, which
defines Greek

34:16.221 --> 34:17.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Turkish territory.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That treaty was signed in 1923.

34:20.292 --> 34:25.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, for almost a century, it
has been
the guarantor of peaceful, if
antagonistic,

34:25.563 --> 34:27.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coexistence.

34:27.299 --> 34:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are genuine fears here
that these
islands are about to become less
tranquil.

34:33.238 --> 34:38.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Military analyst Athanasios
Drougas is concerned
that disputes over the Turkish
soldiers and

34:38.476 --> 34:43.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
territory in the eastern Aegean
Sea could
whip up into a perfect storm.

34:43.181 --> 34:48.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ATHANASIOS DROUGAS, Military
Analyst: We would
probably see, as a scenario,
Turks to be on

34:48.219 --> 34:51.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Greek island or some rocks in
the Aegean
Sea.

34:51.756 --> 34:56.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm talking about skirmishes,
not, of course,
a total war, because, as you
know, Greece

34:56.594 --> 35:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Turkey are members of NATO,
and then we
will have American or NATO
diplomatic intervention.

35:02.801 --> 35:07.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: NATO warships
are currently
patrolling the Aegean to
discourage migrants

35:07.772 --> 35:10.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from attempting to reach the
Greek islands.

35:10.842 --> 35:17.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Following a turbulent 2016, and
a potentially
dangerous 2017, the last thing
NATO wants

35:17.816 --> 35:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is serious trouble between
so-called allies.

35:20.485 --> 35:27.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Greece.

35:27.192 --> 35:38.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today's
announcement by the
Ford Motor Company that it would
add 700 more

35:38.903 --> 35:44.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jobs at a Michigan plant came
after it became
one of a number of companies
squarely in the

35:44.609 --> 35:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
eye of president-elect Trump.

35:47.212 --> 35:51.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
William Brangham follows up on
what's behind
this move and others like it.

35:51.082 --> 35:54.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Ford
announcement follows
moves from several other
companies saying

35:55.020 --> 35:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they too might keep some jobs in
the U.S.
that were planned for Mexico or
elsewhere.

35:59.924 --> 36:04.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president-elect has
repeatedly tweeted
about some of these companies,
including Ford,

36:04.095 --> 36:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and pressing them to keep jobs
in the U.S.

36:06.965 --> 36:11.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ford said today that it didn't
consult with
Mr. Trump on their Michigan
decision.

36:11.169 --> 36:14.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Josh Boak has been covering the
story for
the Associated Press.

36:14.205 --> 36:15.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he joins me now.

36:15.573 --> 36:17.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, Josh, bring us up to speed.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did Ford agree to do today?

36:19.811 --> 36:24.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BOAK, Associated Press:
Ford announced
that it wasn't going to build a
$1.6 billion

36:24.616 --> 36:26.351 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
plant in Mexico.

36:26.384 --> 36:29.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were a few reasons for
that, one of
which was that the plant was
going to build

36:29.587 --> 36:31.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Ford Focuses.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And sales of that car have
dipped as oil prices
have fallen.

36:33.892 --> 36:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is a
little, small,
fuel-efficient vehicle.

36:36.161 --> 36:37.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH BOAK: Exactly.

36:37.996 --> 36:42.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the other major impact has
been Donald
Trump on Twitter talking about
companies and

36:42.767 --> 36:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what he wants to see them do,
and those two
seem to have combined together.

36:47.839 --> 36:52.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ford's own CEO said he hoped
that Trump's
policies on deregulation and
taxes would be

36:52.444 --> 36:54.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good for the company and good
for the country.

36:54.579 --> 36:58.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As we
mentioned before,
this follows moves where Trump
has targeted

36:58.149 --> 37:01.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other companies, Carrier,
Boeing, Lockheed
Martin.

37:01.352 --> 37:06.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And companies have shifted their
positions
based according to what Mr.
Trump seems to

37:06.124 --> 37:07.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be saying.

37:08.026 --> 37:11.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overall, how many jobs are we
talking about
here that are going to be
staying in the U.S.?

37:11.796 --> 37:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BOAK: Well, as far as
Ford's announcement
today, they're looking to hire
700 workers

37:18.236 --> 37:19.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
starting in 2018.

37:19.904 --> 37:22.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When we look at Carrier, that's
800 jobs.

37:22.774 --> 37:26.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we look last week at
Sprint, that's 5,000
jobs.

37:26.544 --> 37:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OneWeb, that's 3,000 jobs.

37:28.446 --> 37:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that sounds like a lot in
an individual
announcement, but the U.S.
economy is massive.

37:34.152 --> 37:38.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It added 2.25 million jobs last
year alone.

37:38.890 --> 37:44.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's so great, that this is
really a drop
in the bucket in the big
picture.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's massive symbolically.

37:46.564 --> 37:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't forget that part of
economics is
psychology and the animal
spirits, and Trump

37:51.736 --> 37:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is really stirring them right
now.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, do you
credit these
moves to Donald Trump?

37:55.440 --> 37:59.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, he would love to take
credit for them,
and we have seen him do that
many times in

37:59.277 --> 38:00.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the past.

38:00.478 --> 38:03.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you credit him with what we
saw out of
Ford today?

38:03.114 --> 38:08.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BOAK: Well, many of the
chief executives
involved in these decisions are
crediting

38:08.153 --> 38:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump or attributing
their decisions
to him.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they have benefited from
that.

38:13.591 --> 38:18.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, with the Sprint deal,
for example,
we saw Masayoshi Son say this
has been the

38:18.596 --> 38:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
result of actions by the Trump
administration.

38:21.866 --> 38:26.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And giving credit to Donald
Trump has actually
been good for these companies.

38:26.905 --> 38:32.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sprint's stock is up more than
40 percent,
as of last Friday, since Trump
became president.

38:32.644 --> 38:37.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if the bottom line is what
these CEOs
really care about, then being on
Trump's side

38:37.315 --> 38:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thus far has been profitable.

38:39.217 --> 38:42.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, how much
of this -- getting
back to the point you made, how
much of this

38:42.053 --> 38:45.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is about economics and how much
of this is
about politics?

38:45.056 --> 38:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this about a substantial
change in manufacturing
policy by these companies, or is
this about

38:50.728 --> 38:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being on the right side of
public opinion?

38:52.564 --> 38:56.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH BOAK: Well, it's critical
to note there
actually hasn't been a policy
change, just

38:56.334 --> 38:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a series of tweets and public
statements and
phone calls.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We haven't seen a policy
overhaul.

39:01.372 --> 39:06.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen the promise of
policy overhauls
on regulatory and tax issues,
but those haven't

39:06.878 --> 39:08.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been manifest yet.

39:08.746 --> 39:13.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what this really appears to
be is a president-elect
able to exercise power on social
media in

39:13.318 --> 39:15.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a way that's unprecedented.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And corporations have seen
benefits to responding
to that.

39:17.889 --> 39:22.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We saw
president-elect Trump
leaning on GM today.

39:22.126 --> 39:26.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this, in your mind, just the
new paradigm,
that companies in the U.S. have
to prepare

39:27.031 --> 39:32.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the fact that you might have
the president-elect
or the soon-to-be president just
naming them

39:32.036 --> 39:33.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and shaming them?

39:33.037 --> 39:35.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSH BOAK: It's definitely
possible.

39:35.406 --> 39:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Business leaders I have talked
to have said
that they expect to have a
bullseye on them.

39:39.177 --> 39:43.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we have also seen
talking with members
of the Trump transition team is
that Donald

39:43.748 --> 39:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump sees these actions and
interventions
as a way to stay connected with
his voting

39:48.319 --> 39:50.054 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
base.

39:50.088 --> 39:53.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
that these
-- as you mentioned, this is not
necessarily

39:53.258 --> 39:55.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a reflection of a new policy.

39:55.093 --> 39:59.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, do you have any sense how
Trump might
-- how this might translate,
these actions

39:59.897 --> 40:04.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might translate into a more
cohesive economic
policy going forward?

40:04.035 --> 40:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH BOAK: Well, he ran on the
premise of
America first.

40:07.605 --> 40:11.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was all part of the
greater make
America great again theme.

40:11.276 --> 40:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's clearly said that he wants
to increase
manufacturing jobs.

40:14.445 --> 40:16.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so this seems to be a
component of that.

40:16.481 --> 40:18.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The question is how he goes
about that.

40:18.683 --> 40:22.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We don't have the policy
details, although
he has suggested that he will
impose a border

40:22.854 --> 40:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax of some kind on companies
that move jobs
overseas.

40:28.459 --> 40:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also suggested that he's
going to cut
regulation, which increases
profits for a

40:32.430 --> 40:34.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lot of these companies.

40:34.265 --> 40:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What remains to be seen is
whether he can
create jobs on a meaningful
scale and generate

40:38.336 --> 40:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kind of economic growth
that's he's actually
promised, about 3.5 percent a
year.

40:43.341 --> 40:46.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It seems to be
he has got
a carrots-and-sticks policy
going here.

40:46.744 --> 40:51.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to offer them,
potentially, less
regulations and thus lower
taxes, and then

40:51.916 --> 40:56.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also threaten to put this tax on
them if they
try to leave the country.

40:56.587 --> 41:01.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think that there's an
appetite in Congress
to actually put those measures
into place?

41:01.492 --> 41:04.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSH BOAK: Well, that remains to
be seen.

41:04.862 --> 41:10.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What executives like Ford CEO
Mark Fields
has said when he talks about his
decision

41:11.002 --> 41:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Mexico is to say -- is to
emphasize the
taxes and deregulation.

41:16.407 --> 41:19.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is focusing on the carrots,
not the sticks.

41:19.777 --> 41:23.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Business leaders are emphasizing
those carrots,
which means that they either
don't want to

41:23.915 --> 41:26.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
address the sticks or they don't
think the
sticks are likely to happen.

41:26.684 --> 41:29.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You have
obviously been
covering economic policy for a
long time.

41:29.887 --> 41:35.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How unusual is this, to have a
president-elect
naming companies by name and
singling them

41:35.159 --> 41:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- singling them out, and then
them responding?

41:37.729 --> 41:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH BOAK: It's unprecedented
because he hasn't
assumed office yet.

41:41.766 --> 41:46.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More importantly, he's doing so
on social
media and other venues that
presidents historically

41:46.237 --> 41:47.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have not had.

41:47.472 --> 41:50.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Just because
it hasn't existed.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH BOAK: Exactly.

41:51.909 --> 41:55.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Josh Boak, AP,
thank you very much for being
here.

41:55.646 --> 42:02.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH BOAK: Thank you.

42:02.987 --> 42:10.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: We continue our
look at the
Obama years and his legacy.

42:10.695 --> 42:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we focus on a subject
that often
gets less attention, public
education.

42:16.134 --> 42:19.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Much of what happens in the
classroom is decided
at the state and local level.

42:19.837 --> 42:24.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the federal government can
also be a big
player in some of the most
personal issues

42:24.475 --> 42:30.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for families, which is also the
focus of our
weekly segment Making the Grade.

42:30.148 --> 42:36.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Throughout most of his term,
President Obama
and his former education
secretary, Arne Duncan,

42:36.721 --> 42:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exercised far more power and
influence in
education than many of their
predecessors.

42:41.692 --> 42:46.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One major focus, a demand for
greater student
testing tied directly to teacher
evaluation

42:46.431 --> 42:49.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, crucially, federal money
for schools.

42:49.834 --> 42:55.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Duncan was essentially the
gatekeeper of billion
of stimulus money known as Race
to the Top.

42:55.940 --> 42:59.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Districts could qualify if they
agreed to
meet those criteria.

42:59.043 --> 43:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Initially, many states joined
in.

43:01.446 --> 43:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, over time, resistance began
building
to testing, data-driven metrics,
and whether

43:06.484 --> 43:09.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teachers were being judged
unfairly.

43:09.353 --> 43:11.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president himself addressed
those concerns.

43:11.489 --> 43:14.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
When we talk about testing,
parents worry

43:14.959 --> 43:19.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it means more teaching to
the test.

43:19.197 --> 43:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some worry that tests are
culturally biased.

43:23.801 --> 43:28.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teachers worry that they will be
evaluated
solely on the basis of a single
standardized

43:28.339 --> 43:29.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
test.

43:29.340 --> 43:32.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everybody thinks that's unfair.

43:32.710 --> 43:34.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is unfair.

43:34.812 --> 43:36.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's not what Race to the
Top is about.

43:36.681 --> 43:39.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What Race to the Top says is,
there's nothing
wrong with testing.

43:39.951 --> 43:44.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just need better tests
applied in a way
that helps teachers and
students, instead

43:44.489 --> 43:49.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of stifling what teachers and
students do
in the classroom.

43:49.393 --> 43:53.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: It also led to a
backlash
of state standards known as the
Common Core.

43:53.397 --> 43:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA SASS RUBIN, Save Our
Schools New Jersey:
They're impacting the kind of
education kids

43:55.867 --> 43:59.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are getting, because they're
eating up a lot
of introduction time with test
preparation

43:59.971 --> 44:01.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and test drilling.

44:01.873 --> 44:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: On this issue, we are
shoulder to shoulder,
parents, conservatives,
progressives, the

44:07.879 --> 44:09.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
teachers.

44:09.680 --> 44:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're all opposed to this
because this is
not about learning, this is not
about education.

44:13.217 --> 44:17.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALISON STEWART: The
administration promoted
the expansion of charter
schools, and pointed

44:17.288 --> 44:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a national graduation rate
topping 83 percent.

44:21.025 --> 44:24.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the same time, the
president's team took
a bigger role in higher
education.

44:24.929 --> 44:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It became the direct lender to
students, instead
of having the loans made
directly by banks.

44:29.867 --> 44:32.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Savings were used to expand Pell
Grants.

44:32.737 --> 44:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the administration took aim
at the world
of for-profit colleges, cracking
down on federal

44:37.308 --> 44:43.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
funds and contending that
students were frequently
not well-served by the schools.

44:43.648 --> 44:47.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's dig a little deeper into
the Obama legacy
in education with two people who
have covered

44:47.418 --> 44:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it extensively, Alyson Klein of
our partners
at Education Week, and Scott
Jaschik of Inside

44:53.090 --> 44:54.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Higher Ed.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thanks to both of you for being
here.

44:56.661 --> 45:00.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk about what the Obama
administration
wanted to do when it first got
into office.

45:00.765 --> 45:04.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alyson, what was one thing that
they wanted
to tackle about through K-12
education immediately?

45:04.669 --> 45:09.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN, Education Week:
So, they were
in a very fortunate position
when they first

45:09.206 --> 45:14.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came into office, in that the
Obama administration
was given $100 billion for
education through

45:14.946 --> 45:18.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act,
better known as the stimulus.

45:18.716 --> 45:22.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with some of that money
through a program
known as Race to the Top, they
were able to

45:22.353 --> 45:27.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prod states to adopt college and
career-ready
standards, better known as the
Common Core,

45:27.525 --> 45:32.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new forms of teacher evaluation
that relied
in part on student test scores,
and dramatic

45:32.129 --> 45:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ways of turning around the
lowest performing
schools, including getting rid
of principals

45:36.500 --> 45:37.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and many teachers.

45:37.902 --> 45:40.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: All right, we
will unpack
that in a little bit.

45:40.404 --> 45:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Same question for you, Scott,
about higher
education.

45:42.607 --> 45:44.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What did the Obama
administration wanted to
tackle right away?

45:44.642 --> 45:46.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK, Inside Higher
Education: Sure.

45:46.510 --> 45:50.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In President Obama's first state
of the union,
he said something no president
had said before,

45:50.047 --> 45:56.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is that every American
needs at least
one year of post-secondary
training to succeed

45:56.387 --> 45:58.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in today's economy.

45:58.222 --> 46:02.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you see that priority
reflected in much
that the administration did,
proposals for

46:02.593 --> 46:08.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
free community college, putting
more money
into aid for low-income
students.

46:08.733 --> 46:13.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The key difference between past
administrations
is that I would say,
historically, the focus

46:13.671 --> 46:18.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of higher ed policy has been on
helping middle-class
families who were already going
to send their

46:18.442 --> 46:22.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children to college to do so in
more affordable
ways.

46:22.246 --> 46:27.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama focused on the
students who
weren't going, those who needed
higher education,

46:27.952 --> 46:30.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but were not seeking it.

46:30.521 --> 46:32.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Alyson, let's
unpack a little
bit of what you talked about.

46:32.957 --> 46:39.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Testing became a buzzword among
K-12 education,
associated with Common Core
state standards.

46:39.830 --> 46:44.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Common Core was obviously an
idea, a way
to have a federal standard, so
that students

46:44.201 --> 46:47.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Nevada could be compared to
students in
Texas.

46:47.638 --> 46:52.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happened in theory with
Common Core and
testing vs. what happened in
practice?

46:52.143 --> 46:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: So, the Obama
administration
didn't tell states that they had
to adopt

46:56.280 --> 47:00.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Common Core standards, but
they did give
them, a number of states, money
who chose

47:00.851 --> 47:02.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

47:02.620 --> 47:05.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they also used some of the
money from
the stimulus which I talked
about to help

47:05.690 --> 47:10.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
states develop new, more
innovative forms
of tests aligned with those
standards.

47:10.728 --> 47:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they were really demanding a
lot from
states at once.

47:13.731 --> 47:18.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Teach had to adjust to brand-new
standards
that were much more rigorous in
many cases

47:18.035 --> 47:20.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than the standards they had
before and brand-new
types of tests.

47:20.905 --> 47:23.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it just put a lot of
pressure on a system.

47:23.908 --> 47:26.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: And also on
teacher evaluations.

47:26.043 --> 47:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That became a very difficult
subject, because
you had teachers in certain
schools with certain

47:31.315 --> 47:35.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of support and scaffolding
being compared
to teachers in other schools
perhaps in more

47:35.986 --> 47:36.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
affluent areas.

47:36.987 --> 47:38.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: Yes, that's right.

47:38.989 --> 47:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the big issues with
teacher evaluation
is that teachers felt that it
didn't necessarily

47:43.327 --> 47:47.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reward them for taking on more
challenging
groups of students.

47:47.098 --> 47:51.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I mentioned before, the
tests and
the standards were changing at
the same time

47:51.736 --> 47:54.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that teacher performance was
being held to
those tests.

47:54.371 --> 47:57.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they really felt like that
was an unfair
situation for them.

47:57.174 --> 48:01.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Charter schools
was another
big part of the Obama
administration's push.

48:01.412 --> 48:06.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe there was something
like $208 million
for charter schools in
2008-2009.

48:06.584 --> 48:10.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's up to $333 million,
approximately,
now.

48:10.287 --> 48:11.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why the focus on charter
schools?

48:11.956 --> 48:15.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: So, charter
schools are one
of the few areas of K-12
education policy

48:15.693 --> 48:19.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where Democrats and Republicans
really see
eye to eye for the most part.

48:19.663 --> 48:24.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration in
particular really
pushed states that had lowest --
low-performing

48:24.068 --> 48:27.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
schools to consider turning
those schools
into a charter.

48:27.538 --> 48:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they also asked states to
set a high bar
for charters, make sure that
charters were

48:31.108 --> 48:35.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serving all different kinds of
students, students
in special education and
English-language

48:35.346 --> 48:40.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learners, and were being held to
the same
standards as regular public
schools.

48:40.151 --> 48:41.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Scott, let's
bring you into
the conversation.

48:41.619 --> 48:43.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT JASCHIK: Sure.

48:43.420 --> 48:48.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: You mentioned
bringing new
people into the higher education
population.

48:48.425 --> 48:51.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did the president and his
administration
make this possible?

48:51.328 --> 48:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Were they successful with
bringing people
in to the higher population,
higher education

48:55.666 --> 48:57.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
population that wouldn't have
been there before?

48:57.301 --> 49:00.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK: Many times, they
were successful,
but not the way he proposed it.

49:00.805 --> 49:01.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: What does that
mean?

49:01.839 --> 49:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK: So, take free
community college.

49:03.774 --> 49:09.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama proposed a
state-federal partnership
that would make community
college free.

49:09.246 --> 49:10.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congress never touched it.

49:10.447 --> 49:13.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you could say, on one hand,
nothing happened.

49:13.417 --> 49:19.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the reality is that
districts all over
the country took the idea and
ran with it.

49:19.290 --> 49:23.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there are free community
college programs
in individual districts all over
the country.

49:23.627 --> 49:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, I would say, by talking
about the issue,
President Obama put much more
emphasis on

49:30.134 --> 49:34.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that choice than you ever saw
before.

49:34.038 --> 49:38.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Obama and also
Michelle Obama used
their bully pulpits to say, hey,
it's important

49:38.876 --> 49:40.678 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to go.

49:40.711 --> 49:45.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they said -- they linked it
over and over
again to jobs that students
would need for

49:45.115 --> 49:46.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the future.

49:46.383 --> 49:49.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in that sense, I think he
changed the
conversation.

49:49.186 --> 49:52.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Community colleges used to be
sort of a side
issue.

49:52.423 --> 49:54.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He made them much more central.

49:54.992 --> 49:58.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He also focused a lot on
endorsing alternative
ways to go to college.

49:58.863 --> 50:04.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a fan of online education,
competency-based
education, all kinds of new
approaches that,

50:04.602 --> 50:09.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, he used the bully pulpit
to promote,
not so much federal legislation,
but with

50:09.907 --> 50:11.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attention.

50:11.208 --> 50:13.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: How about
dealing with income
inequality?

50:13.410 --> 50:16.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We see that in secondary
education.

50:16.413 --> 50:19.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kids who come from well-to-do
families often
go to college.

50:19.316 --> 50:23.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a very small percentage of
people who
come from lower-income families.

50:23.420 --> 50:25.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What did he do and his
administration do to
help those folks?

50:25.723 --> 50:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK: So, early on, he
promoted large
increases -- and he got some --
in Pell Grants,

50:31.228 --> 50:35.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is the largest federal
program for low-income
students.

50:35.199 --> 50:39.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wasn't thrilled with the
results, though,
because a lot of the money ended
up going

50:39.103 --> 50:43.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to students at for-profit
institutions, where
he questioned the quality.

50:43.641 --> 50:48.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that's part of what
led him to
free community college, to focus
attention

50:48.512 --> 50:51.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on another sector.

50:51.081 --> 50:54.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He also focused a lot on the
quality of institutions.

50:54.818 --> 50:59.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wasn't, you know, looking at
community
colleges through rose-colored
glasses.

50:59.423 --> 51:04.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He talked about the need for
them to improve
their graduation rates, to
improve their -- the

51:04.094 --> 51:06.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
connection between their job
training programs
and actual careers.

51:06.931 --> 51:11.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he was putting attention
there, not on
Harvard and Stanford.

51:11.802 --> 51:14.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: What about
attention about
what's going on, on campus?

51:14.505 --> 51:19.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were so many stories about
sexual assault
issues on campuses in the past
year-and-a-half.

51:19.710 --> 51:24.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK: I think this is
an area where
the Obama administration played
a very significant

51:24.048 --> 51:25.749 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
role.

51:25.783 --> 51:29.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, they talked about it a lot,
not just
the Education Department, but
President Obama,

51:29.653 --> 51:32.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vice President Biden, in
repeated events.

51:32.256 --> 51:35.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also, the administration
changed the
rules.

51:35.526 --> 51:40.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They told colleges to change the
burden of
proof when colleges were
considering these

51:40.965 --> 51:44.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases, saying it had to only be
a preponderance
of evidence.

51:44.501 --> 51:49.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's a lower standard
than, say, guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt.

51:49.606 --> 51:54.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they empowered the Office
for Civil Rights
at the Education Department to
have resources

51:54.845 --> 52:02.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do more investigations, so,
attention and
policy, at the same time that
activists on

52:02.820 --> 52:05.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campuses were raising the issue
more than
ever.

52:05.122 --> 52:08.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: A final question
for both
of you.

52:08.092 --> 52:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you think will be the
lasting impact
of his education legacy, the
thing that will

52:14.064 --> 52:18.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stick around, regardless of
what's going on
in terms of politics?

52:18.302 --> 52:20.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALYSON KLEIN: That's a great
question.

52:20.337 --> 52:25.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say one of the big
focuses of the
administration was on turning
around the lowest-performing

52:25.943 --> 52:27.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

52:27.678 --> 52:30.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's something that's been
enshrined
in a law called the Every
Student Succeeds

52:30.647 --> 52:32.349 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Act.

52:32.383 --> 52:35.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States will still have to focus
on schools
that are just at the bottom of
the barrel

52:35.586 --> 52:37.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when it comes to performers.

52:37.321 --> 52:39.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's something that I
expect to continue
no matter who's in the White
House.

52:40.024 --> 52:41.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: What do you
think, Scott?

52:41.725 --> 52:45.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK: I would say this
idea of free
college, even though he didn't
get it.

52:45.229 --> 52:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, New York's governor
proposed free public
higher education.

52:49.566 --> 52:53.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That comes out of the Sanders
and Clinton
plans, but I also think it comes
out of the

52:53.203 --> 52:55.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama proposal about free
community college.

52:55.973 --> 53:00.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eight years ago, people were not
talking about
the idea of free college.

53:00.444 --> 53:01.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Now they are.

53:01.945 --> 53:05.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Scott Jaschik
