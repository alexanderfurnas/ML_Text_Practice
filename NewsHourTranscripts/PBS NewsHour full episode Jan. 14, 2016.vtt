JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:08.008 --> 00:14.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Gunfire and explosions
hit the Indonesian capital of
Jakarta, leaving

00:14.381 --> 00:20.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least two civilians and five
attackers
dead. The Islamic State claims
responsibility.

00:21.021 --> 00:28.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: a family's journey from
Syria to Canada,
the story beyond the image that
went viral,

00:28.395 --> 00:31.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sparked outrage and tore apart a
family.

00:31.198 --> 00:36.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATIMA KURDI, Aunt of Alan
Kurdi: All of a
sudden, whatever you have in
your life, for

00:36.336 --> 00:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your own family, in one day, you
have to leave
everything behind and flee.

00:44.211 --> 00:49.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Oscar
time. We review
this year's nominations, looking
at what's

00:49.683 --> 00:52.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in and what's out.

00:52.052 --> 00:58.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.225 --> 01:00.727 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:00.761 --> 01:12.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street
mounted a comeback
today, one day after its worst
losses since

01:12.506 --> 01:18.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
September. A rebound in crude
oil prices sent
energy shares higher, and the
broader market

01:18.545 --> 01:26.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
followed suit. The Dow Jones
industrial average
gained 227 points to close near
16380. The

01:26.753 --> 01:32.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nasdaq rose almost 89 points.
And the S&amp;P
500 added 31.

01:32.192 --> 01:38.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The investment bank Goldman
Sachs agreed today
to settle long-running federal
and state investigations

01:38.632 --> 01:45.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for $5.1 billion. It stems from
the company's
mortgage practices leading up to
the market

01:45.472 --> 01:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meltdown in 2008. About $1.8
billion of the
total will go toward consumer
relief. Most

01:52.646 --> 01:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other big banks have already
reached similar
settlements.

01:56.450 --> 02:02.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten more detainees have been
released from
the U.S. military prison at
Guantanamo Bay,

02:02.222 --> 02:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cuba. The prisoners were all
from Yemen. They
were transferred Tuesday night
to Oman, reducing

02:08.662 --> 02:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the population at Guantanamo to
93 inmates.

02:12.833 --> 02:18.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Miami today, Defense
Secretary Ash Carter
said some of the rest might end
up on the

02:18.305 --> 02:20.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. mainland.

02:20.107 --> 02:23.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: Not
everyone in Gitmo can be safely
transferred

02:23.276 --> 02:30.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to another country. So, we need
an alternative.
I, therefore, framed for the
president a proposal

02:30.817 --> 02:37.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to establish an alternative
location. That
plan will propose bringing those
detainees

02:37.557 --> 02:41.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to an appropriate secure
location in the United
States.

02:41.595 --> 02:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Up until now,
Congress has
blocked any such move, and even
passed a law

02:46.933 --> 02:48.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to that effect.

02:48.769 --> 02:54.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary Carter also said today
it does appear
that U.S. Navy sailors made a
navigational

02:54.541 --> 03:00.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mistake, causing their boats to
stray into
Iranian waters this week. The 10
sailors on

03:00.580 --> 03:06.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
board the two boats were
detained Tuesday
in the Persian Gulf by Iran's
Revolutionary

03:06.253 --> 03:11.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Guard. They were let go
yesterday after a
flurry of diplomatic contacts.

03:11.558 --> 03:16.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran, meanwhile, announced a key
step today
toward complying with its
nuclear deal with

03:16.663 --> 03:23.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world powers. State TV reported
that technicians
finished removing the core of
the Arak nuclear

03:23.637 --> 03:29.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reactor. The agreement calls for
ensuring
that the site can produce only
tiny amounts

03:29.076 --> 03:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of plutonium, potential fuel for
a nuclear
weapon. The work must be
verified by outside

03:35.916 --> 03:37.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
experts.

03:37.684 --> 03:43.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey is claiming that its
military killed
nearly 200 Islamic State
fighters Iraq and

03:43.590 --> 03:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria just in the last 48 hours.
The prime
minister said that tanks and
artillery blasted

03:49.930 --> 03:55.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
targets after Tuesday's suicide
bombing in
Istanbul. Meanwhile, people
continued to gather

03:55.936 --> 04:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the site of the bombing that
killed 10
tourists. Authorities said they
have detained

04:01.174 --> 04:03.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seven people in the
investigation.

04:03.343 --> 04:10.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Ebola epidemic in West
Africa is officially
over, that word today from the
World Health

04:10.817 --> 04:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Organization. The outbreak
killed 11,315 people,
mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone,
Liberia, over

04:19.759 --> 04:21.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nearly two years.

04:21.561 --> 04:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva, the head of the WHO's
Ebola response
effort hailed the news, but also
sounded a

04:28.068 --> 04:30.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
note of caution.

04:30.036 --> 04:33.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK BRENNAN, World Health
Organization: This
is a very important milestone
and a very important

04:33.440 --> 04:41.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
step forward. We have to say
that the job
is still not done. That's
because there is

04:41.114 --> 04:47.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
still ongoing risk of
reemergence of the disease
because of the persistence of
the virus in

04:48.021 --> 04:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a proportion of survivors.

04:49.823 --> 04:53.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The epidemic is
believed to
have begun in rural Guinea in
December of

04:53.860 --> 04:55.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2013.

04:55.729 --> 05:00.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the second time this week,
relief has
reached starving civilians in
Syria, caught

05:00.767 --> 05:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up in that country's civil war.
The World
Food Program and the Red Cross
and Red Crescent

05:06.373 --> 05:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delivered more food, medicine
and other supplies
to the town of Madaya today. The
area has

05:12.379 --> 05:18.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been cut off by government
troops for months.
Two villages surrounded by rebel
forces in

05:18.151 --> 05:20.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the north also received aid.

05:20.620 --> 05:26.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the
Republican presidential
candidates are squaring off this
evening in

05:26.159 --> 05:31.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their latest debate and their
first of the
new year. The event in North
Charleston, South

05:32.032 --> 05:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina, features the top seven
contenders
according to national polls, and
the stakes

05:37.304 --> 05:42.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are high, with the Iowa caucuses
just two-and-a-half
weeks away.

05:42.976 --> 05:48.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the great Powerball craze is
over, at
least for now. There were three
winning tickets

05:48.181 --> 05:54.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last night for the jackpot that
ballooned
to a record $1.6 billion. One
was sold at

05:54.321 --> 06:02.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a 7-Eleven in Chino Hills,
California, outside
Los Angeles, and hundreds
crowded there, cheering.

06:02.262 --> 06:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other winning tickets were
sold in Tennessee
and Florida.

06:05.966 --> 06:13.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
ISIS claims
today's attack in Indonesia;
hope and loss

06:13.139 --> 06:19.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a family's journey from Syria
to Canada;
is President Obama's pledge to
cure cancer

06:19.546 --> 06:32.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
realistic?; and much more.

06:32.459 --> 06:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now to today's attacks in
Jakarta, Indonesia,
claimed by the Islamic State
group in the

06:38.565 --> 06:41.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
world's most populous
Muslim-majority nation.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner begins our coverage.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a warning: Some of the
images may be disturbing.

06:48.508 --> 06:56.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It is a moment
of cold-blooded
calculation, as gunfire cracks,
two suicide

06:56.283 --> 07:03.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombers crouch, make ready, and
then -- in
all, five attackers and two
civilians died

07:03.189 --> 07:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when multiple gunmen and suicide
bombers struck
the center of Jakarta this
morning.

07:07.994 --> 07:13.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REZA, Witness (through
translator): At first,
I thought it was the explosion
of car tire,

07:13.566 --> 07:18.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but then I realized that it was
bomb explosion.
Then I saw the motorcyclers, all
wearing black

07:18.605 --> 07:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clothes. And they pulled out
long guns.

07:21.374 --> 07:26.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The attackers
hit a police
booth at a busy intersection
with guns and

07:26.379 --> 07:33.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grenades. Another target was a
nearby Starbucks.
Police say one bomber blew
himself up inside,

07:33.720 --> 07:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and waiting gunmen tried to
shoot the survivors
as they fled.

07:37.691 --> 07:43.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After hours of gunfire,
investigators found
more undetonated bombs in a
neighboring building.

07:43.463 --> 07:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They took four militants into
custody. The
Islamic State group quickly
claimed responsibility.

07:49.703 --> 07:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its statement read: "A group of
soldiers of
the caliphate in Indonesia
targeted a gathering

07:55.008 --> 08:01.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the crusader alliance that
fights the
Islamic State in Jakarta."

08:01.147 --> 08:05.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jakarta's police chief offered a
slightly
different account. He pointed to
an extremist

08:05.251 --> 08:08.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group based in Southeast Asia
with ties to
ISIS.

08:08.254 --> 08:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TITO KARNAVIAN, Jakarta Police
Chief (through
translator): There's a militant
named Bahrun

08:11.725 --> 08:15.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Naim who wants to be the leader
of the region.
All leaders of ISIS in Southeast
Asia are

08:15.862 --> 08:18.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
competing to be the chief.
That's why he plotted
this attack.

08:18.798 --> 08:24.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Naim is
believed to be in
the Islamic State's de facto
capital, Raqqa,

08:24.738 --> 08:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria, according to police. But
they warned
today that his group has also
expanded its

08:29.642 --> 08:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
efforts across Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines
and Thailand.

08:34.748 --> 08:38.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just last month, police arrested
more than
a dozen people on the Indonesian
island of

08:38.952 --> 08:44.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Java on charges of planning
attacks on Christmas
and New Year's Eve. They said
some received

08:44.891 --> 08:50.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funding from Naim. Still, there
were questions
today about the level of
sophistication in

08:50.263 --> 08:52.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Jakarta attacks.

08:52.098 --> 08:55.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE COCHRANE, The International
New York Times:
According to terrorism analysts
who I spoke

08:56.002 --> 09:02.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to today, they didn't think much
of the actual
tactics of this group or the
attackers who

09:03.009 --> 09:08.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were involved today, based on
the fact they
didn't really kill anybody.

09:08.648 --> 09:12.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Joe Cochrane is
the Indonesia
correspondent for The
International New York

09:12.552 --> 09:15.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Times, based in Jakarta. He
spoke via Skype.

09:15.622 --> 09:20.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE COCHRANE: A number of these
people's colleagues
had been arrested over the last
three or four

09:20.660 --> 09:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks in various parts of
Indonesia, so the
feeling was these guys were
about to be picked

09:27.133 --> 09:33.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, and they were just trying
some sort of
last gasp effort at glory or
revenge against

09:33.940 --> 09:35.742 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the police.

09:35.775 --> 09:39.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The largest
Muslim country
in the world, Indonesia has long
been a target

09:39.412 --> 09:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of violent Islamist extremism.
The most notorious
incident came in 2002, when the
al-Qaida-linked

09:46.953 --> 09:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jemaah Islamiyah attacked
nightclubs on the
island of Bali, killing 202
people.

09:53.827 --> 09:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in 2009, the same group
struck two hotels
in Jakarta, leaving eight dead.
Since then,

09:59.933 --> 10:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government has led a massive
effort to
dismantle Jemaah Islamiyah, but
there are

10:03.937 --> 10:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
concerns of a resurgence.

10:06.406 --> 10:11.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Jakarta and its 10
million people
are now on high alert, as the
investigation

10:11.878 --> 10:12.812 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
begins.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

10:15.081 --> 10:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And for more on
how ISIS inspires
and influences militant Islamist
groups around

10:21.287 --> 10:26.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world, I'm joined by Joby
Warrick. He

10:31.064 --> 10:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Joby Warrick, welcome back to
the program.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK, The Washington
Post: Thank you.

10:35.001 --> 10:37.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Help us first,
though, understand
who is this group that is
claiming responsibility?

10:37.370 --> 10:40.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It sounds like there are
different groups
operating around that part of
Asia.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Yes, but there are
a number
of these Southeast Asians in
ISIS proper and

10:44.644 --> 10:46.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
working out of Syria.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a battalion there that's
called Katiba.
And they have actually been
successful in

10:49.349 --> 10:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacking Kurdish targets. They
have gone
on the Internet claiming credit,
claiming

10:53.353 --> 10:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they're strong and trying
to drive other
recruits to them.

10:57.156 --> 11:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you see this. Once again,
this is almost
like the model we have seen in
other places,

11:01.794 --> 11:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Belgians and French and Germans
and others
kind of calling out in a
nationalistic way

11:05.965 --> 11:09.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the people to come from the
region and help
and join the ISIS cause.

11:09.202 --> 11:16.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, is there a
firm connection
between Jakarta and what's going
on in Syria

11:16.943 --> 11:18.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Iraq?

11:18.711 --> 11:21.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: I think there is,
in the sense
that there is this common effort
by ISIS to

11:21.314 --> 11:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
try to create these cells all
over the world.
We have sign it in all kinds of
places, and

11:25.184 --> 11:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certainly North Africa, Yemen,
Pakistan, Afghanistan.

11:28.121 --> 11:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they really, really want to
start a cell
in Southeast Asia. They have
been looking

11:32.358 --> 11:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for over a year at trying to
start something
in Indonesia particularly. And
there are groups

11:36.229 --> 11:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are there. There are groups
who are allied
with them, or at least
ideologically allied

11:39.866 --> 11:42.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with them, who like to
participate. And some
of them claim credit and do
things on their

11:43.002 --> 11:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own to try to get the ball
rolling.

11:44.938 --> 11:49.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how do we
distinguish between
groups that are truly allied and
taking orders

11:49.375 --> 11:56.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from ISIS central, wherever that
is, and groups
that are just wanting to do --
wanting to

11:56.616 --> 11:59.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carry out attacks because they
admire what
ISIS stands for?

11:59.485 --> 12:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Sometimes, it's
very hard to
tell.

12:01.387 --> 12:05.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in this case, there's
been enough
messaging from ISIS'
headquarters in Raqqa,

12:05.725 --> 12:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying, we want to do this. We
want to start
something in that part of the
world. And it's

12:10.463 --> 12:16.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
easy to see at least the
outlines of a plan,
some kind of reaching out to a
region and

12:16.336 --> 12:20.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to get people to do
something locally,
just to establish a presence,
just to show

12:20.106 --> 12:21.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that they're there.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this might be what we're
looking at
in this case.

12:23.142 --> 12:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just how
well-organized
are they in Southeast Asia? What
does it look

12:26.479 --> 12:28.281 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
like?

12:28.314 --> 12:30.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: This is new,
because ISIS hasn't
really done anything there
before. But they

12:30.383 --> 12:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do have at least 600 Southeast
Asians in Syria
that we know of. Lots of people
have come

12:35.221 --> 12:39.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to that region to train. Lots of
them have
come back to the region to start
things.

12:39.192 --> 12:43.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are lots of other
alliances they could
make with local groups, ones
that have done

12:43.830 --> 12:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the attacks in the 2000s, some
really horrific
ones, as we have seen. So, this
is potentially

12:48.701 --> 12:50.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the start of something new and
dangerous.

12:50.536 --> 12:54.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, they go to
Syria and train,
and most of them don't stay.
They stay long

12:54.107 --> 12:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough to learn whatever tactics
they need,
and then they're going back? I
mean, has that

12:58.077 --> 12:58.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been documented?

12:58.978 --> 13:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: It has been
documented.

13:00.747 --> 13:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's kind of one leverage point
that local
governments have, that they can
try to stop

13:03.950 --> 13:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these people as they come back.
It's not always
possible. These borders are
sometimes more

13:08.421 --> 13:12.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
porous than we like to think.
And, sometimes,
international travel can be
porous with fake

13:12.825 --> 13:14.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
passports and visas and that
sort of thing.

13:14.727 --> 13:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is really something
that people in
the region are very concerned
about, and they're

13:18.998 --> 13:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
starting to see evidence that it
is happening.

13:20.933 --> 13:25.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have pointed
out that Indonesia
has the largest Muslim
population in the world

13:25.538 --> 13:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in any single country. Should we
be surprised
that there haven't been more
ISIS recruits

13:32.145 --> 13:33.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from there?

13:33.980 --> 13:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Yes, you would
think so. There
are 210 million Muslim Muslims
in Indonesia.

13:37.583 --> 13:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only about 500, experts say,
have gone to
Syria to join the fight. That's
perhaps partly

13:42.655 --> 13:45.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a reflection of the fact that
it's far, it's
distant.

13:45.091 --> 13:52.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's also the fact that the
brand of Islam
in Indonesia tends to be more
moderate, so

13:52.465 --> 13:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you don't see as many radicals,
but there
are some, and the ones that are
there are

13:55.868 --> 13:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
willing to do very brutal
things.

13:57.804 --> 14:02.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were
telling us that
ISIS has had a pretty
sophisticated effort

14:02.942 --> 14:08.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to recruit, that they're using
social media
and so forth, which we're seeing
them use

14:08.114 --> 14:09.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the world.

14:09.916 --> 14:13.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Yes, but the
wrinkle on it is,
they use local people to appeal
to people

14:13.286 --> 14:17.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in their homelands, using local
tongue, using
Malay, using sort of the common
language,

14:17.890 --> 14:22.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and also appealing to sort of
national pride
or -- and to Islamic pride.
Come, represent

14:22.929 --> 14:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the cause in Syria or fight for
us in other
parts of the world.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this is really the ISIS model
these days.

14:28.735 --> 14:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And authorities
are on top
of this? I mean, if the media is
aware of

14:32.338 --> 14:33.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it, we have to assume
authorities are?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Absolutely worried
about it.
They're tracking it very
closely.

14:36.209 --> 14:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It looks like the Indonesian
police or the
government there has been very
aggressive

14:40.413 --> 14:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in trying to find these people
and root them
out. It's not always possible to
get all of

14:43.716 --> 14:45.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them, because they're pretty
good at keeping
a low profile.

14:45.852 --> 14:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Joby Warrick of
The Washington
Post, we thank you.

14:49.956 --> 14:57.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: Enjoyed it. Thank
you.

14:57.463 --> 15:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have seen the
heartbreaking
picture of Alan Kurdi. He's the
Syrian refugee

15:06.439 --> 15:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boy who drowned off the coast of
Turkey this
summer, but what became of the
rest of his

15:11.844 --> 15:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family? Their story runs as wide
and far as
the millions of Syrians who have
now fled

15:17.583 --> 15:18.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the war.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham reports.

15:20.820 --> 15:26.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was one
image that devastated
onlookers across the world, a 3
year-old Syrian

15:26.192 --> 15:31.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refugee, drowned and lifeless,
lying face
down on the beach.

15:31.297 --> 15:35.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alan Kurdi was just one of
hundreds of thousands
of refugees who fled the Middle
East last

15:35.601 --> 15:40.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year, and one of many children
who've drowned
on the perilous sea voyage, but
his death

15:40.673 --> 15:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seemed to cut deeper. From front
pages the
world over, the picture hammered
a global

15:46.212 --> 15:51.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conscience. International
actions were staged
in response. And artists around
the world

15:51.250 --> 15:53.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
responded with their own
touching imagery.

15:53.052 --> 15:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD, Beirut Bureau
Chief, The New
York Times: I remember seeing it
and thinking

15:55.354 --> 15:59.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that this is a really
heartbreaking one. It's
hard to say exactly why that one
is the one

15:59.859 --> 16:02.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that went so viral. But it did.

16:02.562 --> 16:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: New York Times
Beirut bureau
chief Anne Barnard set out to
tell the deeper

16:06.999 --> 16:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story behind this image. What
she found was
an ocean of stories of a boy and
his extended

16:13.372 --> 16:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family, stories that spanned
multiple continents,
and told of horrible violence
and struggles.

16:18.511 --> 16:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD: The Kurdis, like
many, many
Syrians, had essentially, as a
family, accepted

16:24.283 --> 16:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the deal that existed under
Syria's police
state. You have a relatively
decent modest

16:30.990 --> 16:33.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
living in exchange for staying
out of politics.

16:33.292 --> 16:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And like many other millions,
that's what
they were doing. They raised six
children

16:36.929 --> 16:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Damascus. They -- barbering
was the family
business. And they were just
living their

16:42.635 --> 16:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life there, when the war and
conflict began.

16:45.838 --> 16:54.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After protests
against President
Bashar al-Assad led to civil war
within the

16:54.146 --> 16:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, the Kurdis found
themselves caught
in harm's way.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD: Their neighborhood
was so close
to the government artillery
bases, that the

16:57.783 --> 17:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outgoing blasts put cracks in
some of the
walls of the family houses. At
the same time,

17:03.389 --> 17:08.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
police were increasingly
stopping people on
the streets. One child in the
family witnessed

17:08.160 --> 17:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the death of the schoolmate who
was killed
by security forces while at a
protest outside

17:14.700 --> 17:16.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of school.

17:16.569 --> 17:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a suicide bomb that
went off near
the same kid randomly, a very
frightening

17:22.608 --> 17:27.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experience. And there were
people that they
knew who were arrested just for
no reason

17:27.947 --> 17:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and disappeared. So, conflict
was getting
closer.

17:31.017 --> 17:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Aware of the
dangers they
faced, Alan's family members
were determined

17:35.955 --> 17:41.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to find a new home and a new
life, even if
it meant leaving Syria. One of
Alan's aunts

17:41.227 --> 17:43.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tried three times to cross the
sea from Turkey.

17:43.996 --> 17:48.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD: Each attempt was
scarier than
the last, and they all failed.
And the last

17:48.634 --> 17:52.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one ended with them getting
scooped up out
of the water by the Turkish
coast guard. And

17:52.538 --> 17:55.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hivrun said: "I'm not doing it
again. I'm
not risking my kids."

17:55.775 --> 18:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she had a big fight with her
husband,
because he insisted on going on
to Germany,

18:00.746 --> 18:04.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she stayed in Istanbul with
the kids,
who were angry and wanted to
actually keep

18:04.917 --> 18:10.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying. Well, a week later or
so, Abdullah's
family died, and they said, OK,
we did the

18:10.356 --> 18:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right thing. Thank God we didn't
go.

18:13.125 --> 18:17.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They felt really horrible for
Abdullah. But
guess what? Within a few weeks,
they tried

18:17.129 --> 18:18.898 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATIMA KURDI, Aunt of Alan
Kurdi: You own
your house. You live your life,
happy, peaceful.

18:22.335 --> 18:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Alan's aunt
Fatima, Tima
for short, has lived in Canada
for more than

18:26.639 --> 18:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 years, where she continued
the family business,
opening a hair salon near
Vancouver. She maintained

18:32.478 --> 18:37.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contact with her brother, Alan's
father, as
they undertook their fateful
voyage.

18:37.416 --> 18:41.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said that, like most Syrian
families,
the Kurdis were aware of the
grave dangers

18:41.520 --> 18:45.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the journey, but they
ultimately decided
they had no choice.

18:45.124 --> 18:53.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATIMA KURDI: All of a sudden,
whatever you
have in your life, for your own
family, in

18:53.265 --> 19:02.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one day, you have to leave
everything behind
and flee. There is nobody who
would like to

19:02.341 --> 19:04.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do this just by choice.

19:04.143 --> 19:08.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD: The thing is, a
million people
have gone to Europe, 800,000 of
them this

19:08.481 --> 19:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year on boats. And in a strange
way, it can
be a rational choice when you
consider what

19:13.853 --> 19:15.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people are running from.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMAD KURDI, Uncle of Alan
Kurdi (through
translator): Can you imagine, as
a father,

19:19.225 --> 19:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seeing your child die before
your eyes?

19:21.394 --> 19:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mohammad Kurdi
is an uncle
of Alan's, and he saw his share
of horrors

19:25.664 --> 19:30.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria. After fleeing Damascus
for the northern
city of Kobani, he and his son
were trapped

19:30.970 --> 19:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and threatened by ISIS fighters.
Mohammad
was beaten. His son Shergo, 15
years old,

19:36.776 --> 19:42.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was given a gun and instructed
to shoot his
father. Luckily, they both
escaped, but Mohammad

19:42.381 --> 19:46.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decided it was time for his
family to leave
Syria.

19:46.052 --> 19:51.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMMAD KURDI (through
translator): Imagine
the buildings being blown up,
the corpses

19:52.024 --> 19:55.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of children and women. They are
all innocent.

19:55.061 --> 20:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Abdullah
Kurdi, Mohammad's
brother and the father of
3-year-old Alan,

20:00.266 --> 20:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lost his entire family at sea.
He became a
symbol of the plight of refugees
across the

20:05.371 --> 20:09.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Middle East. He returned to his
homeland,
Kobani, where he laid his wife
and children

20:09.542 --> 20:11.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to rest.

20:11.377 --> 20:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDULLAH KURDI, Father of Alan
Kurdi (through
translator): My entire family
passed away.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are martyrs now, but I hope
they can
help those who are still in
need. Enough with

20:19.618 --> 20:25.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this war. I don't know what more
to say. I
am so tired. Just leave me
alone, for the

20:25.558 --> 20:27.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Koran's sake.

20:27.460 --> 20:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today, he
lives alone in
Iraqi Kurdistan, his extended
family now spread

20:31.363 --> 20:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
throughout the world. But,
fortunately,

20:33.466 --> 20:38.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Kurdis' story doesn't end
there. Alan's
uncle Mohammad finally arrived
in Canada with

20:38.604 --> 20:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his wife and five children as
some of the
10,000 refugees welcomed by the
Canadian government

20:43.609 --> 20:46.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last year. It was a bittersweet
arrival.

20:46.745 --> 20:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I am
very happy
and excited, but, at the same
time, I'm very

20:53.252 --> 20:55.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sad about my cousins.

20:55.187 --> 21:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: During their
trip, the family
had been separated from their
father, Mohammad.

21:00.426 --> 21:05.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They met in Germany in December,
just before
flying west. It was the first
time he met

21:05.264 --> 21:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his 5-month-old son, Sherwan.

21:07.900 --> 21:12.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMMAD KURDI (through
translator): There
were days I thought I would
never see my family

21:12.905 --> 21:16.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
again, but thank God the
nightmare is over.

21:16.108 --> 21:22.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATIMA KURDI: It was a beautiful
moment that
those kids, they are going to
begin a new

21:22.515 --> 21:26.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life and going to school,
rebuild their life.

21:26.585 --> 21:30.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now Mohammad
and his family
are staying with his sister
Tima. He is working

21:30.856 --> 21:36.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in her hair salon, the family
business, and
his children are quickly
learning English.

21:36.328 --> 21:47.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHILD: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

21:47.039 --> 21:57.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMMAD KURDI (through
translator): Thank
God that I have arrived here
with my family,

21:57.483 --> 22:05.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after this long journey and
great tragedy.
My children and I are just
starting to feel

22:05.991 --> 22:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
safe. There is a life here for
us.

22:10.229 --> 22:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For Anne
Barnard, who spent
months reporting on the Kurdi
family, this

22:15.734 --> 22:20.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family saga is a reminder that
the Syrian
civil war is about more than
just Assad, the

22:20.773 --> 22:25.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islamic State, and American
interests in the
region. It's about millions of
real families

22:25.911 --> 22:28.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
left with nowhere to turn who
are looking
for a better future.

22:28.981 --> 22:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD: This story reminds
us that each
one of these stories is an
individual tale

22:33.586 --> 22:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and each -- even this one
family. That incredibly
tragic picture of Alan on the
beach was only

22:40.893 --> 22:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a tiny piece of what they had
been through.

22:43.262 --> 22:45.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happened to Alan was just a
fraction
of what happened to them. And
what happened

22:46.031 --> 22:51.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to them is just one story out of
many millions
of stories. Half of the Syrian
population

22:51.070 --> 22:54.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been displaced in this
conflict. So I
think we just have to remember
that each one

22:54.840 --> 22:59.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these stories is a real
person with a real
family, with family dynamics
like those we

22:59.345 --> 23:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have in our own families.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And for Tima
Kurdi, the
story is far from over.

23:03.582 --> 23:11.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATIMA KURDI: Of course, the sad
part, you
always think about the rest of
the family,

23:11.690 --> 23:17.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about a million of those
refugees. They are
still -- have a little bit of
hope one day

23:17.830 --> 23:19.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they will be somewhere safe.

23:19.698 --> 23:24.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After her
nephew's tragic
death, Tima has become an
outspoken activist

23:24.136 --> 23:26.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and advocate for the plight of
refugees around
the world.

23:26.739 --> 23:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATIMA KURDI: People have to
open their heart
and their door and help them.
And that's why

23:34.346 --> 23:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said, if I have a chance to
bring my voice
to the world, I'm willing to do
it. It's not

23:42.921 --> 23:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something I choose. I just -- it
happened.
And it's not an easy thing to
do, really.

23:50.362 --> 23:56.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A dire
challenge now faced
by the U.S., European and Middle
Eastern nations

23:56.101 --> 23:57.102 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
alike.

23:57.136 --> 24:00.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

24:00.739 --> 24:12.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:12.117 --> 24:18.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
examining why
the Oscar nominees still lack
diversity; the

24:18.157 --> 24:24.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tough job market for women over
50; and what
it takes to make a great
photograph.

24:24.296 --> 24:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, what the White House
is calling
the moon shot to cure cancer.
One unexpected

24:31.337 --> 24:35.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announcement in President
Obama's State of
the Union address came when he
tapped Vice

24:35.607 --> 24:41.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Joe Biden to lead an
effort to boost
and streamline cancer research
across the

24:41.613 --> 24:43.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Tonight, I'm announcing a new
national effort

24:46.151 --> 24:50.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get it done. And because he's
gone to the
mat for all of us on so many
issues over the

24:50.856 --> 24:53.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past 40 years, I'm putting Joe
in charge of
mission control.

24:53.592 --> 24:55.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

24:55.394 --> 25:02.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: For the loved ones
we've all
lost, for the families that we
can still save,

25:02.935 --> 25:05.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's make America the country
that cures
cancer once and for all.

25:05.804 --> 25:07.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you say, Joe?

25:07.039 --> 25:08.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

25:08.907 --> 25:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For a look at
what an initiative
might look like, and who would
be involved,

25:12.711 --> 25:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how it might go forward, we
turn to three
people with long ties to cancer
research.

25:18.083 --> 25:23.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Otis Brawley is chief
medical officer
at the American Cancer Society.
Dr. Francis

25:23.856 --> 25:29.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Collins is the director of the
National Institutes
of Health. And Katie Couric, in
addition to

25:29.261 --> 25:33.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being the well-known journalist
and author,
she is also one of the
co-founders of Stand

25:33.732 --> 25:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Up to Cancer. It's a charitable
group that
supports collaborative research.

25:38.437 --> 25:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you
to the program.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Brawley, let me start with
you.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Is it realistic for the
president to say,
let's cure cancer once and for
all?

25:47.746 --> 25:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. OTIS BRAWLEY, American
Cancer Society:
Well, I think the cure analogy
is fine.

25:51.784 --> 25:57.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's really going to happen is
some cancers,
if we intensify our efforts,
will be cured.

25:57.356 --> 26:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many cancers are going to be
stalled out to
where they become very chronic
diseases, like

26:02.361 --> 26:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
diabetes. But the end result is,
people are
going to be better for it.

26:06.865 --> 26:11.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Francis Collins,
Dr. Collins,
do you agree? I mean, we know
there are, what,

26:11.470 --> 26:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over 100 -- maybe hundreds of
types of cancer?
What are people to think about
this?

26:17.376 --> 26:19.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. FRANCIS COLLINS, Director,
National Institutes
of Health: Well, I hope they
will be inspired

26:19.611 --> 26:21.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and excited about this.

26:21.380 --> 26:25.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, there are hundreds of types
of cancer,
but we are at an inflection
point in terms

26:25.284 --> 26:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of things we are learning about
what causes
this disease, where good cells
go bad, and

26:30.522 --> 26:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what could we do about it? And
by bring together
immunotherapy, the new way of
activating the

26:35.561 --> 26:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immune system to tackle cancel,
genomics,
and making sure that everybody
is sharing

26:40.599 --> 26:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the data they're developing in
those kinds
of studies, the vice president,
a man of great

26:45.337 --> 26:50.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passion and principle, is
determined that
this is not going to be a tweak
on the system.

26:50.075 --> 26:55.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is going to be a major
acceleration of
the effort to discover how to
treat and cure,

26:55.347 --> 26:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in many instances, cancer. And
goodness knows,
we can all get excited about
that outcome.

26:59.585 --> 27:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Katie
Couric, as somebody
who has been on the advocacy
side of this

27:04.089 --> 27:09.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for years, having lost your
first husband
and your sister to cancer, how
do you see

27:09.528 --> 27:11.263 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the challenge?

27:11.296 --> 27:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC, Stand Up to
Cancer: Well, I
think it's so exciting, Judy,
when I heard

27:13.732 --> 27:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this announcement at the State
of the Union.
And it's -- I think we are, as
Dr. Collins

27:19.137 --> 27:25.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, at a really inflection
point, and things
are happening so much when it
comes to immunotherapy,

27:25.210 --> 27:27.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as he said, genomics, the basic
science.

27:28.013 --> 27:33.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, as somebody who
has lost people
near and dear to my heart, I --
when Vice

27:33.785 --> 27:38.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Biden lost Beau, I
literally felt
his pain and frustration. And
that's the way

27:38.957 --> 27:42.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I felt when Jay and Emily died.
Why couldn't
there be better treatments?

27:42.861 --> 27:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember, Judy, the first-line
treatment
for metastatic colon cancer for
Jay in 1999

27:48.166 --> 27:54.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- 1997, rather, had been around
since the
1950s. And it just made me
furious. And that

27:54.806 --> 27:56.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was really the impetus for Stand
Up to Cancer.

27:57.009 --> 28:01.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We said, you know, these
researchers, these
scientists, they have to
collaborate, instead

28:01.413 --> 28:07.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of compete. And we started it in
2008, and
now, eight years later, we have
-- we have

28:07.152 --> 28:14.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1,000 scientists. We have 130
researcher institutions
involved. They're working on 18
different

28:14.059 --> 28:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dream teams, where they're
collaborating on
things like pancreatic cancer,
lung cancer

28:18.530 --> 28:21.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with the American Cancer
Society, childhood
cancers.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

28:23.135 --> 28:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: And it's -- so,
and, already,
two FDA-approved treatments have
stemmed from

28:26.972 --> 28:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that kind of research for
pancreatic cancer
and lung cancer. So, I think
collaboration

28:32.244 --> 28:33.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really is the key.

28:34.012 --> 28:38.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Dr. Brawley?
What would constitute a
breakthrough here?

28:38.750 --> 28:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. OTIS BRAWLEY: Well, I agree
that we need
sustained funding and sustained
support for

28:45.223 --> 28:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the scientists, especially the
folks at the
National Cancer Institute, who
have been wonderful

28:49.928 --> 28:51.663 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at this.

28:51.697 --> 28:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do believe that we are at an
inflection
point. We have learned a lot
about what goes

28:56.602 --> 29:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on in the cancer cell. A lot of
targets that
are druggable are being
developed. We actually

29:02.641 --> 29:09.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need some command-and-control of
the oncology
research network in order to
advance it further

29:09.414 --> 29:10.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and faster.

29:10.515 --> 29:12.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean
command-and-control?

29:12.351 --> 29:18.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. OTIS BRAWLEY: Well, we do
need people
to say, this is a project that
needs funding

29:18.457 --> 29:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and needs funding urgently. This
is a project
that's repetitive and need not
be funded.

29:25.297 --> 29:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need people to say, you, as
an investigator,
need to start talking and
collaborating with

29:32.304 --> 29:36.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other investigators. We need to
bring industry
into this.

29:36.441 --> 29:41.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to bring far more than
just government
and academics. I would also say
the advocacy

29:41.513 --> 29:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community needs to be involved.
So, there
needs to be some collaboration
amongst numerous

29:46.351 --> 29:49.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
individuals and numerous
organizations.

29:49.554 --> 29:54.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I actually am very
optimistic that we
can do some very positive work
here.

29:54.993 --> 29:59.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Dr. Collins,
how much
of this is money? We know
something like 265

29:59.865 --> 30:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million more dollars went to the
National
Cancer Institute over the last
few years.

30:04.536 --> 30:09.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were responsible for a lot
of that. Is
money the whole story here?

30:09.341 --> 30:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. FRANCIS COLLINS: It's not
the whole story,
but it sure is helpful.

30:13.612 --> 30:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators who are pursuing
really creative
ideas in cancer research still
have only about

30:18.316 --> 30:22.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one chance in five that their
ideas are going
to get funded, because although
we have now

30:22.154 --> 30:26.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turned the corner -- and much
credit to the
Congress for making that happen
a month ago

30:26.091 --> 30:29.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- we still have a long way to
go to catch
up on the resources that we have
lost.

30:29.861 --> 30:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we're really going to
jump-start this
kind of opportunity for moving
cancer research

30:35.233 --> 30:39.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward at an accelerated pace,
resources
are going to be critical. We are
not lacking

30:39.538 --> 30:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for ideas. We're not lacking for
talent. There
are all kinds of things
happening in this

30:44.409 --> 30:46.178 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
field.

30:46.211 --> 30:48.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Resources are really critical to
make it possible
to move forward at the rate that
I know we

30:48.980 --> 30:54.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could. Take immunotherapy. We
have seen how
the immune system, probably in
all of us,

30:54.453 --> 30:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is searching out and taking care
of small
numbers of cancer cells every
day, and we

30:59.124 --> 31:00.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
never even know we had them.

31:00.926 --> 31:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, sometimes, the cancer cells
are clever
enough to elude that. We have
seen dramatic

31:05.731 --> 31:10.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
results in melanoma, President
Carter with
his metastatic melanoma. Now,
apparently,

31:10.235 --> 31:10.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those brain...

31:10.836 --> 31:11.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:11.403 --> 31:12.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stunning.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. FRANCIS COLLINS: ... melted
away.

31:14.039 --> 31:18.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we need to move that into
other areas,
like pancreatic cancer, like
lung cancer,

31:18.543 --> 31:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
breast cancer, prostate cancer,
where the
immune system is having an even
harder time

31:22.814 --> 31:24.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
finding what is there.

31:24.649 --> 31:29.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those cancers have abnormal
proteins.
They should be approachable. We
need to teach

31:29.788 --> 31:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the immune system, take it to
college, take
it to graduate school, figure
out how we can

31:34.259 --> 31:37.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
activate what our own mechanisms
might be
able to do for us.

31:37.395 --> 31:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Katie
Couric, from where
you stand, that money, do you
look to Congress?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, what are we talking
about here?

31:43.769 --> 31:50.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: Well, of course we
need a bigger
-- I think we need more
sustained and funding

31:50.242 --> 31:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for government and from Congress
and for the
NIH, for the NCI.

31:54.913 --> 32:00.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, to Dr. Brawley's
point, we also
need the private sector
involved. We have

32:00.786 --> 32:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raised -- I think close to $360
million has
been pledged to Stand Up to
Cancer through

32:06.558 --> 32:12.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
corporate and private and
individual donors.
So, we need to come together as
a country

32:12.264 --> 32:16.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and say, you know, this has got
to be where
the end of cancer begins. That's
our motto

32:16.768 --> 32:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Stand Up to Cancer, and
really get everyone
involved.

32:20.172 --> 32:24.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think, under Vice
President Biden's
leadership, he will be able to
galvanize the

32:24.409 --> 32:30.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
community that can be as
political at times,
Judy, as TV news, if you can
imagine that...

32:30.215 --> 32:31.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:31.616 --> 32:33.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: ... with a lot of
overlapping
and competing interests.

32:33.952 --> 32:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we really do need to come
together as
a country, and I think we will
able to accomplish

32:38.256 --> 32:43.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
incredible things, and
especially if we have
a more coordinated, sustained
effort.

32:43.328 --> 32:47.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just quickly
from all three
of you, Dr. Brawley first,
what's the message

32:47.199 --> 32:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people out there right now
who either
have cancer or have a loved one
with cancer

32:53.205 --> 32:55.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- how much hope should they
have right now?

32:55.307 --> 32:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. OTIS BRAWLEY: Well, I do
want to give
everyone who has cancer some
hope.

32:59.611 --> 33:06.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that we need to be
much more organized.
I do think that
command-and-control, where

33:06.751 --> 33:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's actually a strategic
plan, by someone
who's in government -- the vice
president

33:12.657 --> 33:18.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is ideal because he understands
politics.
There's great scientists already
to advise

33:18.997 --> 33:24.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him. But we need actually
someone to do organization
and leadership. So I want to
give everyone

33:24.069 --> 33:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some hope. I'm very excited
about this plan.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Collins?

33:28.506 --> 33:31.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. FRANCIS COLLINS: I'm
excited, too, and
I think we are getting the real
understanding

33:31.376 --> 33:35.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of cancer that we have needed
all along, and
that's translating into ideas
about prevention

33:35.547 --> 33:37.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and treatment.

33:37.382 --> 33:40.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, anybody listening to this, I
think, should
feel a sense of hope, a sense of
inspiration,

33:40.685 --> 33:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sense we're on the right
track, and we have
got the right people and the
right smarts,

33:44.256 --> 33:49.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and now maybe some more
resources. This is
a problem we can eventually
solve.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Katie Couric,
write a check?

33:51.396 --> 33:53.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: Yes, write a
check.

33:53.298 --> 33:58.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, think -- if only one
in five promising
research proposals is funded,
that's four

33:58.169 --> 34:02.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
great ideas that are left
literally, Judy,
on the cutting-room floor.

34:02.107 --> 34:07.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we need to support our
scientists. They're
the real heroes and heroines, I
think, of

34:07.646 --> 34:12.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our society. We need to give
them the money
they need to do the work that
will help us

34:12.884 --> 34:14.653 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all.

34:14.686 --> 34:19.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Katie Couric, Dr.
Francis Collins,
Dr. Otis Brawley, we thank you,
all three.

34:19.057 --> 34:23.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. FRANCIS COLLINS: Thank you.

34:23.228 --> 34:27.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. OTIS BRAWLEY: Thank you.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KATIE COURIC: Thanks, Judy.

34:30.702 --> 34:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, the Motion
Picture Academy
today named its top picks for
the best performances

34:38.176 --> 34:41.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and films of 2015.

34:41.112 --> 34:47.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our look at
who's in this
year's field, and getting just
as much attention,

34:47.819 --> 34:52.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who's not.

34:52.324 --> 34:59.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When it comes to Oscar
nominations this year,
it is a very cruel world,
indeed. "The Revenant,"

34:59.531 --> 35:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a revenge tale set in the
American wilderness
in the 1800s, gained the most
nominations,

35:05.603 --> 35:11.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
12 in all, including for best
picture, best
director Alejandro Inarritu, who
won last

35:11.910 --> 35:18.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year for "Birdman," and in the
leading actor
category for Leonardo DiCaprio,
a megastar

35:18.183 --> 35:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who famously has never won an
Oscar.

35:22.754 --> 35:28.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second most honored film
with 10 nominations
portrayed a different kind of
struggle for

35:28.960 --> 35:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survival. "Mad Max: Fury Road"
is set in a
not-so-distant future that we
can all only

35:34.799 --> 35:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hope to avoid. It's a sequel to
the popular
trilogy that began in 1979.
Director George

35:42.407 --> 35:47.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miller, who also created and
directed the
earlier series, gained a
nomination for the

35:47.178 --> 35:49.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new film, this time using a

Mike Sargent is a film critic
for Pacifica
Radio.

35:54.452 --> 35:57.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT, Film Critic,
Pacifica Radio:
And they're both definitely
about survival,

35:57.055 --> 36:03.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they both are taking, in
many ways, simple
stories and just telling them
really well.

36:03.762 --> 36:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Mad Max" is essentially one
long chase film,
but it's shot and staged and
mounted in a

36:09.034 --> 36:10.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
way no one's ever seen.

36:10.535 --> 36:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: That's tracking right
towards us.

36:12.337 --> 36:15.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Unlike many other
years, though,
the races in this and other key
categories

36:15.940 --> 36:21.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are considered up for grabs. Six
other films
join "The Revenant" and "Mad
Max" on the best

36:21.379 --> 36:27.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picture list, "The Big Short,"
"Bridge of
Spies, "Brooklyn," "The
Martian," "Room,"

36:27.385 --> 36:29.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and "Spotlight."

36:29.220 --> 36:33.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were some familiar names
in the acting
categories. Among the men, in
addition to

36:33.191 --> 36:39.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DiCaprio, Matt Damon in "The
Martian," Bryan
Cranston in "Trumbo," and last
year's winner,

36:39.697 --> 36:45.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eddie Redmayne, among women,
former winner
Cate Blanchett for "Carol," and
Jennifer Lawrence

36:45.370 --> 36:47.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for "Joy."

36:47.238 --> 36:51.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a relative newcomer, Brie
Larson, seems
to be the odds-on favorite for
her performance

36:51.943 --> 36:57.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in "Room" as a woman held
captive for years
with her young son now adjusting
to the outside

36:57.816 --> 36:59.150 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

36:59.184 --> 37:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRIE LARSON, Actress: I just
want him to connect
with something.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Slate film critic
Dana Steven.

37:02.620 --> 37:06.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANA STEVENS, Slate: Brie Larson
is absolutely
wonderful in "Room" and a
genuine breakthrough

37:06.224 --> 37:10.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of performance. And she is
not a name
that is widely known outside of
cinephilic

37:10.829 --> 37:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circles in the last few years.
And, suddenly,
she's burst into stardom and
greater visibility

37:16.034 --> 37:17.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with this role.

37:17.869 --> 37:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Most notably
missing again
for the second straight year,
actors of color,

37:21.606 --> 37:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an issue that's put its own
spotlight on Hollywood
for its lack of diversity at
every level.

37:27.112 --> 37:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: And though I think
Cheryl Boone
Isaacs, who is the head of the
Academy now,

37:31.015 --> 37:36.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has made great strides in the
last couple
years to include more people of
color, more

37:36.921 --> 37:43.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women, more people under a
certain age in
the academy, it still is
dominated primarily

37:43.495 --> 37:52.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by men, primarily by white men
over 60, 65,
and the choices of films and
actors often

37:52.770 --> 37:58.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reflect a sensibility, and maybe
let's just
say a sensibility that's time
perhaps has

37:59.010 --> 38:00.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come and gone.

38:00.845 --> 38:04.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Among those left
off the best
actor list was Idris Elba for
"Beasts of no

38:04.816 --> 38:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nation," and Benicio Del Toro
for "Sicario."

38:08.219 --> 38:13.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The film "Straight Outta
Compton" about the
rap group NWA had been wildly
praised, but

38:13.858 --> 38:15.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was shut out of major
nominations.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANA STEVENS: I always sort of
think, well,
it's earlier up the pipeline
that things should

38:18.730 --> 38:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been fixed. Right? The
problem is that
there aren't people of color and
women out

38:21.933 --> 38:27.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there making movies and getting
the directing
jobs and acting jobs. And if
they were there,

38:27.472 --> 38:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we would have more choices to
pick from.

38:29.807 --> 38:33.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, there are exceptions to
that even
this year, for example, Ryan
Coogler, the

38:33.478 --> 38:37.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
director of "Creed,"
African-American director,
and a great performance by
Michael B. Jordan

38:37.182 --> 38:41.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that role. But neither of
them was recognized.
Instead, it's the white
supporting actor,

38:41.986 --> 38:43.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sylvester Stallone, who got
recognized for
"Creed."

38:43.888 --> 38:49.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Star Wars," the
top grossing
film of 2015, won nominations in
several technical

38:49.727 --> 38:51.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
categories.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just how important are these
nominations for
these films?

38:53.965 --> 38:58.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE SARGENT: All films benefit
from getting
nominated, especially the
Oscars. There's

38:58.636 --> 39:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something they call the Oscar
bump. And I
think we're going to see these
films make

39:02.574 --> 39:06.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least 20 percent more than
they would have
if they didn't get nominated.

39:06.411 --> 39:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Academy
Awards ceremony
itself remains a very big deal,
one of the

39:10.982 --> 39:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most watched programs of the
year.

39:13.251 --> 39:19.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after last year's 15 percent
drop in viewership,
from 43 million to 37 million,
producers are

39:19.857 --> 39:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aiming for a bit of a reboot.
Chris Rock will
host the Oscar broadcast on
February 28.

39:25.863 --> 39:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was also sad news in the
film world
today with the passing of Alan
Rickman, a

39:31.035 --> 39:35.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
classically trained British
actor who performed
with the Royal Shakespeare
Company and earned

39:35.440 --> 39:41.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two Tony Award nominations, and
who often
showcased that pedigree in film
roles, such

39:41.246 --> 39:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as Colonel Brandon in "Sense and
Sensibility."

39:43.481 --> 39:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN RICKMAN, Actor: I have
described Mr.
Willoughby as the worst of
libertines, but

39:49.654 --> 39:53.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have since learned from Lady
Allen that
he did mean to propose that day.

39:53.925 --> 39:57.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANA STEVENS: It was hard for me
to pay attention
to those breaking Oscar
nominations this morning

39:57.962 --> 40:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after hearing the news that Alan
Rickman had
died, because, to me, that's
just such a blow

40:02.700 --> 40:06.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the world of cinema. He was
such a great
performer with incredible range.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALAN RICKMAN: Get them back.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: On screen,
Rickman became best
known for his roles as the
villain, playing

40:12.977 --> 40:15.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
German psychopath Hans Gruber in
"Die Hard."

40:16.014 --> 40:18.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALAN RICKMAN: Yippee ki yay.

40:18.082 --> 40:23.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And he was the
dastardly sheriff
of Nottingham in "Robin Hood:
Prince of Thieves."

40:23.521 --> 40:26.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALAN RICKMAN: And call off
Christmas.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For which he won
a British
Academy and Film Award.

40:29.827 --> 40:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, for a new
generation, he was
master of the dark arts of
magic, Severus

40:34.899 --> 40:36.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Snape, in the "Harry Potter"
franchise.

40:36.868 --> 40:48.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN RICKMAN: Should anyone,
student or staff,
attempt to aid Mr. Potter, they
will be punished.

40:48.079 --> 40:52.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In another vain,
in the Christmas
favorite "Love Actually" Rickman
was a husband

40:53.017 --> 40:56.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Emma Thompson, pathetically
flirting with
adultery.

40:56.521 --> 41:02.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALAN RICKMAN: I'm so in love
with you, a classic
fool.

41:03.027 --> 41:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: During his
30-year career,
Rickman never won an Oscar, but
once said,

41:05.730 --> 41:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"Parts win prizes, not actors."

41:09.033 --> 41:13.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alan Rickman's family announced
today that
he died from a battle with
cancer. He was

41:13.271 --> 41:14.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
69 years old.

41:15.006 --> 41:22.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

41:22.280 --> 41:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It turns out that
women face
a much tougher time in the job
market then

41:36.060 --> 41:38.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
men do as they age.

41:38.329 --> 41:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
recently looked into the
challenge of getting

41:42.467 --> 41:48.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hired as a woman over 50. It's
part of our
weekly segment Making Sense,
which airs every

41:48.573 --> 41:50.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thursday on the "NewsHour."

41:50.241 --> 41:55.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: On Comedy Central's
"Inside Amy
Schumer," the aging actress'
lament:

41:55.847 --> 42:00.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tina Fey, Actress: You know how
Sally Field
was Tom Hanks' love interest in
"Punchline,"

42:00.451 --> 42:02.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then, like, 20 minutes
later, she was
his mom in "Forrest Gump"?

42:02.954 --> 42:05.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Tina Fey is 45,
Patricia Arquette
47.

42:06.023 --> 42:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICIA ARQUETTE, Actress: I
didn't get this
commercial last week for AARP
because the

42:09.527 --> 42:12.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
director said I was too old to
play Larry
King's wife.

42:12.130 --> 42:17.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Schumer's gag,
these stars were
celebrating 55-year-old Julia
Louis-Dreyfus'

42:17.835 --> 42:21.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
last day playing a love
interest, though Schumer
used a raunchier term.

42:21.939 --> 42:25.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY SCHUMER, Actress: But what
about men?
Like, who tells men when it's
their last (EXPLETIVE

42:25.476 --> 42:26.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DELETED) day?

42:26.611 --> 42:27.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

42:27.912 --> 42:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA LOUIS-DREYFUS, Actress:
Honey, men don't
have that day.

42:31.315 --> 42:33.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PATRICIA ARQUETTE: Never.

42:33.151 --> 42:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Turns out it's not
just the case
in Hollywood. Jewish Vocational
Services in

42:37.488 --> 42:44.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
San Francisco is a nonprofit
that helps older
people find jobs. We first
visited in 2009,

42:44.495 --> 42:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the height of the great
recession, when
complaints of age discrimination
abounded.

42:49.233 --> 42:53.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PATRICIA WILSON, Legal
Assistant: I was told
during the interview, "As you
can see, we're

42:54.005 --> 43:01.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very young group. And our main
concern is
that you are overly qualified
for this job,

43:01.345 --> 43:03.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we would be concerned that
you wouldn't
stay."

43:03.381 --> 43:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Did you believe
them?

43:05.049 --> 43:08.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICIA WILSON: No. I just felt
that they
didn't think that I would fit in
with the

43:08.586 --> 43:10.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
younger group.

43:10.388 --> 43:16.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But did Patricia
Wilson have
it worse as a woman? We went
back to JVS last

43:16.093 --> 43:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week to focus on females,
assembling a cast

(LAUGHTER)

43:30.508 --> 43:35.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: All of these women
have had trouble
finding work since 2008.

43:35.913 --> 43:38.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cynthia Josayma used to work in

CYNTHIA JOSAYMA: When the
recession went into
place, my age community all lost
their jobs.

43:45.490 --> 43:49.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have found that, in
general, the
middle-age American woman is
marginalized.

43:49.594 --> 43:53.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANA MICHAELS, Trouble Finding

has been looking for a job for
two years.

44:00.571 --> 44:08.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANA MICHAELS: They have a
culture of ping-pong
at the beer Fridays. I applied
for a place

44:08.679 --> 44:09.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that had nap Thursdays.

44:09.914 --> 44:11.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Nap Thursdays?

44:11.482 --> 44:15.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANA MICHAELS: Yes. And I could
just see myself
putting the blankets over them.

44:15.486 --> 44:19.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, wait a second.
These young
people were taking naps?

44:19.290 --> 44:24.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANA MICHAELS: On Thursdays. I
was at least
double their age. And I'm sure
they looked

44:24.462 --> 44:26.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at me like, oh, this old lady's
not going
to fit in.

44:26.697 --> 44:33.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Though this was
high-tech San
Francisco, the problem extends
nationwide.

44:33.504 --> 44:38.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Denise Carrillo has been
unemployed since
losing her fashion industry job
in New York

44:38.142 --> 44:39.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2007.

44:39.911 --> 44:45.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did you feel you were being
discriminated
against because you were a
somewhat older

44:45.783 --> 44:47.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
woman?

44:47.818 --> 44:52.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE CARRILLO: Yes. Yes, I
did. The experience
was there, my confidence was
there. The compliments

44:52.890 --> 44:58.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just rolled. But I was older.
And that's when
I decided, relocate.

44:58.362 --> 45:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But when you came
here from New
York two-and-a-half years ago,
did you get

45:02.533 --> 45:05.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
responses to the resumes that
you sent out?

45:05.770 --> 45:08.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DENISE CARRILLO: No. None. No
responses.

45:08.139 --> 45:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The plight of older
women looking
for work was the buzz at last
week's annual

45:13.477 --> 45:18.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting of the American Economic
Association,
thanks in part to a Federal
Reserve study

45:19.016 --> 45:26.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making headlines: Women over 50
now account
for half of the long-term
unemployed.

45:26.457 --> 45:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But does that mean they're being
discriminated
against, more than, say, men
over 50?

45:30.628 --> 45:32.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID NEUMARK, Economist,
University of California,
Irvine: This is, of course, one
of the reasons

45:32.530 --> 45:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economists step in, you know,
because we're
always a little -- a little
skeptical of those

45:36.100 --> 45:36.901 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interpretations.

45:36.934 --> 45:38.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Economist David
Neumark.

45:38.769 --> 45:41.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID NEUMARK: Because we have
all not gotten
jobs we have applied for, and it
doesn't mean

45:41.505 --> 45:46.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were discriminated against
because of whatever
feature we have, age, race, sex,
whatever

45:46.177 --> 45:47.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it might be.

45:47.912 --> 45:53.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But economists can
test these
interpretations with field
experiments, the

45:53.417 --> 45:58.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most famous of which may be the
audit study
summarized in this video, where
thousands

45:58.756 --> 46:05.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of made-up resumes were mailed
to employers,
identical, except for the names,
half black-sounding,

46:05.262 --> 46:07.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
half-white.

46:07.498 --> 46:17.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The results? Black-sounding
names were 50
percent less likely to get
follow-up calls.

46:17.308 --> 46:24.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Neumark used the audit
study approach
to study ageism and sexism. He
sent out resumes

46:24.281 --> 46:30.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 12 cities, using women's
names for thousands
of administrative assistant and
retail sales

46:30.488 --> 46:34.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jobs, men's names for custodian
and security
guard.

46:34.659 --> 46:40.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also varied the age: A third
of the fictional
job hunters were around 30, a
third around

46:40.464 --> 46:48.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50, a final third in their
mid-60s. The results
were dramatically different by
age, but just

46:48.506 --> 46:50.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
among the women.

46:50.374 --> 46:53.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID NEUMARK: The youngest
group, 30-year-old
or so, get about 15 percent
callback rates,

46:53.244 --> 46:58.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even higher in sales, the
middle-age group
lower, and the oldest group by
far the lowest.

46:58.816 --> 47:03.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a hint that older male
workers have
lower callback rates than
younger male workers,

47:03.154 --> 47:08.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there's much stronger
evidence, in terms
of magnitudes and how robust the
finding is,

47:08.192 --> 47:10.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of age discrimination against
older women.

47:10.061 --> 47:13.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNA LAHEY, Economist: Those
dark red dots
are fixations. That's where the
eye is pausing.

47:13.264 --> 47:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Economist Joanna
Lahey did a
similar study, sending out 8,000
made-up resumes

47:19.203 --> 47:26.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and an eye-scanning lab
experiment studying
how long H.R. managers looked at
resumes.

47:26.343 --> 47:28.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The red dots tell you where and
for how long.

47:28.379 --> 47:31.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNA LAHEY: And we see the
years on the
employment history, and we see
the education

47:31.716 --> 47:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the year that they got their
education.

47:33.484 --> 47:38.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The managers looked
longer at
younger resumes, looked longer
at the items

47:38.622 --> 47:40.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
indicating age.

47:40.324 --> 47:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNA LAHEY: This one, for
example, says,
"I'm willing to embrace change,"
which is

47:42.426 --> 47:45.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that the AARP used to
recommend
that you put on your resume and
then it stopped

47:45.930 --> 47:46.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recommending.

47:46.797 --> 47:48.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because it didn't
work?

47:48.332 --> 47:50.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNA LAHEY: Well, my first
study found that
it actually hurt older people.

47:50.568 --> 47:56.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because it
identified them as
card-carrying members of AARP,
Lahey suspects,

47:56.507 --> 47:58.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and therefore at least 50.

47:58.109 --> 48:01.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you had people starting in
their mid-30s
all the way to the mid-70s.

48:01.345 --> 48:02.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOANNA LAHEY: Yes.

48:02.513 --> 48:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And when does age
discrimination
start?

48:05.816 --> 48:07.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNA LAHEY: Immediately. It
starts at age
35.

48:07.985 --> 48:09.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Really?

48:09.787 --> 48:15.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNA LAHEY: Yes. It's a pretty
steady process.
As you get older, your amount of
callbacks

48:15.426 --> 48:16.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decrease.

48:16.360 --> 48:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it's women more
than men?

48:18.529 --> 48:20.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNA LAHEY: It's definitely
women more than
men.

48:20.231 --> 48:23.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So the evidence is
clear, but
what's the explanation?

48:23.534 --> 48:27.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID NEUMARK: The evolutionary
biologists
bring everything back to you
know, reproduction,

48:27.438 --> 48:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right? Older men can reproduce.
Older women
can't.

48:29.573 --> 48:32.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA FEY: And then we put her in
the boat
and we push her out into the
water and we

48:32.610 --> 48:37.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drink champagne to salute how
(EXPLETIVE DELETED)
she was for so many years.
Cheers. Cheers.

48:37.214 --> 48:45.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, it could be
that it's really
something inherent that's passed
on from our

48:45.256 --> 48:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evolutionary heritage that just
says, older
women, not so much, older men,
doesn't make

48:51.829 --> 48:53.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a difference?

48:53.664 --> 48:56.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID NEUMARK: It could be. I
mean, I think
the notion that age signals
something, and

48:56.867 --> 49:01.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's -- for some people at
least, it's a negative,
is not -- is not crazy.

49:01.906 --> 49:05.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No, not crazy, as
even our older
women acknowledged.

49:05.743 --> 49:07.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA TROGDON: I'm trying to
think back to

49:07.444 --> 49:09.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Lisa Trogdon is 58.

49:09.280 --> 49:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA TROGDON: ... what I thought
was, when
I was younger. And 50, when I
was 20, 25,

49:15.419 --> 49:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seemed old. And as a young
person, I didn't
have the perspective, like I do
now to realize,

49:22.226 --> 49:24.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
oh, they have valuable
experience.

49:24.461 --> 49:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA MILVY: Maybe it's all a
fear, a fear
of older, more experienced
people.

49:29.400 --> 49:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But what's crazy is
that age
signals something so much more
negative for

49:33.804 --> 49:35.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women than men.

49:35.806 --> 49:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And says economist Teresa
Ghilarducci:

49:37.608 --> 49:41.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERESA GHILARDUCCI, Economist:
It's going
to be a bigger problem, this age
discrimination

49:41.312 --> 49:47.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem, for women as more and
more women
are having to work longer,
because of divorce,

49:47.685 --> 49:54.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or because they have eroded
pensions, or lower
pensions, because even if they
worked their

49:54.291 --> 49:58.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whole life, they were paid less,
and so they
accumulated less pensions.

49:58.696 --> 50:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And as Laura Milvy
asked at the
vocational center:

50:02.399 --> 50:05.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA MILVY: If we're all going
to live to
100 years, and you're trying to
make women

50:05.870 --> 50:10.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their 50s stop working, what
are we going
to do for the next 50 years?.

50:10.774 --> 50:12.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Good question.

50:12.576 --> 50:19.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is "PBS NewsHour" economics
correspondent
Paul Solman, reporting from San
Francisco.

50:19.350 --> 50:32.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now another
in our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask interesting

50:32.229 --> 50:34.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people about their passions.

50:34.131 --> 50:40.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For six decades, Ken Van Sickle
has been quietly
producing photographs in his
darkroom, located

50:40.537 --> 50:45.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the center of Manhattan. His
photos range
from documenting the bohemian
life of New

50:45.643 --> 50:51.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
York and Paris in the 1950s and
'60s to pushing
the limits of the medium itself.

50:51.382 --> 50:54.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN VAN SICKLE, Photographer: If
you walk
out of the front of the Flatiron
Building

50:54.451 --> 50:57.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you walk straight across the
street, you
walk right through my door. Then
you have

50:57.655 --> 51:01.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go 91 steps up the stairs,
which is really
good for me, because it keeps me
healthy.

51:01.392 --> 51:07.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm 83 years old now. I moved
into this building
in 1963. And it's
rent-controlled. And it's

51:07.231 --> 51:12.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a landmark building, and I'm a
senior citizen.
So, I don't pay much rent.
That's the only

51:12.169 --> 51:19.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reason I can live here at all.

51:19.743 --> 51:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't have a favorite place to
take photographs
or even a favorite subject. I
carry a camera.

51:24.715 --> 51:27.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I go out into the hallway, I
carry a camera
with me.

51:27.785 --> 51:33.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was in Paris, I was 23, I
think, and
I wanted to shoot everything I
saw, but I

51:33.857 --> 51:37.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't have enough money to buy,
like, more
than like a roll of film every
two weeks.

51:37.628 --> 51:41.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And somebody said that Chet
Baker was playing
over at the American club. And I
went over

51:41.398 --> 51:47.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I took two pictures, and one
of them is
out of focus, and the other one
is a great

51:47.438 --> 51:49.239 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
photo.

51:49.273 --> 51:52.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm not a concerned
photographer. I'm not
trying to prove anything in any
way politically

51:52.109 --> 51:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or otherwise. I'm interested in
beauty and
sort of the subtle moments of
everyday life.

51:57.848 --> 52:02.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This picture was called "The
Regular." The
chairs in the foreground are
overlapping,

52:02.252 --> 52:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overlapping planes in parallel
recession.
This picture, I just call it
"Washington Square."

52:08.025 --> 52:13.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Laboratories tend to print it

Grand Central Station, I don't
know why there
was only one person walking in
there. I had

52:16.333 --> 52:22.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just gotten off the train. I
call this "Firemen."
The arch had caved in on five
firemen. The

Metropolitan Museum chose this
to be in the
permanent collection.

There are a lot of things that
make a good
photograph. You have to think
about texture

52:31.448 --> 52:35.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and gesture and composition, and
all the things
that painting has in it.
Technology doesn't

52:35.919 --> 52:41.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change the way photography is.
It just -- it
makes it available to more
people, which means

52:41.058 --> 52:45.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's going to be much, much
more really
terrible pictures taken or
pictures that are

52:45.496 --> 52:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
totally dependent on subject,
which is all,
all right.

If you were there when the
Hindenburg caught
on fire, and you took a picture
of it, that's

52:53.037 --> 52:56.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great photograph. But you're
not a great
photographer, because you can't
repeat that

52:56.940 --> 52:58.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in everyday things.

52:58.809 --> 53:05.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What a great photographer does
is, they are
consistently able to make
something in a style

53:05.616 --> 53:11.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's personal to themselves.
My pictures
don't depend on extreme
sharpness. They depend

53:11.288 --> 53:15.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the composition and on the
subject and
on the way I see it.
