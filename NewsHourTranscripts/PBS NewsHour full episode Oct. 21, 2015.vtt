WEBVTT

00:05.639 --> 00:06.807
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.208
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.208 --> 00:10.043
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the
"NewsHour" tonight:

00:10.043 --> 00:12.312
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United States: While I will
not be a candidate, I

00:12.312 --> 00:14.915
will not be silent.

00:14.915 --> 00:19.620
JUDY WOODRUFF: Vice President
Joe Biden ends months of
speculation -- what his decision

00:19.620 --> 00:23.190
not to run means in the
race for the White House.

00:23.190 --> 00:27.094
GWEN IFILL: Paul Ryan says he is
willing to run for speaker of
the House, but on his own

00:27.094 --> 00:29.296
terms.

00:29.296 --> 00:34.668
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday: The push to reduce
the nation's prison population

00:34.668 --> 00:40.240
gains unexpected allies. Police
and prosecutors call for fewer
arrests.

00:40.240 --> 00:45.445
GWEN IFILL: And a pioneering
project to uncover the genetic
roots of autism.

00:45.445 --> 00:50.050
LISA WILSON, Mother of Jonathan
Wilson: I called Blair at work,
and I immediately burst

00:50.050 --> 00:54.588
into tears, and I said, this
changes everything and nothing.

00:54.588 --> 00:57.190
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:57.190 --> 01:03.463
(BREAK)

01:03.463 --> 01:16.176
GWEN IFILL: For Democrats, a
season of uncertainty is at an
end: Vice President Joe Biden
will

01:16.176 --> 01:19.579
not join the presidential
race after all.

01:19.579 --> 01:23.817
He'd pondered the possibility at
least since summer, and
announced his decision today in

01:23.817 --> 01:28.455
the White House Rose Garden.
Joined by his wife, Jill, and
President Obama, he said he

01:28.455 --> 01:32.893
and his family took the time to
consider all political options
after his son Beau died

01:32.893 --> 01:35.529
of cancer in may.

01:35.529 --> 01:38.999
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United States:
Unfortunately, I believe we are
out

01:38.999 --> 01:45.439
of time, the time necessary to
mount a winning campaign for the
nomination.

01:45.439 --> 01:52.479
But while I will not be a
candidate, I will not be silent.
This party, our nation will

01:52.479 --> 02:00.988
be making a tragic mistake if we
walk away or attempt to undo the
Obama legacy. The American

02:00.988 --> 02:08.428
people have worked too hard and
we have come too far for that.
Democrats shouldn't only

02:08.428 --> 02:14.901
defend this record and protect
this record. They should run on
this record.

02:14.901 --> 02:20.073
GWEN IFILL: The vice president
urged his party to oppose the
influence of unlimited campaign

02:20.073 --> 02:24.811
contributions and to support
making college more accessible.
He also warned against a

02:24.811 --> 02:28.815
partisan divide that he said
is ripping the country apart.

02:28.815 --> 02:35.655
JOSEPH BIDEN: It's
mean-spirited, it's petty, and
it's gone on for much too long.
I don't

02:35.655 --> 02:40.794
believe, like some do, that it's
naive to talk to Republicans.

02:40.794 --> 02:46.099
I don't think we should look at
Republicans as our enemies. They
are our opposition. They're

02:46.099 --> 02:51.438
not our enemies. And for the
sake of the country, we have to
work together.

02:51.438 --> 02:56.476
GWEN IFILL: The Biden decision
removed a potential challenge to
Democratic front-runner Hillary

02:56.476 --> 03:00.414
Clinton. She, in turn, praised
him as a good friend and a great
man. We will look more

03:00.414 --> 03:04.551
deeply into the decision, and
its implications, after the news
summary.

03:04.551 --> 03:09.222
JUDY WOODRUFF: In other news,
Syria's President Bashar
al-Assad has made a surprise
visit

03:09.222 --> 03:15.829
to Moscow, his first known trip
abroad since civil war broke out
in his country in 2011.

03:15.829 --> 03:21.468
Russia and Syrian officials now
say that Assad held talks
yesterday with Russian President

03:21.468 --> 03:26.440
Vladimir Putin, and that he
expressed gratitude for Russian
support, including from
warplanes

03:26.440 --> 03:29.543
and military helicopters.

03:29.543 --> 03:34.915
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, President of
Syria (through translator): To
begin with, thank you to the

03:34.915 --> 03:39.152
country of Russia. Terrorism
which we see spreading today
could have been more widespread

03:39.152 --> 03:43.757
and more harmful if not for your
decisions and steps. With all
certainty, a political

03:43.757 --> 03:48.061
solution decided upon by the
people of Syria is the future of
Syria in the way that we

03:48.061 --> 03:51.465
envision, and this
is everyone's goal.

03:51.465 --> 03:57.437
JUDY WOODRUFF: News of the visit
wasn't confirmed until Assad was
safely back in Damascus. Also

03:57.437 --> 04:02.142
today, the Russians announced
that Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov will meet with Secretary

04:02.142 --> 04:06.079
of State John Kerry on Friday in
Vienna. They will be joined by
counterparts from Saudi

04:06.079 --> 04:08.715
Arabia and Turkey.

04:08.715 --> 04:14.087
GWEN IFILL: Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drew
a storm of criticism today

04:14.087 --> 04:18.458
for linking the Holocaust to a
Palestinian leader from World
War II.

04:18.458 --> 04:23.363
In Jerusalem yesterday,
Netanyahu cited a 1941 meeting
involving the grand mufti of

04:23.363 --> 04:26.233
Jerusalem, a known
Nazi sympathizer.

04:26.233 --> 04:32.772
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister: He had a central
role in fomenting the final

04:32.772 --> 04:38.278
solution. He flew to Berlin.
Hitler didn't want to
exterminate the Jews at the
time.

04:38.278 --> 04:42.415
He wanted to expel the Jews. And
Haj Amin al-Husseini went there
and said, "If you expel

04:42.415 --> 04:44.551
them, they will all come here."

04:44.551 --> 04:47.721
"So, what should I do
with them?" he asked.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.490
He said, "Burn them."

04:50.490 --> 04:55.128
GWEN IFILL: Palestinians, along
with Holocaust experts and
survivors and the chancellor of

04:55.128 --> 04:59.366
Germany, said the comment was
factually wrong, and could
incite violence.

04:59.366 --> 05:03.170
Today, as Netanyahu left on a
trip to Germany, he said he's
not absolving Hitler, but he

05:03.170 --> 05:07.440
argued it's absurd to ignore
the mufti's statements.

05:07.440 --> 05:12.812
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
called today for better
physician training and other
steps

05:12.812 --> 05:18.418
to battle an epidemic of
prescription drug abuse and
heroin use. He traveled to
Charleston

05:18.418 --> 05:23.223
in West Virginia, the state with
the highest rate of overdose
deaths in the country. There,

05:23.223 --> 05:26.860
he said he will press for
expanded treatment for addicts.

05:26.860 --> 05:32.866
GWEN IFILL: Toyota has ordered a
new recall, this time for a
faulty power window switch

05:32.866 --> 05:37.604
that can overheat and
potentially cause a fire. The
automaker says more than
six-and-a-half

05:37.604 --> 05:42.576
million vehicles worldwide are
affected. Some two million of
those are in the U.S.

05:42.576 --> 05:47.314
Toyota was hit by fines in the
U.S. after a 2009 scandal over
faulty floor mats, brakes

05:47.314 --> 05:49.816
and gas pedals.

05:49.816 --> 05:54.621
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Wall Street
had another down day, after
another batch of disappointing

05:54.621 --> 06:01.728
corporate earnings. The Dow
Jones industrial average lost 48
points to close at 17168.

06:01.728 --> 06:07.867
The Nasdaq fell almost 41
points, and the S&P 500 slid
nearly 12.

06:07.867 --> 06:13.506
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Joe Biden, what does it mean
that he's not running?;

06:13.506 --> 06:18.945
Paul Ryan says he will serve as
House speaker, but only if;
colder weather brings more
trouble

06:18.945 --> 06:28.121
for thousands of
migrants, and much more.

06:28.121 --> 06:38.565
GWEN IFILL: It has been a
months-long waiting game, but
now that we know Vice President

06:38.565 --> 06:41.768
Biden will not make another run
for the White House, what drove
his decision, and what does

06:41.768 --> 06:45.872
it mean for the rest
of the 2016 field?

06:45.872 --> 06:49.643
Glenn Thrush, the chief
political correspondent for
Politico, has been covering
this, and

06:49.643 --> 06:53.113
in many ways was able to see
around the corner in this
magazine profile earlier this
year,

06:53.113 --> 06:54.748
"Joe Biden in Winter."

06:54.748 --> 06:57.350
Glenn joins me now.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.754
So, after all the ups and the
downs and the speculation, no
go. Why?

07:00.754 --> 07:05.425
GLENN THRUSH, Politico: No, I
mean, there is a number of
reasons, sort of bifurcated

07:05.425 --> 07:09.562
between his emotional life and
this terrible tragedy that he
suffered with the death of

07:09.562 --> 07:14.801
his 46-year-old son, Beau, in
May, but also there was really
no political path.

07:14.801 --> 07:19.973
Biden is sort of a political
procrastinator. He's a very
improvisational politician and

07:19.973 --> 07:24.477
he really waited too long.
Hillary Clinton's performance in
the first debate and this
commensurate

07:24.477 --> 07:28.048
rise in the polls that she saw
afterwards simply left him with
no path.

07:28.048 --> 07:32.018
GWEN IFILL: Your story that you
posted this afternoon, you quote
someone as saying that

07:32.018 --> 07:35.855
all the meetings, all the
speculation, all the ways they
were running traps was more

07:35.855 --> 07:38.892
fantasy football than football.

07:38.892 --> 07:43.396
GLENN THRUSH: Yes, I think he
was really confined to a
relatively small group of
advisers. Shouldn't

07:43.396 --> 07:46.900
surprise folks who know the way
that Biden operates, a lot of
his family.

07:46.900 --> 07:52.472
His son Hunter, his remaining
son, was really pushing him for
this. Also, Mike Donilon,

07:52.472 --> 07:56.743
a longtime aide from Delaware,
was pushing this. But the rest
of the family was fairly

07:56.743 --> 08:01.781
ambivalent and his larger circle
of advisers were more
facilitating what he wanted to
do,

08:01.781 --> 08:04.117
but I think many of them over
time came to believe that he
ultimately wouldn't go for

08:04.117 --> 08:05.785
it.

08:05.785 --> 08:09.589
GWEN IFILL: Another thing that
you wrote in your earlier piece,
it talked about one of

08:09.589 --> 08:13.259
his friends and advisers saying
that in his career Joe Biden had
climbed almost all the

08:13.259 --> 08:15.995
way to the top, and then
someone moved the ladder.

08:15.995 --> 08:16.996
GLENN THRUSH: Can you imagine
what that must feel like?

08:16.996 --> 08:18.498
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.635
GLENN THRUSH: This is a guy who
has done everything -- quote,
unquote -- "right."

08:22.635 --> 08:29.142
The problem is, at some point,
he reached, I think, his own
ceiling. The 1988 presidential

08:29.142 --> 08:32.045
campaign, which was disastrous
for him, he was accused of
plagiarizing Neil Kinnock's

08:32.045 --> 08:33.113
speeches, a U.K. politician.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.749
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

08:35.749 --> 08:41.488
GLENN THRUSH: Really, I think
that was his moment. In 2008, he
ran a very bad presidential

08:41.488 --> 08:47.861
campaign. I think Biden is
really an example of, when a
politician has a moment and they

08:47.861 --> 08:53.333
cannot capitalize on that
moment, the rest of their career
really is a postscript.

08:53.333 --> 08:57.003
GWEN IFILL: What was the
significance of doing this in
the Rose Garden with not only
his

08:57.003 --> 08:59.139
wife, but President
Obama by his side?

08:59.139 --> 09:01.808
GLENN THRUSH: Well, the initial
significance for those of us who
were still wondering what

09:01.808 --> 09:03.643
was happening, we knew then he
was going to say no. He wasn't
going to say yes standing

09:03.643 --> 09:06.279
next to the president.

09:06.279 --> 09:10.884
But I think the significance is
that Joe Biden views himself as
both a family man, as symbolized

09:10.884 --> 09:14.921
by his wife -- getting Jill on
board was one of the big
challenges for this. And he
never

09:14.921 --> 09:18.758
really quite closed the
deal with his own wife.

09:18.758 --> 09:23.730
But the more important point
here is, he views himself very
much as a partner with President

09:23.730 --> 09:27.400
Obama, and that relationship,
which really had its ups an
downs in the first term, has

09:27.400 --> 09:29.903
really deepened into something
more personal. I have been
told...

09:29.903 --> 09:32.672
GWEN IFILL: He went out of his
way today to embrace that
legacy.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.908
GLENN THRUSH: Yes. And
apparently after this, they
embraced in the Oval Office. It
was sort

09:34.908 --> 09:37.877
of a tearful moment.

09:37.877 --> 09:44.117
And the president, I am told,
has been very, very concerned
about Biden's state of mind

09:44.117 --> 09:47.487
subsequent to Beau Biden's
death. This is something that
really weighs on everyone.

09:47.487 --> 09:50.123
GWEN IFILL: So he said today
the window had closed.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.425
Was it Hillary Clinton basically
who closed the window?

09:52.425 --> 09:57.630
GLENN THRUSH: I think she sort
of slammed it on his fingers.

09:57.630 --> 10:02.135
If Hillary Clinton had performed
badly in that first debate or
there had been more damaging

10:02.135 --> 10:04.871
revelations about the e-mails
that had come out, I think we
might be dealing with a
different

10:04.871 --> 10:08.541
fact set. But my sense
is that really did it.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.877
GWEN IFILL: And she went out of
her way, we can take a look, to
be very gracious in her

10:10.877 --> 10:13.780
response to him.

10:13.780 --> 10:17.116
She said, among other things:
"Joe Biden is a good man and a
great vice president. I'm

10:17.116 --> 10:21.087
confident that history isn't
finished with Joe Biden. As he
said today, there is more

10:21.087 --> 10:24.657
work to do, and if I know Joe,
he will always be on the front
lines, always fighting for

10:24.657 --> 10:27.527
all of us."

10:27.527 --> 10:30.763
Now, let's just talk polls. With
Joe Biden out of the race,
Hillary Clinton can afford

10:30.763 --> 10:32.499
to be as gracious as she is.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.734
GLENN THRUSH: Oh, absolutely.

10:34.734 --> 10:39.038
I think it is a good day. I'm
sure she had a nice cup of tea
and watched this thing several

10:39.038 --> 10:44.878
times. Look, in all of the polls
that we have seen, Biden takes
away from Hillary Clinton's

10:44.878 --> 10:49.682
support in battleground states
and nationally as well. So what
this means is that I think

10:49.682 --> 10:51.651
it's quite likely we are going
to see a bump in the national
polls and in New Hampshire

10:51.651 --> 10:55.154
and in Iowa for Hillary Clinton.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.291
GWEN IFILL: No Bernie Sanders
bump out of this? None of the
people who are supporting

10:58.291 --> 11:01.394
Bernie Sanders were
drawing toward Biden?

11:01.394 --> 11:06.933
GLENN THRUSH: Yes, Biden is a
fairly centrist -- you could
make the argument Joe Biden,

11:06.933 --> 11:08.535
in the longer span of his
career, has actually been more
conservative than Hillary
Clinton

11:08.535 --> 11:10.370
on a lot of things.

11:10.370 --> 11:14.407
He has tacked to the left, as
everyone in the Democratic Party
has recently, but Biden's

11:14.407 --> 11:20.380
affiliation is with the white
working-class voters. And Bernie
Sanders much more appeals

11:20.380 --> 11:23.883
to the sort of coastal elites. I
think Sanders will see a little
bit of a bump, because I'm

11:23.883 --> 11:26.986
sure some supporters will flock
to him. But I think Hillary
Clinton is the one who is

11:26.986 --> 11:29.322
going to be the
predominant recipient.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.958
GWEN IFILL: And, finally, the
vice president seemed to signal
today this is not the end

11:31.958 --> 11:34.961
of his career. He still
wants to be heard.

11:34.961 --> 11:38.398
Is there any history of a
second-term vice president who
is not running for president

11:38.398 --> 11:41.034
being heard after
finally withdrawing?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.902
GLENN THRUSH: I think you make a
very good point here. I think
his moment of maximum

11:42.902 --> 11:45.672
leverage has passed.

11:45.672 --> 11:50.043
I think the one thing that is
left is an endorsement. As we
know -- and I covered Hillary
Clinton

11:50.043 --> 11:54.714
in 2007 and 2008 -- there are a
lot of bumps left in this road,
and she will need to pull

11:54.714 --> 11:58.084
some endorsements out of her
pocket during times of need. I
think the final card that

11:58.084 --> 12:00.486
he has to play is
an endorsement.

12:00.486 --> 12:02.589
GWEN IFILL: Well, we will be all
waiting for that, that it will
have a huge impact, perhaps,

12:02.589 --> 12:05.124
perhaps not.

12:05.124 --> 12:11.864
That's the thing we like about
campaigns, Glenn Thrush of
Politico. Thank you very much.

12:11.864 --> 12:18.438
GLENN THRUSH: Great being here.

12:18.438 --> 12:24.210
JUDY WOODRUFF: From a decision
made to another one pending.

12:24.210 --> 12:29.282
Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan
has told his fellow Republicans
that he is willing to serve

12:29.282 --> 12:33.119
as speaker of the House of
Representatives, but only if
divided groups of conservatives

12:33.119 --> 12:36.255
endorse him first.

12:36.255 --> 12:41.127
Political director Lisa
Desjardins reports on a busy day
in the search for a leader.

12:41.127 --> 12:44.597
LISA DESJARDINS: The could-be
speaker laid out his demands
Tuesday night: unified party

12:44.597 --> 12:47.467
backing and family time.

12:47.467 --> 12:51.504
REP. PAUL RYAN (R), Wisconsin: I
have shown my colleagues what I
think success looks like,

12:51.504 --> 12:55.942
what I think it takes to unify
and leads and how my family
commitments comes first. I have

12:55.942 --> 12:59.212
left this decision
in their hands.

12:59.212 --> 13:05.318
LISA DESJARDINS: Paul Ryan's
clear ultimatum landed in a
packed, wild Capitol this
morning.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.655
Reporters surrounded lawmakers
in the conservative House
Freedom Caucus, the rebellious
group

13:08.655 --> 13:12.592
that Ryan says must
sign on for him to run.

13:12.592 --> 13:16.229
But members like Alabama's Mo
Brooks were cool to the idea.

13:16.229 --> 13:20.500
REP. MO BROOKS (R), Alabama: I
don't think there is any
question that a significant
number

13:20.500 --> 13:27.340
of members of the Republican
Conference have coerced,
cajoled, induced Paul Ryan to
run

13:27.340 --> 13:30.076
for speaker of the House when
he doesn't want that job.

13:30.076 --> 13:34.080
LISA DESJARDINS: Idaho's Raul
Labrador is another Freedom
Caucus member.

13:34.080 --> 13:33.479
REP. RAUL LABRADOR (R), Idaho:
There's a lot of people who can
do it. Jason Chaffetz would

13:33.479 --> 13:36.516
be a very good speaker
of the House.

13:36.516 --> 13:41.621
LISA DESJARDINS: While many
members avoided questions and
sought out the elevators,
current

13:41.621 --> 13:45.124
Speaker John Boehner pushed
for stability and Ryan.

13:45.124 --> 13:48.361
REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH),
Speaker of the House: Listen, I
think Paul is going to get the
support

13:48.361 --> 13:54.567
that he is looking for. I
thought he laid out a very clear
vision for how he would run

13:54.567 --> 13:57.937
the speakership. And I thought
the members responded very well
to it.

13:57.937 --> 14:01.441
LISA DESJARDINS: Moderate Peter
King of New York was less sure
that Ryan would get enough

14:01.441 --> 14:04.010
support, and therefore
more worried.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.378
REP. PETER KING (R), New York: I
don't see who else it could be.
If it's not Paul Ryan,

14:05.378 --> 14:07.980
then I think it's a disaster.

14:07.980 --> 14:11.484
LISA DESJARDINS: Already, some
outside conservatives are on the
attack. A group called the Tea

14:11.484 --> 14:17.590
Party Patriots released a video
highlighting Ryan's support of
the 2008 stimulus bill.

14:17.590 --> 14:20.893
REP. PAUL RYAN: This bill
offends my principles, but I'm
going to vote for this bill in
order

14:20.893 --> 14:23.996
to preserve my principles.

14:23.996 --> 14:29.035
LISA DESJARDINS: That underlines
the divide for Republicans, who
face a Friday deadline

14:29.035 --> 14:33.272
set by Ryan. The Wisconsin
representative is using his
leverage to see if he can take

14:33.272 --> 14:37.043
command without becoming
a political casualty.

14:37.043 --> 14:41.447
REP. PAUL RYAN: What I told
members is, if you can agree to
these requests, and if I

14:41.447 --> 14:47.120
can truly be a unifying figure,
then I will gladly serve.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.491
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa
joins us from the Capitol.

14:51.491 --> 14:55.862
So, Lisa, this doesn't sound
like a done deal. It's nightfall
there. What are you hearing?

14:55.862 --> 14:57.997
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

14:57.997 --> 15:02.168
The members of the House Freedom
Caucus just got out of a meeting
with Paul Ryan. Congressman

15:02.168 --> 15:05.671
Ryan had very little to say, but
he told our Quinn Bowman, our
producer here, the meeting

15:05.671 --> 15:09.075
went well. He said it was a
nice meeting. But that's it.

15:09.075 --> 15:13.312
We did get more information from
the Freedom Caucus members, and
I think you put it the

15:13.312 --> 15:18.184
best way there, that this is
still up in the air, Judy. They
are going to meet again later

15:18.184 --> 15:21.754
tonight. They may vote tonight
and that vote may be the most
significant part of this fight

15:21.754 --> 15:24.924
this week. The vote could
be tomorrow as well.

15:24.924 --> 15:29.095
But the reason that vote is very
difficult for Mr. Ryan is that
the House of Freedom

15:29.095 --> 15:33.399
Caucus has their own internal
rules, Judy, where they will
only support a candidate if

15:33.399 --> 15:38.905
80 percent of their members
agree to do so. You are talking
then about 80 percent of the

15:38.905 --> 15:43.176
most conservative members of the
House of Representatives, the
members who wanted John

15:43.176 --> 15:46.579
Boehner out and some of whom are
pretty openly saying they are
not so sure about Paul Ryan

15:46.579 --> 15:48.614
either.

15:48.614 --> 15:54.020
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know the
rest of the Republican
membership in the House of
Representatives

15:54.020 --> 15:59.859
supports Paul Ryan, but how
influential is anybody in the
outside with these Freedom

15:59.859 --> 16:04.397
Caucus members? I mean, who do
they listen to? Who can
influence them?

16:04.397 --> 16:09.202
LISA DESJARDINS: I think these
are members who listen most of
all to their core constituency.

16:09.202 --> 16:13.139
But that does include not just
the voters in their districts,
who do skew very conservative.,

16:13.139 --> 16:16.075
that is why they have been
elected, but who also -- they
also listen to, say,
conservative

16:16.075 --> 16:19.412
talk radio and the Tea Party.

16:19.412 --> 16:23.816
As we put in the package, some
Tea Party groups have already
come out against Paul Ryan
today.

16:23.816 --> 16:28.721
And that's something that is a
factor in these members'
decisions the next couple of
days.

16:28.721 --> 16:32.625
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa, you were
telling me just a few minutes
ago that there is now some
discussion

16:32.625 --> 16:37.597
about trying to deal with
raising the debt ceiling before
there's a vote on a new speaker.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.166
What about that?

16:40.166 --> 16:43.536
LISA DESJARDINS: This is a very
tricky game of chess happening
right now. Not only is

16:43.536 --> 16:46.405
the House trying to bring in a
new leader, but they're also
trying to manage three different

16:46.405 --> 16:50.009
crises coming soon.

16:50.009 --> 16:55.214
And speaking to a top Republican
aide in leadership currently
told me tonight that they would

16:55.214 --> 17:01.220
like to pass an increase in the
debt ceiling before there is a
new speaker, before next

17:01.220 --> 17:06.525
week's vote, which may include
Mr. Ryan. And that vote, Judy,
on the debt ceiling could

17:06.525 --> 17:10.596
come as soon as this week. It's
something that those in power
now in the House want

17:10.596 --> 17:14.767
to do before any new
speaker comes into power.

17:14.767 --> 17:17.436
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we also know
it's something the members of
the Freedom Caucus, most
conservative

17:17.436 --> 17:18.738
members, presumably,
wouldn't want.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.607
LISA DESJARDINS:
Yes, that's right.

17:21.607 --> 17:25.411
And here is where you get into
the complexity of this
situation. The House Freedom
Caucus

17:25.411 --> 17:31.284
realizes that they don't have
potentially another viable
candidate outside of Paul Ryan,

17:31.284 --> 17:35.454
but at the same time, they're
trying to get, I think, as much
out of the situation as they

17:35.454 --> 17:40.660
can, trying to get as many
guarantees as they can from him
about their own agenda.

17:40.660 --> 17:46.599
And that includes trying to get
as many concessions from
Democrats on the debt ceiling.
So it's

17:46.599 --> 17:50.836
complicated. The debt ceiling
might be a factor here in their
discussions with Mr. Ryan, but,

17:50.836 --> 17:54.307
moreover, they're questioning
whether they think he will
actually change things in the

17:54.307 --> 17:58.778
House. One congressman, Raul
Labrador, said to me and other
reporters, you know, we all

17:58.778 --> 18:02.448
like Paul Ryan, but this isn't
about personality. We're just
not sure he can change things
because

18:02.448 --> 18:05.518
he hasn't changed things
yet in the House.

18:05.518 --> 18:09.889
You follow that line of
thinking, if you are outside of
that conservative caucus, Judy,

18:09.889 --> 18:13.559
and it still doesn't make it
clear what the endgame is. I
think tonight could be an
important

18:13.559 --> 18:17.163
night. We will see what the
Freedom Caucus does. And, of
course, Friday is the deadline

18:17.163 --> 18:22.068
that Mr. Ryan set as to whether
he will be viable to run for
speaker.

18:22.068 --> 18:26.939
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins
watching it all very closely at
the Capitol, thank you.

18:26.939 --> 18:36.482
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you.

18:36.482 --> 18:44.256
GWEN IFILL: As winter approaches
across Europe, migrants and
refugees desperate to enter the

18:44.256 --> 18:47.360
E.U. face even
bigger challenges.

18:47.360 --> 18:51.163
Hari Sreenivasan
reports from Greece.

18:51.163 --> 18:56.502
HARI SREENIVASAN: Billowing
smoke signified the latest
threat to the thousands crossing

18:56.502 --> 19:01.607
Southern Europe: fire. It
erupted at a camp along
Slovenia's border with Croatia
and jumped

19:01.607 --> 19:05.444
from tent to tent, likely
sparked by bonfires, as migrants
struggled to keep warm. There

19:05.444 --> 19:08.881
was no word of casualties.

19:08.881 --> 19:13.686
The camp is one of many that
Slovenia has filled to capacity
since thousands began arriving

19:13.686 --> 19:19.325
from Croatia over the weekend. A
number of people in the camp had
just arrived after

19:19.325 --> 19:25.231
a brutal 24 hours. During the
night, a train from Croatia
released them near the frontier.

19:25.231 --> 19:31.737
Then, in near-freezing
temperatures, they were forced
to wade across a river.

19:31.737 --> 19:41.380
MAN: It was very cold. It was a
very big -- after that, we
decided to come in here. We need

19:41.380 --> 19:44.884
help. We need dress.
We need food.

19:44.884 --> 19:49.388
HARI SREENIVASAN: After the
fire, many in the camp were
taken away on buses headed north

19:49.388 --> 19:54.360
to Austria. Elsewhere today,
hundreds waited in fields
guarded by Slovenian authorities

19:54.360 --> 19:57.063
waiting to be told
where to go next.

19:57.063 --> 20:01.467
MAN: I do not think it's Europe
like this, but when I come to
here, so difficult. I'm

20:01.467 --> 20:05.671
sorry for Europe. Europe is sad.

20:05.671 --> 20:09.742
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Slovenes
have appealed to the European
Union for help. And early

20:09.742 --> 20:12.244
today, their Parliament
authorized a greater role for
the army, guarding the border
with

20:12.244 --> 20:15.714
Croatia.

20:15.714 --> 20:19.652
Thousands more migrants have
trekked through Greece and
Macedonia to Serbia, where
they're

20:19.652 --> 20:24.623
pressing to continue their own
journeys into Western Europe.
Overnight, some 3,500 spent

20:24.623 --> 20:29.195
the night in the freezing cold
at the Serbian-Croatian border
after Croatian officials closed
the

20:29.195 --> 20:31.330
gates.

20:31.330 --> 20:38.737
WOMAN: The situation is very
challenging. The people were
here all the night. They spend

20:38.737 --> 20:45.211
all the night, because the
border was temporarily closed,
that such a capacity was very
slow.

20:45.211 --> 20:50.983
So, many families with children,
elderly people, people with
disability were spending the
night

20:50.983 --> 20:52.952
here.

20:52.952 --> 20:57.890
HARI SREENIVASAN: Scuffles broke
out as the frustration of
waiting proved too much for

20:57.890 --> 21:02.328
some. As before, others took
matters into their own hands,
crossing fields and orchards

21:02.328 --> 21:05.898
at dawn, evading police
where they could.

21:05.898 --> 21:09.468
Meanwhile, in Vienna, the head
of Croatia's police met with his
counterparts from Hungary,

21:09.468 --> 21:12.004
Slovenia and Austria.

21:12.004 --> 21:16.675
VLADO DOMINIC, Croatian Police
Director (through translator):
The daily influx from Macedonia

21:16.675 --> 21:21.247
and Serbia into Croatia is about
10,000 migrants. They are
transferred every day towards
the

21:21.247 --> 21:25.851
Slovenian border, and Slovenia
moves them towards Austria. We
must stem the migrant

21:25.851 --> 21:29.822
crisis as soon as possible, so
that we reduce the number of
migrants arriving to Europe.

21:29.822 --> 21:33.526
HARI SREENIVASAN: To that end,
the president of the European
Commission called a Sunday

21:33.526 --> 21:39.632
summit of the Balkan states and
others. But the human surge
showed no signs of abating.

21:39.632 --> 21:44.003
In Greece, three giant ferries a
day are bring refugees to
Athens' main port from the Greek

21:44.003 --> 21:46.705
islands where they land.

21:46.705 --> 21:51.710
This ship, which arrived just
before dawn, carried roughly
2,000 people, most of them

21:51.710 --> 21:56.182
headed on to buses to take them
north. By now, though, some like
Mohammad Ghunaim, a

21:56.182 --> 21:59.118
Syrian medical student, have
tempered their enthusiasm.

21:59.118 --> 22:02.555
MOHAMMAD GHUNAIM, Syrian Medical
Student: Very happy and excited,
but I have to make

22:02.555 --> 22:08.961
my own plan. I have to make my
own future right now. Europe is
not a big dream. You

22:08.961 --> 22:12.097
will make your dream. It's like
the American dream. How -- the
American dream, you will

22:12.097 --> 22:14.333
make your dream.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.736
HARI SREENIVASAN: Many more were
following that dream across the
Aegean Sea from Turkey

22:17.736 --> 22:20.839
today, despite the
mounting hardships.

22:20.839 --> 22:27.112
More than 500 people survived
heavy rains and thundershowers
to get to the island of

22:27.112 --> 22:31.951
Lesbos on their flimsy boats
today. When they got there,
there wasn't enough shelter.
Volunteers

22:31.951 --> 22:36.522
had already run out of rain
covers, leaving children
standing in the rain. These
migrants

22:36.522 --> 22:40.593
and refugees understand that the
weather will certainly get
worse.

22:40.593 --> 22:44.196
They're also starting to get
concerned about the climate, the
uncertain climate toward

22:44.196 --> 22:47.166
migrants across much
of the European Union.

22:47.166 --> 22:52.905
In Athens, for the "PBS
NewsHour," Hari Sreenivasan.

22:52.905 --> 23:02.715
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:02.715 --> 23:08.687
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what to know before Hillary
Clinton testifies on Benghazi;

23:08.687 --> 23:16.028
the search for clues to the
causes of autism; and finding
inspiration in the natural
world.

23:16.028 --> 23:19.965
But first to the latest in
our Broken Justice series.

23:19.965 --> 23:24.536
We have done a number of stories
about calls for reform from
voices across the spectrum.

23:24.536 --> 23:29.608
Tonight, we hear a new call from
top law enforcement officials
themselves.

23:29.608 --> 23:36.282
Today, more than 130 of them,
including police chiefs and
prosecutors, came to Washington

23:36.282 --> 23:42.154
to push for changes to
incarceration and policing
practices. One of the key
reforms they want

23:42.154 --> 23:48.027
to see, reducing or eliminating
prison time for nonviolent
offenses and some drug
possession

23:48.027 --> 23:50.763
charges.

23:50.763 --> 23:55.834
Garry McCarthy is the
superintendent of the Chicago
Police Department. He's co-chair
of

23:55.834 --> 24:01.073
this coalition. And Benjamin
David is the district attorney
for New Hanover and Pender

24:01.073 --> 24:03.942
Counties in Eastern
North Carolina.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.811
And welcome to both of you.

24:05.811 --> 24:06.712
GARRY MCCARTHY, Chicago Police
Superintendent: Thanks for
having us.

24:06.712 --> 24:09.515
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
Superintendent McCarthy, let me
start with you.

24:09.515 --> 24:13.686
You said today -- among other
things, you said, we incarcerate
the wrong people. We

24:13.686 --> 24:16.355
measure the wrong things when it
comes to the criminal justice
system. What are you

24:16.355 --> 24:18.490
referring to?

24:18.490 --> 24:23.896
GARRY MCCARTHY: I'm referring to
the fact that the violent
offenders, repeat offenders

24:23.896 --> 24:29.968
are too frequently on our
streets causing problems. About
two months ago, I came down

24:29.968 --> 24:34.740
to D.C. again with about 30
different jurisdictions across
the country that all have
increases

24:34.740 --> 24:37.676
in violent crime this year.

24:37.676 --> 24:42.214
And the one commonality that we
had, repeat offenders over and
over again. So, there are

24:42.214 --> 24:46.819
some people who, I'm sorry, do
not deserve to be out in our
society. They're dangerous.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.621
There are other people that
can actually be reformed.

24:49.621 --> 24:54.893
And what we find over and over
again is the low-level narcotics
offender is sometimes

24:54.893 --> 24:59.965
incarcerated at a greater rate
than the violent criminal. In
Cook County -- in Chicago, which

24:59.965 --> 25:06.905
is in Cook County, 28 percent of
the inmates who are incarcerated
in Cook County Jail are

25:06.905 --> 25:12.811
there for narcotics-related
offenses, yet less than 4
percent are there for gun
possession.

25:12.811 --> 25:15.481
And these are folks with violent
criminal histories. That's
causing a danger in our

25:15.481 --> 25:17.516
streets.

25:17.516 --> 25:23.155
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, District
Attorney David, what is an
example of an offense that -- we

25:23.155 --> 25:27.793
just heard it has to do with
narcotics, for example. So, if
somebody is carrying around

25:27.793 --> 25:31.397
a small amount of heroin or
cocaine, they shouldn't be
arrested? What should happen

25:31.397 --> 25:33.132
to them?

25:33.132 --> 25:33.132
BENJAMIN DAVID, District
Attorney, New Hanover and Pender
Counties, North Carolina: No,
they

25:33.132 --> 25:37.836
should be arrested, but to be
clear, justice reinvestment in
North Carolina, where I serve

25:37.836 --> 25:42.775
as the district attorney, we
make it mandatory that they are
going to receive probation for

25:42.775 --> 25:47.212
a drug possession case, and to
have the opportunity for a
deferred prosecution.

25:47.212 --> 25:52.017
We went one step further and
also made it where you could
expunge the nonviolent criminal

25:52.017 --> 25:55.954
history of a felon or someone
with a misdemeanor for that
one-time offense, so that they
could

25:55.954 --> 26:00.859
stay eligible for things like
public housing, student loans,
military service, and they

26:00.859 --> 26:03.128
don't have that scarlet letter
on them when they are trying to
get a job, because that

26:03.128 --> 26:05.864
is really what we
are talking about.

26:05.864 --> 26:10.869
The second that we put them into
the system, they're on a
different statistical path.

26:10.869 --> 26:15.107
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you
saying, in effect,
Superintendent McCarthy, that
somebody who

26:15.107 --> 26:19.812
is out there who has -- say they
have an open container of
alcohol or, as you know, we
mentioned

26:19.812 --> 26:24.450
carrying around drugs, you are
assuming that that is not on the
pathway to committing more

26:24.450 --> 26:26.051
violent offenses?

26:26.051 --> 26:29.221
GARRY MCCARTHY: Well, you know,
I'm not going to make that leap.

26:29.221 --> 26:34.993
But what I can tell you is that
there are people who have
violent criminal histories

26:34.993 --> 26:41.900
that need to be incarcerated.
And those individuals who don't
may not be -- may not need to be

26:41.900 --> 26:45.938
incarcerated. Different
prosecution, different method of
dealing with it. It doesn't mean

26:45.938 --> 26:48.006
we're not going to
make the arrest.

26:48.006 --> 26:52.277
But what happens once that
arrest is made, when that
individual goes into the system?

26:52.277 --> 26:57.249
Can they get deferred from
prosecution into drug treatment
programs or something along

26:57.249 --> 27:01.987
those lines? There is a
difference between carrying a
gun, an illegal gun, and getting

27:01.987 --> 27:06.225
caught with some heroin, a
total difference there.

27:06.225 --> 27:10.762
JUDY WOODRUFF: I understand
that. But I still want to just
clarify this. So, are you
saying,

27:10.762 --> 27:17.436
both of you saying, District
Attorney David, that, for
example, that all those years of

27:17.436 --> 27:25.377
arguing just say no, that drugs
-- stay away from drugs, that
they are a pathway to getting

27:25.377 --> 27:29.214
addicted to heroin, that all
those messages were the wrong
messages?

27:29.214 --> 27:32.484
BENJAMIN DAVID: No, I don't say
that at all. I still say stay
away from drugs. It brings

27:32.484 --> 27:35.187
the wolf to the door. It feeds
all the violence in our
communities right now. It's the
very

27:35.187 --> 27:38.156
gasoline for the
engine of crime.

27:38.156 --> 27:43.896
What we are really saying is
that we need to have the right
people in custody. And mentally

27:43.896 --> 27:48.534
ill drug addicts are not who we
want to clog up the prisons and
the jails with. It is a

27:48.534 --> 27:51.036
scarce resource when are you
talking about those beds. And we
want to put the career

27:51.036 --> 27:54.506
and violent criminals
in those places.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.776
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this is going
to be an expensive, more
expensive approach, isn't

27:57.776 --> 28:01.647
it, Superintendent McCarthy? You
are going to require people with
experience in handling

28:01.647 --> 28:05.484
people with drug addiction,
giving people therapy.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.253
GARRY MCCARTHY: Right.

28:08.253 --> 28:12.090
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're going to
require -- it's going to require
more people, more man-hours,

28:12.090 --> 28:14.326
woman-hours to deal with this.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.262
GARRY MCCARTHY: I don't believe
so. I don't believe so, because,
if you think about it,

28:17.262 --> 28:24.603
we're not changing the behavior
of the drug-addicted individual
by incarcerating them. We may
change

28:24.603 --> 28:29.107
behavior of the gun carrier by
incarcerating them, because he's
not addicted to the gun

28:29.107 --> 28:31.977
like the heroin user might
be addicted to the heroin.

28:31.977 --> 28:37.649
It is the wrong medicine for
what ails us. If we -- we want
to correct the behavior,

28:37.649 --> 28:42.220
the way you correct the behavior
of a drug user is to get them
drug treatment, not
incarcerating

28:42.220 --> 28:46.725
them. The way that you change
the behavior of a bad guy who
carries a gun, you put them

28:46.725 --> 28:49.561
in jail. This prevents them from
committing another crime while
he is in there and maybe

28:49.561 --> 28:52.097
he won't do it again
when he comes out.

28:52.097 --> 28:56.501
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is involved,
Mr. David, in changing the laws
to make this happen,

28:56.501 --> 28:58.236
what you are describing?

28:58.236 --> 29:01.440
BENJAMIN DAVID: Well, first of
all, it is outreach efforts and
understanding, first

29:01.440 --> 29:04.743
and foremost, who we are really
talking about now, with the
biggest victims of violent crime

29:04.743 --> 29:07.846
are also from the same
high-crime neighborhoods.

29:07.846 --> 29:12.184
And when you have a business
model where 98 percent of the
people we are putting in prison

29:12.184 --> 29:16.822
are getting out, and they're not
getting out better, and 66
percent of them are back in

29:16.822 --> 29:20.892
that prison cell within three
years charged with new offenses,
what we're doing is not

29:20.892 --> 29:24.329
protecting the community
in the way that we can.

29:24.329 --> 29:28.000
And so what we really have to do
is, when you are talking about
funding, we're going

29:28.000 --> 29:31.903
to save money by closing some
prisons and not having to build
other ones. That is the

29:31.903 --> 29:37.809
North Carolina experience. But
we are going to use that money,
reinvest it into drug treatment,

29:37.809 --> 29:41.179
into mental health reform, into
having some of the things that
we can do to divert these

29:41.179 --> 29:44.316
cases out of the
criminal justice system.

29:44.316 --> 29:50.255
It involves not only government,
but the business community,
getting people jobs, and getting

29:50.255 --> 29:55.027
schools to stop the
school-to-prison pipeline we
could talk about. There are so
many people

29:55.027 --> 29:57.462
in a community other than law
enforcement, because this is
bigger than police and
prosecutors

29:57.462 --> 29:59.865
can handle on their own.

29:59.865 --> 30:03.835
JUDY WOODRUFF: And one other
philosophy, I guess, that has
been behind us, Superintendent

30:03.835 --> 30:07.339
McCarthy, and that's the
so-called broken windows
approach, going after people who
have

30:07.339 --> 30:13.211
committed minor offenses because
you are afraid they are going to
do something worse.

30:13.211 --> 30:16.248
Is that saying that whole
approach was the wrong approach?

30:16.248 --> 30:21.286
GARRY MCCARTHY: No, not -- the
same issue. It's not that we're
not going to address those

30:21.286 --> 30:25.390
conditions. As a matter of fact,
broken windows is the number one
complaint at our community

30:25.390 --> 30:29.261
meetings from the people
who live in the community.

30:29.261 --> 30:34.032
They want us to address those
low-level issues. The question
is, how is it that we address

30:34.032 --> 30:39.337
them? If we were putting people
in prison for 20 years for
public consumption of alcohol,

30:39.337 --> 30:42.441
that law would change very
quickly. But what we are doing
is, we are putting people in

30:42.441 --> 30:47.279
prison for extended sentences
for low-level amounts of
narcotics.

30:47.279 --> 30:51.983
And that just doesn't work. You
can issue somebody a ticket for
drinking a beer in public

30:51.983 --> 30:56.354
vs. arresting them. You can also
take that drug user and divert
them into a program,

30:56.354 --> 30:59.157
instead of incarcerating them.

30:59.157 --> 31:03.662
JUDY WOODRUFF: Superintendent
Garry McCarthy from Chicago and
District Attorney Ben David

31:03.662 --> 31:05.063
from North Carolina,
we thank you both.

31:05.063 --> 31:05.964
BENJAMIN DAVID: Thank you.

31:05.964 --> 31:08.066
GARRY MCCARTHY:
Pleasure. Thank you.

31:08.066 --> 31:12.738
JUDY WOODRUFF: We recorded that
interview late this afternoon.
And I also asked Superintendent

31:12.738 --> 31:18.610
McCarthy about recently
published allegations of a
pattern of abuse at a police
detention

31:18.610 --> 31:23.281
center in Chicago. He says those
allegations are false. You can
watch his comments online

31:23.281 --> 31:32.357
on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

31:32.357 --> 31:45.237
GWEN IFILL: The 2012 attack on
the U.S. Consulate and CIA
compound in Benghazi, Libya, has
sparked

31:45.237 --> 31:50.675
a firestorm of recrimination and
accusation, touching on policy
and politics.

31:50.675 --> 31:55.180
As former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton prepares to
testify before a congressional

31:55.180 --> 31:58.483
committee about the attacks
tomorrow, chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret Warner

31:58.483 --> 32:02.687
catches us up on the
facts of the case.

32:02.687 --> 32:08.326
MARGARET WARNER: This fiery
scene at the U.S. Consulate in
Benghazi, Libya, took place
three

32:08.326 --> 32:13.565
years ago, but it sparked a
political war of words that's
still being fought.

32:13.565 --> 32:19.304
Thirteen months after the fall
of dictator Moammar Gadhafi,
Benghazi was lawless and

32:19.304 --> 32:26.111
awash with guns. The U.S.
mission was protected by one
local militia and unarmed
contractor

32:26.111 --> 32:31.950
guards. On the anniversary of
9/11, around 9:40 p.m., heavily
armed men stormed the compound,

32:31.950 --> 32:36.121
opening fire and torching
some of its buildings.

32:36.121 --> 32:42.427
Hours later, a CIA annex less
than a mile away came under
mortar attack. U.S. Ambassador

32:42.427 --> 32:47.532
Christopher Stevens died in the
main compound, along with
Foreign Service officer Sean
Smith,

32:47.532 --> 32:52.971
apparently of smoke inhalation.
Two contractors, ex-Navy SEALs
Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty,

32:52.971 --> 32:56.141
died at the annex.

32:56.141 --> 33:01.746
Then-Defense Secretary Leon
Panetta said U.S. commanders had
no intelligence that an attack

33:01.746 --> 33:06.751
was coming on the Benghazi
mission, and U.S. forces were
too far away to help when it
did.

33:06.751 --> 33:10.622
LEON PANETTA, Former U.S.
Defense Secretary: Frankly,
without an adequate warning,
there

33:10.622 --> 33:17.629
wasn't enough time, given the
speed of the attack, for armed
military assets to respond.

33:17.629 --> 33:21.833
MARGARET WARNER: In the
aftermath, the military did
deploy elite teams of U.S.
Marines from

33:21.833 --> 33:28.673
Rota, Spain, one to Benghazi to
evacuate personnel, the other to
fortify the U.S. Embassy in
Tripoli.

33:28.673 --> 33:34.646
The Benghazi assault followed
anti-U.S. protests that day in a
half-dozen Islamic countries.

33:34.646 --> 33:38.850
In Cairo, a mob breached the
walls of the heavily-fortified
U.S. Embassy, tearing down

33:38.850 --> 33:43.421
the U.S. flag. No
Americans were harmed.

33:43.421 --> 33:49.461
All those protests were against
an American citizen's online
movie mocking the Prophet

33:49.461 --> 33:54.099
Mohammed. Five days later, on
the Sunday talk shows, then-U.N.
Ambassador Susan Rice pointed

33:54.099 --> 33:56.067
to a linkage.

33:56.067 --> 33:58.770
SUSAN RICE, U.S. National
Security Adviser: What this
began as was a spontaneous, not

33:58.770 --> 34:03.441
a premeditated, response to
what had transpired in Cairo.

34:03.441 --> 34:07.312
MARGARET WARNER: But Republicans
charged the White House knew
almost immediately Benghazi

34:07.312 --> 34:13.551
was a terror attack, and
concealed it to protect
President Obama's reelection
campaign.

34:13.551 --> 34:18.023
The administration insisted
Ambassador Rice was speaking
from the best information
available

34:18.023 --> 34:22.694
at the time. Four months later,
then-Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton took on Senate
Republicans

34:22.694 --> 34:24.763
at a hearing.

34:24.763 --> 34:27.465
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: The fact
is, we had four dead Americans.
Was

34:27.465 --> 34:31.536
it because of a protest or was
it because of guys out for a
walk one night who decided

34:31.536 --> 34:37.442
they would go kill some
Americans? What difference at
this point does this make? It is
our job

34:37.442 --> 34:42.580
to figure out what happened and
do everything we can to prevent
it from ever happening again.

34:42.580 --> 34:46.985
MARGARET WARNER: The incident
launched parallel investigations
by the FBI, the State
Department,

34:46.985 --> 34:52.490
and Congress to do just that.
One was by an independent
accountability review board
appointed

34:52.490 --> 34:57.729
by Secretary Clinton and headed
by retired former Ambassador
Thomas Pickering.

34:57.729 --> 35:03.268
That December, it issued a
stinging report on what happened
that night. And it called

35:03.268 --> 35:07.639
the consulate's security posture
inadequate for Benghazi and
grossly inadequate to deal

35:07.639 --> 35:09.874
with the attack.

35:09.874 --> 35:13.345
THOMAS PICKERING, Former U.S.
Ambassador to the United
Nations: It was deficient in
security

35:13.345 --> 35:19.050
supplies. It was probably
deficient in the security
manning of the post.

35:19.050 --> 35:25.657
There were ongoing security
problems in Benghazi, which we
felt should have alerted the
department

35:25.657 --> 35:31.229
to deal with those issues. Many
of the questions presented to
the department were answered

35:31.229 --> 35:35.300
in the negative, when they
probably should have been
positively responded to.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.402
MARGARET WARNER: And are you
saying there were requests for
additional security there

35:37.402 --> 35:39.604
and they were denied?

35:39.604 --> 35:42.941
THOMAS PICKERING: There was an
ongoing request for additional
security, and a number of them

35:42.941 --> 35:48.480
were not responded to
properly and positively, yes.

35:48.480 --> 35:53.018
MARGARET WARNER: The Pickering
review cited -- quote --
"systemic failures and
leadership

35:53.018 --> 35:58.857
and management deficiencies at
the State Department, a
consulate that was severely
under-resourced

35:58.857 --> 36:04.562
with regard to certain needed
security equipment, and a
short-term staff rotation that
resulted

36:04.562 --> 36:10.301
in diminished institutional
knowledge, continuity and
mission capacity."

36:10.301 --> 36:13.772
Pickering said the review board
closely examined whether the
U.S. military could have
scrambled

36:13.772 --> 36:17.175
forces elsewhere to
the attack site.

36:17.175 --> 36:22.914
THOMAS PICKERING: And it was
very clear to us that the
nearest assistance was called

36:22.914 --> 36:30.221
upon right away, but the
requirement to mobilize aircraft
and move those Marines in Spain
wasn't

36:30.221 --> 36:32.991
sufficient to get
it there in time.

36:32.991 --> 36:36.327
MARGARET WARNER: Three State
Department officials resigned
immediately after that report.
The

36:36.327 --> 36:39.364
report didn't fault
Secretary Clinton.

36:39.364 --> 36:43.468
Did you try to follow the chain
of command, as it were, the
chain of responsibility all

36:43.468 --> 36:44.602
the way to the top?

36:44.602 --> 36:46.171
THOMAS PICKERING: Absolutely.

36:46.171 --> 36:49.607
MARGARET WARNER: So, did it ever
go to the secretary of state?

36:49.607 --> 36:52.744
THOMAS PICKERING: I had no
indication that any of these
decisions went to the secretary

36:52.744 --> 36:54.846
of state.

36:54.846 --> 36:58.817
MARGARET WARNER: And do these
decisions usually go to the
secretary of state?

36:58.817 --> 37:01.686
THOMAS PICKERING: No, they
wouldn't normally go to the
secretary of state. These were
decisions

37:01.686 --> 37:06.624
about should we provide X-kind
of money to build a wall?

37:06.624 --> 37:11.629
MARGARET WARNER: Meanwhile, the
man charged as a ringleader of
the Benghazi attacks, Ahmed

37:11.629 --> 37:15.366
Abu Khattala, faces a federal
trial in Washington after being
captured by U.S. special forces

37:15.366 --> 37:17.702
last year.

37:17.702 --> 37:25.310
I'm Margaret Warner for the
"PBS NewsHour" in Washington.

37:25.310 --> 37:39.057
JUDY WOODRUFF: One in every 68
children in the U.S. is
diagnosed as being on the autism

37:39.057 --> 37:45.430
spectrum. It's long been known
that genetics plays a role in
the neurodevelopmental disorder.

37:45.430 --> 37:51.936
Now scientists believe they have
the tools to identify which gene
variants trigger autism

37:51.936 --> 37:58.176
and with that information
diagnose and treat it much
earlier. A project called MSSNG
has

37:58.176 --> 38:02.747
brought together an unusual
partnership and is giving hope
to affected families.

38:02.747 --> 38:04.849
Special correspondent
Jackie Judd reports.

38:04.849 --> 38:07.519
WOMAN: What's the
highest you can go?

38:07.519 --> 38:11.890
JACKIE JUDD: In the cloud, he is
known only by eight digits,
attached to a map of his

38:11.890 --> 38:12.490
DNA.

38:12.490 --> 38:15.360
WOMAN: Oh, you can go high.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.531
JACKIE JUDD: On the ground, at
his home outside of Toronto,
Jonathan Wilson is known as a

38:19.531 --> 38:23.234
bright and sometimes
aggressive 14-year old.

38:23.234 --> 38:26.004
LISA WILSON, Mother of Jonathan
Wilson: From day one -- and,
literally, I mean day one

38:26.004 --> 38:29.741
-- he was very different
from my other newborns.

38:29.741 --> 38:33.444
BLAIR WILSON, Father of Jonathan
Wilson: I remember, with the
other children, I would

38:33.444 --> 38:37.849
hold them over my shoulder and
cuddle with them. And John would
just arch his back, wouldn't

38:37.849 --> 38:41.553
want to be -- wouldn't
want to be held.

38:41.553 --> 38:48.059
JACKIE JUDD: It wasn't until
Jonathan was almost 3 that he
was diagnosed with autism.

38:48.059 --> 38:52.497
That was based on what doctors
could observe, his behavior and
the absence of typical
developmental

38:52.497 --> 38:54.365
milestones.

38:54.365 --> 38:59.737
JONATHAN WILSON, Autistic: It's
hard for me to know when to
speak, hard to communicate.

38:59.737 --> 39:01.639
BLAIR WILSON: Watch
where you're shooting.

39:01.639 --> 39:06.911
JACKIE JUDD: But it was only
recently that Lisa and Blair
Wilson learned, with great

39:06.911 --> 39:14.519
precision, why their son is
autistic: a spontaneous genetic
mutation on chromosome 16.

39:14.519 --> 39:21.993
LISA WILSON: I got the phone
call, and it stopped me in my
tracks, and I called Blair

39:21.993 --> 39:29.400
at work, and I immediately burst
into tears, and I said, this
changes everything and nothing.

39:29.400 --> 39:35.907
Nothing changes about how we
live our lives, but he now is
able to say, definitively; I

39:35.907 --> 39:39.677
have autism. I was born
with it. It's genetic.

39:39.677 --> 39:42.914
MAN: These machines actually are
able to sequence millions and
millions of DNA fragments.

39:42.914 --> 39:48.720
JACKIE JUDD: The call came from
researchers here at Toronto's
Hospital for Sick Children,

39:48.720 --> 39:54.158
which is a partner in a
pioneering project to identify
genetic variants responsible for

39:54.158 --> 39:56.861
autism.

39:56.861 --> 40:03.401
Jonathan, his parents and his
three brothers all had their
entire DNA mapped or sequenced,

40:03.401 --> 40:07.505
so researchers could see the
most minute deletions or
duplications.

40:07.505 --> 40:08.906
DR. STEPHEN SCHERER, Toronto
Hospital for Sick Children:
Every time a new genome comes

40:08.906 --> 40:11.776
in, we can run a dynamic
kind of reassessment.

40:11.776 --> 40:15.246
JACKIE JUDD: Dr. Stephen
Scherer, whose team reviewed
Jonathan's genome, is one of the

40:15.246 --> 40:17.882
world's leading geneticists.

40:17.882 --> 40:21.919
DR. STEPHEN SCHERER: Now we have
the capability to do the ideal
experiment, and that is to

40:21.919 --> 40:26.658
sequence the entire genome, the
entire complement of DNA of all
of these families, and decode

40:26.658 --> 40:29.927
the underpinnings of autism.

40:29.927 --> 40:36.434
JACKIE JUDD: And, from that,
diagnose and treat autism
possibly from birth, as well

40:36.434 --> 40:43.241
as identify other health
problems often associated with
the disorder.

40:43.241 --> 40:48.946
Autism Speaks began the MSSNG
project with the audacious goal
of completing the DNA mapping

40:48.946 --> 40:54.085
of 10,000 people affected by
autism and then making that
information widely available in

40:54.085 --> 40:56.921
a single place.

40:56.921 --> 41:00.591
Rob Ring is the advocacy
organization's chief science
officer.

41:00.591 --> 41:04.662
ROB RING, Chief Science Officer,
Autism Speaks: In that database
will be families, individuals

41:04.662 --> 41:11.035
touched by autism, their
siblings, parents, all their
genomes. That is a massive data

41:11.035 --> 41:11.569
set.

41:11.569 --> 41:14.138
JACKIE JUDD: How massive?

41:14.138 --> 41:20.244
ROB RING: It's huge. It's the
equivalent of a -- watching a
high-definition TV show
streaming

41:20.244 --> 41:23.948
continuously for 13.5 years.

41:23.948 --> 41:30.588
JACKIE JUDD: Autism Speaks had
the will and the resources, $50
million, to undertake the

41:30.588 --> 41:36.894
project. The Hospital for Sick
Children had the expertise to
map an individual's DNA,

41:36.894 --> 41:41.999
which now costs only $1,000 and
takes only a couple of weeks to
go from blood sample

41:41.999 --> 41:45.770
to complete gene mapping.

41:45.770 --> 41:52.110
What to do with that massive
amount of data being generated
led them to a third partner

41:52.110 --> 41:59.050
not known for its work in
genetics. It led them to Google.
Most consumers know Google

41:59.050 --> 42:03.721
as the go-to search engine to
sort information about everyday
things, like restaurant rankings

42:03.721 --> 42:07.225
or weather patterns.

42:07.225 --> 42:12.797
For the MSSNG project, Google
stores participants' genomes in
the cloud and then applies its

42:12.797 --> 42:16.701
vast analytic power to
questions from researchers.

42:16.701 --> 42:18.936
DAVID GLAZER, Google Genomics:
To date, this is the biggest.

42:18.936 --> 42:22.807
JACKIE JUDD: David Glazer heads
Google's growing genomics
division.

42:22.807 --> 42:27.678
DAVID GLAZER: What we realized a
couple years ago is that the
world of biology has started

42:27.678 --> 42:32.450
to generate a lot more
information than they
historically had tools to work
with.

42:32.450 --> 42:35.953
And that's what we at Google are
really good at, is taking large
amounts of information

42:35.953 --> 42:40.625
and finding the value in that
information. What we're doing
with the MSSNG project is

42:40.625 --> 42:45.563
saying, you guys are generating
and gathering, from all the
volunteer families, this really

42:45.563 --> 42:50.935
valuable set of information. Let
us help make that information as
valuable as possible.

42:50.935 --> 42:57.642
JACKIE JUDD: So far, 76
researchers from six countries,
exploring the causes of autism,

42:57.642 --> 43:03.147
including environmental factors,
have gained entry to the new
portal. And they are posing

43:03.147 --> 43:07.618
questions that only powerful
search engines could process.

43:07.618 --> 43:12.590
DAVID GLAZER: We had to build
tools that could work with data
sets that were trillions of

43:12.590 --> 43:17.495
rows of information. That's
trillions with a T. That tool is
good at working with lots

43:17.495 --> 43:21.199
and lots of information and
finding patterns in an
interactive way.

43:21.199 --> 43:25.770
DR. STEPHEN SCHERER: Right away,
we get some information that
helps in developing new
diagnostic

43:25.770 --> 43:31.742
tests. And, secondly, we can
think about new medicines. This
is the problem right now.

43:31.742 --> 43:35.680
The challenge is, for the core
features of autism, there's no
effective medical treatment.

43:35.680 --> 43:41.352
JACKIE JUDD: The researchers
applying for entry to the DNA
library in the cloud pay

43:41.352 --> 43:46.924
nothing if approved. That is
unique in a field where access
to data can be closely guarded

43:46.924 --> 43:49.126
and expensive.

43:49.126 --> 43:55.266
ROB RING: Our central thesis, if
you will, around MSSNG was, the
more eyes we can get

43:55.266 --> 44:01.572
on a data set like that, the
greater the probability that
discoveries are going to be
made, discoveries

44:01.572 --> 44:06.611
that have the potential to
transform how we think about
autism, how we diagnose it, and

44:06.611 --> 44:10.147
ultimately how we treat it.

44:10.147 --> 44:15.920
JACKIE JUDD: The optimism of
MSSNG's founders about the
potential for unlimited
discovery

44:15.920 --> 44:20.591
is apparent. And they believe
that what works for autism may
work for any number of other

44:20.591 --> 44:22.360
diseases.

44:22.360 --> 44:26.063
DAVID GLAZER: They will all
build on each other, and the
success of one will help all.

44:26.063 --> 44:30.535
JACKIE JUDD: In fact, Google
already is exploring a project
in the cancer field.

44:30.535 --> 44:34.805
DAVID GLAZER: The model is in
the pattern of how to take this
kind of information and

44:34.805 --> 44:39.977
allow scientists to ask the
kinds of questions they want.
There are thousands of very rare

44:39.977 --> 44:45.750
diseases that would benefit from
having a deeper genomic
understanding of their
condition.

44:45.750 --> 44:52.757
JACKIE JUDD: Lisa and Blair
Wilson hope their contributions
to MSSNG spare other parents

44:52.757 --> 44:56.427
some of the anguish they
experienced when they knew that
something was wrong with their

44:56.427 --> 44:59.497
little boy, just not what.

44:59.497 --> 45:07.738
LISA WILSON: I think starting
intervention at age 3 was very
late, compared to how early

45:07.738 --> 45:14.612
our concerns began about him.
And if we could have intervened
earlier in the trajectory

45:14.612 --> 45:18.316
of his development, we could
have influenced it sooner.

45:18.316 --> 45:23.354
BLAIR WILSON: And I think that
would have really helped him
along his journey.

45:23.354 --> 45:30.094
JACKIE JUDD: So far, MSSNG has
put the genomes of 2,300 people
in the cloud, and all 10,000

45:30.094 --> 45:38.169
are expected to be up by next
spring, among them, the
complicated map of a Canadian
teenager

45:38.169 --> 45:44.308
with the simple hope of one day
living an independent life
filled with family and friends.

45:44.308 --> 45:53.117
For the "PBS NewsHour," this
is Jackie Judd in Toronto.

45:53.117 --> 46:05.196
GWEN IFILL: Whether it is the
vibrant colors of autumn leaves,
or the smell of crisp mountain

46:05.196 --> 46:09.300
air, nature has inspired poets
for centuries, including one of
this year's MacArthur grant

46:09.300 --> 46:11.969
winners.

46:11.969 --> 46:14.872
Ellen Bryant Voigt takes us on a
journey through her poetry and
the countryside that serves

46:14.872 --> 46:17.108
as her muse.

46:17.108 --> 46:22.313
ELLEN BRYANT VOIGT, Poet: My
name is Ellen Bryant Voigt. I'm
a poet and a teacher. I

46:22.313 --> 46:27.218
live in rural Vermont. I
have been here since 1969.

46:27.218 --> 46:33.557
When I look back over all the
poems that I have written, I
notice a couple of concerns

46:33.557 --> 46:41.132
or obsessions that kept
recurring. And one of them has
to do with the relationship
between

46:41.132 --> 46:46.237
the individual soul and the
collective, however you want to
define collective. We might
define

46:46.237 --> 46:53.244
it as family. You can define
that as small town, the world,
the natural world.

46:53.244 --> 47:02.253
And very often, that individual
soul is in conflict with the
larger one. And that, I

47:02.253 --> 47:09.593
think, I can trace back to
coming from lots and lots of
relatives close by in a small

47:09.593 --> 47:12.563
area, a small town that
knew all of your business.

47:12.563 --> 47:14.398
(LAUGHTER)

47:14.398 --> 47:20.905
ELLEN BRYANT VOIGT: "If you have
been, let's say, a
glass-half-empty kind of girl,
you

47:20.905 --> 47:28.846
wake to the chorus of geese
overhead, forlorn, for something
has softened their nasal voices,

47:28.846 --> 47:34.485
their ugly aggression. On the
ground, they're worse than
chickens. But flying, one leader

47:34.485 --> 47:40.458
falling back, another moving up
to pierce the wind. No one in
charge or every one in

47:40.458 --> 47:47.331
charge, in flight, each limited
goose adjusts its part in the
cluster just under the clouds.

47:47.331 --> 47:54.538
Do they mean together to
duplicate the cloud?"

47:54.538 --> 48:00.344
I have a great interest in the
rhythms of the natural world. I
try to observe it. And

48:00.344 --> 48:07.184
then I try to come to some
understanding that I didn't have
before. Poetry allowed me to

48:07.184 --> 48:11.822
observe it, and then to try to
find the language that is
precise enough for the
complexities

48:11.822 --> 48:18.929
around that world.

48:18.929 --> 48:27.905
I think I have always looked for
a high degree of solitude. Music
was a wonderful haven for

48:27.905 --> 48:35.212
me as a child. It was a place
that -- where I could find that
solitude and find something

48:35.212 --> 48:43.888
I was passionate about. Music,
to my mind, is a crucial part of
all poems, the rhythm

48:43.888 --> 48:49.026
of it, the rhythm of the line,
the long vowel, the short vowel.

48:49.026 --> 48:55.633
If I can hear a line that is
intriguing and is interesting
rhythmically, then I can go

48:55.633 --> 49:01.839
follow it toward my 50 to 100
drafts, which is about how long
it takes me to do a poem.

49:01.839 --> 49:04.508
"Storm."

49:04.508 --> 49:12.183
"One minute, a slender pine
indistinguishable from the
others, the next, its trunk
horizontal,

49:12.183 --> 49:20.457
still green, the jagged stump a
nest for the flickers. One
minute, high wind and rain,

49:20.457 --> 49:28.599
the skies lit up, the next, a
few bright winking stars, the
lashing of the brook. One
minute,

49:28.599 --> 49:34.839
an exaltation in the apple
trees, the shadblow trees, the
next, white trash on the ground,

49:34.839 --> 49:39.476
new birds, or the same birds
crowding the feeder."

49:39.476 --> 49:46.684
To write poems, I have to remind
myself sometimes to go out into
the world. I love the natural

49:46.684 --> 49:51.789
beauty. I love living in the
country. I love the solitude.
But to only that, to live on

49:51.789 --> 49:57.361
the mountaintop, I think,
wouldn't be good for poems.

49:57.361 --> 50:05.669
I think that poetry has become
more visible and more a part of
the fabric of the culture

50:05.669 --> 50:11.308
than it's often referred to.
More books of poetry are being
published now than ever before.

50:11.308 --> 50:15.246
I think that there's a
great hunger for that.

50:15.246 --> 50:21.518
It's -- we get a lot of
information. We're bombarded
with information. But I think,
especially

50:21.518 --> 50:27.024
in this country, there are very
few ways in which we can process
any of that or that we

50:27.024 --> 50:31.495
can think hard about that. We
need to slow down in order to
think hard about it. And

50:31.495 --> 50:38.002
the poem will slow us down.
It will slow us down.

50:38.002 --> 50:50.781
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally,
to our "NewsHour" Shares.

50:50.781 --> 50:56.120
Today's, it one of our online
videos. And it's about the
personal testimonies of drug

50:56.120 --> 51:01.258
addiction and its impact in West
Virginia. As we heard earlier,
President Obama traveled

51:01.258 --> 51:06.597
to that state today, where he
took part in a community forum
on those very problems.

51:06.597 --> 51:11.735
High schoolers from our Student
Reporting Lab in Richwood, West
Virginia, attended the

51:11.735 --> 51:14.171
event. They interviewed members
of the community affected by all
this.

51:14.171 --> 51:16.674
Here's an excerpt.

51:16.674 --> 51:21.578
DARLENE CLUTTER, Librarian: I
have got a sister that died a
few months ago that was just a

51:21.578 --> 51:28.252
few years younger than me
because she became addicted to
medications that the doctors had

51:28.252 --> 51:30.688
prescribed to her.

51:30.688 --> 51:34.725
LAKIN CLARK, Recovering Addict:
I started using drugs when I was
like 12, probably smoking

51:34.725 --> 51:37.628
weed, just -- probably
just to fit in.

51:37.628 --> 51:41.532
AMY PODDEY, Recovering Addict: I
got arrested on two felony
delivery charges.

51:41.532 --> 51:47.071
DENISE HUGHES, Recovering
Addict: I got arrested on two
felony delivery charges, and as
part

51:47.071 --> 51:52.409
of my bond stipulation, I had to
go to DRC. I have been in there
13 months.

51:52.409 --> 51:57.247
LAKIN CLARK: And I just didn't
-- I didn't know how to live
without drugs. It was how

51:57.247 --> 52:00.484
I felt I had to have them to get
up in the morning. I had to have
them to do anything.

52:00.484 --> 52:03.687
I had to have them to live.

52:03.687 --> 52:06.991
AMY PODDEY: When it is
happening, you don't really
realize that the drugs are
taking over

52:06.991 --> 52:09.326
your body and your mind. You
think that everything is still
OK.

52:09.326 --> 52:12.529
DENISE HUGHES: I have tried -- I
mean, I have tried a lot. I have
not done heroin, but have

52:12.529 --> 52:18.502
I done my share. And it's not
something I'm proud of. It's
wrecked my life.

52:18.502 --> 52:24.808
AMY PODDEY: I have two children.
I have a 10-year-old and a
13-year-old. And for those

52:24.808 --> 52:30.214
two years, I didn't wake up
thinking, I got to get my kids
up for school or I got to do

52:30.214 --> 52:33.884
this. I woke up thinking, how
am I going to get high today?

52:33.884 --> 52:40.758
LAKIN CLARK: What I learned
today is addiction is a disease,
and it kills people. It really

52:40.758 --> 52:42.593
does.

52:42.593 --> 52:46.697
AMY PODDEY: My little boy, one
day, we were at GoMart. He said,
"Mom, will you me a chocolate

52:46.697 --> 52:48.632
milk?" And I said, "I don't have
enough money to." But I had 50
bucks in my pocket and I

52:48.632 --> 52:50.667
went and bought a pill with it.

52:50.667 --> 52:54.872
LAKIN CLARK: I never had much to
do with my son. I would take him
to my mom's house and

52:54.872 --> 53:00.744
I would leave him there for days
at a time, sometimes weeks.

53:00.744 --> 53:06.283
DARLENE CLUTTER: So, for me, you
know, it was just -- it is
heart-wrenching, because

53:06.283 --> 53:09.119
I have seen so many people that
I absolutely just love have
their lives ruined because

53:09.119 --> 53:10.454
of it.

53:10.454 --> 53:14.558
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's
very hard to watch.

53:14.558 --> 53:19.296
And you can find more videos
from our Student Reporting Labs
at studentreportinglabs.com.

53:19.296 --> 53:24.535
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online right now: Global warming
might tighten your wallet

53:24.535 --> 53:29.940
no matter where you live. That's
according to a new study from
Stanford University that

53:29.940 --> 53:35.045
pinpoints the optimal annual
temperature for economic
productivity. What happens when
temperatures

53:35.045 --> 53:39.116
rise? Find out on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:39.116 --> 53:42.086
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight. I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:42.086 --> 53:44.354
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:44.354 --> 53:48.358
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
here at the "PBS NewsHour,"

53:48.358 --> 53:48.692
thank you, and good night.
