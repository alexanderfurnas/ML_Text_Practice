JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.242 --> 00:11.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We bring you the
"NewsHour"
tonight from the Quicken Loans
Arena in Cleveland,

00:11.912 --> 00:15.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ohio, site of the 2016
Republican National
Convention.

00:15.849 --> 00:21.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A defiant Ted Cruz
shakes up the
Republican Convention, as
nominee Donald Trump

00:21.154 --> 00:22.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prepares to take the stage
tonight.

00:23.090 --> 00:27.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I sit down
with the party's
vice presidential pick, Mike
Pence, on what

00:27.995 --> 00:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he'd bring to a Trump presidency
and the nominee's
recent remarks on foreign
policy.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential
Candidate: It's been a long time
since NATO

00:35.135 --> 00:41.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was created, and I also think
Donald Trump
has spoken very wisely about the
need to rethink

00:41.408 --> 00:43.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the mission of NATO.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I'm Hari
Sreenivasan in
Washington with a look at what
the instability

00:46.313 --> 00:48.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Turkey means for Europe.

00:48.148 --> 00:56.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:56.256 --> 00:58.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.059 --> 01:10.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For Donald J. Trump,
the moment
is at hand. The Republican
presidential nominee

01:10.170 --> 01:15.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
addresses this convention, and
the nation,
tonight. It comes as the
campaign is making

01:15.442 --> 01:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a bid for unity, after a day, if
not a full
week, of division.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

01:23.250 --> 01:27.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today's
walk-through for
Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka
at the podium

01:27.721 --> 01:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where they will each speak
Tonight Was Customary.
And then, came the mic test.

01:32.025 --> 01:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I love the media. They're so
honest. They're

01:37.698 --> 01:42.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such honorable people. I love
Cleveland. I
love Ohio. It's great to be
here. Thank you,

01:42.970 --> 01:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody. I love Cleveland. And
they're doing
a great job. And the police are
doing an incredible

01:48.608 --> 01:49.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
job. Thank you very much.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: Ted Cruz of Texas.

01:51.445 --> 01:56.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But much of the
day was dominated
by what happened last night,
when Trump's

01:56.383 --> 01:59.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
primary challenger, Texas
Senator Ted Cruz,
balked at endorsing the nominee.

01:59.820 --> 02:06.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R), Texas: Stand
and speak
and vote your conscience. Vote
for candidates

02:06.159 --> 02:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up and down the ticket who you
trust to defend
our freedom and to be faithful
to the Constitution.

02:12.566 --> 02:12.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(SHOUTING)

02:13.066 --> 02:14.701 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

02:14.801 --> 02:19.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As he finished,
Cruz was
booed off the stage. And his
wife, Heidi,

02:19.573 --> 02:24.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was escorted off the convention
floor to safety,
while Trump delegates vented
their anger.

02:24.878 --> 02:31.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm ticked. Who does he
think he is?
He lost. He's a poor loser. I'm
ashamed of

02:31.418 --> 02:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him. He's done, as far as I'm
concerned, in
the Republican Party.

02:34.921 --> 02:38.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Some Cruz
supporters, on
the other hand, defended their
man.

02:38.358 --> 02:44.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I don't blame him either
way. You know,
it was a very bruising primary.
I think some

02:44.731 --> 02:53.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Trump's attacks on him were
nasty and personal.
And so I can understand why
there's still

02:53.907 --> 02:55.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some hesitation, but, again,
it's a decision
of conscience.

02:55.842 --> 03:00.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Later, Trump
took to Twitter
to say: "Ted Cruz got booed off
the stage,

03:01.014 --> 03:06.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't honor the pledge to
support the party's
nominee. I saw his speech two
hours early,

03:06.520 --> 03:09.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but let him speak anyway. No big
deal."

03:09.289 --> 03:11.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Lyin' Ted Cruz.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: During the
primaries, Trump
had referred to Cruz as lyin'
Ted and attacked

03:14.928 --> 03:20.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his family members. This
morning, the senator
showed no sign of backing down
at a breakfast

03:20.267 --> 03:22.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for his home state's delegation.

03:22.235 --> 03:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R): I am not in
the habit of
supporting people who attack my
wife and attack

03:27.340 --> 03:34.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my father. And that pledge
wasn't a blanket
commitment that if you go and
slander and

03:34.614 --> 03:40.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack Heidi, that I'm going to
nonetheless
come like a servile puppy dog
and say thank

03:40.520 --> 03:44.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you very much for maligning my
wife and maligning
my father.

03:44.157 --> 03:48.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Cruz wouldn't
say if he will
vote for Trump, but said he
would never vote

03:48.595 --> 03:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for Democrat Hillary Clinton.

03:50.797 --> 03:55.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump campaign chair Paul
Manafort argued
that the show of party divisions
may actually

03:55.669 --> 03:58.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rally Republicans behind Trump.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT, Trump Convention
Manager: In
a backhanded way, even with what
Senator Cruz

04:00.640 --> 04:05.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
did, we think Mr. Trump's
commitment to unifying
the party was enhanced last
night. Senator

04:05.412 --> 04:10.884 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
Cruz, the strict
constitutionalist, chose
not to accept the strict terms
of the pledge

04:10.984 --> 04:15.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he signed. So, as far as
the contract
was concerned, he was the one in
violation,

04:15.155 --> 04:16.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not anybody else.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All of that
demonstrates
why unity will be at the top of
the agenda

04:19.526 --> 04:24.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on this fourth and final night
of the Republican
Convention, where the theme will
be make America

04:24.397 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one again.

04:26.333 --> 04:30.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speakers leading up to Trump's
keynote address
will stress unity, leadership,
solidarity,

04:30.604 --> 04:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and trust, all in an effort to
shore up support
for their nominee. The lineup
includes tech

04:36.042 --> 04:41.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
billionaire Peter Thiel, a
co-founder of PayPal,
and Oklahoma Governor Mary
Fallin, co-chair

04:41.715 --> 04:44.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Republican Platform
Committee.

04:44.484 --> 04:50.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those outside the Quicken Loans
arena are
braving scorching heat to show
their opposition

04:50.390 --> 04:55.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Trump. Demonstrators took to
the streets
this afternoon, and plan to
rally again this

04:55.595 --> 04:57.497 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
evening.

04:57.597 --> 05:02.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the convention's first
three days, there've
been about two dozen arrests,
far fewer than

05:02.102 --> 05:03.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
initially expected.

05:03.904 --> 05:07.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour" in
Cleveland, I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

05:07.307 --> 05:11.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We head down to the
convention
floor now.

05:11.678 --> 05:16.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NPR's "Weekend Edition Sunday"
host -- I always
have trouble with that -- Rachel
Martin is

05:16.750 --> 05:22.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with us this week and next for
our joint "PBS
NewsHour"/NPR prime-time
coverage of the conventions.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rachel, I see you're in the
Washington delegation.
What are you watching for
tonight?

05:26.693 --> 05:30.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL MARTIN: Well, there's a
whole lot of
electricity in the hall, as you
might imagine,

05:30.964 --> 05:35.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen, because this is the big
night. This
is when Donald Trump comes out
and accepts

05:35.302 --> 05:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his party's nomination to be
president of
the United States.

05:37.837 --> 05:42.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as you heard in Lisa's
reporting, it's
been a tumultuous few days and
there are a

05:42.475 --> 05:47.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of sore feelings after Ted
Cruz's speech
last night, so people here today
are ready

05:47.113 --> 05:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to turn the page. They're going
to be looking
to Donald Trump to unify this
party.

05:52.219 --> 05:55.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the speech that he's about to
give, we
will hear a lot of the themes we
have heard

05:55.322 --> 06:00.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
throughout the week of an
unsteady world,
of it's a chaotic world. He
wants to be the

06:00.894 --> 06:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strong and steady arm that can
kind of steer
America in the right direction.

06:05.999 --> 06:09.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Could also be the most scripted
thing we have
seen him, although his son said
he might go

06:10.070 --> 06:13.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off-script, which his supporters
are probably
looking forward to -- Judy and
Gwen.

06:13.840 --> 06:15.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you, Rachel.

06:15.909 --> 06:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And earlier
today, I sat down
with the vice presidential
nominee, Indiana

06:20.981 --> 06:25.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Mike Pence, here in the
Cleveland
in the arena for an in-depth
interview about

06:26.019 --> 06:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the convention, the race ahead,
and how his
own views match up, or don't,
with those of

06:31.057 --> 06:33.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the man who chose him.

06:33.460 --> 06:37.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Governor Mike Pence,
congratulations on your
nomination to be vice president.

06:37.597 --> 06:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential
Candidate: Thank you, Judy.
We're very humbled.

06:40.300 --> 06:45.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In your speech
last night,
I don't think there were very
many dry eyes

06:45.538 --> 06:48.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when you gestured up in the
stands to your
mother.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: Or mine.

06:50.410 --> 06:55.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you said you
thanked her,
you went on to talk about your
family, about

06:55.849 --> 06:57.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
growing up. What was that moment
like?

06:57.784 --> 07:01.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: It was very
emotional, very
emotional.

07:01.921 --> 07:09.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My grandfather emigrated to this
country.
My mom grew up in a family of
immigrants.

07:09.129 --> 07:16.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just to think that I could
walk out on
the stage and accept my party's
nomination

07:16.236 --> 07:20.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for vice president of the United
States, and
be able to share that moment
with my mother

07:21.007 --> 07:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and with my wonderful wife, our
three children,
was almost inexpressible.

07:25.679 --> 07:31.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Speaking of
family, the other
-- one of the other major
speakers last night

07:31.851 --> 07:39.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was Senator Ted Cruz, who, in
saying why he's
not endorsing Donald Trump,
cited his own

07:39.893 --> 07:41.728 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

07:41.828 --> 07:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he could not bring
himself to support
somebody who had criticized his
wife and his

07:46.866 --> 07:50.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
father. And he's referring, of
course, to
Donald Trump saying his father
was involved

07:51.004 --> 07:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the assassination of John F.
Kennedy.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you understand why this is a
hard thing
for Ted Cruz?

07:59.312 --> 08:05.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: Senator Ted
Cruz is my friend.
And I'm glad he came to the
Republican National

08:05.618 --> 08:07.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Convention.

08:07.487 --> 08:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was glad we also heard from
Marco Rubio,
and Chris Christie and a great
speech from

08:13.059 --> 08:14.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Scott Walker.

08:14.994 --> 08:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I recognize primaries are
difficult things.
We had a field of outstanding
candidates.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And primaries get a little bit
rough. And
it takes some time for people to
get beyond

08:24.504 --> 08:26.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those things, Judy.

08:26.406 --> 08:31.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I really appreciate the fact
that he came,
that he congratulated Donald
Trump on winning

08:31.478 --> 08:37.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican nomination. And
then he expressed
support for our shared
conservative values.

08:38.084 --> 08:42.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as time goes on,
that you are
going to continue to see more
and more Republicans,

08:42.956 --> 08:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independents, and many Democrats
rally to
that cause. And we're going to
elect Donald

08:47.761 --> 08:49.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump as the next president of
the United
States.

08:49.696 --> 08:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have said
some very -- as
you are now, very complimentary
things about

08:53.233 --> 08:55.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

08:55.268 --> 09:02.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also the case that you have
spent virtually
your entire life as a deep
believer in Christian

09:02.275 --> 09:07.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
values, Christian conservative
values. That
has not been a centerpiece of
Donald Trump's

09:07.714 --> 09:13.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign. Do you think you are
going to be
able, with your own beliefs, to
persuade him

09:14.053 --> 09:19.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on issues like LGBT rights, on
-- I don't
know, on the issue of abortion?
Do you think

09:20.093 --> 09:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you can change his views in
those areas?

09:23.029 --> 09:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: Well, I think
Donald Trump
is pro-life.

09:26.232 --> 09:32.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe in the sanctity of
life, and
we have had some heart-to-heart
conversations

09:32.205 --> 09:36.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the Supreme Court of the
United States
and about the importance of
making sure that

09:36.843 --> 09:41.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our next president appoints
justices to the
Supreme Court who will not only
uphold the

09:41.281 --> 09:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rule of law, but will -- that
will advance
the principles enshrined in the
Constitution

09:46.820 --> 09:48.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

09:48.788 --> 09:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm grateful for Donald Trump's
pro-life views.
And I'm grateful that he's
expressed those

09:56.196 --> 10:04.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
views so publicly and openly.
And, look, the
American people know that there
are issues

10:04.404 --> 10:09.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that divide us very quickly, and
they're issues
that are often matters of the
heart for every

10:09.342 --> 10:11.244 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
American.

10:11.344 --> 10:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the challenges facing our
country today,
I think, have even more even to
do with America's

10:16.549 --> 10:20.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place in the world, with a
struggling economy
that isn't producing the jobs
that Americans

10:20.587 --> 10:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long to see, with the kind of
economic policies
that seem to have other
countries winning

10:26.059 --> 10:27.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and America losing.

10:27.961 --> 10:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is speaking about
those issues,
Judy, and I think that's why not
only do you

10:32.365 --> 10:36.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see tremendous unity in the
Republican Party,
but you see a lot of
independents and a lot

10:36.169 --> 10:40.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Democrats that are being
drawn to this
movement. And I'm excited about
the chance

10:40.373 --> 10:42.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to continue to carry that
message across the
country.

10:42.742 --> 10:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
about America's
role in the world, let me ask
you about foreign

10:45.812 --> 10:47.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump gave an interview
to The New
York Times this week in which,
among other

10:49.582 --> 10:55.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things, he said, if Russia
attacked one of
the small Baltic nations,
Estonia, Latvia,

10:55.321 --> 11:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lithuania, that he would come to
their aid
only after reviewing their
commitment to NATO,

11:01.661 --> 11:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether they fulfill their
obligations to
us, as he put it.

11:05.298 --> 11:11.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a departure not only
from Republican
Party views, but from what is
really mainstream

11:12.071 --> 11:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign policy thinking in this
country. It's
been supported by a majority of
American presidents

11:17.877 --> 11:20.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going back to, I'm told, Harry
Truman.

11:20.713 --> 11:24.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you say today to the
citizens of these
NATO countries about whether the
U.S. is prepared

11:25.084 --> 11:26.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to come to their aid?

11:27.053 --> 11:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: Donald Trump
made it clear
in that very interview that
America will stand

11:29.255 --> 11:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by our allies. We will uphold up
our treaty
obligations, including the
mutual defense

11:34.394 --> 11:36.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
agreement that is NATO.

11:36.496 --> 11:41.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what Donald Trump has also
said -- and
quite apart from the fact that
America keeps

11:41.334 --> 11:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its word and you can tell Donald
Trump keeps
his word -- that what we're also
going to

11:46.339 --> 11:52.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do is say to our allies around
the world,
as we face $19 trillion in
national debt,

11:52.111 --> 11:55.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it's time for them to start
to pay their
fair share.

11:55.381 --> 12:02.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We provide an enormous amount of
resources,
particularly with regard to
military resources,

12:02.155 --> 12:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to countries all over the world.
And in many
cases, those countries are not
compensating

12:09.095 --> 12:12.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the American taxpayer for the
commitment that
we're making to their security.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Doesn't this
inject a note
doubt about whether the U.S. is
going to be

12:15.802 --> 12:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there when they need support?

12:16.703 --> 12:18.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:18.571 --> 12:20.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: No. No, Judy, I
think -- I
don't read The New York Times
every day, but

12:20.540 --> 12:24.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that article actually
said that -- he
said we would absolutely, was
the word that

12:24.644 --> 12:29.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he used, absolutely stand by our
allies and
stand by our treaty obligations.

12:29.415 --> 12:34.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But that's not -- it's a
separate question,
but it's just as important, that
we don't

12:35.021 --> 12:40.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continue to burden the taxpayers
of America
with these commitments all
across the globe,

12:40.326 --> 12:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we say to other countries
with whom we
stand in solidarity in their
defense and the

12:45.732 --> 12:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defense of their freedom, that
we need you
to partner with us.

12:49.402 --> 12:54.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's been a long time
since NATO was
created, and I also think Donald
Trump has

12:54.574 --> 12:59.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spoken very wisely about the
need to rethink
the mission of NATO.

12:59.879 --> 13:01.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well...

13:01.848 --> 13:07.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: It was a Cold
War alliance,
but now we face, in many ways, a
more asymmetrical

13:07.487 --> 13:10.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threat, with the rise of radical
Islamic terrorism.

13:10.123 --> 13:15.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And rethinking NATO's mission
and its ability
to confront that threat to our
freedom is

13:15.895 --> 13:17.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just as important.

13:17.864 --> 13:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He made a couple
of other points
in the article, one having to do
with Turkey,

13:20.600 --> 13:23.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where there has been enormous
turmoil recently,
an attempted coup.

13:23.603 --> 13:27.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he didn't believe the
U.S. should
try to pressure the president of
Turkey, who

13:27.907 --> 13:31.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been rounding people up,
imprisoning people,
shutting down news
organizations.

13:31.544 --> 13:42.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Where are you in terms of
whether the United
States should be supporting and
espousing

13:42.488 --> 13:49.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
democratic values, small-D
democratic values,
in other countries that are
going through

13:49.896 --> 13:51.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a situation like this?

13:51.764 --> 13:56.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: Well, I don't
think we have
to choose between standing by a
strategic

13:56.469 --> 14:01.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ally and articulating our
commitment to democracy
and individual freedom.

14:01.874 --> 14:08.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done that throughout our
history.
And with regard to Turkey, I
have been to

14:08.247 --> 14:16.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ankara. Turkey is a democracy.
We certainly,
we certainly, in the future,
ought to encourage

14:16.155 --> 14:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our ally to live up to their own
democratic
institutions and their own
democratic ideals.

14:21.060 --> 14:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But make no mistake about it.
With the rise
of Islamic terrorism, radical
Islamic terrorism

14:28.000 --> 14:34.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the world -- excuse me --
with the rise
of ISIS, our alliance with
Turkey is more

14:34.474 --> 14:39.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important than ever before, the
ability to
have access, to move resources
into the region

14:39.545 --> 14:46.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and also, most importantly, to
engage Turkey
fully in the battle against
global terrorism,

14:46.285 --> 14:49.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is -- about protecting the
American people.

14:49.122 --> 14:55.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, absolutely, yes, we should
stand by our
allies, but we should also stand
by our ideals

14:55.661 --> 15:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and work with our allies and
encourage them
to live up to the democratic
institutions

15:00.967 --> 15:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and traditions that they enjoy.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have long
been a proponent
of free trade.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: Still am.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But how do you
square that
his saying he would scrap NAFTA
and other

15:10.143 --> 15:16.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treaties in a second, unless he
could make
sure that countries like Canada
and Mexico

15:16.682 --> 15:18.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do something to benefit American
companies?

15:18.851 --> 15:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: I support free
trade. Donald
Trump supports free trade.

15:24.490 --> 15:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trade means jobs. Jobs in the
United States,
jobs in my home state of Indiana
are supported

15:30.263 --> 15:36.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by international exports. But it
doesn't mean
that we don't work hard to make
sure that

15:36.102 --> 15:41.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those are good deals. And NAFTA
itself has
a provision in it that called
for periodic

15:41.140 --> 15:47.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reviews of the economies of the
countries
who had signed the treaty to
ensure that the

15:47.380 --> 15:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deal was working for everybody.

15:49.749 --> 15:54.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I hear Donald Trump
saying about
that deal and about other trade
deals is,

15:54.353 --> 15:59.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's just keep looking and
let's just make
sure that, as we continue to --
as we continue

15:59.258 --> 16:04.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to expand our economic
relationships with
countries around the region and
around the

16:04.130 --> 16:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world, that we're doing it in a
way that's
a win for the American worker
and for American

16:09.435 --> 16:10.102 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs.

16:10.203 --> 16:12.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last question.

16:12.171 --> 16:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of, I should say, the talk
at this convention
from the stage and from the
delegates has

16:17.677 --> 16:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been pretty harsh criticism of
Hillary Clinton.
We have heard, "Lock her up." We
have heard

16:22.548 --> 16:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- we have seen the signs,
"Hillary to prison,"
talk of indicting her.

16:29.322 --> 16:35.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this -- you're somebody who's
been outspoken
against negative campaigning. Do
you think

16:35.228 --> 16:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's been over the top, as even
some Republicans
have said? And do you think it's
been a wasted

16:41.200 --> 16:45.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opportunity, so far, to talk
about what's
positive about Donald Trump?

16:45.471 --> 16:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: Well, first, I
think that's
what freedom looks like.

16:48.975 --> 16:54.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The American people get to
express themselves,
and in the ways that they
choose. But I have

16:54.747 --> 17:00.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got to tell you, I -- this
convention, I have
sensed a tremendous amount of
energy, a tremendous

17:00.186 --> 17:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount of unity, not around the
personalities,
but around the choice that we
face this fall.

17:06.926 --> 17:12.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Donald Trump, you have
someone who will
bring real change to Washington,
D.C. He's

17:12.265 --> 17:18.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a bold leader. He's distinctly
American. He
doesn't play by the
old-fashioned rules. He's

17:18.137 --> 17:24.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to Washington, D.C., break
up the status
quo, and I believe get this
economy moving

17:24.343 --> 17:26.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again and have America standing
tall in the
world.

17:26.746 --> 17:34.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Hillary Clinton, by
contrast, is the very
embodiment of the failed status
quo that Republicans,

17:34.854 --> 17:39.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats and independents are
tired of and
weary of. Now, I want to be
clear.

17:39.292 --> 17:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But for the last
three nights,
"Lock her up" has been a refrain
we have been

17:44.030 --> 17:45.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hearing.

17:45.932 --> 17:49.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: People are
frustrated, $19
trillion in national debt that
just hasn't

17:49.335 --> 17:53.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
been piled up by Democrat
administrations.
It's been nearly doubled under
this administration.

17:53.606 --> 17:57.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, frankly, you know Judy --
you have known
me for a long time -- I have
battled against

17:57.176 --> 18:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the big spenders in my own
party, back when
I was in Congress. The truth of
the matter

18:02.048 --> 18:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, the American people are
looking at Washington,
D.C., and saying, enough is
enough.

18:05.818 --> 18:10.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want a different type of
leadership. We
want a different direction for
this country.

18:10.856 --> 18:15.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's why I truly do
believe that Donald
Trump will be the next president
of the United

18:15.161 --> 18:16.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Different, but
does it have
to be so negative, is my
question?

18:18.631 --> 18:20.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: I think we have
got to lay
out the choice for the American
people.

18:21.067 --> 18:25.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a choice between change and
the status
quo. And I really do believe, we
get out,

18:26.072 --> 18:30.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we work our hearts out, we carry
our message
to the American people, a
positive vision,

18:30.609 --> 18:34.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also laying out the choice
and the stakes,
I truly do believe we will have
a great victory

18:35.014 --> 18:36.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the American people this
fall.

18:36.382 --> 18:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After a tough
campaign.

18:40.086 --> 18:44.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Governor Mike Pence, the
Republican nominee
for vice president, thank you
very much.

18:44.657 --> 18:49.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE: Thank you,
Judy. Good to
see you again.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And from there,
we go to our
team of analysts here in the
booth, who are

18:53.833 --> 18:57.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with us all evening and all week
and next
week, David Brooks of The New
York Times,

18:57.937 --> 19:01.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
syndicated columnist Mark
Shields, and Amy
Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

19:02.074 --> 19:04.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, let's talk a little bit
about what you
heard.

19:04.176 --> 19:08.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
David Brooks, Mike Pence and
Donald Trump?

19:08.347 --> 19:11.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Pepto-Bismol. He
calms things
down.

19:11.851 --> 19:15.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he's a very conventional
conservative,
very -- pretty orthodox
conservative, somebody

19:16.055 --> 19:20.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who's been involved in
Republican circles
forever, has such a sweet
disposition. And

19:20.893 --> 19:25.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so he takes the things Donald
Trump says and
he sorts them, makes them seem
normal.

19:25.831 --> 19:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things the Trump
campaign has
got to do is try to make him
seem like a normal

19:29.902 --> 19:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidate. And Pence has managed
to be good
at that.

19:32.805 --> 19:37.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy?
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: And
he's incredibly on message.

19:37.243 --> 19:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the one person you don't
have to worry
about freelancing. What we have
seen at this

19:40.880 --> 19:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convention and what we saw from
some of the
other candidates who were sort
of in the race

19:46.452 --> 19:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for vice president, like Newt
Gingrich, they're
going to go off on their, sort
of riff on

19:51.490 --> 19:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their own sort of tangent.

19:53.426 --> 19:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pence is going to do what
the Trump campaign
needs him to do, period,
exclamation point.

19:58.831 --> 20:03.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing that Mike Pence
does besides
soothing the edges of Donald
Trump, is he

20:03.402 --> 20:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soothes a lot of candidates
down-ballot.

20:06.105 --> 20:10.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can send Mike Pence to any
one of these
battleground states where the
Senate majority

20:10.910 --> 20:15.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is on the line, and candidates
are going to
want to stand with him, even
those candidates

20:16.082 --> 20:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who aren't going to show up at a
Trump rally.

20:18.217 --> 20:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mark, you have to
listen carefully
to Judy's conversation with Mike
Pence to

20:22.121 --> 20:26.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
realize that sometimes he's
actually disagreeing
with the guy whose ticket he's
on.

20:26.358 --> 20:29.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But -- so when he says he's
going to go and
have a heart-to-heart with him
whenever they

20:29.128 --> 20:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have mild disagreements, not
that people care
if vice presidents and
presidents agreed all

20:32.898 --> 20:38.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time, does that mean he can
make a -- that
he can engineer a change of
heart if he feels

20:38.571 --> 20:40.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
strongly about something?

20:40.306 --> 20:45.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Probably not.
That's not the
historic role of vice
presidents.

20:45.411 --> 20:49.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They don't have that much
influence on the
presidential candidate who has
won the nomination

20:50.082 --> 20:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and given them -- the only
person that has
a vote in the vice presidential
nomination

20:55.020 --> 20:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is the presidential candidate.

20:56.889 --> 21:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do want to say about Mike
Pence, it's
the first Reaganesque figure we
have seen

21:02.228 --> 21:02.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at this convention.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: What do you mean?

21:04.930 --> 21:11.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: In the sense of
Ronald Reagan
was an upbeat, reassuring and
civil and just

21:11.203 --> 21:12.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
appealing figure.

21:13.072 --> 21:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the conversation with Judy,
there wasn't
the adversarial. There wasn't
the chip on

21:17.443 --> 21:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the shoulder. That's not part of
Mike Pence.
And I thought his speech last
night was quite

21:23.015 --> 21:28.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reaganesque in the sense of
putting a smiling
face on conservatism, which has
been missing

21:28.254 --> 21:29.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this week.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It should be said
this is not
like the distinction between Joe
Biden and

21:31.724 --> 21:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan
and George H.W.
Bush.

21:35.327 --> 21:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not like, oh, we have
got two normal
guys, they're in the party and
they have some

21:38.731 --> 21:46.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
differences. This is here and
here. Ronald
Reagan was an upbeat,
market-oriented, outward-looking,

21:46.739 --> 21:49.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sort of optimistic,
future-oriented politician.

21:49.808 --> 21:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump is a fear-oriented,
backward-looking,
closed-in politician.

21:53.279 --> 21:56.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about a
lot of other
things going on tonight,
because, tonight,

21:56.415 --> 21:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're going to hear from Donald
Trump, the
big nomination acceptance
speech.

21:59.785 --> 22:04.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all day long, it's been kind
of overshadowed
by what Ted Cruz did last night.
They're not

22:05.024 --> 22:08.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
talking about Mike Pence.
They're not talking
about even what Donald Trump is
expected to

22:08.827 --> 22:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do. They're talking about the
fact that Ted
Cruz kind of poked the candidate
in the eye.

22:13.599 --> 22:15.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Amy.

22:15.467 --> 22:19.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I have never been at
a convection
where as much time and energy
was expended

22:19.104 --> 22:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on what's going to happen in the
next election
than what's going to happen in
this one.

22:23.943 --> 22:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while Ted Cruz did it most
aggressively
by basically coming out to
somebody's party

22:29.381 --> 22:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, you know, just spilling the
drinks everywhere,
every other candidate has also
gone up there

22:38.190 --> 22:42.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and done a much more subtle way
of saying,
you know what, I have a
different vision of

22:43.028 --> 22:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where our country is going and a
different
vision for where the party needs
to go than

22:46.332 --> 22:51.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump does. I'm going to
stand up here
and say that he's the nominee.

22:51.403 --> 22:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't mean they're all
lining up behind
him. This last day, though, this
is Donald

22:56.842 --> 23:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's day. He's not going to
rescue this
convention. It's still going
down in history

23:02.681 --> 23:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as being unconventional and
disruptive.

23:05.851 --> 23:11.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he has a chance here to make
a good impression.
And I think the good news for
him is that

23:11.957 --> 23:15.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bar is much lower than it
was before we
started this.

23:15.761 --> 23:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
what is the burden
for Donald Trump tonight? What
does he need

23:19.999 --> 23:20.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do?

23:20.766 --> 23:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, oh, sure.

23:22.668 --> 23:25.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the burden -- just one
quick thing on
Ted Cruz, and that is, he had a
chance, like

23:25.371 --> 23:33.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ronald Reagan did in 1976 in
Kansas City,
to make the case for electing --
or, you know,

23:33.245 --> 23:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really separating himself as a
distinct political
figure. He chose not to.

23:38.417 --> 23:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as Jeb Bush and John Kasich
chose not
to endorse and honor their
pledge to endorse,

23:44.890 --> 23:50.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they stayed away. He came to the
room to do
it, high-risk politics for him.

23:50.462 --> 23:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as our nominee, Donald
Trump, tonight,
Judy, he's got to excite his
base. He's got

23:57.936 --> 24:03.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to unite the country. It's a
mood for change
in the country. But the problem
with Donald

24:03.676 --> 24:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is that the change he
represents, to
a majority of Americans right
now, is not

24:08.714 --> 24:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reassuring. It's unreassuring.

24:11.550 --> 24:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's his job
tonight, and especially
to lay out a jobs program.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks?

24:18.724 --> 24:23.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: First, on Cruz, if
I can get
my bite in, I start with the
proposition that

24:23.262 --> 24:25.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Trump is not a normal
politician.

24:25.197 --> 24:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He doesn't cross the threshold,
and this is
going to end very badly for him,
either in

24:28.767 --> 24:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
November or beyond. And if you
start with
that premise, then what Ted Cruz
did, while

24:32.738 --> 24:37.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nakedly ambitious, was
courageous and probably
the right thing to do. If your
party is sliding

24:37.609 --> 24:42.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into some sort of chaotic land
of hollowed
out, then if you stand before
history and

24:42.648 --> 24:47.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yell stop, you will be rewarded
in years and
years to come, in the way that
none of the

24:47.653 --> 24:49.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
others will be.

24:49.588 --> 24:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as Trump, he has picked
law and order
as his theme. And so he has got
to persuade

24:53.625 --> 24:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans that their fundamental
problem is
violence, and that crime and
terrorism are

24:59.765 --> 25:03.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the first things on their
agendas affecting
their lives, and, therefore,
they need a guy

25:03.535 --> 25:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like him. I'm not sure that's
true, but I
think that's more less the task
he has assigned

25:07.806 --> 25:09.308 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
himself.

25:09.408 --> 25:11.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: David Brooks, Mark
Shields, Amy
Walter, thank all you very much.

25:11.677 --> 25:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we have a lot more to talk
about, if
you need more, which I'm sure
you do. Tune

25:15.214 --> 25:20.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in later tonight, beginning at
8:00 p.m. Eastern
time, for our special NPR/"PBS
NewsHour" coverage

25:20.652 --> 25:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Republican National
Convention in Cleveland.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we will go back to Hari
Sreenivasan in
D.C.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Gwen.

25:27.626 --> 25:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Donald
Trump raised
concerns at NATO after
suggesting he wouldn't

25:32.164 --> 25:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
automatically defend allies

In France, investigators say the
man behind
the deadly truck attack in nice
may have started

25:53.018 --> 25:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
planning a year ago. Mohamed
Bouhlel killed
84 people last week when he
drove a truck

25:57.456 --> 26:02.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down a beachside promenade
packed with Bastille
Day revelers. Now a search of
his phone suggests

26:02.327 --> 26:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he'd been thinking about it for
months.

FRANCOIS MOLINS, Paris

26:07.599 --> 26:14.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fireworks dating back to July
14, 2015. Yes,
I said 2015. And it found a
photograph of

26:14.239 --> 26:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a newspaper article dating back
to January
1, 2016, appearing in a local
Nice newspaper,

26:20.345 --> 26:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
headlined -- and I quote -- "Man

HARI SREENIVASAN: Five suspects
already in
custody are facing terrorism
charges for allegedly

26:28.487 --> 26:30.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aiding in the attack.

Federal police in Brazil say
they have broken
up a possible terror plot during
the Summer

26:35.027 --> 26:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Olympics. Brazil's justice
minister says 10
suspects pledged allegiance to
the Islamic

26:40.065 --> 26:45.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
State group and talked of
striking during
the Games. He says they had no
specific targets

26:45.370 --> 26:49.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet. The Olympics begin in Rio
de Janeiro
on August 5.

26:49.508 --> 26:54.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The highest tribunal in sports
today rejected
Russia's appeals to let its
track and field

26:54.680 --> 26:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
athletes compete in Rio. They
have been banned
over allegations of systematic
state-sponsored

26:59.952 --> 27:01.487 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doping.

from Lausanne, Switzerland.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATTHIEU REEB, General
Secretary, Court of
Arbitration for Sport: the Court
of Arbitration

27:05.424 --> 27:12.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Sport has dismissed the
request filed
by the Russian Olympic Committee
and 68 Russian

27:12.531 --> 27:14.299 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
athletes.

27:14.399 --> 27:18.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN PAYNE: So, 68 Russian track
and field
athletes are banned from Rio
unless they can

27:18.470 --> 27:23.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
prove they have not been
involved in doping.
So, stars such as double Olympic
poll vaulting

27:23.809 --> 27:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
champion Yelena Isinbayeva, who
trains in
Russia, will not appear. She has
described

27:28.514 --> 27:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the position as the funeral of
athletes.

27:30.916 --> 27:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MDNM-Now the IOC must decide
whether to
ban the entire Russian team,
which won 82

27:36.255 --> 27:40.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
medals at London in 2012,
including 24 golds.

27:40.893 --> 27:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian sport has been in the
dark for the
last 18 months, and this week a
report claimed

27:45.197 --> 27:50.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Russian secret agents had
swapped positive
drug tests at their laboratory
during the

27:50.202 --> 27:52.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sochi Winter Games.

27:52.404 --> 27:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Russia, as the athletes
prepared for the
Games, the reaction was one of
sadness and

27:56.542 --> 27:58.477 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anger

27:58.577 --> 28:00.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALINA VISHNITSKAYA, Russian
Sprinter (through
translator): This decision is
really frustrating.

28:00.479 --> 28:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For some reason, clean sportsmen
who have
never been caught doping will
have to carry

28:04.516 --> 28:08.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this responsibility with
everyone else. I
wouldn't want this to ever
happen again.

28:08.921 --> 28:12.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IAN PAYNE: Elsewhere within the
sport, the
reaction was quite different.

28:12.991 --> 28:17.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
USAIN BOLT, Olympic Gold
Medalist: If you
are the court and you catch
somebody, I definitely

28:17.529 --> 28:23.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
feel that you should take
action. And if you
feel like banning the whole team
is the right

28:23.535 --> 28:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
action, then I'm all for it, you
know what
I mean?

28:26.972 --> 28:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN PAYNE: The attention will
now switch to
the International Olympic
Committee, who also

28:31.109 --> 28:35.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have their headquarters here.
Legally, they
now have the green light to ban
the entire

28:35.948 --> 28:37.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Russian team.

28:37.716 --> 28:42.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The IOC
Executive Board
meets Sunday to consider that
question.

28:42.254 --> 28:46.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Florida's
state law
enforcement agency will
investigate the police

28:46.491 --> 28:51.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shooting of an unarmed black man
in North
Miami. Behavioral therapist
Charles Kinsey

28:51.363 --> 28:57.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says he was trying to return an
autistic patient
who had wandered off Monday.
Cell phone video

28:57.502 --> 29:02.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showed Kinsey down on his back
with his hands
up, and identifying himself,
before he was

29:03.041 --> 29:05.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shot. He spoke from his hospital
bed yesterday.

29:05.210 --> 29:09.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES KINSEY, Shooting Victim:
And I'm standing
there. I'm like, sir, "Why did
you shoot me?"

29:09.514 --> 29:11.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And his words to me, he said, "I
don't know."

29:12.084 --> 29:15.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As long as I got my hands up,
they're not
going to shoot me. This is what
I'm thinking.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're not going to shoot me.
Wow, was I
wrong.

29:18.357 --> 29:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The police
chief said his
officers had been told there was
a man with

29:22.160 --> 29:27.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a gun threatening to kill
himself. It turned
out the autistic man had a toy
truck.

The U.S. Justice Department
filed suit today
to block two major mergers in
the health insurance

29:32.070 --> 29:37.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industry. Aetna wants to buy
Humana for $34
billion, while Anthem is trying
to buy Cigna

29:37.542 --> 29:43.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for $48 billion. Justice
officials say the
deals would hurt competition and
consumers.

29:43.348 --> 29:47.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The companies say getting larger
will help
them cut prices.

29:47.519 --> 29:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FOX News Channel CEO Roger Ailes
has resigned.
Parent company 21st Century Fox
announced

29:52.224 --> 29:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it late today, and said it's
effective immediately.
Ailes faced growing allegations
of sexual

29:57.129 --> 29:58.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
harassment.

29:59.064 --> 30:03.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks gave
some ground
after a week-plus rally. The Dow
Jones industrial

30:03.201 --> 30:09.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost 77 points to close
at 18517.
The Nasdaq fell 16 points, and
the S&amp;P 500

30:09.708 --> 30:12.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
slipped seven.

30:12.377 --> 30:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the National Basketball
Association is
moving next year's All-Star Game
from Charlotte,

30:17.516 --> 30:22.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Carolina, over a state law
on transgender
bathrooms. The statute requires
people to

30:22.888 --> 30:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use public restrooms matching
their sex at
birth. A league statement says
it wants all

30:27.125 --> 30:31.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people to feel welcome at its
events, and
will choose another city.

Vice President Joe Biden spoke
today with
Turkish prime minister and
expressed -- quote

30:45.711 --> 30:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "unyielding support" for
Turkish democracy.

30:48.780 --> 30:52.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the White House,
this comes as
the crackdown after last
Friday's attempted

30:52.617 --> 30:57.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coup in Turkey continues. And,
today, the
Parliament cemented emergency
legislation

30:57.522 --> 30:59.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
giving the government expanded
powers.

From Istanbul, special
correspondent Marcia
Biggs begins our coverage.

31:03.695 --> 31:08.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Across Turkey this
morning,
reactions to the declaration of
emergency

31:08.767 --> 31:10.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ranged from fearful to
welcoming.

31:11.036 --> 31:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
think it could
make things worse in a country
where we have

31:15.107 --> 31:16.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no freedoms.

31:17.008 --> 31:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
think this is
the right move under the current
circumstances.

31:20.612 --> 31:23.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are going through difficult
times.

31:23.615 --> 31:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The move follows
last Friday's
failed military coup attempt,
which killed

31:30.188 --> 31:36.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearly 250 people and wounded
hundreds more.
In his announcement last night,
Turkish President

31:36.895 --> 31:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to
cleanse what
he called viruses in the armed
forces.

31:41.600 --> 31:46.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): This measure is in
no way against

31:46.138 --> 31:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
democracy, the law and freedoms.
On the contrary,
it aims to protect and
strengthen them.

31:51.510 --> 31:57.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Erdogan's
government had already
embarked on a sweeping crackdown
of mass arrests

31:57.716 --> 32:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and mass firings since the coup.
But Parliament's
overwhelming approval of the
state of emergency

32:04.623 --> 32:09.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fully authorizes him to impose
laws by fiat,
hold prisoners in jail longer
and take other

32:09.995 --> 32:11.730 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
actions.

32:11.830 --> 32:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's markets reacted with a
slide, as
the lira tumbled to a
near-record low and

32:16.168 --> 32:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governments around the globe
reacted cautiously.
Germany called for emergency
rule to end as

32:21.306 --> 32:26.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly as possible. And in
Washington, the
White House also urged Ankara
not to go too

32:26.878 --> 32:28.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
far.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
The United States is not going
to micromanage

32:30.649 --> 32:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the situation in Turkey. But I
think we are
going to send a clear,
unmistakable signal

32:36.254 --> 32:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of support for the democratic
institutions
of Turkey.

32:39.124 --> 32:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Journalist Andrew
Finkel has
lived in Turkey for almost 30
years. He spoke

32:43.862 --> 32:44.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to us in Istanbul.

32:45.096 --> 32:47.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what does this mean for
Erdogan and his
power?

32:47.299 --> 32:51.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW FINKEL, Journalist: Well,
it means
that he will be free to move
against people

32:51.937 --> 32:54.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who he perceives to be his
opponents and his
enemies.

32:54.539 --> 32:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Are there any
limits to this?

32:56.441 --> 33:00.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW FINKEL: It would be a
brave person
to try and impose those limits.
But the thing

33:00.412 --> 33:06.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is, even before the coup
happened, he -- we
were headed down an autocratic
path.

33:06.718 --> 33:11.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Erdogan's
government blames
opposition cleric Fethullah
Gulen and his

33:11.189 --> 33:14.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
followers for the coup. Gulen
now lives in
the U.S. in exile.

33:14.860 --> 33:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW FINKEL: He preaches a
nonviolent variant
of Islam. Most people would call
it a moderate

33:21.933 --> 33:28.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
view of Islam. But his followers
were very
active in many forms of life.
And many believe

33:28.907 --> 33:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that his followers pursued a
policy of really
getting themselves in positions
of authority

33:36.314 --> 33:40.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the bureaucracy, in the
police, in the
judiciary, et cetera, et cetera,
in order

33:40.685 --> 33:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to further the aims of the
movement.

33:42.654 --> 33:47.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Here in Turkey,
many of those
followers attended more than 650
schools founded

33:47.192 --> 33:53.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by Gulen that taught over
200,000 students.
Once strong allies, Erdogan and
Gulen finally

33:53.365 --> 33:59.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
broke in 2013 after Gulen
accused Erdogan
and his party of corruption,
even supplying

33:59.437 --> 34:01.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
videotaped evidence.

34:01.473 --> 34:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW FINKEL: Mr. Erdogan
resented the Gulenists'
move on to occupy positions of
power and the

34:07.012 --> 34:08.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
influence they had within his
own government.

34:08.680 --> 34:11.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Can the country
handle losing
all these people?

34:11.516 --> 34:18.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW FINKEL: It's 60,000
people. It's a
third of the officer corps,
colonels or generals

34:18.123 --> 34:21.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or above. You know, who's
guarding the store?

34:21.459 --> 34:26.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The numbers of
people affected
by this purge are staggering;
30,000 people

34:26.164 --> 34:31.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were suspended from their jobs
in civil service,
9,000 people were taken into
custody; 21,000

34:31.770 --> 34:36.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teachers had their licenses
revoked. Yet,
among all these people, we were
unable to

34:36.107 --> 34:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find anyone who felt free enough
to talk to
us about it.

34:39.311 --> 34:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senel Karatas is the director of
Istanbul
Human Rights Association. This
week, she has

34:44.482 --> 34:48.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been helping the families of
soldiers in custody,
allegedly tortured by government
authorities

34:49.087 --> 34:52.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after the coup. We spoke to her
yesterday.

34:52.490 --> 34:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does the purge mean for
you, someone
who fights human rights
violations on a daily

34:56.594 --> 34:58.396 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
basis?

34:58.496 --> 35:00.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SENEL KARATAS, Director,
Istanbul Human Rights
Association (through
translator): Since the

35:00.298 --> 35:04.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coup, we have seen an extreme
rise of abuses
and maybe suspension of human
rights.

35:04.769 --> 35:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was really good that so many
people have
solidarity against the coup and
prevented

35:08.440 --> 35:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. But some people on the
streets started
to use this atmosphere as an
opportunity for

35:12.444 --> 35:13.645 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
revenge

35:13.745 --> 35:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Are you scared for
yourself,
for your country?

35:16.047 --> 35:19.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SENEL KARATAS (through
translator): Yes. The
state of emergency is the main
concern for

35:20.018 --> 35:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the future of democracy. It will
lead to a
rise in human rights abuses, and
we will fall

35:24.055 --> 35:25.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into despair.

35:25.991 --> 35:29.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Turkey has now
suspended its
commitment to the European
Convention on Human

35:29.294 --> 35:34.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Rights. The deputy prime
minister insisted
today that -- quote --
"Standards of the European

35:34.265 --> 35:38.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Court of Human Rights will be
upheld," but
he didn't elaborate.

35:38.937 --> 35:43.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For now, Senel says she is
doubtful, but will
continue her work.

35:43.375 --> 35:47.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Marcia Biggs in
Istanbul, Turkey.

35:47.512 --> 35:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Turkey's
stability and its
commitment to human rights are
but two of

35:51.783 --> 35:56.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the challenges facing Europe in
the wake of
the attempted coup. Turkey is
also instrumental

35:56.354 --> 36:00.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the fight against ISIS and
stemming the
flow of migrants and refugees
from the Middle

36:00.625 --> 36:01.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
East to Europe.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now we explore Europe's options.

36:03.762 --> 36:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier this evening, I sat down
with Federica
Mogherini, the European Union's
top diplomat.

36:08.333 --> 36:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is in Washington for a donor
conference,
raising money for humanitarian
aid to Iraq.

36:12.370 --> 36:14.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

36:14.305 --> 36:16.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI, Foreign
Policy Chief,
European Union: Thank you very
much for inviting

36:16.307 --> 36:17.442 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

36:17.542 --> 36:19.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
first things
first.

36:19.411 --> 36:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past week, Turkey has
been going through
a significant amount of turmoil.
There was

36:24.516 --> 36:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an attempted coup. They have
detained and
fired tens of thousands of
people. They are

36:30.188 --> 36:34.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
now declaring a state of
emergency, and they're
saying that they want to bring
back the death

36:34.292 --> 36:36.094 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
penalty.

36:36.194 --> 36:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, aren't these the type of
violations of
human rights or civil liberties
that should

36:41.232 --> 36:44.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stop them from becoming a member
of the E.U.,
which they want to be?

36:44.202 --> 36:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI: You know,
what is happening
in Turkey is extremely
important, both for

36:49.207 --> 36:50.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Europe and America.

36:51.042 --> 36:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were saying together with
Secretary
Kerry that, as it was important
to stop the

36:56.481 --> 37:02.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coup, it is very important that
the reaction
to the coup is one that takes
into consideration

37:02.420 --> 37:08.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
human rights, rule of law. And
we're seeing
in these days things that are
completely unacceptable,

37:08.393 --> 37:12.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being that against the word of
university
or media, the judiciary.

37:13.064 --> 37:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are saying very clearly
and loud, both
Europeans and Americans
together, that, yes,

37:20.672 --> 37:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state institutions needs to
be preserved
democratically, so the
president, government,

37:25.944 --> 37:31.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parliament, but that fundamental
freedoms
have to be respected and
protected. And we're

37:31.749 --> 37:33.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to continue this way.

37:33.751 --> 37:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what's the
leverage
that the E.U. has? Will you say
to Turkey,

37:37.255 --> 37:40.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you do this, you're not going
to become
a part of the E.U.?

37:40.758 --> 37:42.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI: Well, we
have said it
very clearly.

37:42.694 --> 37:47.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, if you introduce
the death penalty
that was abolished exactly for
negotiations

37:47.465 --> 37:51.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to enter the European Union, if
you are reintroducing
the death penalty, you are not
going to become

37:51.703 --> 37:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a member of the European Union.
That's very
clear.

37:53.571 --> 37:56.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, one of the
things that
you have been able to do with
Turkey is to

37:56.908 --> 37:59.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
slow the flow of migrants coming
from Turkey
into Greece.

37:59.744 --> 38:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have sort of orchestrated
almost a refugee
swap. If they can keep the
people coming across

38:06.718 --> 38:10.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Turkey to Greece, perhaps
the European
Union can take some people from
Syria.

38:10.555 --> 38:14.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What if Turkey says, you know
what, stay out
of our business, we have to deal
with what

38:14.425 --> 38:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this attempted coup was, we have
to take the
measures we have to take? And
what if they

38:18.696 --> 38:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decide let's just let people
through, let
people go back to Europe again?

38:22.767 --> 38:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI: The deal we
had with Turkey
had nothing to do with the swap.

38:26.738 --> 38:33.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have decided to do and
what we are
doing is to support the hosting
of Syrian

38:33.478 --> 38:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees in Turkey, as we're
doing in Jordan
or in Lebanon. That's the
humanitarian thing.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, by the way, it's also a
security issue.

38:40.985 --> 38:46.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm here in Washington today
because Secretary
Kerry invited this anti-Da'esh
coalition ministerial

38:46.157 --> 38:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting. It has to do with a
global effort
to manage the situation that is
spilling out

38:50.795 --> 38:55.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Syria, with serious
consequences on all
the neighboring countries,
including Turkey.

38:55.667 --> 39:00.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey is a country that is
hosting the largest
number of refugees in the world
at this moment.

39:00.205 --> 39:05.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the agreement we have with
Turkey is about
making lives of Syrian refugees
sustainable

39:05.410 --> 39:10.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and making the life of the
Turkish hosting
communities sustainable.

39:10.415 --> 39:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's humanitarian. It's
aimed also at
preventing radicalization among
the Syrian

39:15.520 --> 39:20.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees. It's important. It's
in our interest.
It's in the interest of the
whole international

39:20.558 --> 39:22.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community. And we're going to
continue that
way.

39:22.460 --> 39:24.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But when you
talk about
radicalization, that is
something that Europe

39:24.696 --> 39:27.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is facing much, much closer than
even the
United States.

39:27.232 --> 39:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, who -- what do you do to
try and stop
the attackers that struck in
Paris, in Brussels

39:33.504 --> 39:35.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and Nice?

39:35.306 --> 39:38.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI: So, first of
all, we have
to realize that this is a global
challenge

39:38.443 --> 39:41.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that requires a global work, a
global coalition.

39:41.613 --> 39:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is why it's so important
that America
and Europe stays together and
works together

39:47.051 --> 39:53.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this respect. We have today a
partnership
between Europe and America that
is as strong

39:53.391 --> 39:57.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as ever. And this is extremely
important to
face this challenge together.

39:58.029 --> 40:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not something that comes
from the outside
of our societies. We see it in
here and we

40:02.166 --> 40:08.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see it in Europe. It's people
that were born
and raised in our own societies.
So there

40:08.473 --> 40:14.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is part of our work that is
focused on defeating
Da'esh on the ground in Syria,
Iraq, but also

40:15.079 --> 40:21.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Libya and elsewhere, but is
also a cultural,
I would say, a social part of
the work, that

40:21.185 --> 40:25.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is aimed at preventing our own
youth to get
radicalized.

40:25.423 --> 40:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Take the case of Nice, somebody
that got radicalized,
if we can talk about that, in a
few weeks'

40:33.331 --> 40:40.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time. So, violence is somehow
preceding the
radicalization. It has nothing
to do with

40:40.438 --> 40:42.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
religion, has much more to do
with violence.

40:42.807 --> 40:47.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is the kind of effort
we're doing,
together with our Arab friends,
also with

40:47.945 --> 40:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a strong component of the Asian
partners in
those efforts, because the risk
is not only

40:53.651 --> 40:58.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Europe. It's for United
States, for the
Middle East, obviously, but also
for Asia,

40:58.690 --> 41:02.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as we have seen in many
different places.
It's a global effort, and this
is why we need

41:02.860 --> 41:04.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
America to stay engaged.

41:04.762 --> 41:07.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
America, you
have said that part of the
strategy going

41:08.066 --> 41:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward for the E.U. is to
strengthen E.U.
relations with the NATO allies.

41:12.837 --> 41:18.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican candidate for
president just
said that he would make NATO
response to a

41:18.176 --> 41:24.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis conditional on those
countries paying
more for the protection. What do
you think

41:24.315 --> 41:26.084 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of that?

41:26.184 --> 41:29.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI: You know, in
Europe, we
are strengthening our defense
capabilities,

41:29.287 --> 41:33.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including also investment in
defense capabilities.

41:33.958 --> 41:38.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that everybody here
in America
understands very well that NATO
has provided

41:38.463 --> 41:43.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peace and security, not only for
Europe, but
for all of the Western world,
for so many

41:43.901 --> 41:48.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
decades. It's part of our
history. I think
it's part of our future. And
when NATO is

41:48.172 --> 41:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investing in security also in
Europe, it's
doing that also for America's
security.

41:52.610 --> 41:59.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there a
position that
the European Union might take if
Donald Trump

41:59.484 --> 42:02.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does come into power and if he
wants to implement
the strategy?

42:02.854 --> 42:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI: You know, I
have my own
personal opinions, preferences,
political

42:08.693 --> 42:10.495 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
views.

42:10.595 --> 42:14.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the point is that Europe and
America need
to work together, are bound to
work together.

42:14.932 --> 42:21.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a world like this, with
terrorism, conflicts,
crisis, dangers everywhere, you
need friends.

42:21.205 --> 42:26.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Europe and America are the
best friends
we can find on both sides of the
Atlantic.

42:26.544 --> 42:33.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, on the European side, we are
committed
to work with America in any
circumstances,

42:33.184 --> 42:37.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with any president that is
elected. What I
can say, though, is that I
remember very well

42:37.688 --> 42:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when Obama was elected in 2008.
In his first
speech in Chicago, he was saying
about restoring

42:43.795 --> 42:48.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friendships and alliances that
were, let's
say, going through difficult
times.

42:48.232 --> 42:52.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he delivered on this.
And I can only
hope that the next president
will do the same.

42:52.336 --> 42:54.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Federica Mogherini,
thanks so much for joining us.

42:54.906 --> 42:58.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEDERICA MOGHERINI: Thank you.

42:58.109 --> 43:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next, our
series The end
of AIDS wraps up in South
Africa, where, this

43:10.221 --> 43:14.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week, many of the world's top
scientists,
researchers and advocates are
meeting in Durban.

43:14.725 --> 43:18.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Among the topics: Is the end of
AIDS really
a possibility?

43:18.362 --> 43:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Perhaps no nation has paid as
steep a toll
from AIDS as South Africa has.

43:22.233 --> 43:25.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as correspondent William
Brangham and
producer Jason Kane report, few
other nations

43:26.070 --> 43:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are doing as much to push back
against the
virus.

43:29.307 --> 43:33.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the final report in our
series, which
has been supported by the
Pulitzer Center

43:33.344 --> 43:35.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Crisis Reporting.

43:35.213 --> 43:40.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As the world
races to end
the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many are
looking to

43:40.918 --> 43:45.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Africa, which has more
ground to cover
than anywhere else.

43:45.289 --> 43:51.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're sending out fleets of
bike messengers
to deliver lifesaving drugs.
They're testing

43:52.029 --> 43:58.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as many people as they can,
educating others,
running some of the world's top
state-of-the-art

43:58.302 --> 44:04.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
research labs. They're even
trying this, surfing
lessons as HIV prevention.

44:04.842 --> 44:10.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Africa has more people
infected with
HIV than any nation on Earth.
Over six million

44:10.481 --> 44:15.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people here have the virus. Only
half of those
are being treated, so South
Africa also has

44:15.286 --> 44:17.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one of the greatest challenges.

44:17.221 --> 44:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALIM ABDOOL KARIM, CAPRISA: One
out of every
five people living with HIV in
the world lives

44:24.095 --> 44:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
right here in South Africa.

44:25.997 --> 44:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Salim Abdool
Karim is one
of the leaders of South Africa's
fight against

44:29.901 --> 44:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HIV/AIDS. He runs CAPRISA, a
major research
lab in Durban.

44:33.871 --> 44:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALIM ABDOOL KARIM: We estimate
that there
are about 1,000 new HIV
infections in South

44:41.178 --> 44:43.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Africa each day.

44:43.180 --> 44:45.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Every single
day?

44:45.917 --> 44:49.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALIM ABDOOL KARIM: Every single
day. And
what's critical in that, it's
not just that

44:49.253 --> 44:57.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's all this HIV, but that
young women
are a key factor in the
highest-incidence

44:57.929 --> 44:59.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
populations.

44:59.830 --> 45:05.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is the
Desmond Tutu
HIV Foundation Youth Center in
Masiphumelele

45:05.303 --> 45:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Township in Cape Town. This is
the place that
uses surfing, among other
things, to keep

45:10.041 --> 45:13.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kids engaged in its HIV program.

45:13.911 --> 45:19.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, Linda-Gail Bekker is
trying to prevent
young women from ever getting
HIV in the first

45:19.116 --> 45:23.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place. Some studies indicate
that up to 8
percent of teenage girls will
become infected

45:24.088 --> 45:27.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every year in parts of South
Africa before
they reach their mid-20s.

45:27.258 --> 45:29.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA-GAIL BEKKER, Desmond Tutu
HIV Foundation
Youth Center: These are
unprecedented around

45:29.827 --> 45:32.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the world. We have to do
something about this.

45:32.597 --> 45:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Bekker's
center is trying
something few other places in
the world are

45:36.434 --> 45:42.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trying. They're offering
uninfected teenage
girls PrEP. It sands for
pre-exposure prophylaxis.

45:42.306 --> 45:46.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as we have reported in this
series, it's
a once-a-day pill which greatly
lowers your

45:46.477 --> 45:49.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
risk of becoming infected if
you're exposed
to HIV.

45:49.313 --> 45:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: You need to take your
pill every day
so that you can stay protected
by the pill.

45:55.319 --> 45:59.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Bekker says,
this isn't
just crucial HIV prevention for
these young

45:59.190 --> 46:04.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women. It's also empowerment.
Too often, she
says, young girls here have very
little say

46:04.261 --> 46:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in their own sexual lives and
sexual health.

46:07.031 --> 46:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: By not taking your pill
every day,
you might be in risk of getting
HIV.

46:11.769 --> 46:16.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA-GAIL BEKKER: For the first
time, we
have something that works if
people take it,

46:16.707 --> 46:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it works for them. It's in
their hands.
So, a young woman can swallow a
pill a day.

46:23.114 --> 46:28.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is in control. She decides
whether she
swallows that pill or not, and
she doesn't

46:28.386 --> 46:32.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to have a conversation with
her male
partner about what he does and
doesn't do

46:32.490 --> 46:34.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under the circumstance.

46:34.358 --> 46:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Of course,
these innovations
come after a very dark history
that drove

46:38.129 --> 46:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the spread of HIV in South
Africa. For years,
apartheid era laws created a
system where

46:43.467 --> 46:48.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black men were forced to travel
long distances
from their rural homes to find
work, often

46:48.372 --> 46:50.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the nation's mines.

46:50.241 --> 46:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many slept with HIV-positive sex
workers,
and then brought the virus home
to different

46:54.612 --> 47:01.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regions. But even after the end
of apartheid,
and as the HIV epidemic
deepened, former President

47:01.218 --> 47:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thabo Mbeki questioned whether
HIV even caused
AIDS.

47:04.722 --> 47:07.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THABO MBEKI, Former South
African President:
How does a virus cause a
syndrome?

47:07.358 --> 47:11.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mbeki was
widely criticized
for hindering South Africa's
response to the

47:11.262 --> 47:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
epidemic. One study estimates
his policies
led to the deaths of over
300,000 South Africans.

47:18.302 --> 47:21.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mbeki was president when Mpumi
Mevana was
diagnosed with HIV.

47:21.872 --> 47:24.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MPUMI MEVANA, HIV Patient: I was
diagnosed
in the corridor by the doctor in
Johannesburg

47:24.942 --> 47:28.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hospital. "No, my dear, we can't
help you
in this situation, because
you're HIV-positive."

47:29.046 --> 47:33.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I went home that day,
thinking that this
is the end of the story for me.
I'm waiting

47:33.684 --> 47:35.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the day I'm going to die.

47:35.553 --> 47:39.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This
37-year-old single
mother from Soweto is almost
completely blind,

47:39.757 --> 47:44.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of a virus that can
strike HIV-positive
people who aren't getting
treatment.

47:44.495 --> 47:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in a sign of the times,
Mevana is now
being treated in one of the most
innovative

47:49.233 --> 47:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clinics in Johannesburg. The
Right to Care
clinics treat more people with
HIV in South

47:54.605 --> 47:59.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Africa than anyone else. It's
9:30 in the
morning, and they have already
seen 300 patients

47:59.577 --> 48:03.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so far. They see 12,000 to
15,000 a month.

48:03.481 --> 48:05.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ian Sanne is the founding
director and CEO.

48:05.516 --> 48:08.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN SANNE, Founding Director and
CEO, Right
to Care: This clinic happens to
be the most

48:08.419 --> 48:12.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
efficient clinic in South
Africa. It's probably
one of the largest.

48:12.323 --> 48:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sanne's goal
is to bring
the most modern technologies to
bear on HIV

48:16.594 --> 48:22.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treatment in South Africa. They
have built
a robotic pharmacy to speed drug
dispensing.

48:22.133 --> 48:24.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: First, you insert your
card in there.

48:24.401 --> 48:29.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They have
built this prototype
ATM-like machine to dispense HIV
drugs far

48:29.406 --> 48:34.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away from clinics. They use
electronic medical
records and bar coding
throughout the system.

48:34.812 --> 48:39.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And wait times in many South
African clinics
can be more than half-a-day, but
here, Sanne

48:39.717 --> 48:45.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says, they average less than an
hour. He says,
remember, South Africa has over
three million

48:45.322 --> 48:49.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people more people who aren't
being treated
today, so every facility
nationwide has to

48:49.693 --> 48:51.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scale up.

48:51.529 --> 48:53.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN SANNE: In my view, we don't
have a choice.
We actually have to make this
work.

48:53.430 --> 48:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. AARON MOTSOALEDI, South
African Minister
of Health: How do we
successfully run this

48:56.333 --> 48:58.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
world's biggest treatment
program?

48:58.202 --> 49:02.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Aaron
Motsoaledi is
South Africa's minister of
health. He points

49:02.573 --> 49:06.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out that South Africa has made
huge gains
in recent years.

49:06.510 --> 49:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2004, only 400,000 were being
treated for
HIV. Today, 3.4 million are. In
2004, 70,000

49:15.920 --> 49:20.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
babies a year were born
HIV-positive, but
treatment has brought that down
to less than

49:20.591 --> 49:26.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
6,000 a year. But Motsoaledi
says achieving
these advances in so short a
period of time

49:26.630 --> 49:28.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has stretched the country's
resources thin.

49:28.699 --> 49:34.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. AARON MOTSOALEDI: There's no
way on earth
you could increase the number of
doctors proportionately

49:34.104 --> 49:35.806 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
within a decade.

49:35.906 --> 49:39.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, for now,
the burden
of South Africa's expanded HIV
care falls

49:39.577 --> 49:42.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hardest on its health care
workers.

49:42.680 --> 49:47.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobuhle Ndlela is a nurse in a
rural part
of KwaZulu-Natal in Eastern
South Africa.

49:48.085 --> 49:52.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her day starts early, getting
her girls off
to school before she drives to
the HIV clinic

49:52.356 --> 49:54.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
where she works.

49:54.291 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KwaZulu-Natal is one of the most
HIV-infected
regions on the planet. At the
local hospital,

50:00.097 --> 50:04.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people routinely show up with
advanced AIDS.
They're often also infected with
tuberculosis,

50:05.035 --> 50:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another epidemic that's plaguing
South Africa.

50:07.538 --> 50:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
T.B. is the leading cause of
death for HIV-positive
people here. It's estimated that
in many pockets

50:13.277 --> 50:18.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of KwaZulu-Natal, one out of
every three adults
is infected with HIV.

50:18.749 --> 50:22.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the clinic where Ndlela
works, she says
the stream of patients coming
through her

50:22.720 --> 50:24.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
door is overwhelming.

50:24.521 --> 50:29.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOBUHLE NDLELA, Nurse: Too much.
I used to
see 260 usually per day. But on
the fourth

50:29.827 --> 50:32.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this month, April, there were
305.

50:33.030 --> 50:34.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Three hundred
and five?

50:34.932 --> 50:35.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOBUHLE NDLELA: Yes, because...

50:35.699 --> 50:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In one day?

50:36.433 --> 50:37.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOBUHLE NDLELA: In one day.

50:37.935 --> 50:43.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So -- and it became even
difficult for me
to observe the patient properly.

50:43.173 --> 50:47.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This woman
with her back
to us just received her
diagnosis a few days

50:47.845 --> 50:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago. She asked that we not show
her face or
use her name.

50:51.582 --> 50:55.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's told us she stares at the
sheet of paper
with her positive result on it
for hours,

50:55.786 --> 50:57.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in disbelief.

50:57.721 --> 51:03.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I didn't expect it to be
like that.
I was so shocked and surprised,
so disappointed.

51:03.527 --> 51:07.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't know how to explain it.

51:07.631 --> 51:12.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She says she
was infected
by her boyfriend, who didn't
know or didn't

51:12.269 --> 51:17.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tell her about his own status.
She hasn't
yet told her two young sons the
news.

51:17.908 --> 51:19.610 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

51:19.710 --> 51:26.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm not ready to tell
them. Even my
family, I never said anything to
them. So,

51:26.317 --> 51:28.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it's not easy.

51:28.118 --> 51:30.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What are you
worried their
reaction is going to be? There's
a lot of

51:30.521 --> 51:34.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in this community that
have it. It's
-- there's no shame in having
this disease.

51:34.525 --> 51:36.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

51:36.293 --> 51:41.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: They will think I'm going
to die. They
will not feel comfortable about
it.

51:41.899 --> 51:45.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It obviously
doesn't feel
this way to her, but she's one
of the lucky

51:45.836 --> 51:51.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ones. Consistent HIV medication,
which she
will now get, can prolong her
life for decades.

51:51.508 --> 51:54.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She can still work, still be a
mom.

51:54.411 --> 51:58.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the challenge for so
much of South
Africa today: Find the people
who are infected

51:58.582 --> 52:03.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with HIV, but don't know it,
persuade them
to start treatment, and sustain
that treatment

52:03.954 --> 52:05.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the rest of their lives.

52:05.856 --> 52:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALIM ABDOOL KARIM: It's not
that we don't
know what to do. It's a
challenge of trying

52:09.393 --> 52:17.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do what we know works, and to
do it at
a scale where it can really make
a difference.

52:17.234 --> 52:22.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After a long
day treating
hundreds of HIV patients,
Nobuhle Ndlela is

52:22.439 --> 52:23.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tired, but not defeated.

52:23.507 --> 52:25.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOBUHLE NDLELA: God knows every
step I take.

52:25.809 --> 52:33.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She has a few
hours with
her daughters to pray and to
sing and to rest,

52:33.550 --> 52:38.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
before she starts again,
wrestling against
an epidemic.

52:38.655 --> 52:45.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Republican presidential
nomination.

53:09.453 --> 53:13.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

planned remarks,
he promises an end to what he
calls poverty

53:13.757 --> 53:18.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and violence at home, war and
destruction
abroad. And he calls for a major
tax relief

53:18.629 --> 53:21.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and millions of new jobs.

53:21.231 --> 53:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

tonight. I'm
