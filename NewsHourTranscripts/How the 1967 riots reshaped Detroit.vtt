HARI SREENIVASAN: Tonight, we
begin a look back, over the
next few weeks, at the unrest

00:04.100 --> 00:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that hit cities across
America in the summer of 1967.

00:08.366 --> 00:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Detroit particularly captured
the nation's attention.

00:11.233 --> 00:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fifty years later,
special correspondent
Soledad O'Brien reports
on what sparked it all and

00:15.766 --> 00:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the scars that remain today.

00:18.100 --> 00:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: On July 23, 1967,
Detroit was hit by a riot.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES, Detroit:
Everything broke loose.

00:24.700 --> 00:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Forty-three dead, thousands
injured, and the city in flames.

00:28.533 --> 00:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: All we could hear is
fire engines and police sirens.

00:31.366 --> 00:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CRAIG, Detroit Police
Chief: I guess, when I'm being
politically correct, I will

00:36.066 --> 00:37.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
say unrest.

00:37.066 --> 00:38.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a riot.

00:38.066 --> 00:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a straight-out riot.

00:39.133 --> 00:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: It was just pure rage.

00:42.033 --> 00:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Detroit had been what
some people thought was a model
city, a place where blacks and

00:48.400 --> 00:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whites had found a
way to get along.

00:50.633 --> 00:55.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAN: There was a lot of
enmity and anger between
the young black guys and
the young white police

00:58.600 --> 01:00.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
officers.

01:00.133 --> 01:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we locked up
about 7,000 people total.

01:02.633 --> 01:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: A lot of people hollering
and screaming and saying, why
do you keep messing with us

01:07.566 --> 01:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and not go to your
neighborhoods?

01:09.600 --> 01:14.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: There were more
than 2,500 buildings
that were destroyed,
looted or burned to the

01:14.100 --> 01:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ground, over 1,200 injured.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: A rebellion.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Insurrection.

01:20.133 --> 01:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: The white community
was calling it a riot.

01:21.733 --> 01:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Detroit
1967, a riot or rebellion?

01:28.300 --> 01:30.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
To this day, they still
debate what it was.

01:30.566 --> 01:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN MCKANE, Former Detroit
Police Officer: A lot of the
smoke was on 12th Street, which

01:36.433 --> 01:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is what it was called then.

01:38.933 --> 01:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The
disturbances began on
12th Street, since renamed
Rosa Parks Boulevard.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They started spontaneously
after a routine police raid on
an illegal bar or what locals

01:48.866 --> 01:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called a blind pig.

01:51.066 --> 01:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Dan McKane was a young
street cop in Detroit's
tactical mobile unit.

01:55.033 --> 02:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN MCKANE: Each precinct had
a vice crew, and they would
arrest the proprietors, and

02:02.100 --> 02:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then probably write tickets
to the rest of the guys.

02:04.533 --> 02:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: How would
you have described the Detroit
Police Department back in 1967?

02:10.666 --> 02:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAN MCKANE: Well, it
was majority white male.

02:14.233 --> 02:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Tensions
between the police and
the African-American
community appeared

02:19.133 --> 02:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have reached their limit.

02:20.366 --> 02:22.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES:
It came to a boil.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
People were just tired
of being hassled.

02:24.533 --> 02:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They was tired of them coming
into their neighborhoods.

02:27.300 --> 02:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Loretta Holmes
was in that blind pig that
night, to welcome back soldiers

02:33.166 --> 02:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coming home from Vietnam.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Suddenly, police burst in.

02:36.133 --> 02:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: And then
I saw a sledgehammer
come through the door.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Next thing we know, the
police were in there.

02:41.833 --> 02:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They took us downstairs.

02:44.133 --> 02:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
About four -- I would say three
or four paddy wagons parked.

02:47.433 --> 02:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And oh, my God, it was a
million people out there.

02:51.233 --> 02:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's like somebody got on
the bullhorn and said, come
to 12th and Clairmount.

02:58.166 --> 03:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The angry
crowd outside exploded into
five days of full-out violence.

03:03.800 --> 03:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"LIFE" magazine captured
15-year-old Frank
Robinson playing in the
rubble that was left

03:08.800 --> 03:10.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of 12th Street.

03:10.933 --> 03:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANK ROBINSON, Detroit: They
threw a couple bricks through
windows, and the police didn't

03:12.466 --> 03:13.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
come.

03:13.466 --> 03:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People saw an opportunity.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: And the
opportunity was to do what?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRANK ROBINSON: To loot.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It may have turned into a
racial situation later, but
from the beginning, it was just

03:22.966 --> 03:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people seeing an
opportunity to loot.

03:26.133 --> 03:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Detroit's
violent unrest was the largest
in the U.S. in about 100 years.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Violence had also
erupted earlier in
Newark and Los Angeles.

03:36.266 --> 03:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quickly, President Lyndon
Johnson named a commission
to explore the causes.

03:43.233 --> 03:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Named for its chair, Illinois
Governor Otto Kerner, the Kerner
Commission's only surviving

03:47.966 --> 03:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
member is former Oklahoma
Senator Fred Harris.

03:50.666 --> 03:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED HARRIS, Former Oklahoma
Senator: What we said was, we
can describe with particularity

03:55.633 --> 04:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the conditions that
exist in the places where
these riots occur, almost
criminally inferior

04:02.633 --> 04:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
schools, no jobs, housing
really terrible, and we have
to get at these kinds of basic

04:12.533 --> 04:13.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's certainly true again.

04:15.733 --> 04:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: What was
the biggest finding of the
Kerner Commission report?

04:18.166 --> 04:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED HARRIS: Our nation is
moving towards two societies,
one white, one black, separate

04:23.766 --> 04:25.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and unequal.

04:25.266 --> 04:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The report
was rejected by the president.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
None of its recommendations
were ever adopted.

04:30.433 --> 04:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHEILA COCKREL, Former Detroit
City Councilwoman: The fact that
it never went anywhere, that

04:33.300 --> 04:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it really didn't drive the
level of policy and drive the
level of people dealing with

04:40.900 --> 04:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
race, is a testament to
how deep-seated and how
tough it is to not only
have the conversations,

04:47.933 --> 04:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but to make the change
that would be required.

04:50.100 --> 04:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Sheila Cockrel,
who served on the Detroit
City Council for 15 years,

04:54.800 --> 04:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says white flight already
plaguing Detroit escalated
rapidly after the unrest.

05:01.733 --> 05:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Other forces were at play.

05:03.800 --> 05:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The auto industry was
hit by an oil crisis
and foreign competition.

05:08.066 --> 05:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were two decades
of government corruption.

05:11.233 --> 05:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2008 the global
financial crash hit
Detroit particularly hard.

05:18.166 --> 05:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, then, in 2013, Detroit
became the largest municipality
ever to file for bankruptcy.

05:24.033 --> 05:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Detroit police are
adamant that they are trying to
repair their relationship with

05:29.633 --> 05:31.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the public.

05:31.600 --> 05:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have trained police
officers in all 12 precincts to
build stronger community ties.

05:36.466 --> 05:37.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Officer Donald Parker.

05:37.666 --> 05:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you build trust
in a neighborhood?

05:40.000 --> 05:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD PARKER, Detroit Police
Department: Building now is us
filtering into the community,

05:44.700 --> 05:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying hi to Ms. Jones,
and saying, hey, we're
here, we're here, we're
touchable, we're reachable,

05:49.433 --> 05:51.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to let them know not
to be afraid of us.

05:51.933 --> 05:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The composition
of the force has also changed.

05:55.333 --> 05:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 1967, it was 5
percent African-American.

05:58.333 --> 06:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, it is about 65 percent
African-American, including
the chief, James Craig.

06:05.266 --> 06:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES CRAIG: Well, what happened
50 years ago, I can't say
would never happen in Detroit,

06:11.100 --> 06:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because there's still issues.

06:13.100 --> 06:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have one of the highest
poverty rates, and while we have
an above-average relationship

06:17.000 --> 06:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the community, there's
the issue of opportunities.

06:21.033 --> 06:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while that's getting better
and while the city has made
a major turnaround, there's

06:28.066 --> 06:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still this belief that, while
the turnaround is happening
in certain parts of the city,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's not in others.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: A sign of
the work remaining to be done:
Detroit's poverty rate is double

06:36.966 --> 06:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what it was in 1967.

06:39.533 --> 06:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city struggles with
segregation, inadequate
housing and has the
lowest school test scores

06:45.566 --> 06:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and graduation
rates in the nation.

06:52.500 --> 06:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anika Goss-Foster is with Future
City Detroit, which imagines
modern-day uses for blighted

06:58.666 --> 07:00.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
properties.

07:00.366 --> 07:02.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Goss-Foster's focus
is the next 50 years.

07:02.866 --> 07:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANIKA GOSS-FOSTER, Detroit
Future City: We call
them dinosaurs, where
there are old monster

07:06.766 --> 07:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plants that are now sitting
vacant in the middle of
residential neighborhoods.

07:11.266 --> 07:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: The old Packard
plant, a dinosaur, abandoned
since the 1990s, is being

07:18.300 --> 07:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
developed into the shops
and galleries in hopes of
reviving the neighborhood.

07:21.633 --> 07:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANIKA GOSS-FOSTER: Things aren't
happening the way as quickly
as they want it to happen.

07:25.033 --> 07:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they certainly aren't
happening at a rate
where it should happen.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you really pushed,
there are a lot of good things
happening all over the city.

07:35.200 --> 07:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are parks that are
being taken care of that have
never been taken care of bore.

07:39.266 --> 07:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The city is completely lit.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are much more involved
in their neighborhoods
than they have ever been.

07:45.900 --> 07:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN:
Entrepreneurs and business
leaders have transformed
7.2 miles of downtown

07:52.866 --> 07:57.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into a booming neighborhood that
has attracted tourists, tech
start-ups and new businesses.

07:59.066 --> 08:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the boom hasn't yet trickled
down into the neighborhoods
that Goss-Foster is trying

08:03.466 --> 08:05.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to develop.

08:05.466 --> 08:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANIKA GOSS-FOSTER: I think
that there are a lot of black
people that would say they

08:07.166 --> 08:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do feel left out.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I wouldn't say that
they feel ignored.

08:10.533 --> 08:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think they feel like,
when is it my turn?

08:14.300 --> 08:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Right,

ANIKA GOSS-FOSTER: To
get the same kind of
attention and investment.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Neglect felt
firsthand by Loretta Holmes.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: We
don't have anything.

08:25.500 --> 08:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's nothing there anymore.

08:26.966 --> 08:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: So, what
happened to the neighborhoods?

08:29.200 --> 08:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES:
People moved out.

08:31.433 --> 08:32.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People moved out.

08:32.866 --> 08:33.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They left.

08:33.866 --> 08:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They walked away.

08:34.866 --> 08:36.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No kept the property up.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Loretta
Holmes stayed behind.

08:38.966 --> 08:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: We
were in Central.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were totally a community.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We were a community.

08:44.633 --> 08:46.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what we did.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We took care of each other.

08:48.366 --> 08:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: She mentors
students at her alma mater,
Detroit's Central High.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: We
give scholarships.

08:54.733 --> 08:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We go ahead and we will buy the
jerseys for the football team.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kids that doesn't have a
coat, we do it undercover,
because we don't want
the other kids to know.

09:05.900 --> 09:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Her investment
in kids is what gives her
hope for a better future for

09:09.333 --> 09:10.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Detroit.

09:10.733 --> 09:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is the city of Detroit
better off today than it was?

09:12.633 --> 09:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: Heck no.

09:13.633 --> 09:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: In the '60s?

09:14.633 --> 09:16.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES: No.

09:16.700 --> 09:17.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, because it's...

09:19.233 --> 09:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Better
off than five years ago?

09:21.900 --> 09:24.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LORETTA HOLMES:
Than five years ago?

09:24.466 --> 09:26.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, because now I
can see the change.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really can.

09:28.700 --> 09:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLEDAD O'BRIEN: Change that,
for a city with a history of
racial conflict and struggle,

09:34.366 --> 09:36.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is long overdue.

09:36.333 --> 09:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
