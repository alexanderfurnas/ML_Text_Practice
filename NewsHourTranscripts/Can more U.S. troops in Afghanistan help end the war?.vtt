JUDY WOODRUFF: The Trump
administration, as you
heard, is taking steps
to increasing America's

00:04.266 --> 00:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military presence in
Afghanistan, after years of
reducing U.S. forces there.

00:10.133 --> 00:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

00:12.066 --> 00:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Since taking
office, the Trump administration
has been conducting a

00:15.100 --> 00:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
review of America's
16-year war in Afghanistan.

00:19.200 --> 00:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The current U.S. commander
there, General John Nicholson,
has recommended sending 3,000

00:23.666 --> 00:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to 5,000 more troops to augment
the 10,000 Americans and
3,000 allied forces that are

00:29.400 --> 00:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
already in the country.

00:32.000 --> 00:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Defense Secretary
James Mattis announced
that the president had now
given him the authority

00:36.700 --> 00:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to decide appropriate
troop levels.

00:38.733 --> 00:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on all of this, we
turn to retired Lieutenant
General Douglas Lute.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served on the National
Security Council staffs in both
the George W. Bush and Barack

00:46.366 --> 00:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama administrations, where
he focused on Afghanistan,
Iraq, and South Asia.

00:51.166 --> 00:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the past four years, he
served as U.S. ambassador to
NATO, and he's now a senior

00:55.366 --> 00:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fellow at Harvard University.

00:57.233 --> 00:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

00:58.233 --> 00:59.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

00:59.233 --> 01:01.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

01:01.266 --> 01:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE (RET.),
Former U.S. Ambassador
to NATO: Good to be here.

01:03.233 --> 01:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, let's talk
first off about this decision
by the president to hand

01:05.266 --> 01:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
General -- or Secretary
of Defense James Mattis
the decision-making
for troop levels.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How unusual is that?

01:10.233 --> 01:11.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

01:11.233 --> 01:13.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

01:13.233 --> 01:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, it is
unusual, but I think we should
first appreciate that we should

01:15.233 --> 01:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have confidence in the entire
Pentagon chain of command,
starting with Secretary Mattis,

01:19.733 --> 01:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but all the way down through
Central Command, and then
ultimately to General Nicholson,

01:24.400 --> 01:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mick Nicholson, who you
mentioned, who is our
commander, four-star
commander in Afghanistan.

01:27.800 --> 01:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is a very experienced
team, responsible individuals.

01:31.566 --> 01:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're going to take this,
this new authority seriously.

01:34.633 --> 01:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I also think there is a logic.

01:37.300 --> 01:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is a rationale to
providing the Pentagon
some flexibility.

01:41.266 --> 01:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It gives them more agility to
fit the number of troops to
the task in Afghanistan, and

01:47.500 --> 01:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that all makes sense.

01:49.566 --> 01:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It does, however, raise one
concern, and that's the concern
that strategy is made up of a

01:54.733 --> 01:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot more than just
the Pentagon piece.

01:57.400 --> 02:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I would be concerned,
or I would be interested in
hearing how the administration

02:02.000 --> 02:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intends to make sure that the
other pieces, the political side
of the equation, the diplomatic

02:06.966 --> 02:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
equation, the economic
assistance equation,
the intelligence
community's role, how all

02:11.666 --> 02:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these various pieces are fit
together in a coherent hole.

02:14.100 --> 02:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, you
raise a very good question,
because, traditionally, we think

02:16.966 --> 02:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a strategy being set from
the top, from the president,
with advice from all of the

02:21.166 --> 02:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
relevant agencies below.

02:23.566 --> 02:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think this does
to the decision-making process
for a country like Afghanistan?

02:27.500 --> 02:28.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

02:29.933 --> 02:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, I think
it's too soon to tell.

02:31.966 --> 02:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The traditional role is that
the National Security Council
would have this oversight

02:34.333 --> 02:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role, this coordinating role,
to make sure that the strategy
stays aligned over time

02:38.833 --> 02:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and that all the pieces
relate to one another
in a coherent way.

02:43.366 --> 02:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not clear whether this
move to give additional
authorities, additional
autonomy to the Pentagon

02:50.433 --> 02:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is just the opening step, or
whether there will still be a
role for the NSC, the National

02:53.933 --> 02:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security Council, led
by H.R. McMaster, to
oversee the whole process.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, we have
said Mattis and Nicholson
both believe that more U.S.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
troops to Afghanistan
is a good idea.

03:05.166 --> 03:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you share that belief?

03:06.366 --> 03:07.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

03:07.366 --> 03:09.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

03:09.433 --> 03:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, I think a
few more -- a few thousand or
even 10,000 more U.S. troops...

03:12.300 --> 03:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Ten thousand more?

03:13.633 --> 03:14.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

03:14.633 --> 03:16.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

03:16.700 --> 03:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: I'm saying that
I think that, hypothetically,
an increase on that scale,

03:19.266 --> 03:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's say, for example, a
doubling of U.S. troops -- there
are some 8,500 there now -- can

03:25.400 --> 03:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
help sustain the current
security stalemate.

03:28.500 --> 03:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't believe that
troops alone will actually
be decisive in the end.

03:34.366 --> 03:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Troops alone can't win this war.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Troops alone will not
remove the stalemate.

03:39.433 --> 03:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The stalemate fundamentally
rests on the political
side of the equation.

03:43.200 --> 03:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, alongside any
military surge, any --
the addition of any number
of U.S. troops, I will

03:50.266 --> 03:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be very interested to hear the
administration's ambitions in
terms of how they're going to

03:53.433 --> 03:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deal with the politics.

03:55.566 --> 03:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, explain
what the challenges are there
for the politics in Afghanistan.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, I look
at this as a three-part
equation on the political side.

04:03.333 --> 04:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, first of all, inside the
Afghan government itself, here
you have zero-sum politics among

04:08.966 --> 04:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the different national players.

04:10.733 --> 04:12.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have a high
level of corruption.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have the patronage network.

04:15.033 --> 04:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have a long period
of time where you have
actually had stalemate
from the central government

04:21.066 --> 04:23.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
itself.

04:23.566 --> 04:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second, you have stalemate
between Afghanistan
and its neighboring
states, most prominently

04:27.033 --> 04:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pakistan, but not just Pakistan.

04:29.066 --> 04:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We only have to look at the map
and see the geographic equation
here, which includes Iran

04:35.166 --> 04:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the west, Central Asia,
and Russia to the north, and
beyond, to the northeast China,

04:42.933 --> 04:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and further to the east, India.

04:44.433 --> 04:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this is a very complex
regional diplomatic equation.

04:48.933 --> 04:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All those players I have just
mention have some impact on
what happens inside Afghanistan.

04:53.166 --> 04:58.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then, ultimately,
to bring this war to a
conclusion, a political
end, which the military

05:00.166 --> 05:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
equation should be in support
of, it involves politics between
the Afghan government and

05:04.900 --> 05:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Taliban, the opponent.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so on all three of
these fronts, inside
Kabul, in the region, and
between the government

05:11.066 --> 05:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the insurgents, there's a
real need for a political surge.

05:14.266 --> 05:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Among those
neighbors, Pakistan obviously
looms very large in Afghanistan,

05:18.533 --> 05:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and provide a consistent safe
haven for the Taliban that are
waging this massive insurgency

05:23.433 --> 05:24.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the country.

05:24.900 --> 05:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How can the U.S. get Pakistan
to help us in that fight?

05:29.100 --> 05:30.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, first of
all, I think you have to place
our requirements, our demands

05:34.166 --> 05:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Pakistan in this part of
the arena, that is, their
support for the Taliban, in the

05:40.866 --> 05:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
context of our other
interests in Pakistan.

05:43.533 --> 05:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we actually have several
interests in Pakistan which
I think surpass our interest

05:49.666 --> 05:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in dealing with
the Afghan Taliban.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would label Pakistan's
internal stability itself.

05:55.333 --> 06:00.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Here you have more than
180 million Pakistanis
in a country where you
have not just the Afghan

06:02.333 --> 06:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Taliban, but the Pakistani
Taliban, remnants of al-Qaida,
and other regional terrorist

06:08.400 --> 06:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
groups, all of which threaten
the stability of the state.

06:09.633 --> 06:10.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A
nuclear-powered state.

06:10.966 --> 06:11.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

06:11.966 --> 06:14.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

06:14.533 --> 06:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: And a state
which has the fastest
growing, the fastest
expanding nuclear arsenal

06:16.200 --> 06:18.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the world.

06:18.233 --> 06:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that very dangerous cocktail
of terrorists, extremists, and
nuclear weapons is actually

06:24.500 --> 06:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
probably more of a
vital national interest
to us than Pakistan's
support for the Afghan

06:29.966 --> 06:31.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Taliban.

06:31.966 --> 06:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's a large array
of complex interests
here which are at play.

06:34.633 --> 06:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Even if the
administration articulates a
strategy, do you think that

06:38.000 --> 06:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this administration can
execute that strategy?

06:40.333 --> 06:41.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

06:41.333 --> 06:43.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

06:43.366 --> 06:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS LUTE: Well, I
think, right now, they're
working with a handicap.

06:45.433 --> 06:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is, while the National
Security Council itself, those
who set strategy and overwatch

06:49.100 --> 06:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the strategy, is largely
in place, the implementers
of the strategy are
largely not in place,

06:56.633 --> 06:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they have a
large number of vacancies
among those officials who
are yet to be nominated

06:59.733 --> 07:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and confirmed by the
Senate, especially in
the Defense Department
and the State Department.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Former

thank you very much.
