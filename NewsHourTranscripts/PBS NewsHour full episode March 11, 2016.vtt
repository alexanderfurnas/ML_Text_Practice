HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.173 --> 00:10.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Republicans hold
a civil debate before next
week's crucial

00:10.344 --> 00:14.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primaries, while Ben Carson
becomes the second
former rival to endorse
front-runner Donald

00:14.882 --> 00:16.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

00:16.717 --> 00:21.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm Judy Woodruff
here at the
site of Nancy Reagan's funeral
in California,

00:21.488 --> 00:25.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where a nation said farewell to
an influential
first lady.

00:25.659 --> 00:29.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES BAKER, Former U.S.
Secretary of State:
She had an instinct for reading
people that

00:29.830 --> 00:36.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president knew he lacked.
"Nancy," he
wrote, "sees the goodness in
people, but she

00:36.937 --> 00:41.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also has an extra instinct that
allows her
to see the flaws."

00:41.708 --> 00:45.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's Friday.
Mark Shields
and David Brooks are here to
analyze the week's

00:45.579 --> 00:47.314 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

00:47.347 --> 00:51.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead, Miles O'Brien's rare
look inside
Fukushima. Five years after the
meltdown,

00:51.718 --> 00:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the historic cleanup continues.

00:53.487 --> 00:57.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAKE BARRETT, TEPCO Adviser: I
believe it
can be done. It can be done
safely and it

00:57.090 --> 01:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can be done successfully. But
nothing of this
magnitude has ever been done by
mankind.

01:01.128 --> 01:08.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:08.635 --> 01:11.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:11.505 --> 01:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Republican
candidates past
and present were out on the
stump today, all

01:19.947 --> 01:25.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eyes are on key states, like
Florida and Ohio,
set to vote in the primary on
Tuesday.

01:25.152 --> 01:30.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I just want to introduce Dr. Ben
Carson, a

01:30.290 --> 01:34.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
special, special person, a
special man.

01:34.461 --> 01:36.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Republican
front-runner
Donald Trump proudly presented
his latest

01:38.665 --> 01:42.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big-name endorsement in Palm
Beach this morning,
former rival Ben Carson.

01:42.402 --> 01:45.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARSON (R), Presidential
Candidate: There
are two different Donald Trumps.
There's the

01:45.572 --> 01:53.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one you see on the stage, and
there's the
one who is very cerebral, sits
there and considers

01:54.014 --> 02:00.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things very carefully. You can
have a very
good conversation with him. And
that's the

02:00.754 --> 02:04.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump that you're going
to start seeing
more and more of.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Ben, thank you.

02:06.226 --> 02:09.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Trump embraced
the endorsement
and said it was a sign
Republicans are getting

02:09.896 --> 02:11.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behind his campaign.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I have been
hearing from virtually
everybody in the Republican
Party, and they

02:15.969 --> 02:18.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are congratulating me. And they
are saying,
we're going to get together.

02:18.605 --> 02:22.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He was coming
off yet another
Republican debate, where the
tone shifted

02:22.876 --> 02:25.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to near civility, dialing back
on the bravado.

02:25.412 --> 02:29.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And so far, I
cannot believe
how civil it's been up here.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:30.984 --> 02:34.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But his rivals
weren't willing
to concede anything. Ohio
Governor John Kasich

02:34.821 --> 02:38.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leads in the polls in the
Buckeye State, one
of five holding their primaries
next Tuesday.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, first of all, let's not --
you know,

02:40.961 --> 02:44.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
math doesn't tell the whole
story in politics.
You have to earn the delegates
in order to

02:44.731 --> 02:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be picked. But let's not get
ahead of ourselves.
We don't know what's going to
happen, because

02:48.402 --> 02:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we still have about half the
delegates to
be selected. And that's what's
going to be

02:52.339 --> 02:57.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very interesting thing to see
how it all
turns out as we move forward
over the next

02:57.344 --> 02:59.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
couple of weeks.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Texas Senator
Ted Cruz argued
only he has the chance to beat
Trump.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
There are only two of us that
have a path

03:04.851 --> 03:12.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to winning the nomination,
Donald and myself.
At this point, I have roughly
360 delegates.

03:12.292 --> 03:17.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has about 100 more than I
have. We have
at this point beaten Donald in
eight separate

03:17.631 --> 03:19.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
states all over the country

03:19.433 --> 03:22.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I watch Ted on
television and
when he speaks, and he's always
saying, "I'm

03:22.769 --> 03:27.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the only one that beat Donald in
six contests,
and I beat him."

03:27.607 --> 03:30.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I beat him in 13 contests.
He never mentions
that.

03:30.177 --> 03:31.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:31.945 --> 03:35.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Trump also
responded to
violence against protesters at
his rallies,

03:35.615 --> 03:37.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including one assault caught on
videotape
Wednesday.

03:37.884 --> 03:41.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAKE TAPPER, CNN: Some of your
critics point
to quotes that you have made at
these debates

03:41.188 --> 03:46.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- at these rallies, including
February 23,
"I would like to punch him in
the face," referring

03:46.560 --> 03:51.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a protester, February 27, "In
the good
old days, they'd have ripped him
out of that

03:51.098 --> 03:55.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seat so fast," February 1,
"Knock the crap
out of him, would, you?
Seriously, OK, just

03:55.569 --> 04:00.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knock the hell -- I promise you
I will pay
for the legal fees. I promise, I
promise."

04:00.807 --> 04:03.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Trump didn't
condone the
violence, but said:

04:03.076 --> 04:08.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We had a couple
big, strong,
powerful guys doing damage to
people, not

04:08.715 --> 04:13.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
only the loudness -- the
loudness, I don't
mind -- but doing serious
damage. And if they

04:13.487 --> 04:17.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have got to be taken out, I --
to be honest,
I mean, we have to run
something.

04:17.290 --> 04:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And today at
Trump's rally
in Saint Louis, protesters
employed a new

04:21.795 --> 04:25.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tactic, staggering their
interruptions one
at a time throughout Trump's
remarks.

04:25.465 --> 04:29.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We better get our
country going,
folks, because that's the kind
of stuff -- it's

04:29.769 --> 04:32.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taking us down. It's taking us
down fast.

04:32.772 --> 04:37.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Florida
Senator Marco Rubio
urged voters to consider the
impact of their

04:37.177 --> 04:41.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choices on Tuesday and how to
vote in both
his home state and in Ohio.

04:41.381 --> 04:44.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
If a voter in Ohio is motivated
by stopping

04:44.184 --> 04:48.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump and comes to the
conclusion that
John Kasich is the only one who
can beat him

04:48.054 --> 04:51.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, then I expect that is the
decision
they will make. I can tell you
that, in Florida,

04:51.525 --> 04:55.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm the only one that can stop
Donald Trump,
and whether someone supports Ted
Cruz or John

04:55.595 --> 04:58.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich,, if you vote for them in
Florida,
you're in essence voting for
Donald Trump.

04:58.765 --> 05:02.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if a voter reaches the same
conclusion
in Ohio, then I think that's
what they're

05:02.435 --> 05:04.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to do as well.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Without wins
in their home
states, Rubio and Kasich face
the end of the

05:06.973 --> 05:08.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
road for their runs.

05:08.808 --> 05:13.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, on the Democratic
side, Vermont
Senator Bernie Sanders courted
voters in North

05:13.346 --> 05:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Carolina, Ohio and Illinois.

05:16.650 --> 05:20.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But former Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton
put aside campaigning today to
attend the

05:20.787 --> 05:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
funeral of fellow first lady
Nancy Reagan
in California.

05:24.824 --> 05:29.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will get Mark Shields and
David Brooks'
take on the state of the
presidential race

05:29.362 --> 05:31.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
later in the program.

05:31.431 --> 05:35.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news, there
was little
relief for the residents in
flood-stricken

05:35.602 --> 05:40.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South, as overnight downpours
brought total
rainfall to two feet in some
places. In Monroe,

05:40.840 --> 05:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Louisiana one of the hardest-hit
communities,
floodwaters caused major damage,
uprooting

05:44.711 --> 05:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trees and collapsing roads.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the National Weather
Service warned
more rain is on the way this
weekend. Some

05:51.017 --> 05:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
places along the Alabama coast
could see six
additional inches.

05:54.854 --> 06:00.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. warned today, South
Sudan has become
one of the most horrendous human
rights situations

06:00.927 --> 06:07.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the world. The new report
detailed atrocities
by government forces, including
cases of children

06:07.200 --> 06:12.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and disabled people being burned
alive and
parents forced to watch as their
children

06:12.939 --> 06:14.674 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were raped.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The country has been mired in a
civil war
since 2013, leaving tens of
thousands dead

06:18.144 --> 06:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and millions more displaced.

06:19.946 --> 06:24.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with David Marshall,
coordinator of
a U.N. human rights mission to
South Sudan,

06:24.751 --> 06:26.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
via Skype earlier today.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID MARSHALL, U.N. Coordinator
for South
Sudan: Our findings were quite
stark, that

06:29.990 --> 06:34.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war crimes and crimes against
humanity have
been perpetrated in 2015 by the
government.

06:34.961 --> 06:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government has instilled or
undertaken
a campaign of terror in the
country to displace,

06:40.800 --> 06:44.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kill, rape, loot and destroy
civilian property.

06:44.704 --> 06:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: To see our
full interview

atrocities in South

Sudan, visit our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

06:49.976 --> 06:56.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The number of North Korean
cyber-attacks on
the South have doubled over the
past month.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Korean intelligence
officials sounded
that warning today to
parliamentary lawmakers.

06:59.719 --> 07:05.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said the North tried, but
failed to hack
into their railway control
system and computer

07:05.258 --> 07:10.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
networks of financial
institutions. The hackers
also stole information from the
smartphones

07:10.363 --> 07:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of dozens of South Korean
officials.

07:13.500 --> 07:19.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama nominated U.S.
Army General
Curtis Scaparrotti to be NATO's
new top military

07:19.172 --> 07:24.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
commander. Scaparrotti,
currently commander
of U.S. forces in South Korea,
will succeed

07:24.210 --> 07:29.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Air Force General Philip
Breedlove as
NATO's supreme allied commander
of Europe.

07:29.416 --> 07:35.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nomination, pending Senate
approval, comes
amid ongoing tensions with
Russia and a refugee

07:35.555 --> 07:37.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crisis plaguing Europe.

07:37.724 --> 07:43.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A South African man says his son
may have
found a piece of missing
Malaysia Airlines

07:43.096 --> 07:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flight 370 in Mozambique. The
teenager found
the part on December 30 in the
town of Xai-Xai,

07:50.003 --> 07:54.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands of miles from the
flight's last
known coordinates. The piece has
a five-digit

07:54.941 --> 07:59.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number on it, which authorities
said indicates
it may belong to a Boeing 777.
Officials are

07:59.479 --> 08:02.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sending it to Australia to be
examined.

08:02.082 --> 08:07.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Japan today, mourners marked
the fifth
anniversary of the 2011
earthquake and tsunami

08:07.454 --> 08:12.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that killed more than 18,000
people. The country's
northeast coastline was
devastated, and still

08:12.759 --> 08:14.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hasn't been fully rebuilt.

08:14.794 --> 08:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Japanese officials, including
Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe, held a moment of
silence in Tokyo.

08:19.632 --> 08:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He struck a positive tone in a
speech at the
altar for victims.

08:23.670 --> 08:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHINZO ABE, Japanese Prime
Minister (through
translator): In the past, our
nation suffered

08:28.308 --> 08:32.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countless disasters that could
be described
as national crises, but overcame
them each

08:32.979 --> 08:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time with determination and
hope. I vow once
again that we will follow hand
in hand in

08:37.584 --> 08:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the footsteps of our forefathers
and continue
to move forward.

08:40.487 --> 08:44.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
anniversary also sparked
protests against nuclear power,
after the

08:44.824 --> 08:48.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meltdown at the Fukushima
Daiichi power plant.
We will have more on the cleanup
efforts there

08:48.995 --> 08:50.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
later in the program tonight.

08:50.964 --> 08:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Department of Health and
Human Services
pledged $94 million to help
fight against

08:55.769 --> 09:01.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heroin and opioid drug abuse.
The money will
go to 271 centers across the
country and be

09:01.708 --> 09:08.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used to treat roughly 124,000
new patients.
It comes a day after the Senate
overwhelmingly

09:08.481 --> 09:14.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passed a bill to help state and
local programs,
but that measure didn't include
any new funds.

09:14.788 --> 09:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The world anti-doping agency
announced there
have been 99 positive tests for
meldonium

09:20.627 --> 09:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this year. That includes Russian
tennis star
Maria Sharapova's sample. The
blood-flow-boosting

09:26.466 --> 09:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drug was banned on January 1 for
its performance-enhancing
benefits. Sharapova admitted
she's been taking

09:33.039 --> 09:36.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it for a decade for health
issues, but didn't
know it had been banned.

09:36.743 --> 09:41.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least seven of the confirmed
cases come
from Russian athletes. Those who
test positive

09:41.915 --> 09:44.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
face up to a four-year ban.

09:44.751 --> 09:49.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stocks closed higher on Wall
Street today
to round out a four-week rally.
The Dow Jones

09:49.456 --> 09:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
industrial average gained 218
points to close
at 17213. The Nasdaq rose 86
points, and the

09:56.429 --> 10:01.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
S&amp;P 500 gained 32. For the week,
the Dow and
the S&amp;P gained more than a
percent. The Nasdaq

10:01.568 --> 10:04.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rose just under a percent.

10:04.070 --> 10:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after his year in space,
astronaut Scott
Kelly has announced his
retirement. NASA said

10:08.975 --> 10:13.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he will retire on April 1. Kelly
worked for
NASA for nearly 20 years. Kelly
also holds

10:13.880 --> 10:19.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the American record for the most
cumulative
time in space at 520 days.

10:19.219 --> 10:23.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
first lady
Nancy Reagan laid to rest; Mark
Shields and

10:24.023 --> 10:29.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brooks analyze the week in
news; the
cleanup continues five years
after the Fukushima

10:29.429 --> 10:39.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nuclear plant disaster; and much
more.

10:39.472 --> 10:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nuclear plant disaster; and much
more.

10:44.744 --> 10:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were recollections and
prayers today
for first lady Nancy Reagan at
her funeral

10:48.515 --> 10:51.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service held in the hill country
northwest
of Los Angeles.

10:52.018 --> 10:57.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Family, friends and first ladies
past and
present were in attendance, as
well as President

10:57.457 --> 10:59.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
George W. Bush.

10:59.092 --> 11:03.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here are some excerpts from
today's service
at the Reagan Presidential
Library.

11:03.329 --> 11:16.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES BAKER, Former U.S.
Secretary of State:
We gather here today to say
goodbye to Nancy

11:16.976 --> 11:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Davis Reagan, a beautiful, smart
and gracious
woman, a woman who captured the
heart of a

11:25.051 --> 11:33.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man who loved his craft, his
country, and
his countrymen, and most
especially loved

11:33.526 --> 11:41.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this remarkable woman, a woman
without whom
Ronald Wilson Reagan would never
have become

11:41.067 --> 11:48.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 40th president of the United
States or
succeeded as well as he did.

11:48.508 --> 11:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She had an instinct for reading
people that
the president knew he lacked.
"Nancy," he

11:55.048 --> 12:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrote, "sees the goodness in
people, but she
also has an extra instinct that
allows her

12:01.955 --> 12:03.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to see the flaws."

12:03.823 --> 12:09.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only time I saw her lose her
composure
was the day the president was
shot. She was

12:09.362 --> 12:16.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devastated and, in fact, she
fell apart. President
Reagan left the hospital
convinced that God

12:16.035 --> 12:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had spared him for a special
purpose. And
the first lady left with a
fierce determination

12:23.142 --> 12:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to protect him in every way that
she possibly
could.

12:28.348 --> 12:35.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ronald and Nancy Reagan were
defined by their
love for each other. They were
as close to

12:35.488 --> 12:40.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being one person as it is
possible for any
two people to be.

12:40.093 --> 12:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTI DAVIS, Daughter of Nancy
Reagan: My
parents were two halves of a
circle closed

12:44.297 --> 12:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tight around a world in which
their love for
each other was the only
sustenance they needed.

12:50.637 --> 12:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While they might venture out and
include others
in their orbit, no one truly
crossed the boundary

12:55.642 --> 12:58.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into the space they held as
theirs.

12:58.211 --> 13:05.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's no secret that my mother
and I had a
challenging and often
contentious relationship.

13:05.051 --> 13:11.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our emotions burned up the color
chart. Nothing
was ever gray. But there were
moments in our

13:11.924 --> 13:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history when all that was going
on between
us was love. I choose to
remember those moments.

13:18.865 --> 13:22.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON REAGAN, Son of Nancy Reagan:
And, today,
my mother comes to rest on this
lovely hilltop

13:22.702 --> 13:28.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with its far-reaching views next
to her beloved
Ronald Reagan Library.

13:28.441 --> 13:35.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, from here, she
will be able
to keep an eye on things.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most importantly, she will once
again lay
down beside the man who was the
love of her

13:39.318 --> 13:46.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life, the one she loved until
the end of her
days.

13:46.492 --> 13:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will watch the sun drop
over the hills
in the west toward the sea, and,
as night

13:53.533 --> 13:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
falls, they will look out across
the valley.
My father will tell her that the
lights below

13:57.303 --> 14:04.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are her jewels. The moon and
stars will endlessly
turn overhead, and here they
will stay, as

14:04.811 --> 14:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they always wished it to be,
resting in each
other's arms, only each other's
arms, until

14:12.051 --> 14:14.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the end of time.

14:14.253 --> 14:20.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Judy Woodruff
attended the
service today, and she joins me
now from Simi

14:20.827 --> 14:21.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Valley.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy, your thoughts on what
happened.

14:23.730 --> 14:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Hari, it's
raining now,
but the sun was shining brightly
as this funeral

14:29.802 --> 14:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service unfolded here at the
Reagan -- Ronald
Reagan Library in Simi Valley.

14:35.041 --> 14:39.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the most beautifully
choreographed
funeral, if you want to put it
that way, that

14:39.812 --> 14:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one could imagine. The flowers
on the casket
were spectacular. The crowd was
full of celebrities

14:46.919 --> 14:53.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and people who served in the
Reagan administration,
a number of influential
Republicans.

14:53.192 --> 14:58.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The service was poignant and it
was funny.
There were a lot of funny
stories about Nancy

14:58.564 --> 15:04.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Ronald Reagan and how close
they were.
All in all, it was classic Nancy
Reagan.

15:04.737 --> 15:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, Judy,
Nancy had a lot
to do in the planning and
orchestrating who

15:09.041 --> 15:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would do what at this ceremony,
right?

15:11.944 --> 15:13.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Exactly.

15:13.813 --> 15:18.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people -- people who know
her said this
-- again, this was just like
what you would

15:18.584 --> 15:23.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expect from the former first
lady. She was
close to her husband. She wanted
to make sure

15:23.890 --> 15:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything was perfect for her
husband, and
she carried that on through the
rest of her

15:28.094 --> 15:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life until his death a little
over 10 years
ago.

15:31.430 --> 15:36.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she felt the same way about
her legacy,
because she saw it connected to
his, so she

15:36.969 --> 15:43.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted today's ceremony, this
service to reflect
the two of them, and that's
really what it

15:43.776 --> 15:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was. It was planned to the T, to
the program,
to who the speakers were, the
music, the minister,

15:50.283 --> 15:56.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything, in a spectacular
setting here
in the Santa Lucia Mountains in
California.

15:56.656 --> 16:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Was this a
reunion of Reagan
administration staff or were
there people

16:01.127 --> 16:03.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from across the aisle as well?

16:03.262 --> 16:09.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there were
both, the
Reagan administration
represented by Secretary

16:09.435 --> 16:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of State James Baker, people
like Ed Meese,
who were part of the Reagan
White House, so

16:14.607 --> 16:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many of the press corps who
covered the Reagan
White House, as I did.

16:18.911 --> 16:25.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a collection of the
Reagan family,
in addition to the staff and the
press. But

16:25.985 --> 16:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there were Democrats here as
well. We saw
-- in fact, I saw Vicki Kennedy,
the widow

16:34.493 --> 16:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of senator Ted Kennedy, here,
and a number
of others.

16:39.298 --> 16:45.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it wasn't, I would say, a
partisan event,
but it was very -- it was heavy
on Republicans,

16:45.471 --> 16:50.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is exactly what you would
expect from
the widow of this president who
represented

16:50.476 --> 16:53.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Republican -- a Republican
icon.

16:53.179 --> 16:56.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Judy, I want
to bring syndicated columnist
Mark Shields

16:56.182 --> 16:58.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks
in on this conversation.

16:58.951 --> 17:03.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark, your thoughts on the
passing of Nancy
Reagan? This happened after we
taped the show

17:03.356 --> 17:05.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last week.

17:05.191 --> 17:10.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Just to add -- to
fill out the
point about being bipartisan,
Governor Jerry

17:10.997 --> 17:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brown was there, whose dad
Ronald Reagan had
defeated to become governor in
1966, the current

17:17.536 --> 17:23.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
governor, then Democrat of
California, along
with Rosalynn Carter, the first
lady, and

17:23.776 --> 17:28.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as, of course, Hillary
Clinton, the
former first lady and
front-runner for the

17:28.047 --> 17:29.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Democratic nomination.

17:29.916 --> 17:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Nancy Reagan, the irony to
me is that
Ronald Reagan is the first of
the 44 presidents

17:36.222 --> 17:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and only divorced man ever
elected, and yet
they are remembered as a couple,
an incredibly

17:41.360 --> 17:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devoted couple, for better, for
worse, in
sickness and health couple. She
was a formidable

17:48.034 --> 17:49.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presence.

17:49.802 --> 17:54.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I had met her. I didn't
know her.
Judy knew her well. But she was
a formidable

17:54.206 --> 17:59.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
force in personnel choice in the
administration,
in the White House.

17:59.745 --> 18:03.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she was responsible for what
may have
been Ronald Reagan's, in many
respects, most

18:03.883 --> 18:09.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important hire, that of Jim
Baker, as chief
of staff, who had run,
ironically, the first

18:09.522 --> 18:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- the last two campaigns
against Ronald Reagan,
that of George H.W. Bush in 1980
for the nomination,

18:15.227 --> 18:17.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for Gerald Ford in 1976, even.

18:17.797 --> 18:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later -- but she reached across.
She recognized
talent and thought it was in the
best interest

18:22.969 --> 18:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Ronnie, her Ronnie, as she
called him,
to have Jim Baker. And I think
it was a wise

18:26.772 --> 18:28.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decision.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. I am reminded
of the Tom
Cruise line that "You complete
me."

18:30.876 --> 18:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They really did complete each
other. And that
was also for better or worse. It
was such

18:34.380 --> 18:39.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a self-enclosed, a beautiful
love, a tremendously
fulfilling love for both of
them. But they

18:39.819 --> 18:42.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sort of completed each other's
emotional needs.

18:42.488 --> 18:45.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so some people were shut
out. And Patti
Davis and some of the Reagan
staff thought

18:45.992 --> 18:50.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were shut out from that.
And along with
that love was a ferocity, as
Mark said, a

18:50.563 --> 18:52.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
protectiveness.

18:52.398 --> 18:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have noticed, in all first
ladies, they
are always more aggressive on
behalf of their

18:55.334 --> 18:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
husbands than the presidents are
themselves.
They're always the tougher
presence in the

18:59.438 --> 19:03.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House. They're willing to
get rid of
people. And Nancy Reagan was
certainly willing

19:03.275 --> 19:06.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get rid of people who were
not serving,
she felt, her husband well.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it was the power of her love
and the grace
of her presence. I'm not
surprised to hear

19:09.849 --> 19:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Judy said. If you remember
those state
dinners in the Reagan years,
they were always

19:13.319 --> 19:20.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extremely glamorous for the
Republicans. And
she was sort of the architect of
those.

19:20.426 --> 19:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: She liked being
first lady.
She liked Washington. And it
came through.

19:25.031 --> 19:31.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we in Washington, the
permanent Washington,
whatever we are, we tire of
people who spend

19:31.737 --> 19:35.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
time, effort, energy and
millions of dollars
to get here to tell us how much
they hate

19:35.541 --> 19:40.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it and how unhappy they are
here. She really
was happy as first lady.

19:40.579 --> 19:46.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Judy, was
there a moment
that stood out for you?

19:46.285 --> 19:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there were
several.

19:48.087 --> 19:49.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm listening to David and Mark
speak about
the relationship between the
Reagans. They

19:50.022 --> 19:56.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were as close -- I think Jim
Baker said it
here -- as close as two people
could be and

19:56.729 --> 19:58.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not be one person.

19:58.531 --> 20:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the point about their circle
of closeness
was so impenetrable, in the
words of their

20:05.504 --> 20:10.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
son Ron Reagan, that no one else
could get
through, including their
children. And that

20:10.976 --> 20:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came through in a very poignant
way in what
both children said about how
they felt -- they

20:16.549 --> 20:22.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loved their parents, but they
knew who came
first, and that was their
parents. It was

20:22.955 --> 20:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president and the first
lady.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Judy, thanks
so much. We will see you back
here on Monday.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: See you then.

20:30.196 --> 20:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
well, let's continue
the conversation about the week
in politics.

20:35.000 --> 20:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night's GOP debate could
have possibly
been on PBS. It was definitely a
different

20:39.538 --> 20:40.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tone, a different vibe.

20:40.539 --> 20:41.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:41.507 --> 20:42.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why do you
think that was?

20:42.842 --> 20:45.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, Alistair
Cooke as actually
moderating it.

20:45.277 --> 20:45.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

20:45.778 --> 20:47.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

20:47.546 --> 20:51.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was because the other
candidates
decided, especially Marco Rubio,
that if they

20:51.650 --> 20:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go after Trump the way they
were, personally,
just in the gutter, that they
end up hurting

20:56.122 --> 20:59.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
themselves. And I think there is
some evidence
for Rubio to that effect.

20:59.358 --> 21:02.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it was a more Rubio-style
debate. And
I thought he did well, because
it was a substantive

21:02.928 --> 21:06.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debate. It was more uplifting.
And he did
well, but not substantially well
enough to

21:06.699 --> 21:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change the nature of the race, I
don't think.

21:09.568 --> 21:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Not for the first
time observed
that the campaigns -- or
campaigns are like

21:15.541 --> 21:17.309 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
parallel skiing.

21:17.343 --> 21:23.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is, you're competing in
Ohio, while your
opponents are in Tampa, Florida,
or Dearborn,

21:23.249 --> 21:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michigan, and a debate brings
you all together.
This is the chance for you to
rearrange the

21:28.120 --> 21:30.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
standing, especially if you're
behind.

21:30.656 --> 21:34.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And last night, there was none
of that. I
mean, rather than PBS, I would
say it was

21:34.994 --> 21:39.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
C-SPAN subcommittee hearings on
the Subcommittee
on Weights and Measures. It was
about that

21:39.965 --> 21:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stimulating, instead of the past
debates,
which have been like the
housewives of the

21:43.936 --> 21:49.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jersey Shore, and you turn them
on expecting
for someone to throw a household
appliance

21:49.375 --> 21:51.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the other.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think -- to some degree, I
think David's
right. They found out that it
didn't work.

21:54.880 --> 22:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has worked for Donald Trump,
but it doesn't
work to be a mini-Trump, as
Marco Rubio proved.

22:00.586 --> 22:07.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, Hari, that may be
the opening
admission, acknowledgment that
Donald Trump

22:07.059 --> 22:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to be the nominee,
because if you
pass up a chance to really take
a shot and

22:12.831 --> 22:17.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try and change the chemistry
and the dynamic
of the race -- and you don't get
that many

22:17.136 --> 22:19.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opportunities, where everybody
is watching
at the same time.

22:20.005 --> 22:25.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the failure of people to
engage Trump
last night, almost an admission,
may be the

22:25.978 --> 22:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
beginning of the concession.

22:27.746 --> 22:30.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
little bit
about what's at stake coming up
Tuesday with

22:30.382 --> 22:34.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ohio and Florida, two big
otherwise general
battleground states.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, there were comments
made on stage
by Donald Trump saying, look,
two of us have

22:38.457 --> 22:40.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the possibility here, two of us
don't.

22:40.826 --> 22:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that basically the case in
terms of Governor
Kasich and Marco Rubio? If they
don't win

22:46.999 --> 22:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their home states, do they pack
up?

22:49.335 --> 22:51.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Rubio probably
does.

22:51.103 --> 22:54.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, if they win their home
states, then
Donald Trump has to get nearly
60 percent

22:54.373 --> 22:58.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the remaining delegates, or
nearly 70 percent
of the remaining delegates, and
that's a tall

22:58.777 --> 23:00.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

23:00.512 --> 23:04.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if they win there , if
Kasich and Rubio
win, then we're looking at going
into the

23:04.216 --> 23:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convention without at least a
clear nominee.
If they lose, I think Rubio
probably has to

23:09.054 --> 23:13.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get out. You get the sense, just
the vibe
this week that the air is a
little popping

23:13.993 --> 23:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of his campaign, a bad,
really bad event
in the football stadium, and
just a lot of

23:19.999 --> 23:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans sort of walking
away.

23:22.968 --> 23:26.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich, on the other hand, maybe
because he
started lower, he's still got
some energy

23:26.038 --> 23:30.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around his campaign. And so I
think he can
lose and hang in there. If it
was he, Cruz

23:30.843 --> 23:35.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Trump, Kasich was suddenly
-- a lot of
people might go to him.

23:35.648 --> 23:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Trump wins them both, then he
will probably
win them all on Tuesday. And
it's just the

23:41.120 --> 23:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
biggest day of the season. And
then you would
have to think he's probably the
nominee.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, John Kasich
is an interesting
one.

23:48.927 --> 23:53.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's run a positive campaign,
the governor
of Ohio, and has not got into
the back and

23:53.932 --> 24:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forth and the insult exchange
that has dominated
most of the Republican debates.
For the first

24:01.140 --> 24:07.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, Donald Trump is running an
anti-Kasich
commercial in Ohio, and it will
be interesting

24:07.713 --> 24:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see what John Kasich does in
the next few
days between now and then.

24:11.750 --> 24:18.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does he take it ®MD+IT /MDNM /in
just passive,
in pacifist fashion, or does he
hit back?

24:18.891 --> 24:24.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's obviously an invitation.
Trump wants
to win Ohio. What he has going
for him right

24:24.530 --> 24:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now is Urban Meyer, the coach at
Ohio State,
perhaps the most -- football
coach at Ohio

24:30.569 --> 24:34.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State -- perhaps the most
popular figure in
the state.

24:34.873 --> 24:39.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it isn't an endorsement, it's
certainly
an embrace, a TV spot that he's
cut with John

24:39.812 --> 24:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich and John Kasich's family,
speaking
very glowingly of qualities John
Kasich's

24:45.117 --> 24:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mother had not been aware he had
probably
before.

24:46.752 --> 24:47.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:47.152 --> 24:48.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:48.921 --> 24:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Does John
Kasich go into
the convention -- let's --
there's probably

24:50.789 --> 24:55.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mathematically not a way that
he's going to
outscore Trump and Cruz in terms
of delegates.

24:55.627 --> 25:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when he goes into that
convention, what
does he do there? Is this a
matter of saying,

25:00.766 --> 25:05.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hey, it's open and I think I'm
still a viable
candidate, and, by that time,
people will

25:05.838 --> 25:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see me as the guy that they want
to nominate?

25:07.439 --> 25:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, let's play
it out.

25:09.341 --> 25:13.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Trump doesn't have a majority
of the delegates,
then I think there will be --
and they can

25:13.178 --> 25:17.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of rewrite the rules. I
think there will
be a period pre-nominate --
pre-convention

25:17.850 --> 25:22.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the candidates will be
going after the
delegates, Republican, and
saying, commit,

25:22.087 --> 25:23.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
commit, commit, commit to me.

25:23.922 --> 25:27.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are going to try, all
the candidates,
to win those delegates over. And
then it just

25:27.359 --> 25:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
becomes a bidding war. And it
will all be
quiet. And then they will try to
commit before

25:32.197 --> 25:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we even get to the convention.
And I suspect
most of the delegates will lie
and they will

25:37.269 --> 25:41.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, yes, Mr. Trump, I'm with
you, yes, Mr.
Cruz, I'm with you, too.

25:41.073 --> 25:44.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so then it's all -- then we
don't know
what happens. Then it's complete
chaos.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't know how
John Kasich
goes after Ohio.

25:47.980 --> 25:53.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I don't know where he
mounts a campaign
that makes him a competitor, a
serious challenger

25:53.886 --> 25:57.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the nomination. I mean, he
can certainly
go to the convention, which is
in Cleveland,

25:57.623 --> 26:02.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and having carried Ohio, if he
does so. That's
not unimpressive by any means.

26:02.828 --> 26:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if Trump is within 100
delegates of the
nomination, he will get them. I
have seen

26:09.368 --> 26:13.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates. Candidates get 100
delegates,
100 people who want to be --
they know that

26:13.639 --> 26:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your -- chance to be the next
president of
the United States or certainly
the nominee

26:18.210 --> 26:24.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of your party. And they want to
be in the
good side of such a nominee. I
have just -- I

26:24.917 --> 26:26.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have seen it in the past.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Maybe with 100,
but Trump is
a unique candidate.

26:28.687 --> 26:32.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is more opposition to
Trump. I have
just felt it all week, so many
people. You

26:32.925 --> 26:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go to them, some members of
Congress, some
just activists.

26:35.227 --> 26:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I agree. Yes.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And you say, could
you support
Trump? And they say, I just
couldn't. I just

26:38.730 --> 26:40.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
couldn't pull the lever.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so there's -- he's unique in
that regard.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
little bit
about the other side.

26:43.469 --> 26:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why, Mark, is this race on the
Democratic
side still continuing? I mean,
conventional

26:48.640 --> 26:54.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wisdom was that Hillary Clinton
would have
a formidable lead, she would be
the clear

26:54.580 --> 26:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and distant choice, but, in
cases like Michigan,
not so.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: No.

27:00.552 --> 27:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, when -- a Sanders person
pointed out
to me, you take out the red
states of Alabama,

27:07.159 --> 27:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mississippi, South Carolina,
Louisiana, Georgia,
Arkansas, and Bernie is doing
pretty darn

27:14.766 --> 27:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well. I mean, that's where
Secretary Clinton
has run up the score, and done
so well with

27:19.705 --> 27:23.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
large African-American votes in
those states.

27:23.075 --> 27:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Bernie -- Bernie Sanders was
billed as
being 21 points behind in the
polling. The

27:30.449 --> 27:33.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primary polling has brought a
new respectability
to astrology.

27:33.085 --> 27:33.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:34.019 --> 27:37.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It was so wrong in
Michigan.

27:37.456 --> 27:41.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I just think you have to
come back. It's
not the messenger. He's not a
charismatic

27:41.894 --> 27:46.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guy that bobby-soxers are
swooning in front
of. It's the message. And you
can see it.

27:46.765 --> 27:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, for the first time, you see
Republican
voters in the exit polls, in
addition to Democrats,

27:52.137 --> 27:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying that they oppose free
trade.

27:54.540 --> 28:00.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They see free trade as
outsourcing of jobs.
They see it as offshoring, so
not in their

28:00.145 --> 28:04.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economic and family's interest.
So, Bernie
-- it's Bernie's message.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even John Kasich was sounding
like Dick Gephardt
on trade and the issues. The
whole debate

28:09.621 --> 28:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has shifted over on that side. I
think it's
also her weakness as a
candidate.

28:14.760 --> 28:18.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She sometimes has a good
message, but, on
attack, we were reminded this
week she's really

28:18.196 --> 28:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not good. She just attacks
wildly, without
focus, and I think
unpersuasively.

28:23.902 --> 28:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I -- the one thing I really like
that she
did this week was confess the
vulnerability:

28:28.173 --> 28:31.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not my husband. I'm not
Barack Obama.
I'm not a politician like them.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: As politically
gifted. That's
right, yes.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, just not as
politically
gifted as those guys.

28:34.780 --> 28:39.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's a true thing,
but also
a nice and honest way to
approach the American

28:39.585 --> 28:40.385 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's a good
point.

28:42.187 --> 28:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, New
York Times
columnist David Brooks,
syndicated columnist

28:44.256 --> 28:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Now: How do you rebuild from a
cascade of
disasters?

29:13.552 --> 29:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five years ago today, Japan was
rocked by
a massive earthquake and a
catastrophic tsunami.

29:18.657 --> 29:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
plant was crippled
by the tremors and waves,
triggering a meltdown

29:23.462 --> 29:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that forced roughly 100 thousand
people from
their homes, spewing radioactive
material

29:28.233 --> 29:30.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into the ocean and nearby
countryside.

29:30.736 --> 29:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien has a
rare look inside Fukushima to
see how the

29:34.840 --> 29:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
massive cleanup project is
pressing forward.

29:37.776 --> 29:41.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His report is a partnership with
PBS program
"NOVA."

29:41.079 --> 29:48.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Fukushima Daiichi
was one of
the largest nuclear power plants
in the world.

29:48.754 --> 29:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, it is a busy, crowded,
dangerous deconstruction
site.

29:57.729 --> 30:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My invitation to see it up close
was unique.

30:00.999 --> 30:03.468 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What next? Does three have a lot
to...

30:03.502 --> 30:10.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But even with special
permission, getting
inside is not easy by design.
Radioactive

30:10.776 --> 30:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contamination levels have gone
down, but not
nearly enough to dispense with
the Tyvek suits,

30:17.549 --> 30:22.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three layers of socks and gloves
and full
face respirators.

30:22.788 --> 30:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like being an astronaut on
a space walk.
Here, 7,000 workers are doing a
job for which

30:32.631 --> 30:34.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there is no playbook.

30:34.433 --> 30:39.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAOHIRO MASUDA, TEPCO (through
translator):
What makes this so difficult is
the lack of

30:39.905 --> 30:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experience. Nobody in the world
has done this
before.

30:43.275 --> 30:48.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Naohiro Masuda is
the chief
decommissioning officer for the
Tokyo Electric

30:48.914 --> 30:50.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Power Company, TEPCO.

30:50.749 --> 30:55.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NAOHIRO MASUDA (through
translator): We still
need to decide what we're even
going to do.

30:55.754 --> 30:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For that, we need to rely on the
knowledge
of people all around the world.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: He relies heavily
on this man.

31:03.895 --> 31:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAKE BARRETT, TEPCO Adviser: For
them to come
out and to publicly say "We need
help" is

31:08.734 --> 31:10.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
different for them.

31:10.535 --> 31:14.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Lake Barrett is
one of a very
select group who has some
experience with

31:14.873 --> 31:21.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a job like this. He was the
Nuclear Regulatory
Commission manager in charge of
the decommissioning

31:21.713 --> 31:28.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Three Mile Island Unit 2 near
Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania. It melted down in
1979.

31:28.186 --> 31:32.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAKE BARRETT: Fukushima is much
more complex.
The damage is much greater.
There's three

31:32.824 --> 31:38.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
melted cores. But the
fundamentals of how
you address this and how you
recover are similar.

31:38.697 --> 31:45.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The daily details
of this 40-year
job are managed here in a
radiation-shielded,

31:45.670 --> 31:50.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
earthquake-proof emergency
operations center.

31:50.442 --> 31:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The superintendent is another
TEPCO veteran,
Akira Ono, on duty here since
June of 2013.

31:56.815 --> 32:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AKIRA ONO, TEPCO (through
translator): Ever
since the disaster, we have been
working here

32:01.319 --> 32:08.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
24 hours a day 365 days a year.
We're ready
to respond to anything that
happens.

32:08.093 --> 32:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: His biggest
problem is water,
a steady torrent of radioactive
water. When

32:15.433 --> 32:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rain falls, it seeps into the
soil, and flows
toward the ocean.

32:21.039 --> 32:27.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The earthquake on March 11,
2011, created
numerous breaches in the
basements of the

32:27.145 --> 32:34.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
reactor buildings. The
groundwater is contaminated
after it mixes with water that
is continuously

32:34.586 --> 32:42.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pumped onto the damaged reactor
cores; 100,000
gallons of newly tainted water
is created

32:42.694 --> 32:45.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here each and every day.

32:45.897 --> 32:51.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They capture and pump most of it
into holding
tanks, lots of tanks. They build
one about

32:51.603 --> 32:58.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every other day. A plateau above
the destroyed
reactors is now a tank farm,
brimming with

32:58.910 --> 33:01.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more than 1,000 of them.

33:01.947 --> 33:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But have they managed to stop
all the radioactive
water from leaking into the
ocean?

33:06.251 --> 33:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN BUESSELER, Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution:
What we're hoping to find is a
container full

33:10.522 --> 33:12.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of water.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In this lab at
the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, they
have been

33:15.160 --> 33:19.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tracking radioactive water from
Fukushima
since the accident.

33:19.097 --> 33:24.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN BUESSELER: The level is
still measurable
and quite elevated, but it's not
anywhere

33:24.302 --> 33:26.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
near what it was at the peak of
the accident.

33:26.404 --> 33:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Oceanographer Ken
Buesseler
says readings in April of 2011
showed cesium

33:32.010 --> 33:35.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
levels 50 million times higher
than normal
at the plant.

33:35.780 --> 33:40.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN BUESSELER: The numbers
dropped very quickly,
but they also didn't go down to
zero. They

33:40.352 --> 33:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't go to the background as
quick as you
would expect if they had stopped
the leaks.

33:43.922 --> 33:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They hope to stop
the toxic
leaks by building a barrier.
They have encircled

33:50.028 --> 33:56.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the damaged reactors with 1,500
pipes that
go 100-feet deep. They will be
filled with

33:56.701 --> 34:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coolant. The goal? Deep-freeze
the soil, creating
a mile-long water barrier.

34:03.108 --> 34:09.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The technique has long been used
in construction
to build tunnels. But can it
work at this

34:09.147 --> 34:12.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
scale for years and years?

34:12.384 --> 34:17.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MDNM /Dale Klein is a former
U.S. nuclear
regulatory commission chairman
and now an

34:17.489 --> 34:19.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
adviser to TEPCO.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MDNM /DALE KLEIN, TEPCO Adviser:
If you
have water flowing through the
site and you

34:21.092 --> 34:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
build a barricade, water's going
to go somewhere.
Do they really understand? Is it
going to

34:26.131 --> 34:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go over the wall? Is it going to
go under
the wall? Is it going to go
around the wall?

34:29.367 --> 34:32.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, my concern is, there is
probably a better
way to do it.

34:32.938 --> 34:37.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The long-term
solution is to
find and remove the uranium fuel
from the

34:37.943 --> 34:44.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four reactors affected. They
have started
the process by removing fuel
that was in underwater

34:45.016 --> 34:47.385 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
storage.

34:47.419 --> 34:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At unit four, which was powered
down when
the tsunami hit, they built a
structure over

34:52.257 --> 34:59.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the damaged reactor, using it as
a platform
to carefully pluck out more than
1,500 fuel

34:59.397 --> 35:02.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assemblies.

35:02.367 --> 35:08.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in units one, two and three,
where the
reactor cores all melted down,
radiation levels

35:08.173 --> 35:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are much higher, making the task
much more
daunting.

35:11.676 --> 35:16.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LAKE BARRETT: People are
probably not going
to have access to those
buildings for more

35:16.047 --> 35:19.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than maybe minutes or two, so
not enough to
do defueling.

35:19.484 --> 35:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And what about
the melted fuel
in the reactor cores? They
aren't even sure

35:25.190 --> 35:26.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
where it all is.

35:27.025 --> 35:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAKE BARRETT: Is it in one big
vertical lump
on the floor underneath it, or
did it come

35:30.895 --> 35:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down and flow like lava in a
volcano and move
out to the sides? We don't know
yet.

35:37.002 --> 35:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: TEPCO has turned
to a team
of scientists and engineers from
the Los Alamos

35:42.674 --> 35:49.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Laboratory for some
assistance. They
are helping build a device
designed to see

35:49.681 --> 35:54.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through the walls of the reactor
buildings
and hopefully make what looks
like three-dimensional

35:55.020 --> 35:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
X-rays of the reactor cores.

35:58.690 --> 36:06.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These long cylinders are able to
detect muons,
subatomic particles created in
space by quasars

36:06.398 --> 36:14.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and supernovas that rain down on
Earth. Muons
are stopped, slowed or deflected
depending

36:14.139 --> 36:21.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the density of the matter
they are passing
through. And uranium is very
dense.

36:21.546 --> 36:25.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Physicist Chris Morris leads the
team.

36:25.517 --> 36:28.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS MORRIS, Los Alamos
National Laboratory:
You can reconstruct the amount
of material

36:28.753 --> 36:34.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the core in the reactor. And
we can actually
measure if there's any uranium
there, if there's

36:34.526 --> 36:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of uranium there, how much
is left.

36:36.728 --> 36:40.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The detectors
will be run for
months to give engineers the
sharpest possible

36:40.965 --> 36:44.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
picture inside a very hazardous
place.

36:44.502 --> 36:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS MORRIS: Human beings
aren't going in
there anytime soon. The
radiation levels are

36:48.106 --> 36:50.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very high. It kills robots.

36:50.909 --> 36:56.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The robots they
have tried
here so far have offered up
glimpses inside

36:56.047 --> 37:02.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the melted nuclear cores, before
failing in
the face of a bombardment of
radiation.

37:02.987 --> 37:06.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Japanese robotics engineers have
their work
cut out for them.

37:06.257 --> 37:10.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAKE BARRETT: I believe it can
be done. It
can be done safely and it can be
done successfully.

37:10.628 --> 37:13.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But nothing of this magnitude
has ever been
done by mankind.

37:13.264 --> 37:18.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NAOHIRO MASUDA (through
translator): I feel
very reassured that, in the next
30 or 40

37:18.703 --> 37:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, people from all over the
world will
gather in Fukushima to work and
research the

37:23.274 --> 37:28.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decommissioning. I'm hoping it
will become
a very lively place.

37:28.413 --> 37:37.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Fukushima five
years later,
they have made progress here,
but it is just

37:37.922 --> 37:45.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the beginning of a marathon.
This cleanup
will rely on technology not yet
invented,

37:45.763 --> 37:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the determination of people
not yet born.

37:50.168 --> 37:53.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Futaba,
Japan.

37:53.805 --> 37:59.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay tuned
this fall. Miles
will have a new documentary on
Fukushima for

37:59.310 --> 38:04.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NOVA." And, right now, you can
read his blog
on the real heroes behind the
nuclear disaster.

38:04.415 --> 38:10.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

38:10.855 --> 38:23.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will be
back with a look
at how Syrians artists are
depicting their

38:23.468 --> 38:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experiences of the ongoing civil
war.

38:25.937 --> 38:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take this moment to
hear from
your local PBS station. It's a
chance to offer

38:29.941 --> 38:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps keep
programs like
ours on the air.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.347 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

38:36.381 --> 38:50.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fighting in
Syria continues
into its fifth year. As the
death toll grows

38:50.762 --> 38:54.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cities are destroyed, Syrian
artists,
many of them forced to flee
their country,

38:54.232 --> 38:56.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have sought ways to respond.

38:56.434 --> 39:00.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In recent months, we have
profiled a number
of these artists in our online
Art Beat series

39:00.738 --> 39:01.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Syrian Voices.

39:01.406 --> 39:03.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our look.

39:03.241 --> 39:07.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A horror story
told in one
minute, that's the idea behind
"Fade to Black,"

39:07.912 --> 39:15.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a short film by Amer Albarzawi,
who shows
us what's happened in Syria
through the changing

39:15.153 --> 39:20.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
image of Farah Brisly, an
actress from Damascus
who now lives in Istanbul.

39:20.225 --> 39:32.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just one of the ways Syrian
artists have
responded to the destruction in
their country.

39:32.270 --> 39:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a refugee camp in Lebanon,
Farah's sister,
Diala, has found another,
working with Syrian

39:36.441 --> 39:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children to design and painting
murals with
them to bring some color and joy
to their

39:42.847 --> 39:43.948 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lives.

39:43.982 --> 39:47.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Diala spoke to us by Skype from
her home in
Beirut.

39:47.885 --> 39:56.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIALA BRISLY, Lebanon: Most of
them, they
skip school for two or three
years. And they

39:56.794 --> 40:03.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to work in the farms to help
their families.
So, they have really very, very
serious life

40:03.568 --> 40:06.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that doesn't belong to a
childhood, you know?

40:06.104 --> 40:11.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The work on the
murals, she
says, begins with a
brainstorming session

40:11.075 --> 40:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as she asks them to imagine what
seems impossible,
like flying.

40:15.513 --> 40:23.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIALA BRISLY: I tell them, like,
you can use
your imagination. It isn't
supposed to be

40:24.022 --> 40:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
realistic. You can imagine
anything.

40:25.790 --> 40:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of them, they think of
butterflies, of
birds, of air balloons, things
like this.

40:30.828 --> 40:36.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, after that, I take this
illustration and
I get inspired by it, and I
start designing

40:36.868 --> 40:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mural. And the day after,
they come to
help me in filling the colors in
these murals.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another artist, a
very different
kind of imagery.

40:43.808 --> 40:48.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Waseem Al-Marzouki documents the
history of
the Syrian conflict through
intricate, large-scale

40:48.613 --> 40:55.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paintings and films that depict
military and
industrial images and symbols.
He grew up

40:55.486 --> 41:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
near Raqqa, now the stronghold
of the Islamic
State, and now lives and works
in Los Angeles.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He told us the war had left him
unable to
work for a two-year period.

41:04.696 --> 41:12.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WASEEM AL-MARZOUKI, Artist: I
was very shocked
from what I see and what we have
experienced,

41:12.170 --> 41:17.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killing, displacement, torture,
all these
things happening to us. And,
yes, so, after

41:17.275 --> 41:22.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two years, I start working
again, but I realize
that what I'm doing is totally
different than

41:22.714 --> 41:26.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what I have done before. It's
more related
to what we are facing.

41:26.851 --> 41:32.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another voice,
that of poetry,
which has always had an honored
place in Arabic

41:32.256 --> 41:34.092 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
culture.

41:34.125 --> 41:40.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ghada Alatrash is a Syrian
writer and translator
now earning a doctorate at the
University

41:40.832 --> 41:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Calgary in Canada.

41:42.567 --> 41:49.006 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
GHADA ALATRASH,
Writer/Translator: Syrian
poetry today is an outcry. It is
a plea to

41:49.040 --> 41:54.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
humanity. It embodies that human
tragedy,
the raw pain, the loss and the
defeat.

41:54.278 --> 42:01.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Alatrash is from
Sweida, in
the south of Syria, and has
translated the

42:01.252 --> 42:13.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work of Najat Abdul Samad, a
friend who remains
in their shared hometown. She
read us the

42:13.631 --> 42:17.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beginning of the poem "When I Am
Overcome
With Weakness."

42:17.535 --> 42:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GHADA ALATRASH: "When I am
overcome with weakness,
I bandage my heart with a Syrian
woman's patience

42:25.076 --> 42:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in adversity. I bandage it with
December's
frozen tree roots, trees that
have sworn to

42:29.414 --> 42:31.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
blossom in March or April."

42:31.382 --> 42:40.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then there is
this, a documentary
titled "The Cow Farm," about a
farmer on the

42:40.291 --> 42:42.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outskirts of Salamiyah.

42:42.160 --> 42:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Filmmaker Ali Sheikh Khudr told
us that, when
the revolution began, many
rushed to capture

42:47.131 --> 42:55.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protests and the political
upheaval. He decided
to tell a different kind of
story, one about

42:55.072 --> 42:57.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hassan, his own cousin, who
supported the
regime.

42:57.108 --> 42:59.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Khoo'-dur, a strong opponent,
said he was
after complexities, seeking to
understand

42:59.944 --> 43:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why people like Hassan sided
with the government.

43:02.313 --> 43:08.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI SHEIKH KHUDR, Filmmaker:
There's a lot
of people just -- they just
didn't want to

43:08.953 --> 43:16.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lose the things that they have.
They didn't
want to lose their future, they
didn't want

43:16.127 --> 43:25.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to lose their lives, they didn't
want to lose
in the country itself. They were
very afraid.

43:25.236 --> 43:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they stood on one side
against the other.
So, you have -- on both sides,
you have people

43:32.877 --> 43:34.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who are afraid, you know?

43:34.645 --> 43:38.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Khudr's cousin
Hassan died
in 2013 fighting for the
government. Khudr

43:38.249 --> 43:40.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
himself moved to Berlin.

43:40.184 --> 43:46.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says that, above all, he
feels a responsibility
to share the stories of Syrians
whose lives

43:46.591 --> 43:48.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have changed forever.

43:48.359 --> 43:57.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI SHEIKH KHUDR: The first
responsibility
was for me that there should be
a film, a

43:57.101 --> 44:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
documentary film from Syria
telling something
different, a new perspective,
you know?

44:09.847 --> 44:15.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was also this second
level of responsibility
that I should take out this
story. People

44:15.386 --> 44:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are dying in Syria are not
numbers. They
are human beings and they have
lives, they

44:22.226 --> 44:26.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have memories, they have dreams,
and that
was lost.

44:26.230 --> 44:33.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Khudr and other
artists we
talked to are determined not to
let these

44:33.437 --> 44:38.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people's stories fade to black.

44:38.743 --> 44:48.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Jeffrey Brown.
