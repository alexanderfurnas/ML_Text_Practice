JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.839 --> 00:06.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.742 --> 00:10.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: What we want to do is
bring manufacturing

00:10.344 --> 00:12.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back to our country.

00:12.179 --> 00:17.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
turns his focus
to trade and the economy after a
rocky start

00:17.050 --> 00:18.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to his administration.

00:18.418 --> 00:19.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:19.419 --> 00:21.054 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:21.088 --> 00:23.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: If
he works with us on our values,
fine.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he doesn't, we will oppose
him tooth and
nail.

00:25.559 --> 00:30.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I sit down with
Senate Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer to talk
about where Democrats

00:30.964 --> 00:34.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can and can't see working with
the new president.

00:34.534 --> 00:39.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, our Politics Monday team
take on the
Trump administration's combative
relationship

00:39.840 --> 00:41.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the press.

00:41.675 --> 00:47.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And feeling the Trump effect
overseas -- how
right-wing movements across the
E.U. are hoping

00:47.581 --> 00:50.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to ride a global wave of
populism to the polls.

00:50.751 --> 00:54.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEERT WILDERS, Leader, Freedom
Party (through
translator): The people will not
stop.

00:54.121 --> 01:00.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether the old-fashioned
politicians or the
friends of the press like it or
not, it will

01:00.427 --> 01:01.662 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not be stopped.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.631 --> 01:08.735 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:08.769 --> 01:20.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's down to
business for President
Trump, and the first order of
business today

01:20.914 --> 01:22.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was economic policy.

01:22.883 --> 01:29.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A weekend of tumult over the
size of the inaugural
crowd, record-breaking protest
marches and

01:29.723 --> 01:34.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
news coverage, gave way today to
a focus on
trade and jobs.

01:34.695 --> 01:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang spent this day at the
White House.

01:37.331 --> 01:45.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On his first full
workday in the
White House, President Trump
wielded the presidential

01:45.739 --> 01:47.474 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pen.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: Great thing for the
American worker

01:49.576 --> 01:51.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we just did.

01:51.445 --> 01:55.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump took three
executive
actions, formally withdrawing
the United States

01:55.382 --> 01:58.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the Trans-Pacific
partnership, or TPP.

01:58.885 --> 02:03.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former President Obama pushed
the 12-country
trade pact, but Congress never
voted on it.

02:03.991 --> 02:08.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president also froze federal
government
hiring outside of the military,
and he revived

02:08.895 --> 02:15.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an on-again/off-again ban on
federal funding
for international groups
providing abortions.

02:15.335 --> 02:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the theme of the day was
clearly meant
to be trade, business and jobs.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Good morning,
everybody.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Good morning, Mr.
President.

02:23.343 --> 02:28.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president had
breakfast with
business executives, talking tax
and regulation

02:28.648 --> 02:29.916 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cuts.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He made clear he wants to keep
U.S. jobs from
moving overseas.

02:32.819 --> 02:38.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We are going to be
imposing
a very major border tax on the
product when

02:38.158 --> 02:41.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it comes in, which I think is
fair, which
is fair.

02:41.561 --> 02:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a company that wants to fire
all of its
people in the United States and
build some

02:48.335 --> 02:52.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
factory someplace else and then
thinks that
that product is going to just
flow across

02:52.372 --> 02:55.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the border into the United
States, that's
not going to happen.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ford CEO Mark Fields
said he was
encouraged.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK FIELDS, CEO, Ford Motor
Company: I come
out with a lot of confidence
that the president

03:01.748 --> 03:07.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is very, very serious on making
sure that
the United States economy is
going to be strong.

03:07.387 --> 03:12.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that encourages all
of us as CEOs
as we make decisions going
forward.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Thank you for
being here.

03:13.894 --> 03:16.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later, he met with
union workers.

03:16.196 --> 03:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Companies that
left are going
to come back to our country, and
they're going

03:21.068 --> 03:23.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to hire a lot of people.

03:23.570 --> 03:28.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's inconceivable to me that
this was allowed
to happen in the first place.

03:28.842 --> 03:33.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: White House Press
Secretary Sean
Spicer, holding his first full
White House

03:33.847 --> 03:35.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
press briefing, said there'd be
more meetings
like those.

03:35.782 --> 03:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
I think that you're going to see
a lot more

03:38.185 --> 03:42.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of that, a listening president
who is engaged
and trying to figure out what
policies and

03:42.355 --> 03:45.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actions that he can take, that
this government
can.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's who he is.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what he did during the
transition,
and I think that's what he's
going to do going

03:49.863 --> 03:51.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

03:51.698 --> 03:54.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump also did
some foreign
policy work, speaking by phone
with Egyptian

03:54.868 --> 04:00.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi,
pledging to
continue U.S. military aid.

04:00.107 --> 04:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, ethics lawyers filed
a federal
lawsuit, charging that his
companies are violating

04:05.212 --> 04:10.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Constitution by taking
payments from foreign
governments while he's in
office.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump brushed it aside.

04:12.319 --> 04:13.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Without merit.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Totally without merit.

04:15.722 --> 04:19.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The White House said
Mr. Trump
has now officially resigned from
the Trump

04:19.559 --> 04:22.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Organization, as he had promised
to do.

04:22.496 --> 04:31.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, you
reported on what
the Trump White House has done
this first

04:31.404 --> 04:33.173 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had been saying to the
press that they
were going to come out of the
box with one

04:35.775 --> 04:37.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
action after another.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What more are they telling you
they have up
their sleeves this week?

04:39.312 --> 04:43.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, they say we
should look for
actions and other indications on
trade later

04:43.350 --> 04:48.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this week, and perhaps on
immigration, although
one thing they say we will now
not see as

04:48.755 --> 04:55.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an executive action will be
President Trump
undoing President Obama's
executive action

04:55.996 --> 05:03.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deferring action, deferring
deportation action
on undocumented immigrants who
came to this

05:03.436 --> 05:05.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
country as minors.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say that is now not a
priority.

05:07.440 --> 05:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The priority on undocumented
immigrants is
on people with criminal records
and those

05:12.379 --> 05:14.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who pose a threat.

05:14.181 --> 05:18.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on those so-called dreamers,
the young
people who came as minors, they
say they want

05:18.385 --> 05:20.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to work with Congress for a
permanent solution.

05:20.887 --> 05:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, we
know the president
also has a couple of meetings
already lined

05:26.126 --> 05:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up with foreign leaders coming
into Washington.

05:28.361 --> 05:32.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's right, Friday,
his first
foreign visitor will be British
Prime Minister

05:32.532 --> 05:34.267 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Theresa May.

05:34.301 --> 05:39.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then on Monday, he will
meeting with Enrique
Pena Nieto, the president of
Mexico.

05:39.639 --> 05:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, two
other quick
things.

05:42.209 --> 05:47.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know the president is going
to be going
to a retreat I guess with
congressional Republicans

05:47.380 --> 05:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later in the week, but I also
want to get
your sense of how it feels
different to be

05:51.017 --> 05:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
covering a Trump White House.

05:53.019 --> 05:58.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, I'll tell you,
at first transitions
always tend to be a little
chaotic and a little

05:58.291 --> 05:59.859 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
messy.

05:59.893 --> 06:03.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the briefing today, there was
a lot of
activity, a lot of people there,
a lot of

06:03.997 --> 06:05.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interest.

06:05.198 --> 06:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was jammed in the Briefing
Room for the
briefing.

06:09.536 --> 06:15.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't quite as crowded as it
was for President
Obama's last press conference,
but still a

06:15.408 --> 06:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of interest and a lot of
people wanting
to attend that first briefing.

06:20.914 --> 06:25.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Yang
covering the White
House for us on this first full
day, workday,

06:25.819 --> 06:30.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the Trump administration,
thank you, John.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
Senate Foreign
Relations Committee voted
through the nomination

06:33.860 --> 06:36.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Rex Tillerson to be secretary
of state.

06:36.496 --> 06:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They voted along party lines,
and they sent
it to the full Senate.

06:39.899 --> 06:44.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That came after Republican Marco
Rubio of
Florida announced his support.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He'd clashed with Tillerson at
the confirmation
hearing.

06:48.008 --> 06:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separately, the president
nominated former
U.S. Representative Heather
Wilson of New

06:52.345 --> 06:55.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mexico to be secretary of the
Air Force.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is a retired Air Force
captain.

06:58.451 --> 07:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new president's move to rein
in Obamacare
is raising questions within his
own party.

07:04.591 --> 07:10.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hours after his inauguration,
Mr. Trump ordered
federal agencies to waive or
delay parts of

07:10.330 --> 07:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the law if they impose financial
burdens on
states.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His directive gave no details.

07:16.236 --> 07:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a leading Republican
senator, Susan
Collins of Maine, said it's not
clear what

07:21.608 --> 07:22.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that means.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:24.244 --> 07:27.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: I
think that the
executive order is very
confusing.

07:27.380 --> 07:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Until there is a secretary in
place who can
interpret the regulations or do
the rule-making

07:36.623 --> 07:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to rescind regulations, it's
very difficult
to say what the impact of the
executive order

07:43.630 --> 07:45.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is going to be.

07:45.365 --> 07:49.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Collins is
offering her own
legislation to replace the
Affordable Care

07:49.502 --> 07:51.271 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Act.

The death toll has reached 20
after a rare
January outbreak of tornadoes
hit the Deep

07:55.442 --> 07:57.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
South over the weekend.

07:57.143 --> 08:00.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fifteen of the victims died in
South Georgia.

08:00.547 --> 08:05.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials in one hard-hit county
made a desperate
plea today for federal help, and
complained

08:05.852 --> 08:07.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're not getting any.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER COHILAS, Dougherty
County Commission
Chairman: The assistance, the
boots on the

08:09.656 --> 08:15.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground, the reasons why the
federal government
exists to help in situations
like this.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not asking for money right
now.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're asking for resources.

08:21.201 --> 08:28.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to get caught up in the
bureaucratic red
tape at a time of this amount of
human suffering

08:28.074 --> 08:29.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is disgraceful.

08:29.943 --> 08:34.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thirty-nine
possible twisters
were reported across the
Southeast from Saturday

08:34.314 --> 08:36.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
morning through Sunday evening.

08:36.816 --> 08:39.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All but nine were in Georgia.

08:39.352 --> 08:44.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Pacific Coast, a winter
storm system
is moving out of California
tonight, after

08:44.090 --> 08:46.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
record rainfall touched off
floods.

08:46.526 --> 08:51.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly four inches fell south of
Los Angeles
on Sunday, flooding major
roadways around

08:51.631 --> 08:55.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Long Beach and even washing away
cars.

08:55.135 --> 09:00.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parts of the San Francisco area
also faced
flooding, and heavy snow in the
Sierra Nevada

09:00.507 --> 09:02.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shut down a highway.

09:02.208 --> 09:05.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The storm is blamed for four
deaths.

09:05.879 --> 09:10.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Representatives of the Syrian
government and
rebel groups sat down in
Kazakstan today for

09:10.517 --> 09:13.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their first peace talks in nine
months.

09:13.486 --> 09:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They traded accusations, and
there was little
sign of progress.

09:17.123 --> 09:23.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The negotiations, hosted by
Russia, Turkey
and Iran, are aimed at extending
a shaky cease-fire

09:23.830 --> 09:25.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
set up just last month.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The U.S. is not directly
involved.

09:28.902 --> 09:34.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China's government is launching
a new crackdown
on attempts to get around its
sweeping Internet

09:34.340 --> 09:36.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
censorship.

09:36.176 --> 09:40.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beijing said today that a
14-month campaign
will aim to -- quote -- "clean
up" Internet

09:40.580 --> 09:44.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service providers and target
unauthorized
connections.

09:44.484 --> 09:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal is to bar China's 730
million Internet
users from accessing overseas
Web sites without

09:52.292 --> 09:54.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
permission.

09:54.093 --> 09:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street today, the Dow
Jones industrial
average lost 27 points to close
back below

09:59.098 --> 10:00.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
19800.

10:00.200 --> 10:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell two, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
six.

10:05.905 --> 10:11.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And an upbeat report today on
the health of
former President George H.W.
Bush.

10:11.044 --> 10:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doctors in Houston say he's
ready to leave
intensive care after being
admitted nine days

10:16.115 --> 10:17.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ago for pneumonia.

10:17.884 --> 10:22.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His wife, Barbara, was
discharged from the
same hospital today after
recovering from

10:22.789 --> 10:24.691 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bronchitis.

10:24.724 --> 10:28.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the highest-ranking
Democrat in the Senate, Minority
Leader Chuck

10:28.795 --> 10:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schumer, discusses the new
president; ongoing
concerns over President Trump's
business dealings;

10:35.768 --> 10:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a combative start to the Trump
administration's
relationship with the press; and
much more.

10:45.812 --> 10:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a combative start to the Trump
administration's
relationship with the press; and
much more.

10:52.819 --> 10:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican control of the House
and Senate
offers President Trump an
opportunity to deliver

10:57.524 --> 10:59.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on many of his campaign
promises.

11:00.026 --> 11:03.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Democrats plan to make that
a rocky road.

11:03.229 --> 11:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The main voice of the opposition
is Senate
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of
New York.

11:07.901 --> 11:10.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We sat down at the Capitol this
afternoon.

11:10.503 --> 11:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I began by asking him how he
would characterize
these first days of the Trump
administration.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: It's
been bumpy, to say the least.

11:18.678 --> 11:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rollout, so to speak, at the
CIA was really
terrible, to stand on sacred
ground, people

11:26.252 --> 11:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who had given their lives for
our country,
and then to spend all his time
talking about

11:30.256 --> 11:32.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extraneous things that related
to himself.

11:32.392 --> 11:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, what he has to realize
is, he's
president, not candidate.

11:37.196 --> 11:41.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of talking about the
numbers of people
who showed up at his
inauguration, he ought

11:41.267 --> 11:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be talking about the number
of people he's
gotten into the middle class,
gotten good-paying

11:45.772 --> 11:47.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, already
this morning
and over the last few days, he
started signing

11:49.676 --> 11:51.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
executive orders.

11:51.477 --> 11:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of them has to do with the
Trans-Pacific
partnership, the trade pact.

11:55.481 --> 11:58.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was another one on the
Affordable Care
Act.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So they are making some
statements, aren't
they?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: But some of these
mean very
little.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The TPP was dead long before he
became president.

12:05.992 --> 12:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he wanted to do something
real on trade,
he could have done what he
promised to do

12:09.963 --> 12:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over and over again in his
campaign, call
China a currency manipulator.

12:13.600 --> 12:18.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, on the first day I'm in
office, I
will call China a currency
manipulator.

12:18.471 --> 12:20.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That would have done something.

12:20.206 --> 12:25.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On his ACA, on the Obamacare, he
said, keep
the good things, get rid of the
bad things

12:25.078 --> 12:26.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and obey the law.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're so locked in a terrible
position on
ACA.

12:29.282 --> 12:33.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, they want to
keep the good
things and repeal it, but they
don't know

12:33.453 --> 12:35.221 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
how to do it.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Isn't it entirely
possible,
Senator, that it could be
repealed and then

12:38.958 --> 12:42.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there could be no agreement on a
replacement
for months or longer?

12:42.495 --> 12:44.364 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, I think --
first, I think
they're going to have more
trouble with repeal

12:46.499 --> 12:48.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alone than they think.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A good number of moderate
Republicans -- Susan
Collins, who made this proposal,
I have a

12:51.871 --> 12:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of respect for her, even
though I don't
think her proposal is very good
-- and bunch

12:57.377 --> 13:01.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of others, Bob Corker, have said
don't repeal
without replacing.

13:01.681 --> 13:05.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then there are a number of
people on the
hard right -- particularly in
the House, they

13:05.084 --> 13:09.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a great deal of clout --
who say if you
put any new money into this,
we're not voting

13:09.489 --> 13:11.324 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for it.

13:11.357 --> 13:16.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, you can't do that in a
replacement bill,
unless you just decimate all the
good things

13:16.195 --> 13:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the bill, the 20 million
people who have
been covered, preexisting
conditions, kids

13:21.668 --> 13:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
21-26 staying on their parents'
plan and a
whole raft of other things.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, they're sort of stuck.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're like the dog who caught
the bus.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Very easy when they're out of
power to repeal
it, not so easy now.

13:31.978 --> 13:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the odds are at
least 50/50 that
they won't be able to accomplish
repeal.

13:37.050 --> 13:41.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This week, there
have already
been two Cabinet nominees of
President Trump

13:41.788 --> 13:42.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been approved.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are a number of others.

13:44.190 --> 13:47.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have said there are eight or
nine of them
you have problems with.

13:47.360 --> 13:51.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think it's possible that
a couple of
them, one or two will not be
confirmed?

13:51.297 --> 13:53.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, that's up
to the Republicans,
because if they have no
defections, they can

13:55.902 --> 13:58.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pass all of these with the
changes in the
rules.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I would say this.

14:00.707 --> 14:05.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have an obligation to bring
to light who
these people are, because this
is such a unique,

14:05.912 --> 14:07.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a bad way, Cabinet.

14:07.647 --> 14:10.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We call it the swamp Cabinet,
billionaires
and bankers.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

14:12.952 --> 14:16.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, first, there are huge
conflicts of interests
with so many of these, because
they have dramatically

14:16.622 --> 14:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
large financial holdings that
would lend themselves
to all kinds of conflict of
interests.

14:22.228 --> 14:27.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of them have had a great
deal of difficulty
filing what's required by law,
90-day plan

14:27.700 --> 14:28.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to divest.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some have done it cleanly.

14:30.069 --> 14:31.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Most have not.

14:31.938 --> 14:36.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Many of them disagree
dramatically with the
views that President Trump or
candidate Trump

14:36.843 --> 14:37.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
then stated.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For instant, the classic is Tom
Price.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump said, I will never touch
Medicare.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Price has made his whole career
on trying
to get rid of Medicare.

14:45.451 --> 14:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're not
saying he's
going to be -- not going to be
confirmed?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're basically pointing out
that there are
some discrepancies.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, look, we
don't know what
happens.

14:53.459 --> 15:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mulvaney, it just came out that
he didn't
pay a household employee -- the
taxes on a

15:00.767 --> 15:02.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
household employee for four
years.

15:02.468 --> 15:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think he
might not be
confirmed?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, on the very
same basis,
Republicans said Tom Daschle
wasn't fit to

15:08.274 --> 15:09.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be secretary of HHS.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're not being dilatory.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
First, these people have
tremendous power.

15:14.013 --> 15:18.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To have a few days to explore
who they are,
and maybe when the public and
some of our

15:18.818 --> 15:24.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican colleagues see all
the problems,
maybe a few of them will vote
for us and knock

15:24.090 --> 15:25.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out some of these nominees.

15:25.892 --> 15:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have an obligation to bring
to light who
these people are, so the
American people see

15:29.495 --> 15:30.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what Trump is doing.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here is what Trump is actually
doing.

15:32.832 --> 15:39.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's talking like a populist,
his inauguration
speech, but he's governing like
a hard right-wing

15:39.105 --> 15:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guy, totally different than the
way he campaigned.

15:41.741 --> 15:42.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

15:42.875 --> 15:43.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean in the
people he's
chosen?

15:43.943 --> 15:44.911 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: In the people
he's chosen.

15:46.145 --> 15:49.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're the most hard-right
Cabinet we have
ever seen.

15:49.382 --> 15:53.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A guy like Mulvaney, who even
wants to cut
funding for cancer research?

15:53.753 --> 15:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's to the right of the average
Republican.

15:55.521 --> 15:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Senator,
with all due
respect, it sounds like you're
saying, yes,

15:57.757 --> 16:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have got -- it sounds like
they have
got big problems, but we may
have to be prepared

16:01.994 --> 16:02.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to live with them.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:04.931 --> 16:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, we depend
on some Republicans
of conscience coming forward and
saying, this

16:07.600 --> 16:09.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is unacceptable.

16:09.368 --> 16:14.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We depend on them using the same
standard
they used against Democratic
nominees on these

16:14.307 --> 16:15.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican nominees.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't know the outcome yet.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me move
to something
else we don't know yet, and that
is who the

16:20.646 --> 16:23.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president is going to nominate
for the Supreme
Court.

16:23.349 --> 16:26.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have said you don't want
somebody -- you
want him to appoint someone who
is from the

16:26.953 --> 16:30.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mainstream, who's not off to the
far -- in
your words, to the far right.

16:30.556 --> 16:31.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Correct.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But your friend,
your colleague,
the majority leader, Mitch
McConnell, has

16:35.761 --> 16:42.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left it wide open that he might
resort to
the so-called nuclear option,
where the Republicans

16:42.034 --> 16:47.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could basically have their way
with 51 votes,
no matter who Mr. Trump,
President Trump,

16:47.206 --> 16:48.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nominates.

16:48.207 --> 16:49.942 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, look,
first, the last
two presidents have nominated
four people

16:51.811 --> 16:56.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Supreme Court, two by the
Republican
President Bush, two by the
Democratic President

16:56.148 --> 16:59.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Obama, and they all got
bipartisan support.

16:59.185 --> 17:05.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am hopeful, not certain at
all, that
the president will nominate
someone who could

17:05.858 --> 17:08.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get bipartisan support.

17:08.494 --> 17:13.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If not, obviously, we will
oppose them with
everything we have.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Certainly, I will.

17:15.268 --> 17:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would think they wouldn't
get enough
support, the 60 votes, that are
now required.

17:18.237 --> 17:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, then the Republicans will
have to come
to that Rubicon: Do they want to
change the

17:21.941 --> 17:23.142 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rules?

17:23.175 --> 17:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about a couple
of issues.

17:24.977 --> 17:29.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Infrastructure, you said you're
willing to
work with President Trump on a
plan to rebuild

17:29.048 --> 17:30.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the nation's infrastructure.

17:30.750 --> 17:35.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have been hearing from
his commerce
secretary-designee, Wilbur Ross,
that his

17:35.454 --> 17:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea is about having a lot of it
financed
privately.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:38.557 --> 17:39.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Yes.

17:39.792 --> 17:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is that something
you could
go along with?

17:40.559 --> 17:41.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: You won't build
many roads.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the ones you will have such
large tolls,
that the very middle-class
people that Donald

17:46.832 --> 17:49.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has said he wants to help
will be dramatically
hurt.

17:49.368 --> 17:55.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, the only way you can do a
good infrastructure
bill is by a significant
increase in federal

17:55.308 --> 17:56.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spending.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have said this to president
when he was
president-elect.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, "I understand
that."

18:01.714 --> 18:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said, you may have to break
with a lot of
your hard-right Republican
colleagues in the

18:05.284 --> 18:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House and Senate who don't like
to see the
federal government spending
money on roads,

18:09.155 --> 18:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even though that is usually what
we have done
throughout the past.

18:12.992 --> 18:13.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he said, "I know."

18:13.993 --> 18:15.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, we will see.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have heard
different things
from different people around
President Trump

18:18.864 --> 18:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about what they want to do about
tax cuts.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think they're going
to do?

18:22.301 --> 18:23.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you have a clear idea?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.304 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Yes, I really
worry, again,
because he's governing from the
hard right,

18:27.940 --> 18:32.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the overwhelming part of
their tax cuts
will go to the wealthiest of
Americans.

18:32.478 --> 18:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's been the credo of the
hard right all
along, reduce taxes on the very
rich, and

18:37.350 --> 18:38.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it will trickle down.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not something Democrats
or most Americans
agree with.

18:41.654 --> 18:46.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think he would get
very much support
for tax cuts that predominantly
go to the

18:46.726 --> 18:48.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
top 1 percent.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would be against what he
campaigned on.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It would be a huge mistake.

18:51.597 --> 18:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not the way to do things.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, middle-class tax cuts, we
would look at
them.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Closing loopholes, he has talked
about closing
the carried interest loophole.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We would be all for it and vote
for that.

19:01.607 --> 19:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we will see what he does.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia and Russia
sanctions.

19:06.012 --> 19:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whatever is decided by Congress
in terms of
continuing or amping up
retaliatory moves

19:11.183 --> 19:17.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against Russia for its role in
the election,
isn't it likely that the
Republican majority

19:17.723 --> 19:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Senate is going to not go
along with
that; basically, that it won't
go anywhere?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.795 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:22.828 --> 19:26.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, our
Republican colleagues,
their credo since the days of
Ronald Reagan

19:26.332 --> 19:31.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be to be tough on Putin
and Russia,
would be to increase sanctions
if they did

19:31.303 --> 19:33.039 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope that they will --
John McCain and
Lindsey Graham, to their credit,
have been

19:35.341 --> 19:38.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stuck with this, a few others,
Ben Sasse.

19:38.044 --> 19:42.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But most seem to be, just
whatever Donald
Trump wants on foreign policy,
they are going

19:42.481 --> 19:43.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

19:43.482 --> 19:44.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have abandoned their
beliefs.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they're going to pay
a price for
that.

19:46.585 --> 19:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We, the country, will a pay a
price substantively,
and they will pay a price
politically.

19:50.790 --> 19:57.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Quite a
remarkable display
of public, strong feelings in
that march on

19:57.396 --> 19:58.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Saturday.

19:58.397 --> 19:59.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

19:59.398 --> 20:00.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:00.666 --> 20:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: I was at the New
York for three-and-a-half-hours.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was exhilarating.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Many people say
they haven't
seen in a long time from the
Democratic Party.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Yes.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But where do
Democrats go from
here?

20:07.540 --> 20:08.474 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:08.507 --> 20:09.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK SCHUMER: OK.

20:09.508 --> 20:10.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was one day.

20:10.509 --> 20:11.477 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:11.510 --> 20:12.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Yes.

20:12.511 --> 20:13.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where do you go
from here?

20:13.512 --> 20:15.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Well, but to say
on the second
day, there should be a whole
plan and everyone

20:17.249 --> 20:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to be marching to the
polls in 2018,
which would be the right thing
to do, is a

20:17.750 --> 20:19.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
little premature.

20:19.485 --> 20:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact that there is such
a depth of
feeling and worry about this new
president,

20:24.390 --> 20:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that women feel on the
issues of
choice and on the issues of
Planned Parenthood

20:29.929 --> 20:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and even on the issues of the
Affordable Care
Act, which say women have to be
treated equally

20:35.134 --> 20:38.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to men, that he's not working
for them, that's
going to have a huge effect.

20:38.838 --> 20:44.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's going to help
us over the
-- not just in the elections in
2018 and 2020,

20:44.243 --> 20:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but over the next several
months.

20:46.045 --> 20:49.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you make
sure both that
you stand up for what you
believe in, but

20:49.315 --> 20:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you don't come across to the
American people
as just a battering ram of no,
no, no?

20:53.853 --> 20:54.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:54.854 --> 20:55.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: That's exactly...

20:55.955 --> 20:56.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And including on
these confirmations?

20:56.856 --> 20:57.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:57.890 --> 20:58.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: It's a very
important question.

20:58.858 --> 20:59.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Stick to our values.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

21:01.127 --> 21:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you stick to your values,
then you will
be guided right.

21:03.829 --> 21:05.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what I have always done
throughout
my career.

21:05.664 --> 21:09.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're not going to oppose
something because
the name Trump is on it just for
the sake

21:09.368 --> 21:11.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of opposition, as Mitch
McConnell did.

21:11.770 --> 21:15.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If he proposes a good
infrastructure plan
that meets our values, we will
work with him

21:15.875 --> 21:17.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on it.

21:17.543 --> 21:20.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he wants to change the trade
laws in a
real way, we will work with him
on it.

21:20.312 --> 21:26.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, when he
tries to roll
over our values, repeal the
protections we

21:26.285 --> 21:31.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put for consumers and the
country against
Wall Street, repeal clean air
and clean water,

21:31.991 --> 21:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
repeal health care and the ACA,
undo the help
and support we have given public
education,

21:37.897 --> 21:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we will fight him tooth and
nail.

21:39.865 --> 21:42.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's what the
country wants
us to do.

21:42.067 --> 21:45.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senate Minority
Leader Chuck
Schumer, thank you very much.

21:45.371 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:46.372 --> 21:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Nice to see you.

21:48.207 --> 21:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in one final
postscript,
after we were done, I asked the
minority leader

21:51.043 --> 21:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about his personal relationship
with President
Trump.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:55.414 --> 21:58.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: He was saying to
me he was
my friend at the beginning.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then he called me some names.

21:59.785 --> 22:04.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I have said is, either
isn't going
to affect me.

22:04.723 --> 22:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Flattering isn't going to affect
me.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Name-calling isn't going to
affect me.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to go by what is the
right thing
to do in terms of our values.

22:11.230 --> 22:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I think both Democrats and
Republicans
have a lot of question marks
about his operating

22:16.101 --> 22:18.404 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
style.

22:18.437 --> 22:23.075 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm worried.

22:23.108 --> 22:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we said
earlier, there's
been plenty of news in the past
24 hours about

22:34.153 --> 22:36.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Trump and his
businesses.

22:36.722 --> 22:42.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, there are continuing
questions about
his pledge to separate from his
businesses

22:42.061 --> 22:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now that he's in the White
House.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham is here with
more.

22:45.631 --> 22:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That federal
lawsuit that
was filed earlier today alleges
that President

22:49.335 --> 22:53.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump is violating the
Emoluments Clause of
the Constitution.

22:53.472 --> 22:57.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That clause bars government
officials from
receiving certain types of gifts
from foreign

22:57.643 --> 22:59.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
powers or governments.

22:59.245 --> 23:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we heard, the president
called the suit
totally without merit.

23:03.015 --> 23:07.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other developments, White
House spokesman
Sean Spicer said today the
president had resigned

23:07.920 --> 23:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from his businesses in full, as
he'd promised
to do.

23:10.489 --> 23:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been questions as to
whether that
had indeed happened, but, late
today, several

23:14.960 --> 23:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news organizations said they had
received
signed letters and filings
showing the process

23:20.399 --> 23:22.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had indeed begun.

23:22.368 --> 23:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jonathan O'Connell is covering
all this for
The Washington Post, and he
joins me now.

23:25.904 --> 23:29.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jonathan, let's start
specifically with this
lawsuit.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the argument that these
plaintiffs
are arguing?

23:31.343 --> 23:33.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JONATHAN O'CONNELL, The
Washington Post: Sure.

23:33.212 --> 23:37.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they're taking aim at is
the Emoluments
Clause of the Constitution, as
you mentioned.

23:37.383 --> 23:42.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an obscure clause that
really no one
had paid much attention to until
recently.

23:42.855 --> 23:48.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What it does is, it bars the
president and
other federal officials from
receiving benefits

23:48.460 --> 23:52.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of any kind from foreign leaders
or foreign
officials.

23:52.798 --> 23:59.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, there isn't
a lot of case
record in terms of courts really
breaking

23:59.171 --> 24:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that apart and explaining what
that might
mean, and the Supreme Court has
never addressed

24:02.641 --> 24:04.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

24:04.476 --> 24:10.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is a wide view of
opinions on what
an emolument might mean, what
might qualify

24:10.082 --> 24:16.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an emolument, and also what
might qualify
as a violation of the Emoluments
Clause.

24:16.355 --> 24:22.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are talking about some of
the businesses
that Mr. Trump has that receive
payments from

24:22.861 --> 24:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal officials or foreign
governments,
or have -- receive interest
payments from

24:29.001 --> 24:31.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
maybe foreign banks.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are foreign buyers of his
condominiums.

24:33.706 --> 24:37.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are foreign tenants or
foreign-owned
tenants of his buildings.

24:37.910 --> 24:42.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mr. Trump is trying to take
precautions
to separate himself from his
businesses as

24:42.348 --> 24:44.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much as he can, but retain
ownership of them.

24:44.717 --> 24:47.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Help me
understand what
the concern is here.

24:47.820 --> 24:53.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it that, if I'm a foreign
government and
I am somehow putting money into
a Trump-related

24:53.392 --> 24:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organization, that that might
somehow curry
favor with the president?

24:57.996 --> 24:59.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JONATHAN O'CONNELL: Sure.

24:59.898 --> 25:04.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, the original idea was to
avoid bribery
from occurring and make sure
that the president

25:04.770 --> 25:08.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other officials were focused
on doing
the best thing for the nation.

25:08.907 --> 25:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that core ideal is, I think,
at the center
of this initial lawsuit and the
other lawsuits

25:15.280 --> 25:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that could be to come, which is
out of a concern
that Mr. Trump will continue to
have some

25:20.252 --> 25:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allegiance to his businesses,
because he does
still own them and he would
still benefit

25:24.723 --> 25:29.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or profit from their doing well
at the same
time as he is president.

25:29.328 --> 25:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there -- you know, he just
has -- he has
such a wide array of businesses
that he started,

25:35.300 --> 25:38.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to think about all the various
conflicts that
he could have in the various
parts of the

25:38.837 --> 25:42.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal government that he will
oversee, it
is going to take quite a bit of
unwinding.

25:42.941 --> 25:47.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: China is one
of the examples
that is often cited when we talk
about this

25:47.613 --> 25:48.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clause.

25:48.614 --> 25:50.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
China rents space in Trump
Tower.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JONATHAN O'CONNELL: Sure.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A Chinese
government bank,
I know, loans money for a
Trump-related project.

25:55.020 --> 25:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is it that the people who
are bringing
the suit want the Trump
Organization to do?

25:59.892 --> 26:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN O'CONNELL: I think
there is a couple
different motives for a suit
like this.

26:05.130 --> 26:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, if you can get far
enough along down
the line in a lawsuit, you can
get to the

26:10.469 --> 26:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discovery phase, as any attorney
would know,
and that's when you sort of get
to learn much

26:13.772 --> 26:17.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more about what the opposing
party has at
stake here.

26:17.643 --> 26:21.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, you know, maybe they
can unearth
some of Mr. Trump's financials.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe they could even unearth
his tax returns.

26:24.450 --> 26:27.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of this might be a long
shot, but there
are probably a number of groups
that are going

26:27.553 --> 26:29.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to try to take a shot at this.

26:29.388 --> 26:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I mentioned, with all
the businesses
that he has, and you mentioned
some of the

26:33.392 --> 26:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chinese interests, there's a
number of opportunities
and courts at which different
parties could

26:37.729 --> 26:39.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take a shot at him this way.

26:39.598 --> 26:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for instance, he has many
hotels in the
United States, some of which he
owns and some

26:45.003 --> 26:51.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of which he has licensing
agreements on, and
if a foreign government wanted
to say, you

26:51.076 --> 26:54.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, say they're going to do
him a favor
and rent out the entire hotel
for a weekend

26:55.013 --> 26:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and give his company thousands
or tens of
thousands of dollars that way,
there is nothing

26:59.651 --> 27:01.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
preventing them from doing that
now.

27:01.587 --> 27:05.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
president's lawyers
and some other legal scholars
have looked

27:05.424 --> 27:11.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at this and said booking a hotel
is really
not the same as giving a sack
full of cash

27:11.296 --> 27:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the president, because the
money is going
to a corporation, not to the
president himself.

27:15.033 --> 27:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JONATHAN O'CONNELL: Sure.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, again, there's a number
of interpretations
here.

27:18.537 --> 27:24.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, from a president's
lawyer you saw,
if somebody's paying market rate
for a hotel

27:24.776 --> 27:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
room, that doesn't feel like a
gift to a lot
of people.

27:26.545 --> 27:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And maybe it would not be
considered a gift
under the Constitution.

27:30.315 --> 27:34.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, if you look
at an emolument
as any kind of a benefit, any
kind of a payment

27:34.786 --> 27:38.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president receives from
a foreign
entity, then even if one is
paying market

27:38.957 --> 27:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate for a hotel room, that's
still a benefit
to him and to his company.

27:43.795 --> 27:49.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Mr. Trump has also said
that he will
be donating any profits from
foreign clients

27:49.635 --> 27:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or foreign business to the
United States treasury,
but think about the difficulty
of that if

27:53.805 --> 27:56.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you own or operate a hotel
company.

27:56.241 --> 28:00.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hotel staff would then have
to distinguish
between the payments that are
from foreign

28:00.779 --> 28:05.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entities or foreign guests and
everybody else,
and then divvy it up and send a
check to the

28:05.284 --> 28:07.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Treasury.

28:07.185 --> 28:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mr. Trump and his attorneys
have not explained
any of the logistics of how that
would work.

28:12.190 --> 28:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or -- he has also mentioned that
he has closed
down a number of business deals
in order to

28:17.129 --> 28:20.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insulate himself from his
businesses, but
he hasn't disclosed what any of
those deals

28:21.033 --> 28:22.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are either.

28:22.868 --> 28:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president,
in part to
disentangle some of these
things, as you have

28:26.438 --> 28:29.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, has said that he's going
to resign from
his companies.

28:29.274 --> 28:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There seems to be some evidence
that he's
making steps to do that.

28:31.977 --> 28:38.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that a lot of ethics
lawyers have looked
at what he's proposed to do and
say it's insufficient.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do they argue the president
needs to
do?

28:41.019 --> 28:46.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN O'CONNELL: I mean, the
ultimate ideal
from the ethics experts and a
thing that a

28:46.992 --> 28:52.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of presidents have done
before Mr.
Trump is to put their assets
into a blind

28:52.064 --> 28:54.032 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trust.

28:54.066 --> 28:59.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a blind trust, the terms
gets thrown around
quite a bit, but essentially it
is an independently

28:59.071 --> 29:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
operated entity that would
liquidate all of
Mr. Trump's assets.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that's not an easy thing to
do with real
estate.

29:06.845 --> 29:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not ideal to sell real
estate when your
hand is forced, because it's a
cyclical business.

29:12.651 --> 29:17.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there's probably a
reasonable
way for Mr. Trump's company to
retain ownership

29:17.856 --> 29:20.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of his hotel and other
properties.

29:20.092 --> 29:25.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if he doesn't do more than
what he's doing
in terms of taking himself and
his ownership

29:25.230 --> 29:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of these companies, these
questions are
going to continue coming up, I
would imagine,

29:30.102 --> 29:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for his entire presidency.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He owns so many businesses.

29:33.205 --> 29:37.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're so prominent, in terms
of golf and
hotel and products, that I can't
imagine this

29:37.909 --> 29:39.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will away if he continues to own
them all.

29:39.811 --> 29:47.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Jonathan O'Connell
of The Washington Post, thank
you very much.

29:47.653 --> 29:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JONATHAN O'CONNELL: Thank you.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:55.894 --> 30:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": our
Politics
Monday team analyzes the
president's first

30:00.699 --> 30:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days in office; and Europe's far
right hoping
to ride a wave of populism.

30:07.973 --> 30:12.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: The new White House
press secretary
stepped in to the spotlight over
the weekend,

30:12.511 --> 30:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scolding the press, but was
later called to
account for his own false
statements.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has the story.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
I believe that we have to be
honest with the

30:21.553 --> 30:22.621 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
American people.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think sometimes we can
disagree with the
facts.

30:24.489 --> 30:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He was notably
less heated
in tone, but today White House
Press Secretary

30:28.627 --> 30:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Spicer's message was
unchanged: The Trump
White House feels the press is
unfair.

30:33.465 --> 30:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Over and over
again, there is
this attempt to go after this
president and

30:41.039 --> 30:44.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, well, that can't be true
and that's not
right, and the numbers weren't
there, and

30:44.676 --> 30:47.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there's a rush to judgment every
time.

30:47.245 --> 30:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's a two-way street.

30:49.081 --> 30:51.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to have a healthy and
open dialogue
with the press corps and with
the American

30:51.683 --> 30:55.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people about what he's doing to
help this
country and to unite it.

30:55.120 --> 30:59.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today's
briefing follows
a tumultuous weekend, starting
with President

30:59.357 --> 31:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's words about the media
Saturday in
front of the CIA's Memorial
Wall.

31:03.361 --> 31:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), President of
the United
States: They are among the most
dishonest

31:06.131 --> 31:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
human beings on Earth.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:09.234 --> 31:12.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

31:12.604 --> 31:15.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Right?

31:15.974 --> 31:23.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they sort of made it sound
like I had
a feud with the intelligence
community.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just want to let you know,
there's a reason
you're the number one stop.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is exactly the opposite.

31:28.787 --> 31:32.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In fact, two
weeks ago, the
president did tweet about
intelligence agencies,

31:33.024 --> 31:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asking: "Are we living in Nazi
Germany?"

31:35.927 --> 31:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Press Secretary Spicer
said that was
about the process, not
intelligence workers.

31:41.299 --> 31:45.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also sparking conflict, the size
of the crowd
at Mr. Trump's inauguration.

31:45.737 --> 31:51.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Many news organizations
published side-by-side
photos showing the Obama 2009
turnout was

31:51.743 --> 31:54.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
larger than this year's.

31:54.279 --> 31:56.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's where White House Spicer
picked up
Saturday evening.

31:56.248 --> 32:01.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: This was the
largest audience
to ever witness an inauguration,
period, both

32:01.586 --> 32:03.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in person and around the globe.

32:03.655 --> 32:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today, Spicer
clarified,
saying he was including
in-person, plus television

32:09.294 --> 32:10.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and online viewers.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SEAN SPICER: It's
unquestionable.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't -- and I don't see any
numbers that
dispute that.

32:15.901 --> 32:19.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: On Saturday,
Spicer also
correctly pointed out that a
reporter had

32:19.337 --> 32:24.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrongly blasted out news that a
bust of Martin
Luther King Jr. had been removed
from the

32:24.543 --> 32:26.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Oval Office.

32:26.344 --> 32:32.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the greater question was
about how the
Trump administration views facts
and the free

32:32.083 --> 32:33.819 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
press.

32:33.852 --> 32:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump aide Kellyanne Conway made
headlines
when pressed by Chuck Todd on
NBC's "Meet

32:37.389 --> 32:39.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Press" yesterday.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Senior
Adviser: Don't
be so overly dramatic about it,
Chuck.

32:41.226 --> 32:44.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What it -- you're saying it's a
falsehood,
and they're giving -- Sean
Spicer, our press

32:44.830 --> 32:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
secretary, gave alternative
facts to that.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK TODD, Moderator, "Meet The
Press": Look,
alternative facts are not facts.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're falsehoods.

32:52.270 --> 32:55.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And on "FOX
News Sunday,"
President Trump's chief of staff
issued a

32:55.507 --> 32:57.242 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
warning.

32:57.275 --> 32:59.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS, Incoming White
House Chief
Of Staff: I'm saying there's an
obsession

32:59.077 --> 33:04.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the media to delegitimize
this president,
and we are not going to sit
around and let

33:04.983 --> 33:06.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it happen.

33:06.117 --> 33:08.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to fight back tooth
and nail every
day.

33:08.987 --> 33:13.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All this
follows a presidential
campaign in which Mr. Trump's
rhetoric often

33:13.458 --> 33:15.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
targeted journalists.

33:15.260 --> 33:19.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The election is
being rigged
by corrupt media pushing false
allegations

33:19.798 --> 33:24.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and outright lies in an effort
to elect Hillary
Clinton president.

33:24.970 --> 33:25.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

33:25.971 --> 33:29.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: But we are going
to stop it.

33:29.841 --> 33:33.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As it pushes
back at the
media, the Trump team is also
opening up a

33:33.678 --> 33:35.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few new seats.

33:35.513 --> 33:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spicer announced the Briefing
Room will have
four Skype seats to bring in
questions from

33:39.484 --> 33:41.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reporters outside Washington.

33:41.887 --> 33:44.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

33:44.055 --> 33:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We take a deeper
look now at
the Trump administration's
relationship with

33:48.827 --> 33:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the press and the latest policy
moves from
President Trump in this week's
Politics Monday,

33:55.033 --> 34:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with our regulars, Tamara Keith
of NPR and
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

34:00.972 --> 34:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're joined tonight by Jeff
Mason of
Reuters.

34:04.209 --> 34:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the current president of
the White House
Correspondents Association.

34:08.313 --> 34:10.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you
to the program.

34:10.048 --> 34:13.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Mason, I'm going to start
with you, since
you're standing out there in the
cold.

34:13.084 --> 34:14.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:14.586 --> 34:16.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You have been
covering this
White House for eight years.

34:16.521 --> 34:22.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I know there were
contentious times during
the Obama administration between
the press

34:22.127 --> 34:26.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the president and the people
around him,
but how do you compare to what's
happened

34:26.464 --> 34:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the last few days under
President Trump?

34:28.566 --> 34:31.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF MASON, Reuters: Well, it
was certainly
unusual on Saturday to have the
president

34:31.836 --> 34:36.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States to talk
about the media
being the most dishonest people
on Earth,

34:36.174 --> 34:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that followed up by the clip
and the statement
that you showed already by Sean
Spicer in

34:41.479 --> 34:43.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Briefing Room.

34:43.348 --> 34:47.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that is -- I can't really
think of anything
that would compare to that
during my time

34:47.252 --> 34:49.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the White House.

34:49.054 --> 34:55.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, today, in the first
full day at
-- first working day, I guess,
this Monday,

34:55.527 --> 34:57.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the press has had pretty decent
access at
the White House.

34:57.595 --> 35:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were several pool sprays
in which we
got to see the president do
things and hear

35:02.434 --> 35:05.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him make statements.

35:05.203 --> 35:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then Sean Spicer of course
held his briefing
and took questions for over an
hour.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, those are positive steps.

35:11.977 --> 35:18.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the tension over the weekend
was unusual,
and certainly not how I expected
to see them

35:18.350 --> 35:20.085 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
start.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara Keith, as
somebody who
has also covered the White
House, is this

35:23.088 --> 35:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all forgotten now because things
went well
today?

35:25.390 --> 35:27.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: No, not
necessarily.

35:27.559 --> 35:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that, when a trust is
betrayed, that
has to be rebuilt.

35:32.931 --> 35:39.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Sean Spicer came into the
Briefing Room,
stood at that podium and at that
lectern and

35:39.537 --> 35:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said things that were verifiably
untrue.

35:42.774 --> 35:47.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He apologized today at the
briefing -- or
at least said that he doesn't
intentionally

35:47.812 --> 35:51.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to say things that aren't
true and that
he wants to have a good
relationship with

35:51.883 --> 35:52.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the press.

35:52.951 --> 35:56.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's a process that requires
some restoration.

35:56.287 --> 36:02.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, as somebody
who watches
politicians and the press,
because you have

36:02.460 --> 36:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been -- that's what you do for a
living, how
does this look from the outside?

36:08.566 --> 36:13.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are we making more of this than
there is here?

36:13.204 --> 36:15.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I know a lot of people
in the media
who are really upset about it.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: I think
that's a great question, Judy,
because, look,

36:19.677 --> 36:25.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the media loves to spend a lot
of time talking
about itself and do a lot of
navel-gazing,

36:25.250 --> 36:27.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which the general public isn't
quite that
interested in.

36:27.986 --> 36:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They aren't really particularly
concerned
with whether our feelings are
hurt or the

36:32.690 --> 36:35.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
things that we complain about.

36:35.727 --> 36:38.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have their own lives and
their own jobs
that are difficult as well.

36:38.863 --> 36:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they expect from us is to
tell us what
has happened, is to tell them
what is happening

36:42.734 --> 36:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and what isn't happening.

36:44.669 --> 36:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think where the media has
gotten itself
in trouble, not just with the
people who support

36:48.173 --> 36:52.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, but just in the
broader frame
of reference -- remember, they
have an approval

36:52.410 --> 36:58.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rating that's almost as low as
Congress' approval
rating -- is the sense that
they're much more

36:58.349 --> 37:06.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interested in things like
parsing words and
getting into fights about little
minutia,

37:06.157 --> 37:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as opposed to stepping back and
seeing what
the big picture is.

37:09.294 --> 37:13.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where I would argue
that the media
needs to spend much more time
going forward

37:13.531 --> 37:17.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, focusing on what we know,
what we don't
know and then moving on.

37:17.769 --> 37:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Jeff Mason,
that does put
the press in a somewhat
unsympathetic position,

37:22.307 --> 37:24.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doesn't it?

37:24.175 --> 37:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF MASON: Yes, it's always
kind of a tricky
position to be in, when the
press isn't super

37:30.448 --> 37:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
popular in this country either.

37:32.150 --> 37:35.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is something that we
have to take
seriously.

37:35.220 --> 37:40.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as I have been saying for
the last few
weeks, in light of some of this
tension that

37:40.492 --> 37:45.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have had with the then
incoming and now
current administration, having
some tension

37:45.296 --> 37:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is normal, and it's our job to
report the
news, it's our job to report the
news accurately

37:50.435 --> 37:52.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and aggressively.

37:52.237 --> 37:55.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think if the press corps
continues to
do that, then we will be on the
right path.

37:55.440 --> 37:59.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, so, Tam, as
the media,
as all of us continue to look at
the relationship

37:59.878 --> 38:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the press, there were some
substantive
things that happened at the
White House over

38:03.781 --> 38:06.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the last few days, these
executive orders.

38:06.317 --> 38:07.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do they add up to?

38:07.318 --> 38:08.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I interviewed Senator Schumer
today.

38:08.453 --> 38:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was fairly dismissive of it.

38:10.855 --> 38:12.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did you read it?

38:12.624 --> 38:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, first, one
thing that
happened at the White House
today is that

38:15.293 --> 38:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump did things that
a president
does.

38:19.063 --> 38:22.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He held meetings with people and
looked presidential.

38:22.934 --> 38:29.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He signed these three
presidential memoranda,
which is a perfectly normal and
expected thing

38:29.674 --> 38:35.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a president to do when they
come into
office, including one that is
related to funding

38:35.847 --> 38:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of organizations that would
perform abortion
overseas.

38:41.452 --> 38:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is like a ping-pong.

38:43.254 --> 38:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, President Reagan
started it, and
then President Clinton rolled it
back, and

38:48.960 --> 38:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then President Bush brought it
back, and then
President Obama rolled it back.

38:54.766 --> 39:00.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there -- these are, in
some ways, expected
things for a president to do.

39:00.939 --> 39:08.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The memoranda on hiring freezes,
that is not
unheard of.

39:08.613 --> 39:15.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the TPP, that is sort of
like, as a colleague
of mine said, putting the
tombstone in front

39:15.653 --> 39:17.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the grave that was dug about
a year ago.

39:17.722 --> 39:22.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, how much
of this -- this
is an administration that
promised to come

39:22.961 --> 39:25.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right out of the gate getting
things done.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

39:27.665 --> 39:30.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so right of the gate, well,
the things
that they said on the campaign
trail, going

39:30.268 --> 39:34.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get rid of Obamacare, we're
going to stop
these trade deals, they started
that by putting

39:34.906 --> 39:36.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these executive orders in place.

39:36.641 --> 39:42.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we don't know is what that
leads to,
and especially on the Obamacare
executive

39:42.313 --> 39:44.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

39:44.082 --> 39:49.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody, the insurance industry,
hospitals,
doctors, the people who are
signing people

39:49.520 --> 39:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up for Obamacare, know exactly
what that means.

39:51.589 --> 39:54.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is going to be a
process that's put
into place.

39:54.759 --> 39:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, overall, I think the Trump
administration
today did some substantive
things, but we

39:59.030 --> 40:01.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just don't know fundamentally
where they go.

40:01.466 --> 40:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing that Donald
Trump got in his
favor today was the fact that
you had three

40:06.271 --> 40:13.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican senators who were
looking like
at one point they were holding
out on their

40:13.311 --> 40:19.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support for Rex Tillerson,
secretary of state
nominee, and all three came out
and publicly

40:19.484 --> 40:21.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supported him.

40:21.352 --> 40:26.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a big victory for Donald
Trump, because
to come in, in your very first
days in office,

40:26.791 --> 40:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and have your own party sink a
Cabinet nominee
would have been a big blow.

40:30.461 --> 40:34.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to come
back to you
just quickly, Jeff Mason.

40:34.098 --> 40:38.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was kind of a question that I
asked John
Yang, who was also at the White
House today

40:38.870 --> 40:40.672 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for us.

40:40.705 --> 40:43.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, does it feel like
-- I know it's
only three or four days in, but
does it feel

40:43.408 --> 40:46.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like this Trump administration
is getting
its sea legs yet?

40:46.744 --> 40:47.845 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

40:47.879 --> 40:49.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF MASON: I think they are
still working
on that.

40:49.681 --> 40:52.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think they would probably
say the same
if they were standing here, if
anyone from

40:52.583 --> 40:55.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the administration were standing
here.

40:55.987 --> 41:00.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certain things like speaking to
the press
over the loudspeaker are not
working.

41:00.458 --> 41:04.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are telling us -- giving us
announcements
that way now so that the pool
knows when to

41:04.862 --> 41:06.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gather.

41:06.664 --> 41:09.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We are getting our daily
guidance at night
which shows what the president
will be doing

41:10.001 --> 41:11.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the next day.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's taken a couple of days to
get into
a rhythm.

41:14.839 --> 41:16.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that sort of applies to some
other things,
too.

41:17.008 --> 41:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they're getting there, in
terms of figuring
out how the White House works
and how that

41:20.912 --> 41:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationship with the press
works.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we're getting there, too.

41:24.382 --> 41:26.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it takes some adjustment on
both sides.

41:27.018 --> 41:31.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess the principle that I am
continuing
to push for and the
Correspondents Association

41:31.589 --> 41:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is continuing to push for is
that we have
access and that we are able to
see and witness

41:37.729 --> 41:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and chronicle what's going on.

41:39.197 --> 41:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And all of that
is very important.

41:41.999 --> 41:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the little bit of time we
have left, Tam
and Amy, I want to ask you about
this -- what

41:47.138 --> 41:52.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little bit of information now
has come out
about President Trump and his
business connections.

41:52.510 --> 41:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a sense that he's put a
lot of that
aside now and away and there
aren't going

41:58.149 --> 41:59.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be that many more questions?

41:59.617 --> 42:01.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Or how do you see that?

42:01.519 --> 42:05.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, I don't think
that the questions
are going to go away, because of
the way that

42:05.523 --> 42:07.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he's putting it aside.

42:07.291 --> 42:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But NPR has gotten its hands on
documents
that show that he did transfer
the title of

42:12.764 --> 42:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
president of his Trump
Organization to his
son.

42:15.933 --> 42:17.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So that is something.

42:17.802 --> 42:23.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the good government people
and ethicists
and many concerned citizens have
-- this doesn't

42:23.908 --> 42:25.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
allay those concerns.

42:25.810 --> 42:28.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And plus, again, over the
weekend, they confirmed
that they are not planning to
release his

42:28.880 --> 42:31.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tax returns any time soon.

42:31.048 --> 42:33.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, I come
back to you
for 20 seconds.

42:33.618 --> 42:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much does that matter to the
electorate,
to the American people?

42:36.454 --> 42:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It matters if it
matters.

42:38.256 --> 42:42.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we have got to keep
focused on the
most important thing, as voters
said going

42:42.293 --> 42:43.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into this election.

42:43.494 --> 42:45.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
One, they wanted change.

42:45.329 --> 42:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two, they want their economic
security to
be better, their personal lives
to be better.

42:49.967 --> 42:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How and what he does that
impacts those things
are going to be very important.

42:53.838 --> 42:58.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, these are issues that
are going
to continue to be surrounding
him, but getting

42:58.976 --> 43:02.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it back to what matters to
voters is going
to be the most important thing.

43:02.914 --> 43:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, Jeff
Mason, thank you all.

43:14.158 --> 43:21.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFF MASON: Pleasure.

43:21.098 --> 43:29.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One day after
Donald Trump
was inaugurated, European
right-wing leaders

43:29.841 --> 43:35.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issued a rallying cry for voters
to help them
upset the establishment in key
elections this

43:35.546 --> 43:39.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year in the Netherlands, France
and Germany.

43:39.116 --> 43:44.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anti-immigration policies,
strong border controls
and disdain for the bureaucrats
of the European

43:44.722 --> 43:48.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Union binds together these
various groups.

43:48.092 --> 43:52.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They met in the German city of
Koblenz, led
by the French presidential
candidate Marine

Le Pen.

43:54.932 --> 43:59.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant
reports, the message of those
wanting to benefit

43:59.036 --> 44:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the so-called Trump effect
is deepening
Europe's divisions.

44:03.107 --> 44:08.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It was a
triumphalist entrance
for politicians aspiring to
repeat Donald

44:08.679 --> 44:11.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump's unexpected success.

44:11.849 --> 44:19.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The controversial leader of
France's National
Front hopes to be propelled into
the presidency

44:19.090 --> 44:24.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this spring by her
anti-immigration stance
and promise of a Brexit-style
referendum on

44:24.829 --> 44:26.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
French membership of the
European Union.

44:26.931 --> 44:32.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARINE LE PEN, President,
National Front Party
(through translator): The very
first blow

44:32.603 --> 44:38.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the old order, the one factor
that will
have the rest of Europe falling
like dominoes

44:38.209 --> 44:39.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is Brexit.

44:39.944 --> 44:44.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A sovereign people has decided
to get rid
of the powerful's argument, to
be able to

44:44.749 --> 44:48.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decide by itself on its own
fate.

44:48.553 --> 44:49.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

44:49.987 --> 44:58.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARINE LE PEN (through
translator): The second
blow wasn't far behind.

44:58.863 --> 45:04.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's election as the United
States president
put the supporters of
neo-liberalism in even

45:04.368 --> 45:06.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
greater difficulty.

45:06.203 --> 45:11.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: On German soil,
Le Pen took
aim at the leader all
anti-immigrant parties

45:11.475 --> 45:15.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
blame for Europe's refugee
crisis, Chancellor
Angela Merkel.

45:15.646 --> 45:20.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARINE LE PEN (through
translator): Mrs. Merkel
is presented as a humanitarian
heroine.

45:20.418 --> 45:22.219 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

45:22.253 --> 45:26.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARINE LE PEN (through
translator): If they
asked the Germans if they were
happy, everyone

45:26.624 --> 45:32.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would see that this migration
policy is a
daily catastrophe.

45:32.897 --> 45:38.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The crowd
chanted, "Merkel
must go," and lapped up the
speech by Geert

45:38.836 --> 45:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wilders, a fervent critic of
Islam, leader
of Holland's Freedom Party, and
in contention

45:44.375 --> 45:46.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be the next Dutch prime
minister.

45:46.210 --> 45:51.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEERT WILDERS, Leader, Freedom
Party (through
translator): A new America,
today, Koblenz,

45:51.048 --> 45:53.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tomorrow, a new Europe.

45:53.284 --> 45:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: At a packed
news conference,
he had these words for critics
of Europe's

45:57.822 --> 45:58.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right wing.

45:58.823 --> 46:00.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEERT WILDERS: We will not stop.

46:00.224 --> 46:02.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The people will not stop.

46:02.960 --> 46:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether the old-fashioned
politicians or the
friends of the press like it or
not, it will

46:09.634 --> 46:11.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not be stopped.

46:11.268 --> 46:16.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The genie will not go back into
the bottle
again, whether you like it or
not.

46:16.841 --> 46:22.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Of all the
nationalist grouping
here, it is the Alternative for
Germany Party

46:22.313 --> 46:27.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which appears to be faltering,
although it
remains the third most popular
in the country.

46:27.852 --> 46:32.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the Christmas market truck
massacre
in Berlin, there was a surge in
support.

46:32.723 --> 46:37.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that appears to have been
temporary, as,
according to the latest opinion
polls, its

46:37.294 --> 46:40.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
national approval numbers are
down to 11 percent.

46:40.331 --> 46:44.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason for that appears
to be that
Chancellor Merkel's government
has promised

46:44.368 --> 46:49.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new raft of security measures,
including
the fast deportation of criminal
refugees

46:49.974 --> 46:52.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and migrants.

46:52.576 --> 46:57.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Providing more workers for
Germany's powerhouse
economy was one of Merkel's
justifications

46:57.148 --> 47:00.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for her open door immigration
policy.

47:00.317 --> 47:04.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With elections looming this
autumn, Merkel's
Christian Democratic Union is
perceived as

47:04.889 --> 47:11.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
having a steadier hand on the
tiller of prosperity
than the untested AFD, or
Alternative for

47:11.362 --> 47:13.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Germany Party.

47:13.297 --> 47:19.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Koblenz's biggest monument,
the AFD's alleged
Nazi tendencies were satirized
with cardboard

47:19.170 --> 47:22.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cutouts of Second World War
dictators.

47:22.640 --> 47:26.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That impression was reinforced
after one of
its senior members said that
Germany should

47:26.911 --> 47:31.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abandon what he called its
shameful memories
about the Holocaust.

47:31.382 --> 47:36.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This might explain the subdued
speech of party
leader Frauke Petry on the banks
of the Rhine.

47:36.520 --> 47:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRAUKE PETRY, Chair, Alternative
for Germany
Party (through translator): We
have to expose

47:43.427 --> 47:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who call for a more
powerful European
Union as the true
anti-Europeans, the true

47:49.967 --> 47:52.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anti-democrats.

47:52.069 --> 47:55.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have an answer to these
spineless technocrats.

47:55.773 --> 48:00.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that answer is people and
politicians
who are going to take back
Europe and restore

48:00.978 --> 48:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
its freedom and sovereignty.

48:02.780 --> 48:07.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
right-wingers may be
hoping to benefit from the Trump
effect, but,

48:07.284 --> 48:13.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Inauguration Day, most
customers in this
cafe were turning a blind eye.

48:13.624 --> 48:17.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Koblenz gathering generated
two days of
protests.

48:17.628 --> 48:19.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
History student Anna Khodorova:

48:19.396 --> 48:25.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNA KHODOROVA, Student: It kind
of reminds
me of the time when Hitler was
still alive,

48:25.736 --> 48:34.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because he used populism against
Jews, against
other discriminated groups of
people.

48:34.311 --> 48:40.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have learned from history,
and I'm afraid
that this happens again also
when Trump becomes

48:40.050 --> 48:41.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

48:41.819 --> 48:51.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The next day,
outside the
conference center, a band played
the anthem

48:51.695 --> 48:54.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the European Union, which the
nationalists
despise.

48:54.899 --> 49:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
English teacher Herman Spix
fears that Europe
is backsliding into the darkest
period of

49:00.571 --> 49:02.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
German history.

49:02.306 --> 49:07.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HERMAN SPIX, Teacher: I'm very,
very much
concerned, because I have been
working on

49:07.645 --> 49:13.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the issue of the Third Reich for
nearly 20
years.

49:13.083 --> 49:15.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is -- in my sense, it is
comparable.

49:15.653 --> 49:22.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: More and more people are
spreading
racism, sexism, and homophobe
sentiments or

49:22.960 --> 49:24.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
whatever.

49:24.795 --> 49:30.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If they come into the
parliament, it will
be a big difference, because I
think we will

49:31.001 --> 49:36.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all be very astonished at what
they will do.

49:36.340 --> 49:41.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The police
erected a protective
ring around the conference
center.

49:41.645 --> 49:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Local AFD councillor Ulrich
Langenback rejected
accusations that they are Nazis
in suits.

49:47.451 --> 49:49.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ULRICH LANGENBACK, Councillor,
Alternative
for Germany Party: For me, they
are.

49:49.486 --> 49:51.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will not use his word.

49:51.455 --> 49:55.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are the fascists, because
it's only young
people.

49:55.092 --> 49:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they got brainwashed by
school and university.

49:58.762 --> 50:03.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Happy to
demonstrate their
enthusiasm in the dark, not so
many were prepared

50:03.968 --> 50:05.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to voice their opinions
publicly.

50:05.603 --> 50:07.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ULRICH LANGENBACK: Germany is
very weak.

50:07.371 --> 50:10.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You are not allowed to speak
openly.

50:10.074 --> 50:14.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're -- always when you speak
if you are
in the AFD, you can worry about
your job.

50:14.078 --> 50:18.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: These
nationalists hope that
hitching themselves to the Trump
bandwagon

50:18.582 --> 50:21.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will bring electoral success.

50:21.252 --> 50:25.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In order to symbolize unity,
they held their
conference where Germany's two
great rivers

50:26.023 --> 50:27.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
meet.

50:27.925 --> 50:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But their message emphasized
growing divisions
within Europe, as the continent
steams deeper

50:31.929 --> 50:34.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into an unpredictable 2017.

50:34.098 --> 50:38.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Koblenz.

50:38.903 --> 50:49.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

50:49.213 --> 50:51.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

50:51.115 --> 50:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every winter, millions of tons
of salt are
spread across the country's
roads and sidewalks.

50:55.886 --> 50:59.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Much of it comes Ohio's Whiskey
Island Salt
Mine.

50:59.823 --> 51:05.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elizabeth Miller of WVIZ/PBS
ideastream in
Cleveland reports.

51:05.229 --> 51:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH MILLER: When old man
winter rears
his icy head, there's one thing
that keeps

51:11.101 --> 51:15.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ohio from becoming a virtual
slip 'n slide:
salt.

51:15.806 --> 51:21.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A natural deicer, over 17
million tons of
rock salt was spread over roads
and sidewalks

51:21.578 --> 51:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the United States during the
particularly
fierce winter of 2015.

51:26.016 --> 51:29.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But where does it all come from?

51:29.954 --> 51:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The answer might surprise you.

51:31.655 --> 51:37.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Right now, we are in the
Whiskey Island
Mine, 1,800 feet below Lake
Erie.

51:37.528 --> 51:41.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are mining salt for the
purposes of
road deicing.

51:41.899 --> 51:47.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, we mined a little
over three million
tons in a pretty mild winter.

51:47.171 --> 51:52.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a normal winter, we will do
about four
million tons a year.

51:52.977 --> 51:56.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH MILLER: Ohio is one of
the top exporters
of salt in the country, and it's
actually

51:56.647 --> 52:01.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mined right under our noses in
places like
Cargill's Whiskey Island Salt
Mine.

52:01.652 --> 52:05.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 12-square-mile mine lies
just offshore
of downtown Cleveland.

52:05.923 --> 52:12.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Once we blast the salt out
of the ground,
we got ahead and scoop it up and
put it on

52:12.696 --> 52:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the belt lines to be sent to the
mill for
processing.

52:16.166 --> 52:21.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH MILLER: A system of
conveyor belts
and elevators bring the salt to
the surface.

52:21.238 --> 52:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Left behind are gigantic pillars
of salt.

52:23.707 --> 52:27.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These support the weight of the
thousands
of feet of rock and lake above
the mine.

52:27.911 --> 52:29.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But wait.

52:29.313 --> 52:34.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did all this salt get here,
almost 2,000
feet under Lake Erie?

52:34.084 --> 52:38.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To answer that question, we
headed to Cleveland's
Museum of Natural History to
talk to expert

52:38.689 --> 52:40.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Harvey Webster.

52:40.491 --> 52:41.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARVEY WEBSTER, Cleveland Museum
of Natural
History: We always think, you
know, Cleveland,

52:41.692 --> 52:43.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ohio, has always been north of
the equator.

52:43.460 --> 52:46.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's been in a temperate
location kind of
forever, right?

52:46.130 --> 52:47.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the answer is no.

52:47.865 --> 52:53.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turns out that North America,
like all
the other continents, has moved
across the

52:53.270 --> 52:55.039 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
planet.

52:55.072 --> 52:58.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the time of the Silurian,
400 million
years ago, Cleveland, Ohio,
would have been

52:58.842 --> 53:05.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about 1,000 miles south of the
equator, in
shallow, tropical conditions.

53:05.315 --> 53:11.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH MILLER: So, Ohio was
tropical, oh,
yes, and covered in a shallow
sea.

53:11.855 --> 53:16.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And its inhabitants are not the
kind of thing
you see strolling in downtown
Cleveland today.

53:16.760 --> 53:21.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eventually, these tropical
conditions and
some overgrown coral reefs
caused the sea

53:21.598 --> 53:23.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to dry up, leaving the salt
behind.

53:23.767 --> 53:29.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARVEY WEBSTER: It would get
saltier and saltier
and saltier, until, finally, the
salt literally

53:29.473 --> 53:33.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
settles right out of that water,
and forms
rock salt.

53:33.677 --> 53:39.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this happened thousands,
tens of thousands
of times, and each time it
happened, it would

53:39.683 --> 53:42.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
add a new layer to the rock
column.

53:42.886 --> 53:47.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if you went to the
Cargill mine, when
you look at the walls, you will
see these

53:47.591 --> 53:49.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alternating bands.

53:49.359 --> 53:53.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each one of those layers is like
a chapter
in the history of the world
right here in

53:53.730 --> 53:57.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cleveland as it existed 400
million years
ago.

53:57.201 --> 54:01.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH MILLER: The salt mine
looks like
another world, and it really is
one.

54:01.672 --> 54:04.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the remains of world that
existed long
before man.

54:04.475 --> 54:08.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even if you never get down
to the mine,
you will still see pieces of
this world scattered

54:08.879 --> 54:11.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on icy roads all winter long.

54:11.515 --> 54:14.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Elizabeth Miller
in Cleveland, Ohio.

54:14.718 --> 54:18.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And thank you,
Ohio, for your
salt.

54:18.088 --> 54:19.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:19.590 --> 54:20.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:20.924 --> 54:32.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
