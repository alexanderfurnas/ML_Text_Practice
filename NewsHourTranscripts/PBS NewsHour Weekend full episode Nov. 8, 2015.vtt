FIGHT THAT FIGHT.

WITH THESE MIDDLE EASTERN

03:19.167 --> 03:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES AND THEY DON'T

03:20.300 --> 03:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARILY WANT TO UPROOT AND

03:21.500 --> 03:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVE THEIR FORCES TO TURKEY

03:25.500 --> 03:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

MYANMAR.

06:53.100 --> 06:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

GIVE CANDIDATES.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS ASTOUNDING WHEN YOU

07:03.167 --> 07:04.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK OF THIS COUNTRY AS BEING

07:04.567 --> 07:06.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOMINATED BY THE MILITARY FOR

07:06.167 --> 07:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HALF A CENTURY.

07:07.967 --> 07:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECONDLY, THIS IS REALLY THE

07:09.300 --> 07:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST TIME IN TA YEARS THAT

07:12.533 --> 07:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE-- IN 25 YEARS THAT THE MAJOR

07:15.833 --> 07:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:21.500 --> 07:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO FOR MANY MYANMAR PEOPLE, THIS

07:23.300 --> 07:24.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THE FIRST TIME IN THEIR LIVES

07:24.567 --> 07:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

07:29.900 --> 07:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MILITARY IS GIVING THEM

07:31.033 --> 07:31.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETE CONTROL.

07:31.967 --> 07:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY STILL HAVE 25% OF ALL THE

07:35.067 --> 07:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARLIAMENTARY SEAT, THEY'LL

07:36.167 --> 07:37.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL CONTROL THAT.

07:37.167 --> 07:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

07:37.900 --> 07:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THE GENERALS OF THE JUNTA

07:41.033 --> 07:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECIDED TO BEGIN A TRANSITION TO

07:43.467 --> 07:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRACY, THEY PUT TOGETHER A

07:47.500 --> 07:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTION THAT INSURES THAT

07:48.733 --> 07:50.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE THE UPPER EDGE.

07:50.367 --> 07:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY MAINTAIN 25% OF ALL SEATS

07:52.333 --> 07:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTOMATICALLY IN THE PARLIAMENT

07:53.433 --> 07:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH GIVES THEM A CLEAR

07:54.567 --> 07:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADVANTAGE.

07:55.267 --> 07:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT THEY DID WAS FASHIONED

07:58.433 --> 08:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEMSELVES, GOLDEN PARACHUTES

08:00.500 --> 08:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF THE OLD SYSTEM, CHANGED

CIVILIAN GARB, BUT MAKE NO

MISTAKE ABOUT IT, THE MILITARY

08:08.767 --> 08:09.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STILL HOLDS THE ABUNDANCE OF

08:09.867 --> 08:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWER.

08:10.633 --> 08:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THAT MEANS

08:11.633 --> 08:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT A LOT OF THESE, YOU KNOW,

08:14.033 --> 08:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPETITIVE RACES IN ALL THESE

08:15.433 --> 08:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMALL PLACES, THEY'RE GOING TO

08:16.967 --> 08:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE TO FORM COALITIONS IN ORDER

08:18.833 --> 08:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO OVERCOME THE POWER THAT THE

08:20.467 --> 08:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY ALREADY HAS BUILT IN.

08:24.933 --> 08:26.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ABSOLUTELY.

08:26.167 --> 08:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNLESS AUNG SAN SUU KYI HAS WON

08:28.333 --> 08:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY A SIGNIFICANT LANDSLIDE.

08:29.267 --> 08:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT COULD HAPPEN.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WHAT I'M HEARING IS 30

08:32.067 --> 08:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILLION PEOPLE WERE ELIGIBLE TO

08:33.833 --> 08:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE.

08:34.167 --> 08:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT AS MANY

08:36.500 --> 08:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS 80% OF THOSE 30 MILLION CAME

08:38.433 --> 08:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE POLLS.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD TRANSLATE PROBABLY

08:41.900 --> 08:44.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO SUPPORT FOR THE NLD.

08:44.167 --> 08:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE A LANDSLIDE, BUT IF

08:46.333 --> 08:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT, YOU ARE EXACTLY LIGHT.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE BE A LOT OF ALLIANCE,

08:50.233 --> 08:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COALITION BUILDING, THIS

08:51.333 --> 08:53.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL HAVE TO INCLUDE MANY OF THE

08:53.467 --> 08:55.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SMALLER ETHNIC MINORITY PARTIES.

08:55.667 --> 08:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER

08:59.967 --> 09:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LEADER OF MYANMAR HAS THE

09:01.567 --> 09:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SKILL SET TO BE A UNIFIER, THAT

09:03.800 --> 09:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS REALLY NEEDED TO BRING THIS

09:05.233 --> 09:06.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY TO IT'S NEXT STEP.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OTHER SPECTER LOOMING WHICH IS

09:10.100 --> 09:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
25 YEARS AGO THEY HAD THE

09:11.333 --> 09:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION, THE MILITARY DIDN'T

09:12.100 --> 09:13.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE WHAT THEY SAW, CHOSE TO

09:13.467 --> 09:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAY IN POWER.

09:14.333 --> 09:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

09:14.733 --> 09:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT HAPPENS

09:15.733 --> 09:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOMORROW, NEXT WEEK, NEXT MONTH

09:17.500 --> 09:19.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN ALL THOSE TOTALS ARE IN AND

09:19.567 --> 09:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING THE

09:20.833 --> 09:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY LIKES.

09:21.700 --> 09:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THAT'S THE BIGGEST

09:23.900 --> 09:24.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERN.

09:24.567 --> 09:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
25 YEARS AGO THE MILITARY DID

09:26.533 --> 09:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT EXPECT THE NLD TO WIN BY A

09:29.067 --> 09:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANDSLIDE.

09:29.967 --> 09:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE CAUGHT BY SURPRISE.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS TIME THEY CANNOT SAY THAT

09:32.767 --> 09:34.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WILL BE CAUGHT BY SURPRISE.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAVE BEEN PREPARATIONS FOR

09:36.533 --> 09:37.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS.

09:37.267 --> 09:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO THE CURRENT PRESIDENT AND

09:40.600 --> 09:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER MILITARY LEADERS ARE ON

RECORD AS SAYING IF THE NLD WIN,

09:44.167 --> 09:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THE OPPOSITION WINS, THEY

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL RESPECT THAT.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO MYANMAR IS A DIFFERENT

09:48.567 --> 09:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY TODAY.

09:50.433 --> 09:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE MORE CONNECTED TO THE

09:51.533 --> 09:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REST OF THE WORLD.

09:52.733 --> 09:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES HAS NORMALIZED

09:54.567 --> 09:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONS.

09:54.933 --> 09:56.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THE MILITARY DECIDES NOT TO

09:56.967 --> 09:59.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE GOOD, IF THE NLD WINS, THIS

09:59.167 --> 10:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD TURN INTO A MAJOR

10:00.833 --> 10:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
