FROM COAL AND SO I THINK        

11:16.983 --> 11:18.622
AND STARTING WITH DIVESTING     
FROM COAL AND SO I THINK        
THERE IS A LOT OF DEBATE        

11:18.624 --> 11:19.492
FROM COAL AND SO I THINK        
THERE IS A LOT OF DEBATE        
GOING ON HERE.                  

11:19.493 --> 11:21.468
THERE IS A LOT OF DEBATE        
GOING ON HERE.                  
AND I THINK THAT HARVARD'S      

11:21.470 --> 11:22.908
GOING ON HERE.                  
AND I THINK THAT HARVARD'S      
STATEMENT TO NOT ENGAGE IN      

11:22.909 --> 11:24.482
AND I THINK THAT HARVARD'S      
STATEMENT TO NOT ENGAGE IN      
THIS HAS LEAD TO A LOT OF       

11:24.485 --> 11:26.123
STATEMENT TO NOT ENGAGE IN

11:26.126 --> 11:29.607
THIS HAS LEAD TO A LOT OF       
ENGAGEMENT FROM STUDENTS AND    
ALUMNI AND MANY LEADERS AND     

11:29.608 --> 11:30.645
ENGAGEMENT FROM STUDENTS AND    
ALUMNI AND MANY LEADERS AND     
FINANCIAL LEADERS SAYING        

11:30.647 --> 11:32.052
ALUMNI AND MANY LEADERS AND     
FINANCIAL LEADERS SAYING        
THAT ACTUALLY THE FINANCIAL     

11:32.054 --> 11:33.726
FINANCIAL LEADERS SAYING        
THAT ACTUALLY THE FINANCIAL     
ARGUMENT IS SAYING AROUND       

11:33.728 --> 11:35.132
THAT ACTUALLY THE FINANCIAL     
ARGUMENT IS SAYING AROUND       
NOT DIVESTING IS NOT AS         

11:35.134 --> 11:36.505

NOT DIVESTING IS NOT AS         
STRONG AS THE FINANCIAL         

11:36.507 --> 11:38.013
NOT DIVESTING IS NOT AS         
STRONG AS THE FINANCIAL         
ARGUMENT FOR DIVESTING.         

11:38.014 --> 11:39.586
