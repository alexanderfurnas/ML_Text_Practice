00:11.278 --> 00:13.614
FOR SATURDAY MAY 23: NOT

00:13.614 --> 00:15.015
GUILTY-- THE DRAMATIC VERDICT

00:15.015 --> 00:15.816
IN THE CASE AGAINST THE

00:15.816 --> 00:17.317
CLEVELAND OFFICER ACCUSED OF

00:17.317 --> 00:19.319
KILLING TWO UNARMED SUSPECTS;

00:19.319 --> 00:21.021
AFTER A LATE-NIGHT VOTE, THE

00:21.021 --> 00:22.356
SENATE FAILS TO EXTEND A

00:22.356 --> 00:23.724
CONTROVERSIAL DOMESTIC

00:23.724 --> 00:25.092
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM;

00:25.092 --> 00:26.593
AND, IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:26.593 --> 00:27.995
THE POTENTIAL DANGERS OF

00:27.995 --> 00:29.663
TRANSPORTING OIL ACROSS THE

00:29.663 --> 00:30.831
COUNTRY BY RAIL.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.900
>> IF WE'RE SENDING 10 OR 20 OR

00:32.900 --> 00:35.769
30 TIMES AS MUCH OIL DOWN THE

00:35.769 --> 00:39.373
TRACK, THAT OBVIOUSLY INCREASES

00:39.373 --> 00:40.574
THE CHANCES OF AN ACCIDENT

00:40.574 --> 00:41.508
OCCURRING.

00:41.508 --> 00:42.676
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:42.676 --> 00:44.011
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.046
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:46.046 --> 00:47.614
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:47.614 --> 00:49.316
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:49.316 --> 00:50.217
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.285
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:51.285 --> 00:52.686
PROTESTERS MARCHED IN CLEVELAND

00:52.686 --> 00:54.087
TODAY AFTER POLICE OFFICER

00:54.087 --> 00:55.589
MICHAEL BRELO WAS FOUND NOT

00:55.589 --> 00:57.224
GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS IN THE

00:57.224 --> 00:58.825
SHOOTING DEATHS OF TWO BLACK,

00:58.825 --> 01:00.160
UNARMED SUSPECTS.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.396
BRELO WAS AMONG THE 13 OFFICERS

01:02.396 --> 01:05.299
WHO FIRED 137 BULLETS AT A CAR

01:05.299 --> 01:06.700
DURING AND AFTER A HIGH-SPEED

01:06.700 --> 01:08.802
CHASE IN NOVEMBER OF 2012.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.671
ONCE THE SUSPECTS STOPPED, BRELO

01:10.671 --> 01:12.873
JUMPED ONTO THE HOOD AND FIRED

01:12.873 --> 01:15.409
15 ROUNDS INTO THE WINDSHIELD.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.777
43-YEAR-OLD DRIVER TIMOTHY

01:16.777 --> 01:17.878
RUSSELL AND 30-YEAR-OLD

01:17.878 --> 01:19.379
PASSENGER MALISSA WILLIAMS WERE

01:19.379 --> 01:20.280
KILLED.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.548
THIS MORNING, JUDGE JOHN

01:21.548 --> 01:23.283
O'DONNELL SPENT NEARLY AN HOUR

01:23.283 --> 01:25.218
EXPLAINING THAT OFFICER BRELO'S

01:25.218 --> 01:27.321
BULLETS COULD NOT BE PROVED TO

01:27.321 --> 01:29.122
BE THE FATAL SHOTS BEYOND A

01:29.122 --> 01:30.958
DOUBT, AND THAT THE DECISION TO

01:30.958 --> 01:32.359
FIRE HIS WEAPON WAS

01:32.359 --> 01:35.062
CONSTITUTIONALLY REASONABLE.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.296
>> I FIND BY A PREPONDERANCE

01:36.296 --> 01:37.464
OF THE EVIDENCE THAT BRELO'S

01:37.464 --> 01:40.067
DECISION TO USE DEADLY FORCE

01:40.067 --> 01:41.435
AGAINST RUSSELL AND WILLIAMS WAS

01:41.435 --> 01:42.836
BASED ON PROBABLE CAUSE TO

01:42.836 --> 01:45.138
BELIEVE THAT THEY

01:45.138 --> 01:46.373
THREATENED IMMINENT, SERIOUS

01:46.373 --> 01:47.808
BODILY HARM TO HIM AND THE OTHER

01:47.808 --> 01:49.109
OFFICERS, NOT TO MENTION THE

01:49.109 --> 01:50.377
PUBLIC.

01:50.377 --> 01:51.478
>> Sreenivasan: ONE OF THE

01:51.478 --> 01:52.546
VICTIMS' FAMILY MEMBERS HAD THIS

01:52.546 --> 01:53.714
RESPONSE:

01:53.714 --> 01:55.615
>> BUT HOW CAN YOU GET ON TOP OF

01:55.615 --> 01:59.653
THIS CAR AND NOT BE CHARGED?

01:59.653 --> 02:01.688
AND NOT BE CHARGED!

02:01.688 --> 02:03.457
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID!

02:03.457 --> 02:04.424
>> I WILL NEVER TRUST THE

02:04.424 --> 02:05.892
CLEVELAND POLICE, THE DEPUTY

02:05.892 --> 02:07.894
SHERIFF, ANY POLICE, PERIOD,

02:07.894 --> 02:08.628
NEVER AGAIN.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.830
I WILL NEVER CALL THEM TO MY

02:09.830 --> 02:11.331
HOUSE FOR ANYTHING.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.232
>> Sreenivasan: BRELO'S DEFENSE

02:12.232 --> 02:13.533
ATTORNEY HELD THE VICTIMS

02:13.533 --> 02:14.935
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EVENTS AND

02:14.935 --> 02:16.103
HAD STRONG WORDS FOR THE

02:16.103 --> 02:18.071
PROSECUTION.

02:18.071 --> 02:20.741
>> THE PROSECUTION IN THIS CASE

02:20.741 --> 02:23.310
SPARED NO EXPENSE AND WAS IN

02:23.310 --> 02:25.712
FACT RUTHLESS.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.848
IT WAS CLASSICALLY A CASE OF

02:27.848 --> 02:30.250
DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH.

02:30.250 --> 02:30.217
>> Sreenivasan: CLEVELAND'S

02:30.217 --> 02:31.485
POLICE CHIEF TOLD REPORTERS THAT

02:31.485 --> 02:33.587
OFFICER BRELO REMAINS ON UNPAID

02:33.587 --> 02:35.222
SUSPENSION WHILE THE DEPARTMENT

02:35.222 --> 02:37.858
EXPLORES ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES.

02:37.858 --> 02:38.658
FOR MORE ON THE VERDICT, I'M

02:38.658 --> 02:39.993
JOINED FROM CLEVELAND BY "PLAIN

02:39.993 --> 02:41.862
DEALER" REPORTER MARK NAYMIK.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.630
SO, OF THE PEOPLE YOU'VE TALKED

02:43.630 --> 02:44.664
TO AND THE PLACES YOU VISITED

02:44.664 --> 02:45.866
TODAY THAT KNEW ABOUT THE

02:45.866 --> 02:47.267
VERDICT, WHAT WAS THEIR

02:47.267 --> 02:49.036
REACTION?

02:49.036 --> 02:52.439
>> YOU KNOW, SOME IS, WELL, WE

02:52.439 --> 02:52.406
EXPECTED IT.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.441
NOW, THEY MAY EXPECT IT BECAUSE,

02:54.441 --> 02:56.743
YOU KNOW, SOME IDENTIFIED THEIR

02:56.743 --> 02:59.946
DISTRUST FOR THE JUSTICE SYSTEM;

02:59.946 --> 03:02.115
OTHERS, YOU KNOW, THOUGHT, WELL,

03:02.115 --> 03:03.383
OKAY, THAT'S WHAT THE EVIDENCE

03:03.383 --> 03:05.685
SHOWED, BUT NO ONE WAS

03:05.685 --> 03:06.820
SURPRISED.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.222
NO ONE VOICED THAT TO ME.

03:09.222 --> 03:10.690
THEY ARE DISAPPOINTED, THEY ARE

03:10.690 --> 03:12.426
FRUSTRATED, THEY USE IT AS A

03:12.426 --> 03:14.094
POINT TO TALK ABOUT LARGER

03:14.094 --> 03:16.163
ISSUES IN THE CITY-- OBVIOUSLY

03:16.163 --> 03:19.699
ECONOMIC ISSUES, CRIME-- AND

03:19.699 --> 03:21.902
PEOPLE WANT MORE ATTENTION PAID

03:21.902 --> 03:23.370
TO THEM AND THEIR ISSUES, BUT

03:23.370 --> 03:26.239
NOBODY SAID TO ME, "WOW, I AM

03:26.239 --> 03:26.940
SHOCKED."

03:26.940 --> 03:27.707
>> Sreenivasan: THE MAYOR,

03:27.707 --> 03:28.708
FRANK JACKSON, CALLED THIS A

03:28.708 --> 03:30.343
"DEFINING MOMENT FOR THE CITY."

03:30.343 --> 03:31.645
THIS IS A CITY STILL ON EDGE

03:31.645 --> 03:33.013
FROM TAMIR RICE, AND THERE WERE

03:33.013 --> 03:34.181
SCHEDULED PROTESTS FOR THAT,

03:34.181 --> 03:35.615
RIGHT?

03:35.615 --> 03:36.083
>> YES.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.517
IN FACT, THAT IS JUST ONE OF

03:37.517 --> 03:39.619
SEVERAL MORE MAJOR DECISIONS

03:39.619 --> 03:41.688
THAT I THINK WILL TEST BOTH THE

03:41.688 --> 03:43.990
POLICE RESPONSE, THE ORGANIZED

03:43.990 --> 03:46.660
DEMONSTRATION RESPONSE, AND KIND

03:46.660 --> 03:48.361
OF THE RESIDENTS' PATIENCE.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.464
TAMIR RICE, OVER THE LAST FEW

03:50.464 --> 03:52.065
WEEKS, THAT ISSUE-- AND TODAY IS

03:52.065 --> 03:53.600
THE SIX-MONTH ANNIVERSARY SINCE

03:53.600 --> 03:54.868
HE WAS SHOT-- THAT'S WHY THERE

03:54.868 --> 03:56.503
WERE SCHEDULED PROTESTS.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.805
THAT REALLY SEEMS TO CONNECT A

03:58.805 --> 04:01.041
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THIS BRELO

04:01.041 --> 04:03.477
VERDICT, WHICH NOW DATES BACK TO

04:03.477 --> 04:05.812
2012.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.181
AGAIN, TWO PEOPLE DIED, MANY

04:08.181 --> 04:09.950
PEOPLE ANGRY ABOUT IT BUT TAMIR

04:09.950 --> 04:11.485
RICE, THE IDEA OF A 12-YEAR-OLD

04:11.485 --> 04:13.587
BOY, MANY KNEW HIM, HE WAS FROM

04:13.587 --> 04:15.589
A NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE WEST SIDE,

04:15.589 --> 04:16.890
THAT ONE REALLY HAS THE

04:16.890 --> 04:18.525
EMOTIONAL PUNCH THAT I THINK

04:18.525 --> 04:20.961
WITH THIS AND THE POLICE CHASE

04:20.961 --> 04:23.263
AND SHOOTING OF TIMOTHY

04:23.263 --> 04:25.398
RUSSELL AND MELISSA WILLIAMS

04:25.398 --> 04:26.933
IS THE ONE THAT COULD SPARK A

04:26.933 --> 04:28.735
STRONGER REACTION, BUT RIGHT NOW

04:28.735 --> 04:30.003
IT IS VERY CALM.

04:30.003 --> 04:30.737
>> Sreenivasan: THE CHIEF OF

04:30.737 --> 04:32.205
POLICE SAID THEY ARE ALREADY

04:32.205 --> 04:33.773
PLANNING TO CHANGE THEIR POLICY

04:33.773 --> 04:36.409
ON HIGH-SPEED PURSUITS.

04:36.409 --> 04:38.211
>> AND THEY HAVE SHOWN THAT IN

04:38.211 --> 04:39.579
THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.214
WE HAD A HIGH-SPEED CHASE THAT

04:41.214 --> 04:43.383
WAS CALLED OFF, AND THERE WAS

04:43.383 --> 04:44.718
SOME CRITICISM FROM THE POLICE

04:44.718 --> 04:46.453
UNION ABOUT THAT, SAYING THAT,

04:46.453 --> 04:48.355
"YOU KNOW, WE LET THESE PEOPLE

04:48.355 --> 04:50.090
GET AWAY.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.058
THIS WAS MANAGED WELL, NOBODY

04:52.058 --> 04:53.260
WAS AT RISK."

04:53.260 --> 04:54.294
THEY DID GET LICENSE PLATE

04:54.294 --> 04:56.062
INFORMATION AND THE NEXT DAY

04:56.062 --> 04:57.797
THEY ARRESTED THAT SUSPECT.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.666
THE CITY HAS BEEN MAKING THAT

04:59.666 --> 05:01.201
MESSAGE A LOT, THAT THEY HAVE

05:01.201 --> 05:03.270
ALREADY CHANGED POLICY IN

05:03.270 --> 05:06.206
REACTION TO THAT 2012 POLICE

05:06.206 --> 05:07.240
CHASE THAT ENDED IN THE

05:07.240 --> 05:07.908
SHOOTING.

05:07.908 --> 05:11.545
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

05:11.545 --> 05:11.011
CHANGES THEY ARE MAKING WITH

05:11.011 --> 05:12.712
SO-CALLED COMMUNITY POLICING AND

05:12.712 --> 05:13.680
TRYING TO CONNECT WITH THE

05:13.680 --> 05:14.548
RESIDENTS.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.949
VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO BE

05:15.949 --> 05:18.351
SENT RIGHT NOW AT A TIME WHEN

05:18.351 --> 05:19.786
PEOPLE AGAIN ARE ON EDGE AND

05:19.786 --> 05:22.322
POTENTIALLY READY TO REACT.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.323
ONE OF SEVERAL...

05:23.323 --> 05:26.793
WE HAVE A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

05:26.793 --> 05:28.528
CONSENT DECREE THAT IS BEING

05:28.528 --> 05:30.564
NEGOTIATED RIGHT NOW THAT SHOULD

05:30.564 --> 05:32.899
BE DONE IN THE NEXT MONTH OR

05:32.899 --> 05:33.833
SO.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.235
THAT WILL HAVE A REACTION.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.770
THE TAMIR RICE INVESTIGATION IS

05:36.770 --> 05:37.938
STILL NOT COMPLETED.

05:37.938 --> 05:38.972
THAT WILL HAVE A REACTION.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.107
AND WHETHER THEY CHARGE, ANOTHER

05:41.107 --> 05:42.642
POTENTIAL FLASH POINT.

05:42.642 --> 05:43.276
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

05:43.276 --> 05:44.411
MARK NAYMIK, REPORTER FROM THE

05:44.411 --> 05:46.479
CLEVELAND "PLAIN DEALER," THANK

05:46.479 --> 05:47.180
YOU SO MUCH.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.381
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

05:48.381 --> 05:49.482
>> Sreenivasan: DESPITE INTENSE

05:49.482 --> 05:51.017
DEBATE AND A LATE-NIGHT VOTE,

05:51.017 --> 05:52.786
THE SENATE REJECTED LEGISLATION

05:52.786 --> 05:53.920
THAT WOULD HAVE EXTENDED THE

05:53.920 --> 05:54.754
GOVERNMENT'S DOMESTIC

05:54.754 --> 05:55.989
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.390
THE KEY PROVISION OF THE PATRIOT

05:57.390 --> 05:59.392
ACT IS SET TO EXPIRE AT MIDNIGHT

05:59.392 --> 06:01.061
ON MAY 31.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.262
EARLIER, THE HOUSE PASSED A

06:02.262 --> 06:03.763
COMPROMISE THAT WOULD STOP THE

06:03.763 --> 06:05.165
N.S.A. FROM COLLECTING ALL PHONE

06:05.165 --> 06:06.900
DATA, BUT ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT

06:06.900 --> 06:09.202
TO REQUEST SPECIFIC RECORDS FROM

06:09.202 --> 06:10.837
PHONE COMPANIES, WITH A WARRANT.

06:10.837 --> 06:12.405
BUT TOP SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE

06:12.405 --> 06:14.207
DIVIDED AND ENDED UP REJECTING

06:14.207 --> 06:15.508
THE HOUSE VERSION EARLY THIS

06:15.508 --> 06:16.643
MORNING.

06:16.643 --> 06:17.811
>> THIS IS A DEBATE ABOUT

06:17.811 --> 06:20.247
WHETHER OR NOT A WARRANT WITH A

06:20.247 --> 06:24.117
SINGLE NAME OF A SINGLE COMPANY

06:24.117 --> 06:26.286
CAN BE USED TO COLLECT ALL THE

06:26.286 --> 06:27.854
RECORDS, ALL OF THE PHONE

06:27.854 --> 06:30.490
RECORDS OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN

06:30.490 --> 06:32.158
OUR COUNTRY WITH A SINGLE

06:32.158 --> 06:33.093
WARRANT.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.962
OUR FOREFATHERS WOULD BE AGHAST.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.464
>> THIS IS A HIGH THREAT PERIOD

06:37.464 --> 06:39.799
AND WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

06:39.799 --> 06:41.234
OVERSEAS.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.369
WE KNOW WHAT'S BEEN TRIED HERE

06:42.369 --> 06:46.239
AT HOME.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.407
MY COLLEAGUES, DO WE REALLY WANT

06:47.407 --> 06:51.511
THIS LAW TO EXPIRE?

06:51.511 --> 06:54.581
WE'VE GOT A WEEK TO DISCUSS IT,

06:54.581 --> 06:55.782
WE'LL HAVE ONE DAY TO DO IT.

06:55.782 --> 06:56.583
>> Sreenivasan: THE SENATE

06:56.583 --> 06:57.617
RECESSED FOR THE MEMORIAL

06:57.617 --> 06:59.152
DAY HOLIDAY, BUT SENATE LEADER

06:59.152 --> 07:00.654
MITCH MCCONNELL IS CALLING

07:00.654 --> 07:02.589
MEMBERS BACK EARLY ON SUNDAY,

07:02.589 --> 07:04.457
THE 31st, JUST EIGHT HOURS

07:04.457 --> 07:05.625
BEFORE THE SURVEILLANCE

07:05.625 --> 07:07.627
PROGRAM EXPIRES AT MIDNIGHT.

07:07.627 --> 07:08.828
THE HOUSE IS NOT SCHEDULED TO

07:08.828 --> 07:10.630
RETURN TO SESSION UNTIL AFTER

07:10.630 --> 07:11.698
THE DEADLINE.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.366
IN CALIFORNIA, A DOLPHIN AND

07:13.366 --> 07:14.968
THREE PELICANS HAVE REPORTEDLY

07:14.968 --> 07:16.569
BEEN FOUND DEAD NEAR THAT TEN-

07:16.569 --> 07:19.005
SQUARE-MILE OIL SPILL OFF THE

07:19.005 --> 07:20.307
COAST OF SANTA BARBARA.

07:20.307 --> 07:21.708
VETERINARIANS ARE STILL TRYING

07:21.708 --> 07:22.742
TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE OIL

07:22.742 --> 07:24.477
CAUSED THE ANIMALS' DEATHS.

07:24.477 --> 07:25.879
CLEAN UP CREWS HAVE BEEN TRYING

07:25.879 --> 07:27.480
TO CONTAIN THE SPILL SINCE

07:27.480 --> 07:29.349
TUESDAY, WHEN A PRIVATELY-OWNED

07:29.349 --> 07:31.217
PIPELINE RUPTURED, SENDING

105,000 GALLONS OF CRUDE INTO

07:33.553 --> 07:34.587
THE OCEAN.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.356
WORKERS DESCRIBE THE OIL SLICK

07:36.356 --> 07:37.657
AS "THINNER THAN A COAT OF

07:37.657 --> 07:39.693
PAINT" AND SAY ROUGH SEAS ARE

07:39.693 --> 07:40.960
FURTHER COMPLICATING THE

07:40.960 --> 07:41.895
CLEANUP.

07:41.895 --> 07:42.929

07:50.070 --> 07:51.604
FACING A RECORD-BREAKING FEDERAL

07:51.604 --> 07:53.173
PENALTY OVER THE WAY IT HANDLED

07:53.173 --> 07:54.841
AN IGNITION DEFECT.

07:54.841 --> 07:56.576
THAT DEFECT HAS BEEN TIED TO AT

07:56.576 --> 07:58.411
LEAST 104 DEATHS.

07:58.411 --> 07:59.579
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS

07:59.579 --> 08:00.714
THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS

08:00.714 --> 08:02.716
IDENTIFIED CRIMINAL WRONGDOING

08:02.716 --> 08:03.983
IN GENERAL MOTORS' FAILURE TO

08:03.983 --> 08:05.218
DISCLOSE THE DEFECT.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.654
G.M. IS EXPECTED TO HAVE TO PAY

08:07.654 --> 08:09.189
AT LEAST $1 BILLION TO SETTLE

08:09.189 --> 08:09.756
THE MATTER.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.091
HOWEVER, OFFICIALS SAY G.M. IS

08:11.091 --> 08:11.925
COOPERATING WITH THE

08:11.925 --> 08:13.093
INVESTIGATION, WHICH COULD

08:13.093 --> 08:14.494
REDUCE THE PENALTY.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.995
THE FINAL SETTLEMENT COULD BE

08:15.995 --> 08:18.365
REACHED AS EARLY AS THIS SUMMER.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.966
IN IRAQ, ABOUT 3,000 PRO-

08:19.966 --> 08:21.000
GOVERNMENT TROOPS ARE STRUGGLING

08:21.000 --> 08:22.402
TO RETAKE THE CITY OF RAMADI

08:22.402 --> 08:23.770
AFTER ISLAMIC STATE MILITANTS

08:23.770 --> 08:25.405
OVERRAN IT LAST WEEKEND.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.973
THE CAPITAL OF ANBAR PROVINCE IS

08:26.973 --> 08:29.275
ONLY 65 MILES WEST OF BAGHDAD,

08:29.275 --> 08:30.577
AND THE ISIS VICTORY THERE IS

08:30.577 --> 08:32.479
SEEN AS A MAJOR EMBARRASSMENT

08:32.479 --> 08:34.147
AND STRATEGIC LOSS FOR IRAQ'S

08:34.147 --> 08:34.848
LEADERS.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.483
SO FAR, AT LEAST 500 PEOPLE HAVE

08:36.483 --> 08:37.717
DIED IN FIGHTING AND A THIRD OF

08:37.717 --> 08:39.152
THE CITY'S POPULATION HAS

08:39.152 --> 08:40.620
REPORTEDLY FLED.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.389
AND IN IRELAND, A NATIONWIDE

08:42.389 --> 08:43.656
REFERENDUM ON ALLOWING GAY

08:43.656 --> 08:44.958
MARRIAGE HAS PASSED.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.893
OFFICIALS SAY MORE THAN 62%

08:46.893 --> 08:47.961
VOTED YES.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.362
IRELAND IS NOW THE FIRST COUNTRY

08:49.362 --> 08:50.663
IN THE WORLD TO LEGALIZE GAY

08:50.663 --> 08:53.099
MARRIAGE BY POPULAR VOTE.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.601
A GROUP OF FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA

08:54.601 --> 08:56.002
ARE MAKING AN UNPRECEDENTED

08:56.002 --> 08:57.637
OFFER TO HELP THE STATE FIGHT A

08:57.637 --> 08:59.005
RECORD-BREAKING DROUGHT.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.206
THEY'VE AGREED TO GIVE UP A

09:00.206 --> 09:01.708
QUARTER OF THEIR WATER THIS

09:01.708 --> 09:02.742
SEASON.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.010
JOINING ME NOW IS "SACRAMENTO

09:04.010 --> 09:05.311
BEE" REPORTER DALE KASLER WITH

09:05.311 --> 09:06.246
MORE ON THE CRISIS.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.114
SO, WHY STRIKE SUCH A DEAL?

09:08.114 --> 09:10.216
WHO ARE THE PLAYERS INVOLVED?

09:10.216 --> 09:11.985
>> WELL, IT IS A GROUP OF

09:11.985 --> 09:13.820
FARMERS IN THE DELTA REGION,

09:13.820 --> 09:15.155
WHICH IS AN AGRICULTURAL REGION

09:15.155 --> 09:17.590
SOUTHWEST OF SACRAMENTO.

09:17.590 --> 09:19.993
THEY WERE FACED WITH SEVERE

09:19.993 --> 09:22.128
WATER CUTS; AS YOU KNOW IN THE

09:22.128 --> 09:24.197
FOURTH YEAR OF DROUGHT THE STATE

09:24.197 --> 09:26.499
HAS BEEN CUTTING WATER USE IN

09:26.499 --> 09:28.368
THE CITIES AND SUBURBS AND AMONG

09:28.368 --> 09:30.470
MANY OF THE FARMERS, AND NOW

09:30.470 --> 09:32.939
THEY ARE GOING AFTER THE FARMERS

09:32.939 --> 09:34.908
WITH -- WITH THE SO-CALLED

09:34.908 --> 09:36.943
SERIAL WATER RIGHTS, WATER

09:36.943 --> 09:38.278
RIGHTS THAT WERE THOUGHT TO BE

09:38.278 --> 09:40.246
UNTOUCHABLE, AND THEY CAME TO

09:40.246 --> 09:41.347
THESE FARMERS AND THEY STRUCK A

09:41.347 --> 09:42.549
DEAL.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.884
THE GROWERS DON'T BELIEVE THAT

09:44.884 --> 09:47.086
THE STATE DEPARTMENT NECESSARILY

09:47.086 --> 09:48.688
HAS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO TAKE ANY

09:48.688 --> 09:49.956
OF THEIR WATER, BUT RATHER THAN

09:49.956 --> 09:51.257
FIGHT IT OUT THEY AGREED TO A

09:51.257 --> 09:52.225
COMPROMISE.

09:52.225 --> 09:52.992
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHAT IS

09:52.992 --> 09:53.860
THEIR INCENTIVE IN GOING THIS?

09:53.860 --> 09:55.328
GIVING UP A QUARTER OF THEIR

09:55.328 --> 09:57.063
LAND OR LETTING SOME OF

09:57.063 --> 09:59.299
THOSE LANDS GO FALLOW OR A

09:59.299 --> 10:00.133
DECREASE IN THEIR CONSUMPTION BY

10:00.133 --> 10:01.734
A QUARTER?

10:01.734 --> 10:03.203
>> WELL THE INCENTIVE IF THEY

10:03.203 --> 10:04.871
DON'T CUT A DEAL THEY COULD GET

10:04.871 --> 10:06.706
DINGED EVEN WORSE.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.575
IT IS NOT EXACTLY SURE BUT THE

10:08.575 --> 10:10.643
STATE IS SERIOUS ABOUT CUTTING

10:10.643 --> 10:12.745
BACK WATER DELIVERIES, AND WHO

10:12.745 --> 10:15.648
KNOWS HOW MUCH WATER WE COULD

10:15.648 --> 10:17.050
END UP LOSING IF THEY DON'T MAKE

10:17.050 --> 10:17.984
A DEAL.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.586
THIS IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM; THE

10:19.586 --> 10:22.388
INDIVIDUAL FARMERS CAN EITHER

10:22.388 --> 10:25.425
OPT IN OR OPT OUT AND THOSE WHO

10:25.425 --> 10:27.460
OPT OUT, WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH OF A

10:27.460 --> 10:29.095
CUT THEY COULD BE FACING.

10:29.095 --> 10:29.896
>> Sreenivasan: WELL, IF IT IS

10:29.896 --> 10:31.130
VOLUNTARY, HOW DOES THE STATE

10:31.130 --> 10:34.234
ENFORCE THESE CUTS?

10:34.234 --> 10:35.335
>> SPOT CHECKS.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.503
THEY ARE GOING TO USE SATELLITE

10:36.503 --> 10:38.938
IMAGERY TO SEE IF PEOPLE ARE

10:38.938 --> 10:41.140
FALLOWING FIELDS LIKE THEY SAY

10:41.140 --> 10:42.775
THEY WILL.

10:42.775 --> 10:43.910
AND THE STATE ALSO BELIEVES

10:43.910 --> 10:44.911
THERE WILL BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT

10:44.911 --> 10:46.980
OF PEER PRESSURE THAT IF YOUR

10:46.980 --> 10:49.182
NEIGHBOR SAID HE IS GOING TO

10:49.182 --> 10:50.884
FALLOW HIS FIELD AND NOT DIVERT

10:50.884 --> 10:55.355
WATER OUT OF THE RIVERS, THAT

10:55.355 --> 10:56.923
THEY THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL GO

10:56.923 --> 10:58.024
ALONG.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.259
THEY BELIEVE THEY WILL GET A LOT

10:59.259 --> 11:00.426
OF COOPERATION ON THIS.

11:00.426 --> 11:01.327
>> Sreenivasan: BUT WHAT IS

11:01.327 --> 11:02.529
THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THIS

11:02.529 --> 11:03.763
DEAL? YOU MENTIONED THIS IS A

11:03.763 --> 11:04.697
GROUP OF FARMERS.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.166
HOW MUCH WATER DOES THEIR

11:07.166 --> 11:08.768
CONSUMPTION REPRESENT OF ALL OF

11:08.768 --> 11:10.503
THE FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA?

11:10.503 --> 11:11.671
>> WELL, IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF

11:11.671 --> 11:13.406
THINGS, NOT A LOT.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.008
THESE FARMERS IN THE DELTA

11:15.008 --> 11:17.877
REGION REPRESENT, OH, SOMETHING

11:17.877 --> 11:19.779
LESS THAN 10% OF ALL THE

11:19.779 --> 11:21.080
IRRIGATED FARMLAND IN

11:21.080 --> 11:22.482
CALIFORNIA, AND THEY ARE TALKING

11:22.482 --> 11:24.784
ABOUT GIVING UP 25% OF THEIR

11:24.784 --> 11:25.752
WATER.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.087
SO, AS YOU CAN SEE, IT IS NOT AS

11:28.087 --> 11:29.188
IF CALIFORNIA WILL SOLVE THIS

11:29.188 --> 11:31.090
WATER PROBLEM WITH A STROKE OF

11:31.090 --> 11:32.492
THE PEN.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.960
NEVERTHELESS, THIS IS VERY

11:33.960 --> 11:35.828
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS A

11:35.828 --> 11:37.564
COMPROMISE, AND WATER AND

11:37.564 --> 11:39.032
COMPROMISE DON'T OFTEN GO

11:39.032 --> 11:41.000
TOGETHER IN CALIFORNIA.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.602
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, EVEN

11:42.602 --> 11:45.305
IN A NORMAL YEAR, A WET YEAR,

11:45.305 --> 11:46.873
THERE IS LITIGATION OVER WATER

11:46.873 --> 11:47.807
IN CALIFORNIA.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.008
IT IS SUCH A PROFESSIONALS

11:49.008 --> 11:50.476
COMMODITY.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.145
THERE IS ALWAYS A TUG-OF-WAR

11:52.145 --> 11:54.447
GOING ON OVER WATER SUPPLIES.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.049
THERE ARE ENTIRE LAW FIRMS IN

11:56.049 --> 11:58.184
SACRAMENTO AND ELSEWHERE THAT

11:58.184 --> 12:00.286
ARE SOLELY DEVOTED TO LITIGATING

12:00.286 --> 12:02.055
WATER LAW CASES.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.856
SO, THE FACT THAT A SIGNIFICANT

12:03.856 --> 12:06.159
GROUP OF FARMERS HAVE STEPPED UP

12:06.159 --> 12:07.694
AND OFFERED A COMPROMISE

12:07.694 --> 12:09.762
SOLUTION IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL IN

12:09.762 --> 12:11.364
AND OF ITSELF, AND THE STATE

12:11.364 --> 12:13.833
OFFICIALS ARE HOPING THAT THIS

12:13.833 --> 12:16.002
LEADS TO FURTHER COMPROMISE

12:16.002 --> 12:18.771
AROUND THE STATE AS THE WATER

12:18.771 --> 12:20.940
REGULATORS START TO GO AFTER

12:20.940 --> 12:22.775
THESE SENIOR WATER RIGHTS

12:22.775 --> 12:24.310
HOLDERS AROUND THE STATE.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.311
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

12:25.311 --> 12:26.279
DALE KASLER OF THE SACRAMENTO

12:26.279 --> 12:27.614
BEE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.283
>> THANK YOU.

12:37.690 --> 12:38.558
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

12:38.558 --> 12:39.759
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.827
THE PHILADELPHIA AMTRAK

12:40.827 --> 12:42.161
DERAILMENT BROUGHT NEW ATTENTION

12:42.161 --> 12:44.197
TO SAFETY ON PASSENGER TRAINS.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.665
IT COMES AS FEDERAL REGULATORS

12:45.665 --> 12:47.300
ARE ALSO TAKING STEPS TO IMPROVE

12:47.300 --> 12:49.135
FREIGHT RAIL SAFETY, ESPECIALLY

12:49.135 --> 12:50.536
WHEN IT COMES TO TRAINS THAT

12:50.536 --> 12:51.871
HAUL OIL.

12:51.871 --> 12:52.772
THE OIL BOOM IN PLACES LIKE

12:52.772 --> 12:54.240
NORTH DAKOTA HAS LED TO HUGE

12:54.240 --> 12:55.908
BUDGET SURPLUSES AND CREATED

12:55.908 --> 12:57.343
THOUSANDS OF JOBS.

12:57.343 --> 12:58.544
BUT BECAUSE THERE ARE FEW

12:58.544 --> 13:00.413
PIPELINES IN THE STATE, MUCH OF

13:00.413 --> 13:02.115
THE OIL EXTRACTED THERE HAS TO

13:02.115 --> 13:03.783
BE SENT ACROSS THE NATION BY

13:03.783 --> 13:04.684
RAIL.

13:04.684 --> 13:05.852
NOW, FEDERAL OFFICIALS ARE

13:05.852 --> 13:07.687
PUTTING NEW RULES IN PLACE,

13:07.687 --> 13:09.322
ORDERING COMPANIES TO STRENGTHEN

13:09.322 --> 13:10.990
OLDER RAILCARS.

THE MILLION BARRELS COMING OUT

16:59.685 --> 17:02.121
OF NORTH DAKOTA EACH DAY GOES BY

17:02.121 --> 17:03.356
RAIL.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.657
THAT'S BECAUSE MOST OF THE

17:04.657 --> 17:06.592
COUNTRY'S REFINING CAPACITY IS

17:06.592 --> 17:08.561
FAR FROM NORTH DAKOTA.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.263
THAT MEANS NORTH DAKOTA CRUDE

17:10.263 --> 17:12.231
HAS TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES

17:12.231 --> 17:14.100
TO BE PROCESSED INTO GASOLINE

TINY CHANCE OF A CATASTROPHE

THE CHANCES OF AN ACCIDENT

18:32.478 --> 18:34.347
OCCURRING.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.048

18:36.048 --> 18:38.050
REALITY THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO

GET USED TO.

18:39.719 --> 18:40.886

22:49.235 --> 22:50.603
THE CASE.

22:50.603 --> 22:51.737
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF

22:51.737 --> 22:53.639
CIVILIANS TRAPPED THERE.

22:53.639 --> 22:54.673
ISIS, AS SOON AS ISIS CAME IN

22:54.673 --> 22:56.442
THEY MADE ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE

22:56.442 --> 22:59.979
LOUD SPEAKERS OF THE MOSQUE THAT

22:59.979 --> 23:02.081
THOSE WHO COLLABORATED AND THERE

23:02.081 --> 23:04.283
WERE BODIES POUND IN THE STREET,

23:04.283 --> 23:05.517
PEOPLE WHO WERE SUSPECTED TO BE

23:05.517 --> 23:06.685
OPPOSITION.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.454
>> Sreenivasan: AND ANY WORD

23:08.454 --> 23:12.057
THAT THE RELICS IN THE U.N.

23:12.057 --> 23:13.425
WORLD HERITAGE SITES ARE IN

23:13.425 --> 23:14.960
IMMINENT DANGER?

23:14.960 --> 23:16.328
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY VIDEOS OF

23:16.328 --> 23:18.597
THEM DESTROYING ARTIFACTS?

23:18.597 --> 23:21.400
>> NO, NOT AS OF YET, AND

23:21.400 --> 23:23.535
PALMERA, THEY SAID ISIS AREN'T

23:23.535 --> 23:26.105
REALLY THERE YET; THEY ARE MUCH

23:26.105 --> 23:28.907
MORE FOCUSED ON THE WESTERN

23:28.907 --> 23:30.876
STEP, WESTERN DEPOTS AND

23:30.876 --> 23:32.511
GENERALLY SECURING THE TOWN AND

23:32.511 --> 23:34.246
GETTING A MILITARY GRIP.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.681
IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER AREAS THEY

23:35.681 --> 23:37.016
HAVE TAKEN IN IRAQ WHERE THEY

23:37.016 --> 23:39.285
DESTROYED ANTIQUITIES IT HAS NOT

23:39.285 --> 23:41.854
BEEN FOR A FEW WEEKS AT LEAST

23:41.854 --> 23:43.188
AND SOMETIMES EVEN MONTHS AFTER

23:43.188 --> 23:44.757
THEY HAVE TAKEN AREAS THAT THEY

23:44.757 --> 23:47.159
HAVE ACTUALLY DESTROYED THIS

23:47.159 --> 23:49.395
CULTURAL HERITAGE.

23:49.395 --> 23:50.963
YOU SOMETIMES NOTICE THAT MAYBE

23:50.963 --> 23:54.333
WHEN THE VERY FAMILY, WHEN THE

23:54.333 --> 23:57.036
STORY DIES DOWN, THE RELEASE OF

23:57.036 --> 23:58.237
THE VIDEO WILL, OF THEM LIKE

23:58.237 --> 24:02.708
DESTROYING A HERITAGE SITE, SO

24:02.708 --> 24:04.643
IT IS POSSIBLE WE WON'T SEE ANY

24:04.643 --> 24:05.744
OF THAT FOR A WHILE BUT

24:05.744 --> 24:07.546
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS GREAT CONCERN

24:07.546 --> 24:08.981
OF THE HERITAGE.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.149
>> Sreenivasan: LOVEDAY MORRIS

24:23.595 --> 24:25.597
MORE THAN 37 MILLION AMERICANS

24:25.597 --> 24:27.066

24:27.066 --> 24:29.068
MILES OVER THIS HOLIDAY WEEKEND,

24:29.068 --> 24:31.036
THE VAST MAJORITY GOING BY CAR,

24:31.036 --> 24:32.204
ACCORDING TO A.A.A., THAT'S THE

24:32.204 --> 24:33.505
HIGHEST NUMBER OF FOLKS

24:33.505 --> 24:34.807
TRAVELING OVER MEMORIAL DAY IN

24:34.807 --> 24:36.175
TEN YEARS.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.443
EXPERTS SAY THE OVERALL DROP IN

24:37.443 --> 24:39.044
GAS PRICES IS FUELING THE SPIKE

24:39.044 --> 24:40.913
IN TRAFFIC, SOME DRIVERS ARE

24:40.913 --> 24:42.414
SAVING NEARLY A DOLLAR PER

24:42.414 --> 24:44.450
GALLON COMPARED TO LAST YEAR.

24:44.450 --> 24:45.584
THAT IS IT FOR THIS EDITION OF
