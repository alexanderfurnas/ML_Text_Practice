ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM.

02:08.200 --> 02:09.367
>> THE UNITED STATES ABSOLUTEL

LAST NIGHT IN GENEVA IS NOT AN

02:30.133 --> 02:30.767
HISTORIC AGREEMENT

02:30.767 --> 02:33.100
IT IS AN HISTORIC MISTAKE.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.700
TODAY THE WORLD HAS BECOME A

02:35.700 --> 02:36.433
MUCH MORE DANGEROUS PLAC

02:36.433 --> 02:37.567
BECAUSE THE MOST DANGEROUS

02:37.567 --> 02:40.033
REGIME IN THE WORLD HAS TAKEN

02:40.033 --> 02:40.900
SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARD BE O

FOR THE FIRST TIME THE LEADING

02:45.000 --> 02:48.967
POWERS IN THE WORLD HAVE AGREE

02:48.967 --> 02:51.933
TO A NUCLEAR ENRICHMENT IN IRAN.

02:51.933 --> 02:55.567
>> JOINING US NOW FROM GENEVA,

02:55.567 --> 02:56.967
SWITZERLAND IS MARGARET WARNER

02:56.967 --> 02:57.767
SHE'S BEEN REPORTING ON TH

02:57.767 --> 02:58.967
STORY ALL WEEK

02:58.967 --> 03:00.833
IT'S SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED,

03:00.833 --> 03:03.367
MARGARET, BUT BREAK IT DOWN FO

03:03.367 --> 03:03.933
US

03:03.933 --> 03:08.033
WHICH SIDES GET WHAT

03:08.033 --> 03:09.133
>> Reporter: IN THE DAYS O

03:09.133 --> 03:11.433
PAINSTAKING NEGOTIATIONS IN TH

03:11.433 --> 03:12.333
INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL RIGHT

03:12.333 --> 03:13.933
BEHIND ME, IRAN AND THE U.S.

03:13.933 --> 03:15.100
BOTH GOT THE MOST IMPORTAN

03:15.100 --> 03:17.000
THING THEY NEEDED.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.800
FOR THE U.S., THE U.S. NEEDED TO

03:18.800 --> 03:20.200
STOP THE CLOCK ON THE ADVANCIN

03:20.200 --> 03:21.933
OF IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRA

03:21.933 --> 03:23.400
BECAUSE IT'S BELIEVED TO B

03:23.400 --> 03:28.000
WITHIN THREE TO SIX MONTHS O

03:28.000 --> 03:30.633
BEING NUCLEAR WEAPONS CAPABLE.

03:30.633 --> 03:33.467
AND SO THE FEAR, THE CONCERN WAS

03:33.467 --> 03:35.333
THAT EVEN DURING NEGOTIATIONS ON

03:35.333 --> 03:37.567
A COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT TO

03:37.567 --> 03:40.767
STOP IT ALL THAT IRAN WOUL

03:40.767 --> 03:43.300
ACHIEVE THAT STATE AND THE

03:43.300 --> 03:44.467
PRESIDENT OBAMA WOULD HAVE A

03:44.467 --> 03:45.900
VERY UNPLEASANT CHOICE O

03:45.900 --> 03:47.100
MILITARY ACCIDENT AND LETTING IT

03:47.100 --> 03:49.600
HAPPEN OR WATCHING ISRAEL LAUNCH

03:49.600 --> 03:52.467
A MILITARY STRIKE.

03:52.467 --> 03:54.867
SO I'LL JUST GIVE A FEW EXAMPLES

03:54.867 --> 03:56.767
OF THE PROGRAMS THAT -- ALL OF

03:56.767 --> 03:59.700
THE REACTORS WE'VE HEARD A LOT

03:59.700 --> 04:02.333
ABOUT AND THE PLUTONIUM REACTOR,

04:02.333 --> 04:05.600
IRAN PROMISED NOT TO BUILD ANY

04:05.600 --> 04:09.400
MORE CENTRIFUGES AND NOT EVE

04:09.400 --> 04:11.033
OPERATE THOUSANDS THAT THEY HAVE

04:11.033 --> 04:12.167
INSTALLED THAT AREN'

04:12.167 --> 04:13.767
OPERATIONAL AND THEY AGREED TO

04:13.767 --> 04:16.467
NO LONGER ENRICH THE 20% WHICH

04:16.467 --> 04:19.067
WAS WEAPONS GRADE AND TO REDUC

04:19.067 --> 04:21.667
AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE THA

04:21.667 --> 04:21.933
STOCKPILE.

04:21.933 --> 04:23.900
THEY WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE

04:23.900 --> 04:27.567
ENRICHING URANIUM AT THE 3% TO

04:27.567 --> 04:29.367
5% LEVEL WHICH IS ONE OF THE

04:29.367 --> 04:30.633
NUCLEAR REACTORS

04:30.633 --> 04:31.967
AT THE END OF THE SIX MONTHS

04:31.967 --> 04:33.767
THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE MORE

04:33.767 --> 04:35.967
OF THAT THAN THEY DO RIGHT NOW

04:35.967 --> 04:38.067
IRAN GOT TWO THINGS IT WANTED.

04:38.067 --> 04:41.600
ONE IS THE THE FINANCIAL

04:41.600 --> 04:43.667
SANCTIONS THAT WERE CHOKE TH

04:43.667 --> 04:45.467
ECONOMY AND ABOUT $6 BILLION

04:45.467 --> 04:47.533
WORTH AND THEN THEY DID GET NO

04:47.533 --> 04:49.667
A STATEMENT OF THEIR RIGHT T

04:49.667 --> 04:52.967
ENRICH, BUT A STATEMENT IN THI

04:52.967 --> 04:54.100
DOCUMENT HERE WHICH SAYS THA

04:54.100 --> 04:55.267
THE END OF THE WHOLE BUSINES

04:55.267 --> 04:56.867
WHICH COULD BE TEN OR MORE YEARS

04:56.867 --> 05:01.200
FROM NOW AND THE COMPREHENSIVE

05:01.200 --> 05:02.867
DEAL, AFTER THAT, IRAN WIL

05:02.867 --> 05:04.400
ENJOY THE SAME STATUS AT ANY

05:04.400 --> 05:07.500
OTHER NON-NUCLEAR WEAPON

05:07.500 --> 05:09.133
PRODUCING NUCLEAR STATE.

05:09.133 --> 05:11.500
SAY BRAZIL OR JAPAN, AND THA

05:11.500 --> 05:14.567
IMPLIES THE RIGHT TO A DOMESTI

05:14.567 --> 05:15.367
ENRICHMENT PROGRAM

05:15.367 --> 05:17.867
>> SO WHAT ABOUT THE DIPLOMATI

05:17.867 --> 05:19.833
CONSEQUENCES HERE?

05:19.833 --> 05:20.967
IT SEEMS BOTH SAUDI ARABIA AND

05:20.967 --> 05:23.000
ISRAEL ARE ON THE SAME SIDE OF

05:23.000 --> 05:24.800
THE TABLE AND BOTH IN STRONG

05:24.800 --> 05:29.533
OPPOSITION TO THIS DEAL.

05:29.533 --> 05:31.533
>> Reporter: IT'S DEFINITELY A

05:31.533 --> 05:34.567
CASE OF STRANGE BEDFELLOWS

05:34.567 --> 05:35.700
IRRACE JUST DOESN'T TRUST, DOE

05:35.700 --> 05:39.300
NOT WANT IRAN TO HAVE ANY ENRICH

05:39.300 --> 05:40.267
AT ALL AS PRIME MINISTER

05:40.267 --> 05:41.600
NETANYAHU MADE CLEAR TODAY AND

05:41.600 --> 05:43.033
THEY DON'T TRUST HOWEVER GOO

05:43.033 --> 05:44.767
THE SAFEGUARDS ARE THAT IRAN

05:44.767 --> 05:46.433
WILL EVER ABIDE BY THEM AND NO

05:46.433 --> 05:48.700
HAVE SOME SORT OF SECRET PLA

05:48.700 --> 05:48.933
GOING.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.433
SO THEY'RE EVEN UPSET AT THI

05:51.433 --> 05:53.567
FIELD BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT DOE

05:53.567 --> 05:55.633
IMPLY A RIGHT TO ENRICH,

05:55.633 --> 05:57.467
HOWEVER, NETANYAHU STILL FACES A

05:57.467 --> 06:00.967
CHOICE AND THEY FURTHER SCUTTL

06:00.967 --> 06:04.367
THIS AND DOES HE START FOCUSIN

06:04.367 --> 06:07.033
MORE OR SAYING THE FINAL DEAL.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.167
HE DID MENTION THE THREAT OF

06:10.167 --> 06:12.067
ACTION, AND FEW PEOPLE THINK H

06:12.067 --> 06:13.700
WOULD DARE TO EXERCISE THA

06:13.700 --> 06:15.733
DURING THIS SIX-MONTH PHASE.

06:15.733 --> 06:17.933
FOR SAUDI ARABIA, IT'S MOR

06:17.933 --> 06:18.167
COMPLICATED.

06:18.167 --> 06:21.500
WHAT THEY'RE REALLY WORRIE

06:21.500 --> 06:23.233
ABOUT IS ANY PRESSURE WITH IRA

06:23.233 --> 06:25.733
AND THE U.S. ELEVATES IRAN'S

06:25.733 --> 06:28.233
STATUS AND THEY'RE ENGAGED IN

06:28.233 --> 06:31.167
GREAT POWER SUNNI VERSUS SHI

06:31.167 --> 06:35.767
RIVALRY IN THE GULF, BUT IT DOES

06:35.767 --> 06:37.133
NOT HAVE A LOT OF CLOUT IN THE

06:37.133 --> 06:38.400
U.S. CONGRESS AND THEY DON'T

06:38.400 --> 06:40.533
EXPECT TO DO MUCH AT HOME.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.233
WHAT THEY EXPECTED TO TRY TO D

06:42.233 --> 06:43.800
IS SHAPE THE FINAL DEAL AS MUC

06:43.800 --> 06:44.500
AS THEY CAN.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.067
>> SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT

06:46.067 --> 06:46.767
SIX MONTHS

06:46.767 --> 06:48.767
WILL WE SEE MORE REGULAR CHECK

06:48.767 --> 06:49.567
ON IRAN AND ITS NUCLEA

06:49.567 --> 06:56.400
PROGRESS

06:56.400 --> 06:57.533
>> Reporter: YES, ABSOLUTELY

06:57.533 --> 07:00.700
ONE OF THE ELEMENTS IS THAT IRAN

07:00.700 --> 07:02.900
HAS A MUCH MORE INTRUSIV

07:02.900 --> 07:03.800
VERIFICATION AND THAT'S ONE OF

07:03.800 --> 07:05.200
THE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THI

07:05.200 --> 07:06.900
PHASE ONE DEAL

07:06.900 --> 07:08.467
IN ADDITION TO NEGOTIATING THE

07:08.467 --> 07:11.600
BIG DEAL WHICH IS HOW HARD THESE

07:11.600 --> 07:12.800
NEGOTIATIONS WERE, NOBODY

07:12.800 --> 07:15.500
TALKED TO THINKSES IT CAN CAN BE

07:15.500 --> 07:17.500
DONE IN SIX MONTHS AS THE PRIM

07:17.500 --> 07:22.267
MINISTER ORIGINALLY PROMISED O

07:22.267 --> 07:24.800
PLEDGED AND HE TALKS ABOUT A

07:24.800 --> 07:26.733
YEAR AND FINALLY, PRESIDENT HA

07:26.733 --> 07:28.400
A POLITICAL TASK AHEAD WHICH I

07:28.400 --> 07:30.300
TO KEEP CONGRESS, HOLD THE LINES

07:30.300 --> 07:31.733
AND CONGRESS TRYING TO IMPOS

07:31.733 --> 07:33.900
ADDITIONAL SANCTIONS ON IRAN

07:33.900 --> 07:35.533
EVEN DURING THIS PHASE, AND

07:35.533 --> 07:38.033
THOUGHT IT WAS TELLING THAT TH

07:38.033 --> 07:39.833
DEMOCRATIC FOREIGN RELATIONS

07:39.833 --> 07:41.067
COMMITTEE SAID HE STILL WANTS TO

07:41.067 --> 07:42.833
PUSH THAT KIND OF LEGISLATIO

07:42.833 --> 07:44.700
JUST WITH THE SIX-MONTH TRIGGE

07:44.700 --> 07:45.700
OUT THERE.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.800
SECRETARY KERRY SAID LAST --

07:47.800 --> 07:50.733
EARLY THIS MORNING AT THIS DAW

07:50.733 --> 07:53.067
PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT PRESIDEN

07:53.067 --> 07:54.467
OBAMA WOULD PROBABLY VET

07:54.467 --> 07:55.633
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

07:55.633 --> 07:56.900
I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA HA

07:56.900 --> 07:58.200
POLITICAL JOBS AHEAD AT HOME A

07:58.200 --> 07:58.533
WELL

07:58.533 --> 08:00.900

NON-COMBAT ROLE BEYOND 2014 AN

08:23.600 --> 08:25.733
THEY ASSIGNED IT PROPERLY, BUT

08:25.733 --> 08:27.567
KARZAI AGAIN INSISTED THAT H

BEFORE THE AFGHAN ELECTIONS NEXT

A STUDY FIVE YEARS AFTER THE

PROGRAM LAUNCHED

15:26.933 --> 15:28.567
THAT STUDY FOUND THAT COMPARED

15:28.567 --> 15:30.800
TO PEOPLE IN REGULAR PROBATION

15:30.800 --> 15:32.633
HOPE PROBATIONERS WERE HALF AS

15:32.633 --> 15:34.400
LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED FOR NE

15:34.400 --> 15:36.567
CRIMES OR HAVE THEIR PROBATION

15:36.567 --> 15:36.633
REVOKED.

15:36.633 --> 15:38.133
THEY ENDED UP SPENDING ABOUT

15:38.133 --> 15:40.433
HALF AS MUCH TIME IN PRISON AN

15:40.433 --> 15:43.667
WERE 72% LESS LIKELY TO US

16:05.100 --> 16:06.533
MODELS THAT USE THREATS USUALL

16:06.533 --> 16:08.067
DON'T WORK BECAUSE THE THREATS

16:08.067 --> 16:09.667
WERE TOO BIG AND NEVER CARRIED

16:09.667 --> 16:11.833
OUT, BUT HOPE, HE SAYS, DOES THE

16:11.833 --> 16:13.533
EXACT OPPOSITE

16:13.533 --> 16:15.100
>> WHAT THEY'VE DONE WITH TH

HOPE MODEL IS TO RATCHET DOW

16:17.833 --> 16:19.567
THE LEVEL OF PENALTY

16:19.567 --> 16:20.800

THIS PROGRAM

19:05.600 --> 19:06.867
IT'S NOT SOMETHING BAD MIGHT

PROGRAM COULD SAVE TAXPAYERS BIG

TIME

19:18.400 --> 19:20.733
ACCORDING TO ALM, A PROBATIONE

PRISON IN HAWAII COSTS AROUN

19:30.600 --> 19:33.467
SWIFT SANCTIONS COME AT A COST

19:33.467 --> 19:35.167
MORE STRAIN ON THE LOCAL JAIL,

19:53.000 --> 19:54.533
THINKS JUDGES SHOULD PUT MOR

19:54.533 --> 19:55.933
PEOPLE IN PRISON FROM THE START.

19:55.933 --> 19:58.067
HE ALSO THINKS HOPE KEEP

AND ALOUSE THEM TOO MANY

THESE OFFENDERS ARE IN HOP

MORE OVERSIGHT AND MOR

REQUIREMENTS FOR CHECKING IN AND

MORE DRUG TESTING THAN REGULAR

20:22.800 --> 20:22.967
PROBATION?

20:22.967 --> 20:25.833
JUST BY HAVING THEM DO DRU

20:25.833 --> 20:26.900
TESTING IS NOT SUPERVISION

20:26.900 --> 20:29.733
IT'S ONE FORM OF SUPERVISION

20:29.733 --> 20:32.800
BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

20:32.800 --> 20:33.933
>> NOT ENOUGH, KENNETH SAYS,

20:33.933 --> 20:35.433
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEE
