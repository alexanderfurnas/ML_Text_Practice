JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.433 --> 00:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.866 --> 00:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
James Comey breaks his silence.

00:09.666 --> 00:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The former FBI director, in a
statement to the U.S. Senate,
details how President Trump

00:16.600 --> 00:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked for his personal loyalty,
asked to drop the investigation
into Michael Flynn, and

00:21.966 --> 00:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called Russia a cloud
hanging over the presidency.

00:24.466 --> 00:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then: The pressure is on.

00:26.933 --> 00:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Top U.S. intelligence
officials remain
tight-lipped in a high-stakes
congressional hearing about

00:33.400 --> 00:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether the president has
tried to influence them.

00:35.033 --> 00:36.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:36.966 --> 00:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN HEINRICH (D), New
Mexico: You could clear an awful
lot up by simply saying it

00:39.333 --> 00:41.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
never happened.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN COATS, U.S. National
Intelligence Director:
I don't share -- I don't
share with the general

00:43.066 --> 00:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public conversations that
I have with the president.

00:45.933 --> 00:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead:
a twist on terrorism
in the Middle East.

00:49.833 --> 00:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A stunning dual attack in Iran
leaves at least 12 dead and
40 wounded, with ISIS claiming

00:56.800 --> 00:58.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
responsibility.

00:58.733 --> 01:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:05.533 --> 01:08.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:08.333 --> 01:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our lead
story tonight: James
Comey tells his story.

01:17.700 --> 01:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a prepared statement
to the Senate Intelligence
Committee, released one
day ahead of his hearing

01:24.666 --> 01:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tomorrow, the former
FBI director details his
personal conversations
with the president,

01:30.133 --> 01:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nine in total, compared
with just two during three
years with President Obama.

01:35.633 --> 01:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey describes how Mr. Trump
asked repeatedly for a pledge
of personal loyalty, asked that

01:42.300 --> 01:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he drop the investigation
into General Michael
Flynn, and complained that
allegations surrounding

01:46.433 --> 01:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia were a cloud
over his presidency.

01:49.500 --> 01:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey also confirms that he told
President Trump that he wasn't
under investigation himself.

01:56.566 --> 02:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Moments ago, Mr. Trump's
attorney responded in
a written statement,
quoting, "The president

02:02.666 --> 02:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is pleased," it says, "that
Mr. Comey has finally publicly
confirmed his private reports

02:07.533 --> 02:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the president wasn't
under investigation
in any Russia probe."

02:10.500 --> 02:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And continuing, he wrote, "The
president feels completely
and totally vindicated."

02:16.633 --> 02:18.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, there is a
lot to unpack here.

02:18.766 --> 02:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to walk through
much of it now with reporter
Matt Apuzzo of The New York

02:21.933 --> 02:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Times and with John Carlin.

02:24.100 --> 02:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He served as assistant attorney
general for national security
from 2014 until October

02:29.700 --> 02:31.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of last year.

02:31.233 --> 02:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's now an attorney
in private practice.

02:33.833 --> 02:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let's start with their
first meeting on January 6
at Trump Tower in New York.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Matt, and -- we're going
-- I'm going to ask both of
you right now about this.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To set a little background,
it was New York City.

02:47.966 --> 02:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
James Comey was meeting the
president for the first time.

02:51.133 --> 02:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He showed up at Trump Tower
to meet the president's
national security team,
and then, privately,

02:58.133 --> 03:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he and the president-elect then
had a one-on-one session where
Comey shared with Mr. Trump

03:04.066 --> 03:09.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
information -- he called
it sensitive information
of a salacious nature
that had been gathered

03:10.133 --> 03:12.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as part of the
Russia investigation.

03:12.066 --> 03:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, with that background,
here is what James
Comey goes on to say.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They had a meeting.

03:18.933 --> 03:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here are some specifics now,
beginning with a dinner at the
White House three weeks later

03:23.433 --> 03:24.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

03:24.866 --> 03:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, this is January 27,
after Mr. Trump is president.

03:27.433 --> 03:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On that day, the president
invited Comey over.

03:30.100 --> 03:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They dined alone
in the Green Room.

03:33.100 --> 03:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And here's how
Comey describes its.

03:35.166 --> 03:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says: "My instincts told me
that the one-on-one setting, and
the pretense that this was our

03:39.966 --> 03:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first discussion about my
position, meant the dinner was,
at least in part, an effort

03:44.900 --> 03:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have me ask for my job
and create some sort of
patronage relationship.

03:52.366 --> 03:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That concerned me
greatly, given the FBI's
traditionally independent
status in the executive

03:56.033 --> 03:58.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
branch.

03:58.133 --> 04:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I replied that I loved my work
and intended to stay and serve
out my 10-year term as director.

04:04.100 --> 04:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"And then, because the set-up
made me uneasy, I added that I
was not 'reliable' in the way

04:09.833 --> 04:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politicians use that word,
but he could always count
on me to tell him the truth.

04:15.866 --> 04:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few moments later, the
president said, 'I need
loyalty, I expect loyalty.'

04:20.966 --> 04:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't move, speak, or change
my facial expression in any
way during the awkward silence

04:25.633 --> 04:26.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that followed.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We simply looked at
each other in silence."

04:29.633 --> 04:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Matt Apuzzo, how does
this square with the
reporting you have done?

04:33.200 --> 04:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT APUZZO, The New York Times:
Well, a lot of the -- a lot of
the details here, my colleagues

04:37.566 --> 04:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I have been reporting
out here over the
last several weeks.

04:41.866 --> 04:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's hard to overstate just
the extraordinary nature of
the portrait we're seeing here.

04:46.533 --> 04:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're really getting -- we're
really getting the backstory
to the Jim Comey firing.

04:51.033 --> 04:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're seeing a president who
was preoccupied with, as you
said, getting the cloud lifted,

04:57.933 --> 05:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the cloud of this Russia
investigation that was -- become
a real liability for the Trump

05:01.933 --> 05:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
administration from day one.

05:05.333 --> 05:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the idea that at
this private dinner that
the president starts
their relationship by

05:10.100 --> 05:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asking for this loyalty pledge,
you can -- you just read these
memos, you can see Comey,

05:14.733 --> 05:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
just his anxiety
here in the words.

05:18.333 --> 05:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just the uncomfortable
-- you know, the discomfort
he has is palpable.

05:23.133 --> 05:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see Trump getting
more and more frustrated that,
you know, why is this guy

05:27.566 --> 05:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not doing what I'm asking?

05:29.633 --> 05:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Carlin, from
your perspective, what is the
significance of this exchange

05:33.166 --> 05:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the president
asking for loyalty?

05:35.600 --> 05:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN, Former Justice
Department Official:
Well, the FBI has a
unique institutional role,

05:40.733 --> 05:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as does the
Department of Justice.

05:42.800 --> 05:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, because both the FBI and
prosecutors in the Department
of Justice may be called

05:49.833 --> 05:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
upon to investigate potential
criminal activity by members of
the president's party, by actual

05:56.600 --> 06:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members of the
administration, and in some
circumstances investigate
conduct of a president

06:03.633 --> 06:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him or herself, there's been
a history where the department
has attempted to shield itself

06:07.866 --> 06:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from political interference.

06:09.900 --> 06:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there have been times in
that history where maintaining
that independence has been

06:14.033 --> 06:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particularly fraught.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

06:16.933 --> 06:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: In my tenure as
chief of staff at the FBI, and
in my time at the department,

06:20.733 --> 06:23.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can't recall something
quite like this.

06:23.066 --> 06:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I just
want to pick up on that, later
on in that January 27 dinner,

06:29.966 --> 06:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alone with the president
in the White House in the
green room, Mr. Comey writes.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He says: "He then
said, 'I need loyalty.'

06:35.100 --> 06:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I replied, 'You will always
get honesty from me.'

06:38.400 --> 06:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He paused and then said, 'That's
what I want, honest loyalty.'

06:42.000 --> 06:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I paused, and then said,
'You will get that from me.'"

06:45.566 --> 06:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something, John
Carlin, that was appropriate?

06:49.533 --> 06:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, you can
see how the president's
demanding loyalty, that
might be appropriate

06:57.200 --> 07:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in some other context
of a political campaign,
or even other parts
of the administration.

07:04.200 --> 07:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Director Comey is very
focused, it look likes in that
exchange, and understands the

07:10.366 --> 07:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unique independence of the
role of the FBI director.

07:12.433 --> 07:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reason why the statute
was changed so that the FBI
director's term of years is

07:18.833 --> 07:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10 years designed to cut across
administrations to ensure that
the president who appointed

07:24.333 --> 07:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the director, that the
director would outlast the
tenure of that president.

07:28.166 --> 07:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so Director Comey, I
think, is trying to explain
in this awkward context why he

07:35.100 --> 07:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be honest, not disloyal in
some sense, but loyal ultimately
to the Constitution and

07:43.566 --> 07:45.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, now I want
to turn both of you to this
-- I think it was their next

07:47.200 --> 07:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meeting, February the 14th, in
a meeting in the Oval Office.

07:50.200 --> 07:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this time it was with
the president, the vice
president, the attorney general,

07:54.300 --> 07:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
several other senior
administration officials.

07:56.633 --> 08:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of that meeting,
the president asked everyone
to leave, except for Comey.

08:03.633 --> 08:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And according to Mr. Comey's
statement, Mr. Trump turned
back to the subject of General

08:06.666 --> 08:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Flynn, who had been
fired just the day before, and
he said -- quote -- "'I hope

08:11.433 --> 08:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you can see your way
clear to letting this
go, to letting Flynn go.

08:16.133 --> 08:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is a good guy.

08:17.266 --> 08:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I hope you can let this go.'"

08:19.266 --> 08:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Comey writes: "I replied
only that 'he is a good guy.'

08:23.333 --> 08:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I did not say I
would 'let this go.'"

08:26.800 --> 08:30.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Matt Apuzzo, how does
that square with what
you have reported?

08:30.200 --> 08:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: My colleague
Michael Schmidt broke that
exchange a few weeks ago.

08:37.200 --> 08:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's no less -- it's no
less remarkable seeing it in
that full context, seeing the

08:44.033 --> 08:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president ask everybody to
leave the Oval Office and speak
alone with the head of the

08:47.966 --> 08:52.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FBI and say, you
know, let Flynn go.

08:52.966 --> 08:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just the very nature of we --
people -- we don't have to be
in Washington to understand

08:57.400 --> 09:00.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
why that makes us
feel uncomfortable.

09:00.133 --> 09:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, anybody who has ever
fought a ticket in court, you
know, knows that they don't

09:07.000 --> 09:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - they don't want to feel
like the criminal justice system
is rigged for people who are

09:10.566 --> 09:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
friendly with the politicians.

09:13.766 --> 09:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so if you're at the
FBI, yes, you are part
of the administration.

09:18.700 --> 09:20.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're part of the
Department of Justice.

09:20.766 --> 09:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But they just don't see
themselves as working
for the president when
it comes to criminal

09:24.566 --> 09:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
justice stuff, and, as John
said, certainly not when the
investigation touches on the

09:30.433 --> 09:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president's own associates.

09:32.466 --> 09:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, continuing
that now, this is afterward,
the same day, February 14.

09:36.133 --> 09:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Comey writes he spoke with the
attorney general in person.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "I took the opportunity
to implore the attorney
general to prevent any future

09:46.366 --> 09:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
direct communication between
me and the president - -
between the president and me.

09:50.566 --> 09:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I told the A.G. what had just
happened -- him being asked to
leave" -- because the attorney

09:57.566 --> 10:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general was one of those who
had been asked the leave the
Oval Office -- "while the FBI

10:01.033 --> 10:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
director, who reports to
the A.G., remained behind."

10:04.266 --> 10:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said: "That was inappropriate
and should never happen.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did not reply."

10:09.600 --> 10:11.666 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
John Carlin, how
do we read this?

10:11.666 --> 10:16.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: I will tell
you, there have been
instances before, let's
say, in a terrorism

10:18.133 --> 10:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
incident or a major shooting, in
my experience, where the White
House would sometimes reach

10:21.633 --> 10:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out directly to the FBI.

10:24.200 --> 10:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it raised concerns, even
when that was the context, and
there were usual media calls

10:31.200 --> 10:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over to the attorney general to
ensure that the department was
aware of the contact directly

10:35.800 --> 10:38.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with the White House
or with immediate
aides to the president.

10:38.566 --> 10:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to have the president of
the United States order people
out of the room in order -- you

10:45.533 --> 10:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, if true, according to this
account -- in order to implore
the director of the FBI to

10:50.966 --> 10:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
drop an investigation of
a friend or associate,
that's the core of why
many of our rules and

10:57.600 --> 11:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
customs were in place, was to
prevent exactly that type of
conversation or interference

11:03.600 --> 11:05.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from occurring.

11:05.133 --> 11:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So now, here we
are, a month-and-a-half later.

11:07.733 --> 11:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is March the 30th.

11:08.966 --> 11:12.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The president phones
Jim Comey at the FBI.

11:12.500 --> 11:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He repeats the idea of a cloud
over his administration because
of the Russia investigation.

11:19.466 --> 11:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said: "He said he had
nothing to do with Russia, had
not been involved with hookers

11:24.933 --> 11:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Russia, and had always
assumed he was being
recorded when in Russia.

11:29.433 --> 11:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He asked what we could
do to 'lift the cloud.'"

11:32.100 --> 11:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Matt Apuzzo, we're
back to that same scenario,
back and forth, where
the president is asking

11:38.266 --> 11:40.466 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the FBI director
to do something.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT APUZZO: Yes.

11:42.500 --> 11:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, look, you can see
why Donald Trump might
be frustrated, right?

11:48.500 --> 11:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just setting aside the fact
that he's the president, if
you have been told you are not

11:52.566 --> 11:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under investigation personally,
but yet your administration
can't escape the cloud of this

11:59.600 --> 12:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation, and you kind
of just want it to be over,
you can see why you would say,

12:02.900 --> 12:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hey, what do I have to
do to make this go away?

12:05.866 --> 12:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If I'm not under investigation,
why can't you just say that?

12:08.700 --> 12:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a very human response.

12:11.233 --> 12:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as John said, there's
a reason, and there's
a process that you're
supposed to go through

12:15.266 --> 12:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when you reach out
on stuff like this.

12:17.233 --> 12:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, and just
finally, John, we're not showing
anymore graphics from the

12:23.033 --> 12:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
statement, but it was
on March the 30th.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was another
phone call where the
president again called,
complaining about the cloud

12:28.933 --> 12:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over his presidency.

12:30.900 --> 12:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in that conversation,
he said: "If there were some
satellite associates of his who

12:37.633 --> 12:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did something wrong, it would
be good to find that out, but
that he hadn't done anything

12:42.266 --> 12:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wrong and hoped I would find
a way to get it out there."

12:44.333 --> 12:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he called Mr. Comey
again on April the 11th, and
talked about loyalty, back and

12:50.133 --> 12:52.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forth.

12:52.100 --> 12:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "I have been very
loyal to you," and, in essence,
saying, will you be loyal

12:56.766 --> 12:58.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back to me?

12:58.233 --> 13:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said, "At this
point, I didn't answer him."

13:00.733 --> 13:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you also, today, finally
now, John Carlin, have
the president's attorney
saying the president

13:04.900 --> 13:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
feels vindicated.

13:07.533 --> 13:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CARLIN: Well, I think
in those conversations and
in that back-and-forth,
you also had Director

13:15.066 --> 13:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey informing the president,
according to this opening
statement, that he had recounted

13:22.066 --> 13:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their previous conversation
to the then-acting deputy
attorney general, Dana Boente.

13:26.366 --> 13:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

13:28.533 --> 13:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: And when
the president called, I
think, the second time,
the president referenced

13:32.033 --> 13:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and said, should I reach out?

13:34.433 --> 13:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it sounds like Director
Comey tried to say yes,
you should, through
White House counsel.

13:37.900 --> 13:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the idea of making a --
potentially making public the
results of an investigation, the

13:46.166 --> 13:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appropriate channel, the one
that's set up, there's actually
a memorandum on White House

13:49.900 --> 13:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contacts that's designed to
ensure that that type of contact
takes place lawyer to lawyer,

13:57.400 --> 14:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House counsel to
deputy attorney general,
to avoid either the
actuality of interference

14:00.666 --> 14:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with an investigation
or the appearance.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you can see this kind
of confused back-and-forth.

14:07.500 --> 14:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To me, the most troubling of
the exchanges that are detailed
-- and the rest do provide

14:11.900 --> 14:16.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
context for it -- would
be the direct request
to end an investigation
of an associate, if

14:18.700 --> 14:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
true, related to the
investigation of Flynn.

14:21.700 --> 14:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Matt Apuzzo,
just finally, very quickly,
the fact that Director Comey

14:28.566 --> 14:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made these notes immediately
after each one of these meetings
or phone calls, I think,

14:33.066 --> 14:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
adds to the remarkable
nature of all this.

14:35.033 --> 14:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT APUZZO: That's right.

14:37.100 --> 14:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you have a you have an
FBI director who clearly was
so uncomfortable with these

14:40.800 --> 14:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interactions, he felt like
he had to document them,
and not just document them.

14:43.866 --> 14:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's like, this is where
he was sitting and this is where
he was sitting, and I walked

14:47.400 --> 14:51.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out the door near the
grandfather clock, and
then, halfway through,
this guy knocked on

14:51.333 --> 14:53.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the door.

14:53.433 --> 14:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it is really detailed
stuff that is clearly intended
for future consultation and

14:58.500 --> 14:59.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to say, this isn't
just my memory.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I sat down and did
this in real time.

15:01.766 --> 15:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should
point out once again the
president's attorney has issued

15:04.800 --> 15:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a statement today saying the
president feels vindicated,
that, he, in essence, thanked

15:12.266 --> 15:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Comey for repeating
the fact, he said, that
the president himself
wasn't under investigation.

15:17.533 --> 15:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So this will clearly continue.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to hear from
Mr. Comey tomorrow himself.

15:22.366 --> 15:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Carlin, Matt Apuzzo,
thank you very much.

15:24.866 --> 15:25.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN CARLIN: Thank you.

15:25.866 --> 15:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT APUZZO: Thank you.

15:28.300 --> 15:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the
release of the Comey
statement today came not
long after top intelligence

15:33.566 --> 15:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officials appeared before the
Senate Intelligence Committee.

15:35.800 --> 15:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In public session, at least,
they declined to discuss
conversations with the president

15:41.966 --> 15:44.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about Russia or
about James Comey.

15:44.466 --> 15:46.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our Lisa Desjardins
begins the coverage.

15:46.766 --> 15:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This was
supposed to be about FISA, the
foreign surveillance law used to

15:52.500 --> 15:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thwart terror attacks.

15:54.966 --> 15:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, the Senate
Intelligence hearing became
a high-stakes dance over
the Russia investigation

16:00.933 --> 16:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and President Trump.

16:02.633 --> 16:05.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
National Security
Agency director Michael
Rogers began by saying:

16:05.833 --> 16:07.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE ROGERS, National Security
Agency Director: I have never
been directed to do anything

16:09.500 --> 16:13.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I believe to be illegal,
immoral, unethical,
or inappropriate.

16:13.466 --> 16:18.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And to the best of my
recollection during
that same period of
service, I don't recall

16:18.100 --> 16:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ever feeling pressured to do so.

16:20.366 --> 16:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But, after
that, it was a day of senators'
questions and intelligence

16:25.166 --> 16:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
officials' sidesteps.

16:26.166 --> 16:28.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:28.300 --> 16:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia: Did
the president - - the reports
that are out there -- ask you

16:30.666 --> 16:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in any way, shape or form
to back off or downplay
the Russia investigation?

16:36.733 --> 16:38.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

16:38.766 --> 16:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL ROGERS: I'm not going
to discuss the specifics of
conversations with the president

16:39.833 --> 16:41.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Adding
gravity today, a flurry of
new headlines overnight.

16:44.600 --> 16:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The New York Times reported
that former FBI Director James
Comey asked not to be left

16:51.066 --> 16:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
alone with President Trump,
for fear of being pressured.

16:53.633 --> 16:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post said
the president asked the
director of national
intelligence to intervene

16:57.666 --> 17:02.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the FBI's probe of
former national security
adviser, Michael Flynn.

17:04.700 --> 17:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That DNI, Dan Coats, was in
today's hearing and wouldn't
confirm or deny the story.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN COATS, U.S. National
Intelligence Director:
I'm willing to come
before the committee and

17:10.933 --> 17:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tell you what I know
and what I don't know.

17:13.033 --> 17:17.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What I'm not willing to
do is to share what I
think is confidential
information that ought

17:17.466 --> 17:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be protected in
an open hearing.

17:20.033 --> 17:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republican
Marco Rubio began by
defending the president.

17:22.966 --> 17:24.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:24.966 --> 17:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCO RUBIO (R), Florida: I
actually think, if what is being
said to the media is untrue,

17:26.433 --> 17:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then it is unfair to the
president of the United States.

17:28.533 --> 17:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But in
an effort to bolster that
view, he got confusion.

17:32.433 --> 17:34.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:34.533 --> 17:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCO RUBIO: Is anyone aware
of any effort by anyone in
the White House or elsewhere

17:37.166 --> 17:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to seek advice on how to
influence any investigation?

17:41.900 --> 17:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: My answer is
absolutely no, Senator.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:50.266 --> 17:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCO RUBIO: No one has
anything to add to that?

17:54.233 --> 17:56.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: I don't understand
the question.

17:56.300 --> 17:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrat
Martin Heinrich went further,
pressing Coats if Trump asked

17:59.966 --> 18:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him to blunt the investigation.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:03.033 --> 18:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN HEINRICH (D), New
Mexico: You could clear an awful
lot up by simply saying, it

18:04.500 --> 18:06.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
never happened.

18:06.533 --> 18:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN COATS: I don't share -- I
don't share with the general
public conversations that

18:09.000 --> 18:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have with the president
or many of my administrative
colleagues within the
administration that

18:14.666 --> 18:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I believe are --
shouldn't be shared.

18:16.233 --> 18:18.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:18.400 --> 18:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN HEINRICH: Well, I
think your unwillingness
to answer a very basic
question speaks volumes.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Independent
Angus King hammered the intel
chiefs for neither answering nor

18:27.200 --> 18:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
explaining why they
weren't answering.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:30.700 --> 18:32.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANGUS KING (I), Maine:
Is it an invocation of
executive privilege?

18:32.266 --> 18:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If there is, then
let's know about it.

18:33.966 --> 18:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If there isn't,
answer the questions.

18:35.966 --> 18:37.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL ROGERS: I stand by
the comments I have made.

18:38.766 --> 18:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm not interested in
repeating myself, sir.

18:40.133 --> 18:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I don't mean that
in a contentious way.

18:42.866 --> 18:44.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANGUS KING: Well, I do mean
it in a contentious way.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't understand why you're
not answering our questions.

18:48.666 --> 18:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Ultimately, the
top two intel chiefs said they
were waiting for more guidance

18:52.766 --> 18:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from the White House,
while Deputy Attorney
General Rod Rosenstein
and acting FBI Director

18:59.700 --> 19:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrew McCabe indicated
they don't want to harm the
current special investigation.

19:04.766 --> 19:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for President Trump himself,
he was in Cincinnati for an
infrastructure event, and

19:08.400 --> 19:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
avoided all talk of Russia or
the FBI, but, online, he did
announce Christopher Wray as

19:14.566 --> 19:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his nominee for the
new FBI director.

19:17.333 --> 19:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wray is a criminal
defense lawyer and former
federal prosecutor who
headed the criminal

19:21.466 --> 19:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
division at the
Department of Justice.

19:24.033 --> 19:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's also known for
representing New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie in
his so-called Bridgegate

19:28.200 --> 19:30.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scandal.

19:30.266 --> 19:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But before any new director
starts, the spotlight remains on
the man just fired from the job,

19:35.500 --> 19:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who testifies on
Capitol Hill tomorrow.

19:37.633 --> 19:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa joins
us now from the Capitol.

19:41.466 --> 19:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa, it was a riveting hearing.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You talked to some of
the senators afterwards.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are they saying?

19:46.900 --> 19:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think
they're actually drawing
two conclusions from today.

19:49.333 --> 19:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, Judy, Democrats
feel increasingly that
this Trump administration
has a real problem

19:55.333 --> 19:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with both the investigation
and how it is handling it.

19:58.400 --> 20:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two, the second conclusion,
Democrats and Republicans
alike are not just frustrated.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're now concerned about the
lack of answers that they got
today and that they have been

20:07.300 --> 20:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting in the
congressional probe here.

20:09.633 --> 20:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke to Senator John McCain,
a man who you will remember
wished he was an ex-president

20:13.933 --> 20:15.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

20:15.966 --> 20:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said after walking away from
that hearing he felt that the
balance of power has clearly

20:19.233 --> 20:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shifted to the executive.

20:21.300 --> 20:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they're saying here,
Judy, is they're worried about
Congress' power and Congress'

20:24.600 --> 20:26.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
responsibility to look
into these matters.

20:26.666 --> 20:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, on James
Comey, we did get his opening
statement, and we have been

20:30.566 --> 20:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dissecting that on the program.

20:32.033 --> 20:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what are the senators
looking for from him tomorrow?

20:34.266 --> 20:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I got to
tell you, Judy, that written
statement has really shifted

20:37.166 --> 20:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expectations here
on Capitol Hill.

20:39.666 --> 20:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For one, I think Democrats
now are very happy to see that
Comey, indeed, plans to lay out

20:46.666 --> 20:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the red flags that he
saw in his conversations
with President Trump.

20:49.233 --> 20:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will certainly spend
a lot of time on that.

20:52.133 --> 20:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans, meanwhile,
we will see what they ask.

20:54.533 --> 20:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know some of their questions
will push back at Mr. Comey,
because he testified previously

20:59.133 --> 21:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in committee, he indicated
that he didn't think there
was any political pressure on

21:04.600 --> 21:05.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

21:05.533 --> 21:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Expect that kind of pushback.

21:07.633 --> 21:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think, overall, Judy,
this day began here on Capitol
Hill with many people thinking

21:10.600 --> 21:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
James Comey's testimony
might not live up to its
very prominent billing.

21:14.466 --> 21:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But now, Judy, it looks
like it just might.

21:17.033 --> 21:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it
was already going to --
everybody was watching
it, and now everyone

21:21.900 --> 21:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - more than everyone
will be watching.

21:24.166 --> 21:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I know you are
going to be there for us
tomorrow at the Capitol.

21:26.833 --> 21:28.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lisa, thank you.

21:28.966 --> 21:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be here with live
coverage of tomorrow's Senate
hearings with former FBI

21:34.700 --> 21:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Director James Comey.

21:35.633 --> 21:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's beginning at 10:00 a.m.

21:37.100 --> 21:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eastern here on PBS and
online at PBS.org/NewsHour.

21:43.900 --> 21:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
Islamic State, or ISIS, stunned
the nation of Iran with an

21:47.533 --> 21:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack into the heart of
its capital city, Tehran.

21:50.966 --> 21:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The targets, Parliament, and
the shrine to the revolutionary
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah

21:56.600 --> 21:58.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Khomeini.

21:58.133 --> 22:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When it was over, 13 people
were dead, plus six attackers.

22:01.233 --> 22:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have a full report
right after the news summary.

22:04.666 --> 22:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Britain, the death toll
rose to eight in Saturday's
London Bridge attack.

22:08.900 --> 22:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Teams had been searching
the River Thames today.

22:11.533 --> 22:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They recovered a body, and the
president of France said it
was a 45-year-old Frenchman

22:16.333 --> 22:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who had been missing.

22:18.433 --> 22:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police also made another
arrest today in connection
with the bridge killings.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump spoke by phone
today with the ruler of Qatar.

22:26.366 --> 22:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House says that he
offered to help repair a breach
with Arab states, who accuse

22:32.566 --> 22:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the oil kingdom of
supporting terror.

22:34.633 --> 22:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A day earlier, Mr. Trump
appeared to support
claims made by Saudi
Arabia and other nations

22:39.500 --> 22:41.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against Qatar.

22:41.633 --> 22:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Russia's foreign
minister denied a CNN report
that Russian hackers planted

22:47.933 --> 22:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a fake story with Qatar's
state news agency that led
to the diplomatic break.

22:51.300 --> 22:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through translator): I
think that CNN, like some other

22:58.333 --> 23:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mass media outlets, is just
waiting for the type of story
that stinks, or some scandal

23:00.666 --> 23:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to automatically, without any
evidence, add this episode
to the list of Russian sins,

23:07.166 --> 23:09.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Russian hackers or
someone else linked to
the Russian Federation.

23:09.633 --> 23:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The African
nation of Mauritania
today became the latest
to cut diplomatic

23:14.333 --> 23:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
relations with Qatar.

23:16.233 --> 23:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A warning today to American
armed forces inside Syria.

23:20.166 --> 23:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Militia groups supporting
President Bashar
al-Assad threatened
to hit U.S. targets if

23:26.600 --> 23:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. crosses what it
calls any more red lines.

23:28.733 --> 23:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just yesterday, American
planes bombed pro-government
fighters in Southern Syria.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pentagon says they
came close to U.S.-backed
opposition forces.

23:37.633 --> 23:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, President
Trump renewed his call to
commit $1 trillion in the years

23:43.733 --> 23:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ahead to overhauling the
nation's infrastructure.

23:47.100 --> 23:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Cincinnati, he said he has
heard the pleas of voters, and
the days of rebuilding other

23:51.833 --> 23:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
countries are over.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
We spend trillions and
trillions of dollars

23:56.766 --> 24:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outside our nation, but
we can't build a road,
a highway, a tunnel, a
bridge in our own nation.

24:04.800 --> 24:08.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we watch everything
falling into disrepair.

24:08.666 --> 24:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's time to rebuild our
country, to bring back our
jobs, to restore our dreams.

24:15.666 --> 24:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
also met with family business
owners he said were victims

24:19.166 --> 24:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of rising insurance
premiums under Obamacare.

24:22.300 --> 24:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he vowed that Republicans
will replace it, or bust.

24:29.766 --> 24:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today,
the Dow Jones industrial
average gained 37 points
to close at 21173.

24:33.733 --> 24:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq rose 22, and
the S&amp;P 500 added three.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return to the attacks
in Iran, the implications
and consequences, and
the wider picture in

24:46.533 --> 24:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a greatly unsettled region.

24:48.800 --> 24:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a moment, William
Brangham will speak with
experts on those questions.

24:52.533 --> 24:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, to begin, chief foreign
affairs correspondent Margaret
Warner reports on today's terror

24:58.966 --> 25:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Tehran that left 13 dead
and more than 40 wounded.

25:02.333 --> 25:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: It was
mid-morning when the
first shots echoed from
the Iranian Parliament

25:07.933 --> 25:09.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
building.

25:09.866 --> 25:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gunmen, some reportedly dressed
as women, stormed in with
rifles and suicide vests.

25:15.166 --> 25:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least one blew himself up
outside the Parliament chamber.

25:19.266 --> 25:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Another ran back outside and
began firing in the streets.

25:23.300 --> 25:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMAD SHAH, Witness (through
translator): When we were
close to the Parliament in a

25:26.066 --> 25:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
taxi, there were
more gunfire sounds.

25:28.300 --> 25:30.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
People were panicked
and started running away
and seeking shelter.

25:30.866 --> 25:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The
resulting siege with
police went on for hours.

25:35.266 --> 25:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Near the same time, the shrine
of Iran's revolutionary founder,
Ayatollah Khomeini, was hit.

25:45.166 --> 25:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Authorities say that, in
the end, six attackers were
killed and five arrested.

25:54.233 --> 25:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Islamic State group
immediately claimed
responsibility, the first
time the Sunni extremist

26:00.600 --> 26:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group has struck successfully
inside Shiite Iran.

26:03.933 --> 26:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The militants put out
video of the assault while
it was still under way.

26:10.333 --> 26:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One attacker says: "Do
you think we will go away?

26:13.333 --> 26:14.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will remain, God willing."

26:16.800 --> 26:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
the Islamic Republic's
supreme leader, was defiant.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI,
Supreme Leader of Iran (through
translator): The firecracker

26:23.666 --> 26:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
play that took place
today will have no effect
on the people's will.

26:27.366 --> 26:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, these incidents proved
that if the Islamic republic had
not resisted at the epicenter

26:32.133 --> 26:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of these seditions in Iraq and
Syria, we would be dealing with
many troubles caused by them

26:37.866 --> 26:40.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inside the country now.

26:40.300 --> 26:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But
Charlie Winter of the
International Center for
the Study of Radicalization

26:43.566 --> 26:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at King's College, London,
says that, for ISIS, attacking
Iran is like taking the crown

26:49.333 --> 26:51.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jewel.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE WINTER, International
Center for the Study
of Radicalization:
Striking Iran like

26:52.966 --> 26:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is akin to striking
the United States or Israel.

26:54.766 --> 26:58.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, this is really
a huge symbolic victory
for the Islamic State.

26:58.633 --> 27:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In terms of its propaganda, I
think the group will be talking
about this moment for years

27:06.800 --> 27:08.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to come.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: This attack
comes as ISIS is under pressure
from Iranian-backed militias

27:11.200 --> 27:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria and Iraq, as well as
from the U.S.-backed coalition.

27:16.066 --> 27:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ISIS-controlled Iraqi city
of Mosul has all but fallen
to government forces, aided

27:21.800 --> 27:23.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the Shiite militias.

27:23.866 --> 27:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in Syria, U.S.-backed
Kurdish fighters have opened a
full-on assault to reclaim the

27:29.166 --> 27:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Islamic State's capital, Raqqa.

27:31.666 --> 27:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also occurs amidst a spike
in the tense rivalry between
Iran and the Sunni Arab states

27:37.400 --> 27:39.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
led by Saudi Arabia.

27:39.466 --> 27:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last month, President Trump
rallied Arab nations to oppose
terror, and Iran especially.

27:45.866 --> 27:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, on Monday, the Saudis
and others cut ties to Qatar,
citing, in part, its ties to

27:52.033 --> 27:54.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Iran.

27:54.100 --> 27:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moreover, just hours before
today's attack, Saudi Foreign
Minister Adel Al-Jubeir Iran

27:59.800 --> 28:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - quote -- "must
be punished" for its
interference in the region.

28:02.333 --> 28:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After the attacks, Iran's
Revolutionary Guard accused the
Saudis, saying: "The fact that

28:09.233 --> 28:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islamic State has claimed
responsibility proves that they,
the Saudis, were involved."

28:14.866 --> 28:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Charlie Winter says this turn
of events further complicates
regional politics and the fight

28:19.733 --> 28:21.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against ISIS.

28:21.766 --> 28:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLIE WINTER: Regional
politics are kind of balancing
on a knife edge at the moment.

28:27.733 --> 28:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The more actors there are
involved in this war, the more
confusing it'll get, the more

28:30.800 --> 28:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bogged down states around
the world will get.

28:32.933 --> 28:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In a statement
this afternoon, the White House
voiced sympathy for the victims,

28:37.600 --> 28:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but said states that sponsor
terrorism risk falling victim
to the evil they promote.

28:43.733 --> 28:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Margaret Warner.

28:46.200 --> 28:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So what does
this first ever ISIS attack
inside actually Iran mean,

28:52.066 --> 28:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and how might Tehran respond?

28:54.133 --> 28:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To help us with that,
I'm joined by two people
with deep knowledge of
Iran and its role in

28:57.733 --> 28:59.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the region.

28:59.866 --> 29:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Randa Slim is director of the
Track II Dialogues Initiative
at the Middle East Institute.

29:03.533 --> 29:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Karim Sadjadpour is
a senior fellow in the
Middle East program at
the Carnegie Endowment

29:08.333 --> 29:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for International Peace.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Randa Slim, I would
like to start with you.

29:13.633 --> 29:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wonder if you could just
help us -- give us your sense,
your first reaction to this

29:17.633 --> 29:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack and, in particular, why
you believe, perhaps, these
two targets were chosen in

29:23.466 --> 29:25.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Tehran.

29:25.533 --> 29:29.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANDA SLIM, Middle East
Institute: Well, they
are important symbols
for Iranian Islamic

29:30.500 --> 29:32.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republic.

29:32.466 --> 29:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they especially the
mausoleum of Imam Khomeini, the
attack outside it is something

29:39.500 --> 29:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is seen by the
ISIS community, or the
community that is pro-ISIS,
as being an important

29:48.566 --> 29:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
symbol to attack because it
symbolizes the heart and the
founder of the Islamic Republic.

29:56.166 --> 30:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it is a first attack
claimed by ISIS in Iran.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have been trying to do
this attack for some time.

30:05.366 --> 30:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the fact that
they have been able to succeed
today will not diminish Iranian

30:16.366 --> 30:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime resolve to fight ISIS
in Iraq, for example, although
I have to say, in Syria,

30:24.666 --> 30:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are not devoting
much resources to
fighting ISIS, letting the
Americans lead that fight,

30:28.133 --> 30:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and instead fighting -- mostly
devoting their resources to
fight the Syrian opposition,

30:34.266 --> 30:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the non-jihadi
Syrian opposition.

30:36.333 --> 30:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Karim,
what was you first reaction
when you heard about this?

30:39.033 --> 30:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR, Carnegie
Endowment For International
Peace: Well, Iran has
been heavily invested

30:41.633 --> 30:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in regional conflicts
over the last six years.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As Randa mentioned, in
Syria, they have poured
billions of dollars.

30:46.966 --> 30:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have a thousand
casualties, likewise in Iraq.

30:50.233 --> 30:52.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have trained Shia
militias in Yemen.

30:52.700 --> 30:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they have been largely
immune to the casualties
in the Middle East.

30:57.600 --> 31:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Iranian people haven't
suffered the same way as peoples
in the region have suffered.

31:02.100 --> 31:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So this was a major
breach in Tehran.

31:05.900 --> 31:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I still think the fact
that Iran is a country which is
about 90 percent Shiite Muslim,

31:10.433 --> 31:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the city of Tehran is probably
over 95 percent Shia Muslim, I
don't think that ISIS is going

31:17.433 --> 31:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to continue to be able to
make these kinds of attacks in
Iran, because they don't have

31:21.400 --> 31:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the reservoir of support
in Iran that they may have
elsewhere in the Arab world.

31:25.633 --> 31:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And, Randa,
as we heard in Margaret Warner's
package at the beginning,

31:30.033 --> 31:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS hitting Iran in
particular was like them
stealing the crown jewels.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For those of us who don't
understand, why is that such
an attractive target to them?

31:39.433 --> 31:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANDA SLIM: ISIS represents
a -- the Salafi jihadi wing
of -- radical radical wing of

31:50.233 --> 31:52.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sunni Islam.

31:52.300 --> 31:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is a form of Sunni
Islam that looks at Shias, which
is the main religion of Iran,

31:59.233 --> 32:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as being apostates.

32:01.366 --> 32:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they look at their vision
of Islam, and their mission
of Islam is to cleanse Islam

32:10.033 --> 32:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of these apostates,
meaning the Shia.

32:12.466 --> 32:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, also, ISIS is
fighting for its survival.

32:19.433 --> 32:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is ISIS basically staking
a claim in the leadership
of this Sunni radical jihadi

32:26.900 --> 32:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
form of Sunni Islam, even
after they are defeated
in Mosul and after they
are defeated in Raqqa.

32:33.833 --> 32:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Karim, we
saw that, even though ISIS did
claim responsibility for this,

32:38.666 --> 32:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Iran immediately blamed
Saudi Arabia for this attack.

32:41.833 --> 32:43.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make
of that accusation?

32:43.900 --> 32:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: Well, Iran
and Saudi Arabia have long been
accusing one another of fueling

32:48.066 --> 32:50.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ISIS.

32:50.166 --> 32:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the Iranians, ISIS is a
byproduct of Saudi Wahhabist
ideology and Saudi financing.

32:56.500 --> 33:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To the Saudis, ISIS is
a byproduct of Iranian
support for Bashar
al-Assad in Syria and Shia

33:02.533 --> 33:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
militias in Iraq which are
killing Sunnis en masse.

33:08.533 --> 33:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reality is that ISIS poses
a grave threat to Iran, but
an even graver threat to Saudi

33:12.633 --> 33:14.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Arabia.

33:14.733 --> 33:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in theory, these two
countries actually have a
mutual adversary in ISIS.

33:17.766 --> 33:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what Iran has been doing
which I think is quite dangerous
is conflating Saudi Arabia

33:23.600 --> 33:25.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and ISIS.

33:25.666 --> 33:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they put their finger on
something which has a powerful
resonance amongst Iranians.

33:30.233 --> 33:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And whether you're a Shiite
cleric living in (INAUDIBLE)
or a secular Iranian opponent

33:37.233 --> 33:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the regime living in Los
Angeles, there is this kind
of Persian nationalism against

33:42.300 --> 33:43.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Saudi Arabia.

33:43.300 --> 33:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're trying to harness that.

33:45.300 --> 33:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what's dangerous about that
is not that they blamed Saudi
Arabia for this attack and

33:48.833 --> 33:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they vowed retaliation.

33:50.933 --> 33:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This really has a danger
of escalating this huge
regional war between
Iran and Saudi Arabia,

33:57.600 --> 34:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which has really eclipsed
the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict in its
destabilization on the Middle

34:01.933 --> 34:04.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
East.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Randa, as
you heard Karim mention here,
very strong tensions between

34:06.700 --> 34:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Iran and Saudi Arabia.

34:08.333 --> 34:12.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We also have a proxy
war going on between the
two nations in Yemen.

34:12.900 --> 34:17.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think that this attack
today -- I guess I'm asking, are
we getting potentially closer

34:19.233 --> 34:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to an all-out conflict
between Iran and Saudi Arabia?

34:23.066 --> 34:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDA SLIM: Look, this
attack definitely contributes
to further escalation
in an already volatile

34:31.733 --> 34:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
region and in an already
tense relationship between
the two regional powers.

34:38.666 --> 34:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as we have seen in the
past, when Iran and Saudi Arabia
fight or escalate their fight,

34:43.266 --> 34:45.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it doesn't stay with
Saudi Arabia and Iran.

34:45.766 --> 34:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It reverberates throughout the
region, and because one way by
which they wage this competition

34:52.766 --> 34:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between them is through proxy
fights in the rest of the
region, be it in Yemen, be it

34:57.533 --> 35:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria, be it in Iraq,
or even be it in Lebanon.

35:00.433 --> 35:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we are likely
to see -- as tensions
and as things escalate
between the two countries,

35:07.333 --> 35:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are likely to see that
being played out again in Yemen
and being played out in Syria

35:11.466 --> 35:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and being played out in Iraq.

35:13.600 --> 35:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's problematic here is that,
instead of the two regional
countries, Iran and Saudi

35:20.533 --> 35:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arabia, focusing their resources
and working together on fighting
a common economy to both

35:26.933 --> 35:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them, which is ISIS, we are
seeing this now escalation in
the relations between them,

35:32.533 --> 35:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leading both to divert their
resources and their attention
from the real joint enemy,

35:38.766 --> 35:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is ISIS, and focusing it
on waging this fight and this
competition between them in

35:41.633 --> 35:43.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
different proxy sites
around the region.

35:43.800 --> 35:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Karim, I
wonder what you believe the
Trump administration's response

35:47.866 --> 35:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to all this is going to be.

35:49.933 --> 35:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARIM SADJADPOUR: The Trump
administration has gone back
to kind of the status quo ante

35:53.933 --> 35:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. policy, which is
cooperation with Saudi Arabia
and containment of Iran.

35:58.733 --> 36:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I oftentimes think that
President Trump views
this as just simply siding
with one team against

36:05.100 --> 36:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another, and that's a dangerous
recipe in the Middle East.

36:08.133 --> 36:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Karim Sadjadpour, Randa Slim,
thank you both very much.

36:14.300 --> 36:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARIM SADJADPOUR:
Thank you, William.

36:21.633 --> 36:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Campaigning has
ended in the fiercely contested
British general election.

36:29.600 --> 36:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prime Minister Theresa May of
the Conservative Party called
the vote in order to boost her

36:34.200 --> 36:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
authority as Britain
negotiates its withdrawal
from the European Union.

36:38.866 --> 36:43.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Her main challenge
comes from Labor Party
leader, Jeremy Corbyn.

36:43.200 --> 36:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the campaign has
been overshadowed by two
recent terrorist attacks.

36:48.000 --> 36:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports from London.

36:51.266 --> 36:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Along with
many young Britons, Steve and
Keeley Whitton dream of raising

36:57.433 --> 37:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their children in a
home of their own.

37:00.400 --> 37:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
London's expensive real estate
is beyond their reach, and so
they live with Steve's parents.

37:05.300 --> 37:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But affordable housing isn't
top of their election agenda.

37:08.966 --> 37:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Saturday's terrorist attack, two
miles from where they live, is.

37:11.966 --> 37:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEELEY WHITTON, Voter: A couple
of times, actually, whenever
we have gone out, really,

37:14.666 --> 37:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have had the conversation,
what are we going to do
if something happens?

37:17.833 --> 37:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE WHITTON, Voter:
If something did happen,
just having a plan,
basically having -- so

37:20.533 --> 37:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I will grab one kid,
she will grab the other.

37:23.100 --> 37:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the past couple of weeks,
after the terrorist attacks in
Manchester and London, security

37:29.766 --> 37:34.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
has gone up in my own
agenda, as far as who
I'm going to vote for.

37:36.466 --> 37:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think a lot of people are
now looking, all right, who's
best going to deliver security?

37:39.200 --> 37:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Vigilance,
tolerance and remembrance
unite these people.

37:43.833 --> 37:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're from Borough
Market, where the three
Islamist terrorists
lashed out with knives

37:49.566 --> 37:51.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before being shot dead.

37:51.533 --> 37:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The traders have been kept away
from their businesses, while
forensics experts gathered

37:54.900 --> 37:55.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evidence.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
VERY REV.

37:57.866 --> 37:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW NUNN, Dean of
Southwark: So, we're going
to keep a moment of silence.

37:59.933 --> 38:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're keeping it at the
other end of the bridge
in St. Paul's cathedral.

38:02.333 --> 38:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They know we're here.

38:03.700 --> 38:05.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We know they're there.

38:05.633 --> 38:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're standing in solidarity,
the two cathedrals and
our communities together.

38:12.033 --> 38:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Sir Simon
Hughes was the area's member
of Parliament for 32 years from

38:17.700 --> 38:20.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Liberal Democrats,
the third largest party.

38:20.200 --> 38:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He lost his seat to the
Labor candidate in 2015.

38:23.733 --> 38:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Winning it back would hurt
Labor and help Theresa May.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIR SIMON HUGHES, Former
Justice Minister: Actually, the
public services are at the top

38:28.866 --> 38:30.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of people's agenda.

38:30.866 --> 38:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People want us to have the
police we need, the nurses
we need, the doctors we need.

38:34.133 --> 38:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is now an issue.

38:36.166 --> 38:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The security of the country,
dealing with the very few
people who want to disrupt us

38:38.233 --> 38:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a major political issue now
in this country, and it will be
the biggest issue on the desk

38:48.866 --> 38:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the incoming prime minister
and the incoming government.

38:50.866 --> 38:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The belief that
radicalization and terrorism
are fuelled by deprivation,

38:52.900 --> 38:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
social isolation, and
Britain's military campaigns
abroad will guide Jill Rose.

38:58.966 --> 39:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JILL ROSE, Voter:
There are two issues.

39:01.100 --> 39:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are the immediate, about
how we stop or try and stop
more terrorist attacks, and

39:04.433 --> 39:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then the bigger picture
that is equally important.

39:06.566 --> 39:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, for me, that means voting
Labor in terms of the approach,
changing this world that

39:13.966 --> 39:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
really goes back to the
cuts and the approach of
the current government.

39:18.600 --> 39:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Now would you please
welcome the leader of the
Labor Party, Jeremy Corbyn?

39:23.500 --> 39:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Jeremy
Corbyn's Achilles' heel is
security, say his critics.

39:27.733 --> 39:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They fear Britain's defense
would be weakened by a lifelong
self-professed pacifist taking

39:34.133 --> 39:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
control of Britain's Trident
nuclear missile system.

39:36.233 --> 39:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader, Labor
Party: We have to obviously
try to protect ourselves.

39:40.466 --> 39:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We wouldn't use it as first use.

39:42.966 --> 39:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if we did use it,
millions are going to die.

39:46.033 --> 39:47.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have to think
these things through.

39:47.466 --> 39:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Close down NATO.

39:49.466 --> 39:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This
conservative ad uses Corbyn's
past and words to attack him.

39:53.533 --> 39:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEREMY CORBYN: Fight all
the cuts, except those
in the armed forces.

39:57.033 --> 39:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our friends from Hezbollah,
friends from Hamas.

39:59.133 --> 40:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATE HOEY, Labor M.P.: I don't
think people need fear because
he said something 30 years

40:03.633 --> 40:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ago or appeared with somebody.

40:05.133 --> 40:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, we have all had
our past and our histories.

40:07.600 --> 40:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Kate Hoey has
been a Labor M.P. for 28 years,
and her seat is under threat

40:12.300 --> 40:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because she supported Brexit.

40:14.333 --> 40:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATE HOEY: I think Jeremy
would know that, being prime
minister, the first duty is to

40:17.666 --> 40:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protect the British public.

40:19.633 --> 40:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, even though
he has said things in the
past, people grow into a job.

40:24.066 --> 40:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think I have
seen changes in Jeremy.

40:26.066 --> 40:29.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have known him for a very
long time, and even over the
last year, I have seen how he's

40:29.666 --> 40:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
changed, in terms of the
way he puts his views.

40:32.733 --> 40:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Please welcome the leader
of the Conservative Party, the
prime minister, Theresa May.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: When Theresa
May called the snap election
in April, the Conservatives

40:40.966 --> 40:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were 17 percent ahead of Labor.

40:43.400 --> 40:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her refusal to debate Corbyn
helped erode the advantage.

40:47.100 --> 40:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: You have called a general
election for the good of the
Conservative Party, and it's

40:50.333 --> 40:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to backfire on you.

40:51.900 --> 40:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: No, I called...

40:55.133 --> 40:57.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

40:57.300 --> 41:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA MAY: I called a general
election because I believe that
the British people have a right

41:03.000 --> 41:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to vote and to say who they
want to see leading them
through the Brexit negotiations.

41:05.933 --> 41:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW PARRIS, Columnist,
The Times: She has personally
been winged like a bird's been

41:10.266 --> 41:11.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
winged.

41:11.633 --> 41:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has appeared
inadequate and indecisive.

41:14.266 --> 41:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She has changed her
mind, and pretended that
she hasn't changed her
mind, and I don't think

41:18.600 --> 41:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people will ever see her in
quite the same way again.

41:20.800 --> 41:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: From his
Thames-side warehouse loft,
former conservative M.P.

41:24.866 --> 41:29.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matthew Parris, now a respected
columnist, has written some
damning commentaries about

41:29.566 --> 41:32.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the prime minister.

41:32.066 --> 41:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW PARRIS: She doesn't
have those quicksilver
qualities that are perhaps
needed in a statesman

41:36.433 --> 41:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and needed in negotiation.

41:37.933 --> 41:39.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She's rigid.

41:39.500 --> 41:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
THERESA MAY: The
conservative party can
build a better Britain.

41:42.233 --> 41:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This song,
banned from the air by the BBC,
has hit the top of the British

41:46.733 --> 41:47.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
charts.

41:47.966 --> 41:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN (singing):
She's a liar, liar.

41:50.533 --> 41:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oh, she's a liar, liar.

41:53.966 --> 41:56.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Oh, you can't trust
her, no, no, no.

41:56.700 --> 42:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But above this
betting shop in East London,
there's optimism in the campaign

42:00.866 --> 42:04.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
office of Conservative
candidate Lee Scott.

42:04.133 --> 42:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's trying to reclaim a seat
lost to Labor in 2015, and
says he's reaping the benefit

42:10.500 --> 42:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of May's promise to
crack down on extremists.

42:12.533 --> 42:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LEE SCOTT, Candidate
for Parliament: They
are totally committed
to going out and voting

42:16.000 --> 42:18.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for me.

42:18.066 --> 42:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA JOHNSTON, Voter: Anyone
slightly to the right is being
made to feel almost guilty

42:20.566 --> 42:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have to be center-right.

42:22.666 --> 42:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEE SCOTT: You know, they want
to try and make people feel
guilty to love their country,

42:26.266 --> 42:30.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
guilty to want to stand
up for what's right,
guilty for wanting to
try to have a firm law

42:30.866 --> 42:31.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and order policy.

42:31.866 --> 42:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not going to work.

42:33.900 --> 42:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on the doorsteps, people
are saying to me that it's
about strong leadership.

42:36.400 --> 42:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that strong leadership
is coming from Theresa May,
certainly not from Mr. Corbyn.

42:40.466 --> 42:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The latest
opinion polls suggest that
Theresa May's gamble will pay

42:43.866 --> 42:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off, and that she will be
returned to office with
an increased majority.

42:47.866 --> 42:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But many pollsters have been
wrong in the recent past, most
notably failing to correctly

42:51.966 --> 42:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
predict the Brexit vote during
last year's E.U. referendum.

42:55.866 --> 42:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in London.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Thank you, Malcolm.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be back shortly with
our series done by students,
Limitless, about people

43:04.600 --> 43:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
living with disabilities.

43:06.166 --> 43:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, first, take a
moment to hear from
your local PBS station.

43:18.933 --> 43:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEXT, WE TAKE A MOMENT TO LOOK
AT THE SPECIFIC SKILLS SOME
COMPANIES WANT THEIR ENTRY-LEVEL

43:28.400 --> 43:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMPLOYEES TO HAVE, AND WHAT
COLLEGES MIGHT DO TO MAKE
SURE THEIR GRADUATES ARE READY

43:32.766 --> 43:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HIT THE GROUND RUNNING.

43:34.700 --> 43:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN HAS THIS
STORY, WHICH ORIGINALLY
AIRED LAST FALL.

43:38.700 --> 43:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Graduation
day at Georgetown University.

43:43.300 --> 43:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It takes four years, more
than $200,000, and a lot
of hard work to get here.

43:51.633 --> 43:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now more employers
are asking, what does a
four-year degree really mean?

43:56.400 --> 44:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What true marketable
skills can new graduates
offer the work force?

44:00.533 --> 44:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Georgetown University is
trying to answer that question.

44:02.633 --> 44:05.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANDALL BASS, Professor,
Georgetown University:
We're hearing from
employers, how do you

44:05.266 --> 44:07.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
differentiate between
two graduates?

44:07.566 --> 44:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Professor
Randall Bass leads the college's
Designing the Future Initiative.

44:12.033 --> 44:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANDALL BASS: If you have got
a pile of 10 graduates who
all have degrees from quality

44:16.633 --> 44:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liberal arts schools,
and they all look more
or less alike in terms of
their formal credentials,

44:20.866 --> 44:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are there ways to
differentiate them?

44:23.433 --> 44:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
&lt;&lt;TEACHER TALKING>>

44:25.833 --> 44:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Last
semester, Bass and
colleagues at Georgetown
offered a free experimental

44:32.266 --> 44:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
course for students who want to
further distinguish themselves.

44:35.533 --> 44:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead of receiving
a traditional credit,
students who meet the
requirements are awarded

44:41.133 --> 44:43.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a digital badge.

44:43.233 --> 44:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANDALL BASS: What we see in
the badges is a way of trying
to help students tell a story

44:49.000 --> 44:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about some dimension of their
learning that might otherwise
be merely a line on their

44:52.766 --> 44:54.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
resume.

44:54.733 --> 44:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESY OSUNSADE, Talent
Acquisition, Arabella Advisors:
A resume has never been enough.

44:56.233 --> 44:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's why the concept of
badging is appealing to me.

44:58.766 --> 45:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Job
recruiters, like Desy
Osunsade, see digital
badges as a way to better

45:03.433 --> 45:05.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
define talent.

45:05.400 --> 45:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESY OSUNSADE: We spend a lot
of time and money as recruiters
trying to make sure that

45:08.366 --> 45:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have the perfect fit,
because recruiting is expensive.

45:10.900 --> 45:15.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Osunsade recruits for
Arabella Philanthropic
Investment Advisors.

45:15.466 --> 45:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says a degree doesn't say
enough about a potential hire.

45:18.900 --> 45:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DESY OSUNSADE: It tells me
the person's line of study.

45:22.700 --> 45:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't tell me if they are
good at things like critical
thinking, problem-solving, do

45:29.133 --> 45:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they work well in teams, do they
have great oral communication?

45:31.266 --> 45:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A resume, in itself, with
a degree from anywhere
does not tell me that.

45:35.500 --> 45:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The digital
badge offered by Georgetown
is called a Catalyst Badge.

45:41.833 --> 45:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alexis Oni-Eseleh
participated in the pilot.

45:43.800 --> 45:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXIS ONI-ESELEH: The Catalyst
Badge is just affirming that
when we see something that

45:46.100 --> 45:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needs to be changed, we just
go about it, proving that
you are an agent of change in

45:50.733 --> 45:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accomplishing the goals
you set for yourself.

45:54.400 --> 45:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Don Fraser,
from the Education Design Lab,
works with Georgetown, George

45:57.600 --> 46:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mason University, and University
of Virginia, as part of a
larger effort called the 21st

46:03.466 --> 46:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Century Skill Badging Challenge.

46:05.600 --> 46:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If I'm an
employer, I'm going to get a
better employee if they have

46:12.133 --> 46:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
badges that say they are
a creative problem solver
or critical thinker, a
good oral communicator?

46:14.800 --> 46:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DON FRASER, Education Design
Lab: If there's rigor in those
badges, I would - and those

46:18.866 --> 46:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are skills that you find
valuable in the work that
you're doing, I would say yes.

46:22.733 --> 46:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More so than
just if they came out of a
specific school with a certain

46:27.066 --> 46:29.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
degree?

46:29.166 --> 46:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DON FRASER: Exactly, right,
because they have been working
specifically to acquire those

46:32.166 --> 46:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
skills, which is totally
different than the implicit way
in which we believe they are

46:39.100 --> 46:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting those right now, hoping
that by the time they graduate
and get this degree, they

46:41.766 --> 46:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have gained these
skills in some capacity.

46:43.733 --> 46:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Anthony
Carnevale is the director of
the Georgetown University Center

46:47.233 --> 46:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on Education and the Workforce.

46:49.633 --> 46:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY CARNEVALE, Director,
Center on Education and
the Workforce: What's
happening is that

46:51.766 --> 46:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the on-the-job training
is no longer sufficient,
because employers don't
commit to employees

46:57.800 --> 47:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a lifetime the way they
used to, so we have got to
get our own job training.

47:00.433 --> 47:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In may,
Alexis Oni-Eseleh graduated
from Georgetown with a major in

47:07.933 --> 47:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
global health and a minor
in women's gender studies.

47:11.266 --> 47:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since graduation, she has
been helping with her parents'
company and will start a more

47:14.933 --> 47:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
serious job search this fall.

47:16.733 --> 47:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALEXIS ONI-ESELEH: Here
it is, certification
Catalyst Credential.

47:19.766 --> 47:24.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I had to pass a certain
level of criteria,
which you can find here.

47:24.500 --> 47:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you click there, it
will take you to this Web site,
which tells you everything

47:28.366 --> 47:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I needed to do to
become a Catalyst.

47:31.033 --> 47:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Catalyst Credential
is awarded to a student
who embraces challenges,
demonstrates initiative,

47:35.700 --> 47:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pursues positive social change.

47:37.333 --> 47:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DON FRASER: You host
them online, and they're
hosted digitally.

47:40.533 --> 47:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People have the ability to click
on that badge and get at the
metadata associated with how

47:45.333 --> 47:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the learner, the student
achieved that particular badge.

47:49.200 --> 47:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if I am so inclined, I
can look at assessments that
were a part of that badge.

47:56.133 --> 47:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can look at the work, the body
of work that the student did
in order to earn that badge.

48:01.500 --> 48:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNOUNCER: The same degree
from different schools
produces different workers.

48:05.200 --> 48:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Some
emerging for-profit education
ventures see a much bigger role

48:09.600 --> 48:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for digital badges.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CRAIG, Director,
University Ventures: A
degree doesn't say a lot.

48:13.566 --> 48:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A badge or a micro-credential
can say a lot more.

48:16.566 --> 48:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ryan Craig
is the author of "College
Disrupted: The Great Unbundling

48:20.400 --> 48:22.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Higher Education."

48:22.400 --> 48:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN CRAIG: The primary
credential that we use in our
labor market is the degree.

48:27.666 --> 48:29.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the sort of
default credential.

48:29.800 --> 48:34.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Micro-credentials, or
badges, breaks that down
into literally competencies.

48:34.666 --> 48:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What micro-credentials
are signaling is the
shift from degree-based
hiring to competency-based

48:41.100 --> 48:42.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hiring.

48:42.766 --> 48:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANNOUNCER: That's right,
LinkedIn, it's not just
for top executives.

48:44.900 --> 48:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's for you, and it's the
perfect place for you to
start your professional story.

48:48.633 --> 48:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Craig points
to Microsoft and its recent
purchase of LinkedIn as new

48:52.666 --> 48:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
players in the field of
post-secondary education
because they offer educational
training, certificates,

48:58.866 --> 49:01.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and a marketplace
to display skills.

49:01.100 --> 49:06.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RYAN CRAIG: Competency
marketplaces, we think,
are the way in which
a decade from now are,

49:07.566 --> 49:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most post-secondary
education will be purchased.

49:10.066 --> 49:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But
Anthony Carnevale cautions
that commercial badges,
micro-credentials,

49:14.833 --> 49:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and certificates
need more scrutiny.

49:16.866 --> 49:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTHONY CARNEVALE: It's a
whole industry where I there's
no transparency, no consumer

49:23.700 --> 49:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protection, so let the buyer
beware of what happened to the
people who took this course,

49:26.833 --> 49:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got this badge, so that
people can tell if something
is worth the money.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Alexis
Oni-Eseleh says she recently
used the Catalyst badge in a job

49:35.500 --> 49:37.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interview.

49:37.600 --> 49:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEXIS ONI-ESELEH: The
interviewer asked me to
talk about a time where
I showed initiative,

49:39.633 --> 49:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I was able to talk about
the digital badge and all the
steps I had to take in order to

49:43.700 --> 49:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get it and to qualify for it.

49:45.833 --> 49:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I even encouraged her
to go look up the digital
badge on my LinkedIn page.

49:49.200 --> 49:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This fall,
designers of the badge challenge
are expanding their reach

49:52.566 --> 49:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to colleges who serve
non-traditional students,
who often have a harder
struggle to find jobs.

49:59.100 --> 50:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In Washington, D.C.,
I'm Hari Sreenivasan
for the "PBS NewsHour."

50:06.066 --> 50:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we continue
our series Limitless, produced
by middle and high school

50:16.900 --> 50:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students, looking at people with
disabilities dealing with the
challenges of everyday life.

50:21.633 --> 50:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tonight, a remarkable
young boy who was born
with a heart disease.

50:25.000 --> 50:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The story was produced by
our Student Reporting Labs
and reporter Emma Kate Woods.

50:31.466 --> 50:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's an eighth grader at report
Dalton Middle School in Georgia.

50:33.633 --> 50:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY BRUCE HENNON, Suffers
From Heart Disease: I was born
with a hypoplastic left heart,

50:40.666 --> 50:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which, it's very rare, and
it's -- you're born with
literally half of heart.

50:48.133 --> 50:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EMMA KATE WOODS: Jerry
Bruce Hennon is a happy,
easy-going 11-year- old
boy who was born with

50:54.033 --> 50:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a congenital heart disease.

50:55.533 --> 50:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERRY BRUCE HENNON: Your heart
beats like ba-bup, ba-bup.

50:58.066 --> 51:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mine was that, but ba-bup,
ba-bup, ba-bup, twice as fast.

51:03.033 --> 51:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it had to work
for left and right.

51:06.233 --> 51:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And this hand's
always been weak.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's getting stronger.

51:10.866 --> 51:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA KATE WOODS: Hypoplastic
left heart syndrome is
a birth defect where
the left side of the

51:14.100 --> 51:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heart doesn't form correctly,
severely restricting blood
flow through the heart.

51:21.133 --> 51:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a result, the heart cannot
pump oxygen-rich blood through
the body properly, causing a

51:25.166 --> 51:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
life-threatening condition.

51:27.200 --> 51:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he was three days old,
Jerry Bruce suffered a stroke,
leaving his left side partially

51:32.466 --> 51:34.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
paralyzed.

51:34.500 --> 51:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In order to live, Jerry Bruce
need a heart transplant,
which he fortunately received

51:38.100 --> 51:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on June 4, 2016, a procedure
he knows has changed his life.

51:45.033 --> 51:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY BRUCE HENNON: The
transplant, I feel like that's
the greatest and worst possible

51:49.300 --> 51:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thing that could
ever happen to me.

51:51.300 --> 51:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMMA KATE WOODS: Jerry
Bruce is very close with his
family, especially his mother.

51:58.333 --> 52:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY BRUCE HENNON: This bond
is the strongest between a
mother and a son to ever live.

52:06.566 --> 52:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I promise you that.

52:09.133 --> 52:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA HENNON, Mother of
Jerry Bruce: You know,
I don't know if anybody
else with a special-needs

52:10.833 --> 52:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
child will understand that.

52:14.200 --> 52:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You do love all of
your children, but
it's just different.

52:16.866 --> 52:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His little classmates
are tight and take good
care of him, you know?

52:21.800 --> 52:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think they will
always be there.

52:24.966 --> 52:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's got a good
support group in his class.

52:28.266 --> 52:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMMA KATE WOODS: A student at
Westwood Elementary School, his
classmates and his fourth grade

52:32.833 --> 52:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teacher Ms. Bailey have seen
his struggles first hand.

52:36.366 --> 52:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAQUITA BAILEY, Teacher: He's
had such a tough little life.

52:39.100 --> 52:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's had to go through
so much from birth.

52:41.433 --> 52:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think all of the surgeries
and things like that he's had
throughout his entire existence

52:45.566 --> 52:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on earth made him stronger
just as an individual, but
he's still the same little boy.

52:51.900 --> 52:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's no different.

52:53.966 --> 52:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EMMA KATE WOODS: Jerry Bruce's
strength and determination
have made him a local hero,

52:59.066 --> 53:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
earning the nickname Superman.

53:01.266 --> 53:05.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEREDITH DILBECK, Friend of
Jerry Bruce: I think he just
loves, like, Superman, like,

53:06.733 --> 53:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Batman, and all that stuff.

53:08.733 --> 53:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our school has really reflected
on that, just him being like
Superman and like saving the

53:13.633 --> 53:15.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
world and all that.

53:15.666 --> 53:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY BRUCE HENNON: Just the
joy that God's given you is like
a chance, because most people

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
don't get that.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA HENNON: You just want
your child to live, or
that's -- that's how I felt.

53:24.900 --> 53:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, you know, he could
be a rocket scientist.

53:29.600 --> 53:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You don't have to play
football to be a man
or a successful person.

53:34.233 --> 53:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jerry,
we are in awe of you.

53:36.833 --> 53:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, Emma Kate, you have
a future as a reporter.

53:40.133 --> 53:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:42.166 --> 53:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And don't forget, join us for
live coverage of former FBI
Director James Comey's testimony

53:47.800 --> 53:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

53:48.733 --> 53:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

53:51.033 --> 53:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eastern on PBS and

on Facebook and YouTube.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:59.500 --> 54:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
