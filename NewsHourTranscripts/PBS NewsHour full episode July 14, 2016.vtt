JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill's on assignment in
Cleveland.

00:08.709 --> 00:14.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Speculation swirls
around whom Donald Trump will
pick for his

00:14.047 --> 00:19.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vice presidential running mate,
but as the
candidate prepares for a
different type of

00:19.319 --> 00:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
convention, could party rules
threaten his
nomination?

00:23.991 --> 00:30.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Thursday:
hunger, violence,
and political unrest, how
Venezuela's financial

00:30.397 --> 00:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crisis has taken a turn into
darkness.

00:33.467 --> 00:38.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): At
2:00 in the morning,
I was sleeping in my room. My
telephone rang

00:38.939 --> 00:43.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it was my son. He said to
me, "Papa, I'm
kidnapped. I will put the
kidnapper on."

00:43.877 --> 00:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And our End of
AIDS series
takes us from the U.S. to
Rwanda, where a

00:50.217 --> 00:55.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successful response to the virus
is becoming
a point of pride for this once
battered country.

00:55.722 --> 01:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SABIN NSANZIMANA, Rwanda
Biomedical Center:
Now it's time where we can say,
no more loss,

01:01.128 --> 01:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shouldn't lose any other life
anymore.

01:03.931 --> 01:08.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:08.268 --> 01:12.372 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:12.406 --> 01:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The political
world was alive
with talk today of Donald
Trump's running

01:25.052 --> 01:26.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mate.

01:26.954 --> 01:31.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several news outlets reported
that he's decided
on Indiana Governor Mike Pence.
Trump's son,

01:31.491 --> 01:38.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Jr., told NBC it's down
to three, Pence,
former Speaker Newt Gingrich and
New Jersey

01:38.498 --> 01:43.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Chris Christie. The
Trump campaign
said only that an announcement
will come tomorrow

01:43.704 --> 01:45.605 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
morning.

01:45.639 --> 01:49.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the Democrats'
presumptive nominee,
Hillary Clinton, met with
Democratic senators

01:49.710 --> 01:54.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Capitol. She told them
she will pick
a -- quote -- "very qualified"
vice presidential

01:54.648 --> 01:59.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running mate. We will discuss
all of this
and more after the news summary.

01:59.152 --> 02:04.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg
walked back her criticism of
Donald Trump

02:04.558 --> 02:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. She had branded him a
faker and dangerous
for the country. In a new
statement, she said

02:10.464 --> 02:15.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "My recent remarks
were ill-advised,
and I regret making them. In the
future, I

02:15.869 --> 02:17.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will be more circumspect."

02:17.971 --> 02:22.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. secretary of homeland
security says
he's worried about potential
trouble during

02:22.943 --> 02:28.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protests at the upcoming party
conventions.
Jeh Johnson spoke at a House
hearing today.

02:28.081 --> 02:34.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEH JOHNSON, U.S. Secretary of
Homeland Security:
I am concerned about the
prospect of demonstrations

02:34.521 --> 02:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting out of hand. I am
concerned about
the possibility of violence. We
have within

02:40.961 --> 02:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DHS some 3,000 personnel that
will be dedicated
to the security of the
Republican National

02:47.501 --> 02:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Convention and the Democratic
National Convention
each.

02:50.704 --> 02:55.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Johnson said
thousands of state
and local police will also be
working the

02:55.642 --> 02:57.744 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two conventions.

02:57.778 --> 03:02.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds turned out today in St.
Paul, Minnesota,
for the funeral of Philando
Castile, whose

03:02.749 --> 03:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fatal shooting by a policeman
had touched
off nationwide protests. The
casket was carried

03:08.422 --> 03:14.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by horse-drawn carriage to the
Cathedral of
St. Paul. More than 1,500
mourners attended

03:14.494 --> 03:16.196 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the service.

03:16.229 --> 03:21.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Dallas, police turned out en
masse for
the funeral of Sergeant Michael
Smith. He

03:21.034 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was one of five officers shot to
death by
a sniper last week.

03:25.639 --> 03:31.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A tragedy is unfolding in
Southern France
tonight. A truck rammed into a
crowd celebrating

03:31.311 --> 03:37.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bastille Day in Nice. Local
officials say
at least 30 people were killed,
including

03:37.150 --> 03:42.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the driver, and 100 were
injured. They're
calling it an attack.

03:42.289 --> 03:46.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain's new prime Britain's
new prime minister,
Theresa May, shook up the ruling
Cabinet today,

03:46.827 --> 03:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sacking several ministers and
naming Boris
Johnson as foreign secretary.
The outspoken

03:52.199 --> 03:57.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
former London mayor helped lead
efforts to
quit the European Union. His
appointment drew

03:57.537 --> 04:01.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sharp criticism across Europe.
Johnson brushed
it aside.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BORIS JOHNSON, Former Mayor of
London: It
is inevitable there was going to
be a certain

04:03.243 --> 04:07.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount of plaster coming off the
ceiling in
the chancelleries of Europe. It
wasn't the

04:07.481 --> 04:14.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
result that they were expecting.
And clearly
they are making their views
known in a frank

04:14.554 --> 04:16.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and free way.

04:16.389 --> 04:20.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a massive difference
between leaving
the E.U. and our relations with
Europe, which,

04:20.627 --> 04:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if anything, I think, are going
to be intensified
and be built up at an
intergovernmental level.

04:27.300 --> 04:31.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Here in
Washington, the State
Department said the United
States expects

04:31.104 --> 04:34.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to work well with the new
British ministers.

04:34.708 --> 04:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
traveled to
Moscow today, reportedly calling
for joint

04:39.246 --> 04:45.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S.-Russian action against
Islamic State
forces in Syria. Ahead of
Kerry's arrival,

04:45.152 --> 04:51.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post said that he
will propose
joint bombing operations and
other efforts,

04:51.324 --> 04:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and ask Russia to restrain
Syria's military.

04:54.694 --> 04:59.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Until now, the Obama
administration had rejected
such cooperation.

04:59.399 --> 05:05.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad
has denied that his forces
targeted American

05:05.605 --> 05:12.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journalist Marie Colvin. She
died in an artillery
attack while reporting in Syria
in 2012, and

05:12.679 --> 05:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her family is charging in a
lawsuit that the
regime wanted her silenced.

05:17.017 --> 05:23.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Assad tells the "NBC Nightly
News" that
Colvin was to blame for her own
death.

05:23.089 --> 05:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, President of
Syria: She worked
with the terrorists. And because
she came

05:27.093 --> 05:33.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
illegally, she's being
responsible of everything
that befall on her. Nobody knows
if she was

05:33.900 --> 05:39.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed by a missile or which
missile and where
did the missile come from or
how. Nobody has

05:39.739 --> 05:41.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any evidence.

05:41.708 --> 05:45.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Assad typically
uses the term
terrorists to describe all of
the groups fighting

05:45.445 --> 05:47.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his forces.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And back in this country, Wall
Street resumed
its rally. The Dow Jones
industrial average

05:51.585 --> 06:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gained 134 points to close at
18506. The Nasdaq
rose 28 points, and the S&amp;P 500
added 11.

06:01.795 --> 06:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
speculation
grows around Donald Trump's V.P.
pick; a country

06:07.534 --> 06:14.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in crisis, inside Venezuela's
economic collapse;
a rise in employment contracts
that restrict

06:14.908 --> 06:28.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
workers' freedom; and much more.

06:28.488 --> 06:33.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We start with a swirl of
speculation around
Donald Trump's V.P. pick, as the
Republican

06:34.027 --> 06:37.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Party readies for an
unconventional convention.

06:37.564 --> 06:43.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gwen is in Cleveland tonight at
the PBS station
there, WVIZ ideastream.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hello, Gwen.

06:45.138 --> 06:52.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how does all this rollout of
a vice presidential
pick, how does it compare with
others you

06:52.045 --> 06:53.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have covered?

06:53.780 --> 06:57.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I would say the last
24 hours
is crazier than any other I have
ever covered,

06:57.550 --> 07:00.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but not entirely the entire
process.

07:00.053 --> 07:04.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're still waiting for the
final word on
who the nominee is going to be.
But think

07:04.424 --> 07:10.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back with me, Judy, because you
have covered
these as well. In 1988, that was
the one big

07:10.263 --> 07:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surprise. Remember when Dan
Quayle showed
up literally at the convention
on a riverboat

07:15.201 --> 07:17.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and George Bush had anointed him
for the first
time?

07:17.804 --> 07:21.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one had ever really heard of
him. No one
had thought of him, once again
from Indiana,

07:21.875 --> 07:27.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a senator from Indiana. And then
I remember,
in 1992, being in Little Rock
and hearing

07:27.080 --> 07:31.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Al Gore was going to be
Bill Clinton's
nominee. And part of the
surprise of that,

07:31.751 --> 07:34.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course, was there were two
Southerners.
That wasn't supposed to happen.
That wasn't

07:34.988 --> 07:36.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the conventional wisdom.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the last true
surprise, and it
didn't happen on the day of the
announcement,

07:40.660 --> 07:44.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it happened maybe a day or
two before,
was when Dick Cheney, who was in
charge of

07:44.431 --> 07:49.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the search process, actually
announced that
he was going to be -- he didn't
announce it,

07:49.102 --> 07:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it became clear he was going
to be the
vice presidential nominee that
year.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you think about it --
for H.W. Bush
-- when you think about it now
-- I mean,

07:57.777 --> 08:01.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for George W. Bush -- when you
think about
it now, you realize this is
crazy and this

08:01.581 --> 08:06.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is unusual and everything about
this campaign
has been unusual, but the vice
presidential

08:06.119 --> 08:08.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pick process always is.

08:08.088 --> 08:11.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the bottom
line is reporters
have to be very careful at a
moment like this.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Very, very careful.

08:14.294 --> 08:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We woke up this morning and we
heard that
Mike Pence was leading the
possibilities.

08:18.732 --> 08:23.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then that grew for a while,
and then the
Trump people sprayed some water
on it. And

08:23.837 --> 08:28.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are a million different
theories I have
seen today. I personally,
especially given

08:28.942 --> 08:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way this campaign has been,
want to watch
Donald Trump walk out himself
and say the

08:34.047 --> 08:35.815 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
words.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think we all
do. All right,
Gwen, who will be doing
"Washington Week"

08:38.718 --> 08:40.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from there tomorrow night,
thanks.

08:40.320 --> 08:44.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Yes, we will have a
special hour-long
show. Looking forward to it.

08:44.090 --> 08:48.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From possible
running mates
to party rules, there is a lot
to unpack.

08:48.628 --> 08:55.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm joined now by Lisa
Desjardins in Cleveland,
NPR political editor Domenico
Montanaro, and

08:55.402 --> 08:59.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" regular presidential
historian
Michael Beschloss.

08:59.372 --> 09:02.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you
back to the
program.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa, I'm going to come to you
in just a moment
to talk about the rules
committee, but first

09:05.779 --> 09:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to turn to Domenico on
the latest on
the vice presidential pick by
Donald Trump.

09:10.984 --> 09:14.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been up and down all day,
as Gwen said.
What are you learning?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO, Political
Editor, NPR:
Yes.

09:16.489 --> 09:20.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Gwen is talking about, we all
want to see
it come out of Donald Trump's
mouth, because

09:20.960 --> 09:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if there's anything we know,
that this campaign
wants to surprise us. Donald
Trump had said

09:26.399 --> 09:29.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he wants to surprise us. We
know that,
by 11:00 a.m. Tomorrow, we're
supposed the

09:29.702 --> 09:34.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to hear in New York. All the
signs are pointing
to Mike Pence. The biggest
signal is that

09:34.541 --> 09:38.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was left off the speakers
list at the Republican
National Convention.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what is important about that
is because
Chris Christie and Newt
Gingrich, who are

09:41.948 --> 09:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other two finalists, were on
that speakers
list, but, of course, all of us
sit there

09:45.652 --> 09:49.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and say, is that head fake, is
that real?
Everybody is starting to look
toward Pence.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will see if it's real.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael
Beschloss, you have
written about so many of these
-- of course,

09:54.260 --> 09:58.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you have written about
presidents and their
choice of vice presidents. What
does this

09:58.932 --> 10:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tell us about the nominee, the
candidate?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
I think the first thing it's
going to tell

10:02.602 --> 10:07.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us, as we have always been
asking this question,
after this convention, is this
going to be

10:07.440 --> 10:12.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of a change in Donald
Trump's persona,
in which he becomes more of a
traditional

10:12.145 --> 10:14.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidate or is he going to
remain himself?

10:14.814 --> 10:20.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think if it's Mike Pence,
probably the
answer is that this is a sop to
those who

10:20.520 --> 10:26.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are saying you should choose a
vice president
in a more traditional way. From
everybody

10:26.092 --> 10:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we hear, if he chose who to
spend an evening
with of the three finalists, the
three presumed

10:31.464 --> 10:37.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finalists, Gingrich and Christie
and Pence,
probably wouldn't be Pence, but
this is someone

10:37.070 --> 10:40.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who probably has the least risk
for this ticket,
the least unpredictable.

10:40.840 --> 10:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly
back to you,
Domenico.

10:44.077 --> 10:48.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What would -- given what we have
watched unfold
from Donald Trump during this
campaign, what

10:48.615 --> 10:50.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
would Mike Pence bring?

10:50.617 --> 10:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Well, you're
a couple
of days away from the Republican
Convention

10:55.355 --> 10:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
starting, and he needs to unify
that party.

10:57.390 --> 11:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, Lisa is out there
covering the rules
committee and that got kind of
messy today.

11:01.494 --> 11:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he needs to be able to shore
up the conservative
base. I think Michael is exactly
right. If

11:06.132 --> 11:10.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you were to choose to have
dinner with somebody,
it probably wouldn't be Pence,
an Indiana

11:10.036 --> 11:12.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
governor, somebody he doesn't
know very well.

11:12.272 --> 11:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He likes Chris Christie. He
likes -- seems
to like Newt Gingrich very well.
They seem

11:16.776 --> 11:23.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to echo his personality. But the
safe pick
is a pick like Pence, in the
sense that the

11:23.416 --> 11:28.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most important thing in a vice
presidential
announcement is do no harm in a
vice presidential

11:28.788 --> 11:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pick, because we have seen
people create all
kinds of problems for the top of
the ticket.

11:33.927 --> 11:38.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But most people vote for the top
of the ticket.
They don't vote for the vice
president. The

11:38.865 --> 11:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last time that you could really
tangibly point
to a vice president actually
bringing some

11:43.503 --> 11:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
geography on is probably LBJ
being picked
by JFK back in 1960.

11:50.109 --> 11:53.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael, just
quickly to you.
How much does the pick matter,
traditionally?

11:54.013 --> 11:57.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Well, it
doesn't matter
usually. Domenico is absolutely
right.

11:57.717 --> 12:02.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you had to just count
electoral votes,
you have to go all the way back
to LBJ in

12:02.288 --> 12:08.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1960 and say, he brought Texas,
a couple of
Deep South states Kennedy
wouldn't otherwise

12:08.127 --> 12:09.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have won.

12:09.929 --> 12:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, 1992, Bill Clinton decided
to choose
Al Gore, against a lot of
advice, Tennessee,

12:15.368 --> 12:18.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another Southerner, another
moderate, also
young.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: He felt that
that would
double a lot of messages that he
wanted to

12:22.342 --> 12:24.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
send.

12:24.143 --> 12:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that, I think you can say,
helped that
ticket to get elected, but hard
to quantify

12:28.014 --> 12:29.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it in terms of numbers.

12:29.983 --> 12:33.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
you are there
in Cleveland. You have been
watching the goings-on

12:33.486 --> 12:37.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the convention. The Rules
Committee has
been meeting. This, I guess, is
another way

12:37.557 --> 12:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of learning something about the
nominee, isn't
it?

12:39.959 --> 12:41.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Oh, Judy, it's
fascinating.

12:41.861 --> 12:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are actual decisions being
made that
will affect the party for years
to come. And

12:45.932 --> 12:51.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today what I saw in person was
the crash of
the many tectonic plates of this
party today.

12:51.804 --> 12:56.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw the rules committee have
to stop for
four hours before they even got
started, had

12:56.909 --> 13:02.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go behind closed doors,
supposedly for
a printer error, but it was
really about problems

13:02.949 --> 13:09.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between conservatives, Ted
Cruz's camp, also
the anti-Trump camp that's
hoping to use the

13:09.088 --> 13:12.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rules process to derail Donald
Trump next
week.

13:12.525 --> 13:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Add to that to the mix the RNC.
Their officials
were another side, and the Trump
campaign.

13:17.096 --> 13:21.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you have these four sides
coming together,
each trying to protect their own
territory.

13:21.868 --> 13:28.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Judy, I just came from
there. Those negotiations
completely collapsed. And I
think the takeaway

13:28.041 --> 13:32.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
here today is that the
grassroots movement
of the Republican Party, the
ones that do

13:32.912 --> 13:38.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not trust Washington and do not
trust the
RNC, they seem to have had some
losses today.

13:38.518 --> 13:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One vote that just happened, a
big one, there
was a move to try and ban
lobbyists from being

13:43.022 --> 13:49.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of the RNC. That failed.
That was a major
test vote. That shows the RNC's
strength.

13:49.796 --> 13:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, his campaign sort
of staying
arm's length from that, but
they're hoping

13:54.400 --> 14:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that that bodes well for them as
they try
to go to a convention and they
want the least

14:00.473 --> 14:02.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rebellion possible.

14:02.275 --> 14:05.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, Judy, there is enough
people here
who want to derail Donald Trump
that I think

14:05.812 --> 14:09.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're still going to hear their
voices on
the floor next week, but it's
just not clear

14:09.315 --> 14:11.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
how much.

14:11.150 --> 14:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Domenico,
listening to
you -- and I want to come back
to Lisa -- why

14:14.921 --> 14:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does it matter to Donald Trump
what comes
out of the rules committee right
now?

14:18.558 --> 14:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Well, I
don't think it
matters so much what necessarily
comes out

14:23.262 --> 14:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the rules committee, you
know, in a procedural
way, but what they really want
to do and need

14:28.067 --> 14:34.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do here is to pacify some of
the anti-Trump
rebellion that could take place.

14:34.774 --> 14:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last thing that Reince
Priebus, the chairman
of the Republican Party, or
anybody else on

14:39.378 --> 14:44.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump campaign wants right
now is any
show of disunity on the floor of
the convention.

14:44.984 --> 14:46.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what they're trying to
avoid.

14:46.786 --> 14:51.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Michael,
looking at this
through the lens of history,
relationships

14:51.224 --> 14:56.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the party and the
nominee have varied
from election to election. How
much does it

14:56.929 --> 15:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matter to Donald Trump that he
has the RNC
and the grassroots of the party,
which in

15:02.101 --> 15:04.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this case are two different
things, with him?

15:04.103 --> 15:05.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Totally
matters.

15:05.872 --> 15:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were talking about this rules
committee.
That excuse that there was a
printer error

15:10.209 --> 15:14.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that stalled the meeting, it
sounded like
something out of the old Soviet
Union, the

15:14.747 --> 15:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of excuse that used to be
given.

15:16.916 --> 15:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the point is that if there's
even the
remotest danger that these
pledged delegates

15:21.921 --> 15:26.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will become liberated, there is
a history
of that. In 1980, Ted Kennedy
came to New

15:26.325 --> 15:30.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York with Jimmy Carter, who was
president,
didn't have enough delegates.
So, he tried

15:30.363 --> 15:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get a rule passed that all
pledges were
-- could be broken, and in that
case he might

15:35.902 --> 15:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to beat Jimmy Carter,
who was not
running well in the polls.

15:39.205 --> 15:44.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they don't want anything, the
Trump people,
to happen that's spontaneous.
But the final

15:44.710 --> 15:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point is that Donald Trump will
be totally
affected by the image that
Americans take

15:50.716 --> 15:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away of this convention at the
end of next
week. If it's a positive image,
it's going

15:55.087 --> 15:56.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to help a lot.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If it looks as if it's
disorganized, people
will blame him.

15:58.691 --> 16:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa, on another
front, the
Trump campaign -- there has been
a lot of,

16:02.895 --> 16:08.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess, consternation, you
might say, among
Republicans about why it's taken
so long for

16:08.334 --> 16:11.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us to learn who's speaking at
the convention.

16:11.270 --> 16:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Trump campaign did put out a
partial list
today. What did we learn from
that?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we got a lot from it. I
think there
will still be more speakers
ahead, but, Judy,

16:20.379 --> 16:24.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this wasn't the list that Donald
Trump sort
of told us to expect. This
wasn't celebrities

16:24.951 --> 16:29.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sports figures. By and
large, these were
actual -- mostly, the biggest
group were lawmakers,

16:29.589 --> 16:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
current lawmakers, including
House Speaker
Paul Ryan and Senate Majority
Leader Mitch

16:34.727 --> 16:36.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
McConnell.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We knew that those names would
be on there,
but also some important
senators, like Shelley

16:38.698 --> 16:43.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moore Capito of swing state West
Virginia,
Florida's Governor Rick Scott,
oh, another

16:43.769 --> 16:50.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
swing state, I wonder why. And I
also paid
attention especially to there's
a few businessmen.

16:50.343 --> 16:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The manager of Trump's own
winery is going
to be speaking, as well as, for
example, the

16:55.514 --> 16:59.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
owner of a casino, those kinds
of voices.
But I think we do see some
themes in here

16:59.852 --> 17:05.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well. It looks like Donald
Trump is going
to open this convention talking
about security.

17:05.625 --> 17:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said just a few days ago,
"I'm the law
and order candidate."

17:08.361 --> 17:12.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they're going to play
that up a lot.
And then, also, with these
businesses, probably

17:12.932 --> 17:16.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk about jobs. I think, Judy,
all these
things kind of come together,
what we're talking

17:16.903 --> 17:21.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, the vice president, the
rules. This
idea that the conservatives and
the Republican

17:21.240 --> 17:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party are very hungry for some
red meat, whether
it's in the direction of the
party or in their

17:25.444 --> 17:27.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
candidate or in the vice
presidential candidate.

17:28.014 --> 17:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Pence, if he's the nominee,
fills that
goal. But he also, some
Democrats are telling

17:33.085 --> 17:39.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me today, gives them something,
because he
is very staunch abortion. He is
against gay

17:39.091 --> 17:40.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rights.

17:40.893 --> 17:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while he appeals to many
Republicans,
he sort of creates this bigger
divide perhaps

17:45.932 --> 17:51.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we get into November. And I
think Donald
Trump seems to be doing a lot of
things here

17:51.504 --> 17:54.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in all of these ways for
conservative at this
convention.

17:54.440 --> 17:59.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So many questions
answered
today, but other questions
certainly still

17:59.645 --> 18:01.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there.

18:01.480 --> 18:06.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins, Domenico
Montanaro, Michael
Beschloss, thank you, all three.
And we look

18:06.152 --> 18:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forward to spending much more
time with you
next week.

18:09.622 --> 18:14.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Absolutely.

18:14.060 --> 18:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Thank you.
Look forward
to it.

18:25.905 --> 18:33.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to Venezuela,
where what's
been an economic crisis is
leading to social

18:33.879 --> 18:38.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and political upheaval, in a
country once
flush with oil money.

18:38.284 --> 18:43.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In partnership with the Pulitzer
Center on
Crisis Reporting, videographer
Bruno Federico

18:43.489 --> 18:48.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and special correspondent Nadja
Drost brings
us this report from Caracas.

18:48.194 --> 18:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Dr. Dili Gonzalez
walks into
what is left of her hospital in
Caracas. The

18:54.266 --> 18:59.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
28-year-old physician is one of
the few doctors
left here, as Venezuela falls
deeper into

18:59.305 --> 19:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
collapse, its health care system
in shambles.

19:02.274 --> 19:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We aren't supposed to be here.
We film with
a hidden camera. The ceilings
leak, vital

19:08.147 --> 19:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
equipment broken, with no spare
parts, patients
in deep need with few doctors
attending.

19:13.853 --> 19:17.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DILI GONZALEZ, Venezuela
(through translator):
These gloves aren't sterile. You
can't operate

19:17.623 --> 19:19.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with them. There's nothing here.

19:19.492 --> 19:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Heat flows into the
morgue. Water
shortages have made the bathing
areas putrid.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This hospital is falling apart.

19:26.832 --> 19:30.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DILI GONZALEZ (through
translator): I
would say we have a humanitarian
crisis. There

19:30.836 --> 19:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are no medications. You can't
get antibiotics
There were eight operating
rooms. Now three

19:35.741 --> 19:41.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or four function, with
difficulty. One thing
gets fixed, another breaks.
We're in bad shape.

19:41.514 --> 19:45.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Gonzalez says
doctors have to
send patients out to scrounge
for everything

19:45.885 --> 19:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from ibuprofen to chemotherapy
agents. The
doctors have to improvise with
what little

19:50.823 --> 19:52.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they have.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DILI GONZALEZ (through
translator): We're
responding to medical situations
as though

19:55.161 --> 19:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are in a war. This is not
Syria. We are
in Venezuela.

19:58.264 --> 20:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NADJA DROST: This is Venezuela
now.

20:00.866 --> 20:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DILI GONZALEZ (through
translator): We
used to be the middle class. Now
we're lower

20:05.404 --> 20:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
class. Everyone is lower class,
because no
one has the economic capacity to
go to the

20:10.209 --> 20:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supermarket and buy everything
they need,
pay the rent, or pay for the
condominium,

20:15.281 --> 20:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pay utilities, with what they
earn.

20:17.149 --> 20:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Gonzalez and her
husband, also
a doctor, share a small
one-bedroom apartment,

20:21.754 --> 20:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and can't make ends meet with
their monthly
salary.

20:24.623 --> 20:28.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DILI GONZALEZ (through
translator): I
earn 30,000 bolivares a month,
which are about

20:28.727 --> 20:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$30. For the apartment, we pay
90,000 bolivares
in monthly rent.

20:33.399 --> 20:40.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Even so, they are
some of the
lucky ones; 10:00 a.m. on a
weekday morning,

20:40.106 --> 20:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hundreds wait to buy food, in
shopping lines
that have become a symbol of
Venezuela's economic

20:44.977 --> 20:46.779 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crisis.

20:46.812 --> 20:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're here in a middle-class
neighborhood,
but most of the people in this
line come from

20:51.450 --> 20:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poor neighborhoods from all
across the city,
because they can't find food at
subsidized

20:56.489 --> 21:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prices in their neighborhoods.
So they have
come here to this supermarket,
lining up throughout

21:01.827 --> 21:05.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the night, in the hopes that
when they can
finally enter, they might come
out with a

21:05.731 --> 21:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bag of rice and a carton of
milk.

21:08.300 --> 21:13.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Over a decade ago, the
government of former
President Hugo Chavez introduced
price controls

21:13.405 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on certain basic goods, to make
them more
accessible to the poor, offering
them at almost

21:17.810 --> 21:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
token prices. Now, with so
little to go around,
goods are rationed.

21:23.082 --> 21:27.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After having been in line since
midnight,
Sandra Romero Maya leaves the
supermarket.

21:27.419 --> 21:32.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDRA ROMERO MAYA, Venezuela
(through translator):
I want to eat a steak, because I
can't anymore.

21:32.124 --> 21:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do I have for food? What
you see here,
for 15 days, a week? Do you
think that eight

21:37.263 --> 21:39.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people can get by on this?

21:39.698 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Venezuela hardly
produces anything
besides oil, importing almost
all goods thanks

21:46.372 --> 21:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to revenue from petroleum sales.
But the deep
drop in oil prices, along with
what critics

21:51.844 --> 21:56.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say is government mismanagement,
have helped
drive triple-digit inflation,
the highest

21:56.682 --> 22:00.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the world, and has reduced
the ability
to import goods.

22:00.553 --> 22:05.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Products from car parts to corn
flour are
difficult to get. The scarcity
has created

22:05.758 --> 22:11.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a huge black market. In the
Petare neighborhood,
contraband vendors called
bachaqueros display

22:11.564 --> 22:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their wares, goods purchased at
regulated
prices, and resold for much
more. These vendors

22:17.903 --> 22:21.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are illegal, and we're advised
to use a hidden
camera to avoid getting
attacked.

22:21.874 --> 22:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the black market contributes
to the scarcity
of regulated goods.

22:26.545 --> 22:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDRY VELOZ, Venezuela (through
translator):
I leave at 4:00 or 5:00 in the
morning to

22:30.182 --> 22:33.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go line up, and I return at 5:00
in the evening
night without anything.

22:33.619 --> 22:38.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Andry Veloz, a
frustrated mother,
says it's a rare day she returns
with anything

22:38.924 --> 22:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the shopping line to the
shantytown where
she lives with her husband and
three children.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sometimes, they eat just once a
day.

22:46.632 --> 22:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and her husband blame the
shortage of
subsidized goods on the black
market bachaqueros.

22:51.003 --> 22:54.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEO GUERRERO, Venezuela (through
translator):
These people, who like to rise
at dawn to

22:54.340 --> 22:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to buy everything and
resell it. All
of it expensive.

22:57.476 --> 23:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Butter costs 500
bolivares, and
they sell it for 2,000. That's
about $2 on

23:03.916 --> 23:10.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the black market, or three days'
work at minimum
wage. Soaring prices and scarce
supply has

23:11.023 --> 23:16.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led to looting of stores. Trucks
are often
attacked. Venezuelans are at the
edge, and

23:16.929 --> 23:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many increasingly blame the
government for
the crisis they are living.

23:25.170 --> 23:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Nicolas Maduro,
Chavez's chosen
successor, says it's an economic
war waged

23:30.609 --> 23:37.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by foreigners and businessmen
hoarding supplies
to drive up prices and
destabilize the government.

23:37.383 --> 23:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tania Diaz is a member of
Congress in Maduro's
party.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TANIA DIAZ, Venezuela Congress
Member (through
translator): They have managed
to create a

23:44.556 --> 23:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
huge distribution mafia. And
they block consumers'
access to products, and increase
prices along

23:50.863 --> 23:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way. This is simply a war
economy.

23:53.632 --> 23:58.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: Many of the
government's supporters
are the poor, who have benefited
most from

23:58.304 --> 24:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the social programs rolled out
under Chavez's
administration.

24:02.441 --> 24:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three years after his death,
Chavez's legacy
lives on for many of his
supporters, called

24:08.147 --> 24:15.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chavistas, his face adorning
billboards and
murals throughout Caracas.
Chavistas feel

24:15.220 --> 24:19.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their revolution has been
unfairly covered
by the international press.

24:19.258 --> 24:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to overcome their
wariness before
they bring us to a Chavista
collective, trying

24:24.096 --> 24:29.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to hold out the crisis by
growing their own
food. Tucked under a metro line,
this is one

24:29.435 --> 24:35.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of several community gardens the
government
is supporting to help alleviate
food shortages.

24:35.874 --> 24:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Jose Pacheco, the garden's
coordinator,
the government has made
mistakes, but that

24:40.846 --> 24:44.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't deter him from believing
in Chavismo,
Chavez's brand of socialism.

24:44.817 --> 24:49.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE PACHECO, Venezuela (through
translator):
I will tell you something. No
revolution in

24:49.088 --> 24:53.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history has been easy. We're in
a tough spot.
But we're not going to go over
to the right

24:53.692 --> 24:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because of that. They don't
guarantee us anything.

24:56.695 --> 24:59.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Margarita Lopez
Maya is a political
analyst.

24:59.164 --> 25:02.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARITA LOPEZ MAYA, Political
Analyst: What
is happening? Chavismo is being
reduced to

25:02.968 --> 25:09.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its core, to its hardest core,
and there is
a portion, a significant portion
of Venezuelans

25:09.274 --> 25:17.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that are disenchanted by
Chavismo at this
moment, but still haven't done
the steps to

25:17.516 --> 25:19.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go to the opposition.

25:19.284 --> 25:23.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: But more and more
Venezuelans
are turning against the
government, lining

25:23.856 --> 25:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up last month to add their names
to a petition,
led by the opposition, for a
referendum to

25:29.194 --> 25:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
oust Maduro. Government
supporters call it
a coup attempt.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): They
want to turn
our country over to the United
States.

25:37.870 --> 25:43.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: With a political
crisis and the
economy in freefall, law and
order have broken

25:43.976 --> 25:50.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down. Violence racks Caracas,
now the most
murderous city in the world. As
sun sets,

25:50.649 --> 25:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much of the city goes quiet.
Going out could
mean becoming the latest victim
of robbery

25:55.254 --> 25:57.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or kidnapping.

25:57.189 --> 26:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): At
2:00 in the morning,
I was sleeping in my room. My
telephone rang

26:01.827 --> 26:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it was my son. He said to
me, "Papa, I'm
kidnapped. I will put the
kidnapper on."

26:06.899 --> 26:11.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: It was a
year-and-a-half ago
when the kidnappers told this
man, whose identity

26:11.136 --> 26:17.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we agreed to hide, that he had
until morning
to gather a ransom of $35,000
for the release

26:17.042 --> 26:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his son, who was put in a car
with his
captors, circling Caracas
throughout the night.

26:22.781 --> 26:26.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kidnapping is big business in
Caracas, and
we wanted to speak to someone
who does it.

26:26.618 --> 26:31.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A trusted colleague led us to a
kidnapper
who calls himself El Negro. With
the help

26:31.356 --> 26:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 50 gang members in his
kidnapping ring,
he studies and stalks a person
for weeks if

26:36.929 --> 26:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they look like they have money
to determine
if they are worth grabbing.

26:43.469 --> 26:46.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Someone like you," he says to
me.

26:46.805 --> 26:48.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Once a person is kidnapped,
things move quickly.

26:48.974 --> 26:52.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EL NEGRO, Kidnapper (through
translator):
You communicate with the family.
And if the

26:52.711 --> 26:57.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family doesn't comply, we have
to pressure
them. There's various ways. You
can cut a

26:57.449 --> 27:02.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finger and send it with a note.
Or you leave
a note at the door of their
house.

27:02.087 --> 27:06.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the family doesn't comply
within 48 hours,
we look for a way to eliminate
the person

27:06.758 --> 27:08.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or release them.

27:08.427 --> 27:11.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: The father we spoke
with was
dealing with different
kidnappers than El

27:11.463 --> 27:16.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Negro's gang, and they agreed to
release his
son for the $6,000 he had
managed to gather.

27:16.802 --> 27:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): As I
was driving
down, the kidnapper told me, "If
you come

27:21.039 --> 27:24.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across a police checkpoint,
don't worry, because
we're the same people."

27:24.810 --> 27:29.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: El Negro says the
police turn
a blind eye to his operations,
for a price.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EL NEGRO (through translator):
It's a business
more than anything. It's the
same authorities

27:33.852 --> 27:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from whom we buy weapons.

27:35.621 --> 27:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Kidnappings are
rarely reported,
and there are no official
statistics. But

27:39.658 --> 27:44.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a recent study estimating
their number
has quintupled this year, they
show no sign

27:44.496 --> 27:46.231 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of slowing down.

27:46.265 --> 27:50.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): In the
end, I think
the economic situation and lack
of money,

27:50.736 --> 27:54.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impunity, and the lack of
vigilance are the
most important factors driving
this wave of

27:54.806 --> 27:56.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kidnapping.

27:56.575 --> 27:59.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: After his son was
released, he
finished his studies within the
year and,

27:59.645 --> 28:04.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like so many others who could,
left Venezuela.

28:05.017 --> 28:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of Dr. Dili Gonzalez's
friends and colleagues
have gone, too. Despite the
crime, the food

28:10.856 --> 28:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shortages, and challenges of
getting by every
day, she's determined to stay to
serve her

28:16.261 --> 28:17.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patients.

28:17.996 --> 28:20.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DILI GONZALEZ (through
translator): I'm
one of those who think, no, I'm
not going

28:20.332 --> 28:24.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to move out of the country. I'm
going to fight
until the end, until I can't
anymore.

28:24.303 --> 28:33.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: For the "PBS
NewsHour," reporting
with Bruno Federico, I'm Nadja
Drost in Caracas.

28:33.478 --> 28:42.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

28:42.754 --> 28:47.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
small African
country mounts a robust fight
against the

28:47.526 --> 28:49.394 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AIDS epidemic.

28:49.428 --> 28:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: how some American
companies are
requiring workers to sign
contracts that limit

28:55.434 --> 28:57.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
career mobility.

28:57.269 --> 29:01.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While they are not well-known,
companies can
use these contracts to prevent
an employee

29:01.506 --> 29:06.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from working for a competitor.
Lawmakers are
worried that it's gone too far
and they are

29:06.745 --> 29:11.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trying to weaken or even
outright ban them.
In fact, the Massachusetts State
Senate today

29:11.750 --> 29:14.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debated its own bill to limit
them.

29:14.419 --> 29:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But many say these agreements
are not likely
to go away.

29:17.823 --> 29:22.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Duarte
Geraldino has
the story for our series Making
Sense, which

29:22.928 --> 29:24.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
airs Thursdays.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: In a small
industrial park
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, the
Allure lampshade

29:28.800 --> 29:30.502 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
factory.

29:30.535 --> 29:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK VAN WETTERING, Allure
Shades: We take
pride in that fact that
everything is made

29:33.238 --> 29:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in America, the metal, the
frame, the lining,
the trimming. And our stickers
are made in

29:39.277 --> 29:40.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the USA too.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:41.546 --> 29:43.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Everything is
made in the
USA.

29:43.181 --> 29:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK VAN WETTERING: Exactly.

29:44.983 --> 29:47.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Mark Van
Wettering has been
making lampshades since he was a
teenager,

29:47.152 --> 29:51.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opened his own business in 2007,
just before
the start of the great
recession.

29:51.223 --> 29:57.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK VAN WETTERING: I had to do
a bankruptcy,
a Chapter 13, to get my stuff in
order, and

29:57.462 --> 30:03.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lost my home, but I held onto
this business.
And I bet everything on myself
and on the

30:03.235 --> 30:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
company, that we would succeed.

30:05.103 --> 30:08.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: To boost his
odds, he thought
about having his employees sign
a non-compete

30:08.306 --> 30:12.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contract, which would have
prevented them
from quitting to go work at any
one of his

30:12.878 --> 30:14.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
three local rivals.

30:14.713 --> 30:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK VAN WETTERING: I saw a
lawyer. I had
it drawn up. I couldn't find it
in me to bring

30:19.985 --> 30:26.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it to the table and have my
employees sign
it. If someone feels that they
have a better

30:26.091 --> 30:27.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunity somewhere else, I'm
all for it.

30:27.926 --> 30:33.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But nearly 40
percent of
all American workers have at
some point signed

30:33.899 --> 30:40.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a non-compete contract,
including one out
of every six workers earning
less than $40,000

30:40.205 --> 30:46.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a year, some of them much less,
like Genoveva
Ochoa, a Central American
immigrant who speaks

30:46.812 --> 30:52.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
practically no English, and yet
knows the
phrase non-compete.

30:52.751 --> 30:58.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ochoa came to the U.S. five
years ago and
almost immediately went to work
at Allure.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GENOVEVA OCHOA, Allure (through
translator):
I learned everything here.

31:01.159 --> 31:05.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But two years
ago, she says
her husband convinced her to
join him at nearby

31:05.831 --> 31:11.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Canterbury Lampshades, which
offered her 50
cents more an hour, but also
made her sign

31:11.303 --> 31:13.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a non-compete contract.

31:13.105 --> 31:17.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GENOVEVA OCHOA (through
translator): They
called me into the office and
said, here are

31:17.876 --> 31:22.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the papers you need to sign, and
if you don't
sign, you don't get the job.

31:22.547 --> 31:27.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: She signed.
But she says
Canterbury failed to give her
full-time hours,

31:27.486 --> 31:33.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so she quit and returned to
Allure. Canterbury
has since sued both Ochoa and
Van Wettering

31:33.492 --> 31:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for violating the non-compete
agreement.

31:36.027 --> 31:41.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GENOVEVA OCHOA (through
translator): This
is so unfair. Forcing people to
sign these

31:41.600 --> 31:46.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
papers, it's like cutting off
our hands, because
we can't work anywhere else.

31:46.304 --> 31:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Ochoa offered
to resign
from Allure. Van Wettering
wouldn't hear of

31:50.609 --> 31:53.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it. Instead, he filed a
countersuit.

31:53.678 --> 31:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the record, Canterbury
declined our interview
request.

31:56.448 --> 32:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK VAN WETTERING: First of
all, we hired
her originally. We taught her
the skills that

32:01.153 --> 32:06.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she has. I can't believe that
there will be
a judge somewhere in the state
of Florida

32:06.258 --> 32:11.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who would agree with my
competitor that a
person making $9 or less...

32:11.163 --> 32:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Nine dollars
or less?

32:13.131 --> 32:19.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK VAN WETTERING: Yes,
assembling lampshades
is now subject to a non-compete
clause.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Believe it,
says his lawyer,
Jonathan Pollard.

32:21.606 --> 32:25.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN POLLARD, Attorney: This
degree of
absurdity is unique to Florida.

32:25.710 --> 32:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: If there's a
judge anywhere
who might enforce Canterbury's
contract, says

32:30.182 --> 32:34.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pollard, that judge is probably
in Florida,
one of the more pro-business
states.

32:34.953 --> 32:39.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN POLLARD: Non-compete
law is a creature
of state law. On one end of the
spectrum,

32:39.124 --> 32:42.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have California, where
employee non-compete
agreements are unenforceable.
And on another

32:42.994 --> 32:46.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
end of the spectrum, you have
Florida, where
they are highly enforceable.

32:46.798 --> 32:51.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Of course,
even in Florida,
most non-compete contracts are
reserved for

32:51.703 --> 32:54.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
higher-level employees who have
access to
trade secrets.

32:54.806 --> 32:59.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUSSELL BECK, Attorney: Recipes
for cookies,
profit margins, customer lists.

32:59.211 --> 33:02.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DUARTE GERALDINO: And as
attorney Russell
Beck, who writes an influential
blog, points

33:02.981 --> 33:04.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out:

33:04.716 --> 33:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUSSELL BECK: Billions of
dollars of trade
secrets are stolen on an annual
basis, and

33:07.752 --> 33:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there needs to be some mechanism
for protecting
them.

33:10.288 --> 33:14.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Several
studies suggest
theft of trade secrets robs the
U.S. economy

33:14.626 --> 33:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of some $300 to $500 billion a
year. Headlines
warn of larcenous employees
looking to lift

33:21.867 --> 33:24.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot more than paper clips.

33:24.069 --> 33:30.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No wonder non-compete contracts
have proliferated,
popping up in some surprising
sectors of American

33:30.075 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

33:31.910 --> 33:34.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The way they made it very
clear to us
from the beginning is that we
were volunteer

33:34.279 --> 33:36.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
providers. We are not employees
of the company.

33:36.314 --> 33:41.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: And yet, in
the paperwork
that you signed, you had to sign
a non-compete?

33:41.920 --> 33:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OMAR SAID, Florida: We did.

33:44.122 --> 33:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAMARIS SAID, Florida: Can you
get the drinks,
honey?

33:47.392 --> 33:49.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Omar and
Damaris Said are
foster parents, licensed by
Florida to care

33:49.394 --> 33:50.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for special-needs children.

33:50.962 --> 33:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OMAR SAID: They have autism,
bipolar, intellectual
disability.

33:55.233 --> 34:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMARIS SAID: Some of them have
all three.
A lot of times, the children who
have these

34:00.272 --> 34:05.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behaviors are in institutions.
And the state
wants to step them down into
group homes,

34:06.011 --> 34:12.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but we need people that are
willing to open
up and do this type of service.

34:12.484 --> 34:16.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: In 2012, the
Saids signed
a detailed contract with a
private company

34:16.454 --> 34:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called LifeShare to take David
and Cyrus (ph)
into their home.

34:20.292 --> 34:25.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LifeShare would train and
supervise the Saids,
and also give them a portion of
what the state

34:25.063 --> 34:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paid for the boys' care. The
Saids agreed
to provide a long list of
services.

34:29.701 --> 34:35.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
OMAR SAID: This is not
baby-sitting. This
is a therapeutic setting. We are
constantly

34:35.740 --> 34:40.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
taking data, annotating
behaviors, looking
at trends, graphing that
information. We have

34:40.578 --> 34:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
therapists coming in and out. We
have doctors'
appointments.

34:42.881 --> 34:47.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Cyrus, now 17,
had been
in an institution.

34:47.352 --> 34:52.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYRUS, Florida: Here, it's a lot
more better.
They care about you. They don't
let other

34:52.791 --> 34:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people hurt you. But other
places, they didn't
do that.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Did they hurt
you?

34:56.127 --> 34:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CYRUS: Yes, sometimes. They let
the boys hurt
me.

34:59.597 --> 35:04.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: What did they
do?

35:04.202 --> 35:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CYRUS: Punch me, kick me. One of
them tries
to break my arm.

35:10.275 --> 35:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAMARIS SAID: OK, and so whoever
wins, what
do we say? Good game, good job.

35:15.680 --> 35:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: This level of
foster care
can be physically and
emotionally challenging.

35:20.051 --> 35:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMARIS SAID: Yes, I have gotten
punched in
the face. He's gotten bitten.
He's gotten

35:23.355 --> 35:25.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nose broken.

35:25.190 --> 35:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OMAR SAID: We don't take it
personal. This
is a challenge that they were
born with. It's

35:28.426 --> 35:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our job to help them manage it.

35:30.295 --> 35:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But according
to the contract,
the response to violent
outbursts was to dial

35:35.100 --> 35:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
911, then a LifeShare hot line
and wait for
a call back.

35:39.771 --> 35:44.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LifeShare wouldn't comment, but
the Saids
say the company often told them
to lock themselves

35:44.476 --> 35:46.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in their bedroom.

35:46.311 --> 35:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OMAR SAID: What happens if he
gets into glass
or into some of the kitchenware,
or rips the

35:50.415 --> 35:52.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TV from the wall and injures
themselves?

35:52.517 --> 35:57.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMARIS SAID: So, we were
getting hurt. The
boys were getting hurt. And we
would call

35:57.655 --> 36:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cops, and then the cops
would say, if
you don't know how to control
them, then these

36:00.592 --> 36:03.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boys do not have any business
being here in
your home.

36:03.161 --> 36:07.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Fearing they
would lose
Cyrus and David, the Saids
decided to terminate

36:07.599 --> 36:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the contract with LifeShare and
deal directly
with the state, which was urging
a more hands-on

36:12.704 --> 36:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach. They say LifeShare
immediately invoked
the non-compete clause,
withholding their

36:17.876 --> 36:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
monthly stipend, and demanding
they either
give up the boys, or pay $20,000
to keep them.

36:22.814 --> 36:29.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAMARIS SAID: I love every
single one of them.
And we feel that these kids do
not deserve

36:29.254 --> 36:31.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to have a price tag.

36:31.056 --> 36:34.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OMAR SAID: We just wanted to
walk away and
continue doing the work that we
feel we have

36:34.059 --> 36:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been called to do. LifeShare
wouldn't have
that.

36:37.162 --> 36:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Jonathan
Pollard represents
the Saids in what has now turned
into complex

36:41.366 --> 36:43.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
litigation.

36:43.168 --> 36:45.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN POLLARD: LifeShare is
saying: We
have a non-compete agreement.
Those children

36:45.937 --> 36:47.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are basically our property.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: How is that
possible?

36:49.707 --> 36:56.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN POLLARD: There is
nothing to stop
anyone from putting together a
non-compete

36:56.214 --> 36:58.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
agreement for anything.

36:58.083 --> 37:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: In part,
that's why a national
movement against non-competes is
picking up

37:02.153 --> 37:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steam. The White House and U.S.
Treasury are
investigating, as nine states
look to restrict

37:07.292 --> 37:10.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their use and five want to ban
them altogether.

37:10.195 --> 37:15.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Non-compete contracts are
increasingly unenforceable,
but employers keep asking
workers to sign

37:15.867 --> 37:21.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these contracts. For example, in
California,
workers sign non-compete
contracts at a higher

37:21.106 --> 37:27.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate than most Americans, and
yet in that
state, these contracts carry
almost no legal

37:27.212 --> 37:27.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weight.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So what then is their purpose?

37:29.781 --> 37:35.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN POLLARD: Those
agreements are just
restricting competition and
employee mobility,

37:35.820 --> 37:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which means, you can pay your
folks less money
and have a better bottom line at
the end of

37:41.726 --> 37:43.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the day. That's what it's about.
It's greed.

37:43.561 --> 37:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RUSSELL BECK: There are
definitely companies
that use these agreements as a
retention tool.

37:48.399 --> 37:52.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's not what they are
designed for, and
companies shouldn't be doing
that.

37:52.237 --> 37:56.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But, to be
clear, you believe
that there is a place in the
future of the

37:56.107 --> 37:58.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American work force for these
non-competes?

37:58.943 --> 38:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUSSELL BECK: Absolutely. They
just can't
be abused.

38:01.846 --> 38:06.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: That's the
struggle for
policy-makers. Non-competes can
promote innovation

38:06.284 --> 38:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and entrepreneurship, but they
also have the
potential to act like economic
nooses around

38:11.122 --> 38:13.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the necks of workers, and even
competing businesses.

38:13.725 --> 38:18.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK VAN WETTERING: I want to
compete, but
I want to compete on a fair
playing field.

38:18.763 --> 38:27.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: In Fort
Lauderdale, Duarte
Geraldino for "PBS NewsHour."

38:27.972 --> 38:39.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now our series
The End of AIDS
turns from America's epidemic to
the one in

38:39.150 --> 38:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sub-Saharan Africa. That's where
the virus
first emerged, and it remains
the hardest-hit

38:44.556 --> 38:49.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
region, with an estimated 70
percent of all
HIV infections worldwide.

38:49.794 --> 38:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The small nation of Rwanda,
which many learned
about decades ago because of a
genocide there,

38:55.099 --> 39:00.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has now mounted one of the most
impressive
HIV/AIDS responses in the world.

39:00.905 --> 39:05.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Correspondent William Brangham
and producer
Jason Kane continue our series,
with support

39:05.376 --> 39:08.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the Pulitzer Center on
Crisis Reporting.

39:08.413 --> 39:14.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At this
hospital in a remote
northern area of Rwanda, a small
medical miracle

39:14.385 --> 39:19.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is unfolding. This district,
still in the
grips of an HIV epidemic, has
not recorded

39:19.791 --> 39:25.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a single case of mother-to-child
HIV transmissions
for three years.

39:25.330 --> 39:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Similar progress has been
happening throughout
Rwanda, outpacing many other
places in the

39:29.601 --> 39:31.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
world, even many in the U.S.

39:31.436 --> 39:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sat down with local leaders.
We sat down
with the Ministry of Health team
of supervisors.

39:39.310 --> 39:46.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We discussed, how can we make --
how can we
do better, just to have zero
case?

39:46.150 --> 39:52.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Jean Nepo Utumatwishima says
they did
it with a creative mix of
medicine, technology

39:52.724 --> 39:55.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and what you might call
aggressive neighborliness

39:55.126 --> 40:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JEAN NEPO UTUMATWISHIMA,
Rwanda: Rwandans,
they tend to hear much to their
peers, to

40:01.599 --> 40:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the people they live with.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You listen to
who you know.

40:04.402 --> 40:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JEAN NEPO UTUMATWISHIMA: You
listen to
who you know, and sometimes to
who you share

40:09.140 --> 40:10.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the situation.

40:10.942 --> 40:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: To achieve
this success,
a fleet of influential women
were recruited

40:14.612 --> 40:19.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from local villages, and these
women visited
every pregnant woman in their
area to make

40:19.284 --> 40:23.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure each one was educated and
tested for
HIV.

40:23.154 --> 40:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If untreated, an HIV-positive
woman will often
pass the virus to her baby at
birth, or through

40:28.359 --> 40:34.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
breast-feeding, but HIV
treatment can stop
that. Using simple texting, the
workers transmit

40:34.299 --> 40:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
results and information to the
local health
center, which then relays it to
the main hospital.

40:39.003 --> 40:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JEAN NEPO UTUMATWISHIMA:
When the SMS
reaches the central server, it
goes directly

40:45.109 --> 40:47.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to these computers.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr.
Utumatwishima says working
with infected pregnant women who
are so consistently

40:49.480 --> 40:54.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving birth to babies free of
the virus has
been a huge source of pride for
the nation's

40:54.218 --> 40:55.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care providers.

40:56.020 --> 41:00.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JEAN NEPO UTUMATWISHIMA: We
need a generation
of kids who will never blame us,
who will

41:00.658 --> 41:02.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
never blame the country.

41:02.460 --> 41:07.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's a
remarkable success
for a country many learned about
through tragedy.

41:07.732 --> 41:15.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1994, one of the two main
ethnic groups
in Rwanda, the Hutus, turned on
their neighbor

41:15.340 --> 41:20.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tutsis and slaughtered hundreds
of thousands
of them, often killing them with
machetes.

41:20.511 --> 41:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Millions more were displaced.

41:23.981 --> 41:27.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government agencies, including
much of the
nation's health infrastructure,
were left

41:27.285 --> 41:31.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in shambles, a ripe opening for
HIV.

41:31.389 --> 41:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jon Cohen has covered the
HIV/AIDS epidemic
for more than 25 years for
"Science" magazine,

41:36.461 --> 41:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and he traveled with us for this
series.

41:38.296 --> 41:41.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN, "Science": When I was
here in 2000,
they were trying to restart an
AIDS program

41:41.666 --> 41:43.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that had been completely
destroyed.

41:43.067 --> 41:45.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So they had a
good program
prior to the genocide?

41:45.503 --> 41:50.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN: They had one of the
leading programs
in sub-Saharan Africa in the
early 1990s.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was all destroyed.

41:52.076 --> 41:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Destroyed at
the very moment
HIV rates were spiking
throughout the region.

41:57.715 --> 42:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SABIN NSANZIMANA, Rwanda
Biomedical Center:
Everything was completely down,
so it has

42:01.085 --> 42:02.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be built from zero.

42:02.887 --> 42:07.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Sabin
Nsanzimana was
in medical school during the
rebuilding. He

42:07.425 --> 42:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says he hated going to the AIDS
wards, because
all his training felt useless,
the death so

42:12.397 --> 42:14.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
overwhelming.

42:14.198 --> 42:20.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SABIN NSANZIMANA: Could not
do anything
to help them. What you could do
only was to

42:20.905 --> 42:23.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see people suffering without any
help.

42:23.441 --> 42:28.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Nsanzimana
is now leading
his nation's HIV/AIDS response,
and he says

42:28.913 --> 42:30.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
everything has changed.

42:30.715 --> 42:36.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, health officials say 86
percent of
HIV-positive Rwandans know their
status, that

42:36.788 --> 42:42.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
80 percent of those have started
treatment,
and 82 percent of those have now
have fully

42:42.527 --> 42:46.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suppressed the virus, making
them far less
likely to infect others.

42:46.164 --> 42:51.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hitting 90 percent in each of
those categories
is what global health experts
say will be

42:51.102 --> 42:58.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a major step towards ending the
epidemic,
and Rwanda is almost there. Of
course, the

42:58.743 --> 43:03.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
success of Rwanda's effort
relies in large
part on people actually adhering
to their

43:03.047 --> 43:05.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
treatment plans.

43:05.183 --> 43:10.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Josiane Mukanyandwi is
HIV-positive, but she's
alive and well, and the virus is
undetectable

43:11.022 --> 43:15.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in her blood. That's what
prevented her young
son, Prince, from getting
infected when he

43:15.193 --> 43:20.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was born. But that diligence
isn't easy. It
involves long treks to the
clinic, time she

43:20.765 --> 43:26.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has to take off work. She's got
checkups and
treatment, long stretches of
waiting and counseling,,

43:26.337 --> 43:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
managing her meds, all of this
even though
Mukanyandwi feels perfectly
fine.

43:31.542 --> 43:36.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSIANE MUKANYANDWI, Rwanda
(through translator):
It took one month to accept my
status. I talked

43:36.881 --> 43:41.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with my family, my parents, and
I decided
to come. Now I'm coming every
month, and there

43:41.619 --> 43:43.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is not a problem.

43:43.454 --> 43:47.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As Josiane
leaves, a long
line of moms follow through the
clinic. They're

43:47.925 --> 43:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all HIV-positive, their babies
all negative.

43:51.028 --> 43:57.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SABIN NSANZIMANA: Now it's
time where
we can say, no more loss,
shouldn't lose any

43:57.502 --> 44:06.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other life anymore, because this
country will
be only be rebuilt by its own
people.

44:06.444 --> 44:10.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
mother-to-child HIV
transmission rate has fallen so
sharply in

44:10.114 --> 44:13.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rwanda that, when the rare
transmission does
occur...

44:13.184 --> 44:15.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: She refused initially to
start on treatment.

44:15.987 --> 44:19.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: ... health
officials conduct
a forensic examination of each
case to see

44:19.891 --> 44:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why it happened and how to
prevent it next
time.

44:22.493 --> 44:26.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SABIN NSANZIMANA: We still
have new infections.
We still have people dying
because of AIDS.

44:26.497 --> 44:32.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we still have children who
are getting
HIV from their mothers, so we
shouldn't sleep.

44:32.803 --> 44:37.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jon Cohen says
that, in
the aftermath of Rwanda's
genocide, the nation

44:37.542 --> 44:39.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
built an even stronger HIV
response.

44:39.710 --> 44:46.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN: They had a chance to
rebuild from
the bottom up and to build a
sturdy structure

44:46.717 --> 44:51.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of a health response,
and they're
starting to see the payoff of
that.

44:51.355 --> 44:53.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So they seized
an opportunity.

44:53.224 --> 44:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN: Yes. I hate to be
Pollyannish about
any of this stuff. It's hard to
sustain this

44:58.763 --> 45:03.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of response they have
today, and the
place they want to go to next is
really difficult

45:03.834 --> 45:05.603 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to get to.

45:05.636 --> 45:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The last and
most difficult
steps to end the epidemic
involve finding

45:08.372 --> 45:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who don't know they're
infected, as
well as helping those who are on
medication

45:12.710 --> 45:15.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stay the course.

45:15.112 --> 45:19.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: When they give me pills,
I started
to refuse.

45:19.417 --> 45:23.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: These young
people, part
of a local support group, are
all HIV-positive.

45:23.788 --> 45:29.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were infected at birth by
the virus that
has also made most of them
orphans. Most say

45:29.260 --> 45:33.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they didn't learn their status
until they
developed AIDS as kids, and
nearly died.

45:33.564 --> 45:38.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Like me, the first time I
know it,
I -- I want to kill myself.

45:38.469 --> 45:43.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Compared to
adults, adolescents
are twice as likely to skip
their meds, take

45:43.274 --> 45:45.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them incorrectly, or stop
treatment altogether.

45:45.843 --> 45:50.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This can hurt their own health,
and make them
more likely to infect others.
So, keeping

45:50.348 --> 45:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these young people consistently
on treatment
is a crucial goal for the
country.

45:53.584 --> 45:56.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It was a hard task for me
to take my
pills.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why?

45:58.155 --> 46:02.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: For the first thing, I
would go off,
play, and then forget the good
time of taking

46:02.960 --> 46:04.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
medicine.

46:04.862 --> 46:06.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Eighteen-year-old Jean-Paul
-- that's not his real name --
is one of those

46:06.697 --> 46:08.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who needs help.

46:08.532 --> 46:12.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: You're going to, like, need
someone to,
like, remind you. You're going
to need a parent

46:12.069 --> 46:14.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or a family member or a
relative.

46:14.805 --> 46:19.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Like all these
young people,
Jean-Paul has been paired with
another young

46:19.210 --> 46:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man from the group, Alexis
Nshimiyimana. Alexis
is older than Jean-Paul. He's
also HIV-positive,

46:25.149 --> 46:31.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he's been more consistent
with his meds.
His job now is to help Jean-Paul
do the same.

46:31.822 --> 46:34.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two hang out. They swap
stories. They
commiserate.

46:34.525 --> 46:40.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXIS NSHIMIYIMANA, Rwanda: He
asks some
things. What can I do? I say,
this is your

46:40.765 --> 46:45.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life. It is not mine. You know?
You may take
medicine in order to live.

46:45.803 --> 46:50.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: They're talking from
experience, so we're
open to them. He told me, this
is what you're

46:50.875 --> 46:55.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to do. You're going to
change your time
that you used to take your drugs
to a time

46:55.146 --> 46:57.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is not going to be an
obstacle to you.

46:57.782 --> 47:02.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But there are
logistical
obstacles as well. His mom and
dad are both

47:02.119 --> 47:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dead. He splits his time between
his aunt's
house and an uncle's across
town. Jean-Paul

47:07.291 --> 47:10.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still misses pills now and then,
he said.
But he's trying.

47:10.361 --> 47:13.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a lot of difficult things
to deal with
for someone your age.

47:13.864 --> 47:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: That's part of life.

47:15.666 --> 47:19.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Part of life
for an entire
nation as well, one that's
striving to keep

47:19.503 --> 47:22.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up its newfound progress against
this epidemic.

47:22.707 --> 47:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Kigali, Rwanda.

47:26.410 --> 47:28.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some remarkable
reporting.

47:28.946 --> 47:33.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, tomorrow, our team reports
on an innovative
treatment program that's
happening on a remote

47:33.918 --> 47:42.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
island in Eastern Kenya, and how
they have
figured out how to reach
fishermen there.

47:42.526 --> 47:55.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

47:55.206 --> 47:57.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

47:57.141 --> 48:03.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Carolina's Tim Scott is
the only black
Republican in the United States
Senate. Yesterday,

48:03.247 --> 48:08.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott took to the Senate floor
to speak about
his experiences of being
scrutinized by law

48:08.252 --> 48:10.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enforcement because of the color
of his skin.

48:10.821 --> 48:12.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here is an excerpt:

48:12.723 --> 48:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TIM SCOTT (R), South
Carolina: For those
who don't know, there are a few
ways to identify

48:16.794 --> 48:18.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a member of Congress or Senate.

48:18.696 --> 48:24.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, typically, when you have
been here for
a couple of years, the law
enforcement officers

48:24.335 --> 48:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get to know your face, and they
just identify
you by face. But, if that
doesn't happen,

48:30.274 --> 48:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you have a badge, a your
license that
you can show them, shows you're
a senator,

48:35.780 --> 48:41.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or this really cool pin. I
oftentimes say
that the House pin is larger
because our egos

48:41.919 --> 48:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are bigger, so we need a smaller
pin.

48:44.855 --> 48:55.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's easy to identify a U.S.
senator by
our pin. I recall walking into
an office building

48:55.466 --> 48:59.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just last year after being here
for five years
on the Capitol.

48:59.670 --> 49:08.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the officer looked at me
with a little
attitude and said: "The pin, I
know. You,

49:09.013 --> 49:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't. Show me your I.D."

49:10.948 --> 49:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will tell you, I was thinking
to myself,
either he thinks I'm committing
a crime, impersonating

49:20.891 --> 49:25.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a member of Congress, or -- or
what?

49:25.296 --> 49:32.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I will tell you that,
later that evening,
I received a phone call from his
supervisor

49:32.770 --> 49:37.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
apologizing for the behavior.

49:37.141 --> 49:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. President, that is at least
the third
phone call that I have received
from a supervisor

49:45.983 --> 49:49.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or the chief of police since I
have been in
the Senate.

49:49.453 --> 49:54.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was U.S.
Senator Tim Scott
of South Carolina.

49:54.325 --> 49:59.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We continue the conversation
about race and
policing online, not just a
black and white

49:59.430 --> 50:05.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue. Activists are calling for
greater exposure
of police shootings of Latinos.
Read more

50:05.135 --> 50:11.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about five more Americans shot
by police last
week whose deaths didn't garner
much media

50:11.742 --> 50:12.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

50:12.877 --> 50:17.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:17.381 --> 50:19.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now updating two major
stories.

50:19.350 --> 50:25.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A scene of horror has unfolded
in Southern
France tonight. Officials in
Nice report 60

50:25.723 --> 50:31.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed, 100 hurt when a truck
plowed into
a crowd watching fireworks for
Bastille Day.

50:31.962 --> 50:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amateur video captured people
running for
their lives. Witnesses and local
officials

50:37.034 --> 50:43.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called it an attack and said the
driver also
shot at the crowd before being
shot dead himself.

50:43.641 --> 50:47.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, a spokesman at
the White House
says President Obama has been
informed of

50:47.578 --> 50:49.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the situation.

50:49.380 --> 50:53.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the night's other big
story, it is
being widely reported that
Republican Donald

50:53.751 --> 50:58.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has asked Indiana Governor
Mike Pence
to be his running mate, and that
Pence has

50:58.422 --> 51:03.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accepted. The Trump campaign
says only that
the announcement will come
tomorrow morning

51:03.460 --> 51:05.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in New York.

51:05.195 --> 51:08.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a reminder that, next week,
I will be
joining Gwen and the rest of our
"NewsHour"

51:08.599 --> 51:13.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team in Cleveland for four days
of special
coverage at the Republican
National Convention.

51:13.837 --> 51:15.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's how to watch.

51:15.506 --> 51:21.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: With so much at stake,
you need
election coverage you can trust.
That's why

51:21.812 --> 51:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the "PBS NewsHour" has teamed up
with NPR
to bring you prime-time coverage
of the conventions.

51:27.718 --> 51:32.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
joined by
NPR's Rachel Martin for
balanced, in-depth

51:32.856 --> 51:35.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reporting you won't find
anywhere else.

51:35.926 --> 51:41.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us for live coverage of the
Republican
National Convention, begins
Monday, July 18,

51:41.498 --> 51:45.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

PBS and NPR
stations.

51:45.135 --> 51:47.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we hope you
will join us.

51:47.938 --> 51:51.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy
Woodruff.

51:51.208 --> 51:55.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
