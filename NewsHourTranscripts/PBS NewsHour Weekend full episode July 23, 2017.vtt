>> IT WAS A COMBINATION OF

07:05.366 --> 07:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS.

07:06.466 --> 07:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INITIALLY SPEAKER RYAN AND THE

CONCERNING AMERICAN BUSINESSES,

07:17.766 --> 07:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF OIL AND GAS COMPANIES

07:18.766 --> 07:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOBBIED AGAINST THESE MEASURES,

07:20.466 --> 07:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARGUING THEY WOULD UNDERCUT

07:21.500 --> 07:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

USERS THAT WAY.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS CERTAINLY PART OF THEIR

19:43.766 --> 19:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTENTION AND I THINK IT ALSO

19:45.100 --> 19:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATED A KIND OF PSYCHOLOGICAL

19:46.733 --> 19:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPACT.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

USERS... I MEAN, THEY DON'T USE

19:55.800 --> 19:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR REAL NAMES, BUT IF THEY'RE

BUYING OR SELLING PRODUCTS,

19:58.600 --> 19:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE PHYSICAL PRODUCTS HAVE TO

GO SOMEPLACE IN THE REAL WORLD,

20:01.433 --> 20:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE A MAILING ADDRESS, RIGHT?

20:02.666 --> 20:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU'RE BUYING DRUGS, YOU

20:03.833 --> 20:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHYSICALLY HAVE TO GET CONTROL

20:04.766 --> 20:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF IT.

20:05.833 --> 20:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THAT MEAN THAT NOW THE

POLICE OR THE DIFFERENT

20:08.133 --> 20:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

GOT YOUR ADDRESS.

20:10.733 --> 20:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DRUGS ON THE DARK WEB, YOU

20:14.866 --> 20:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENCRYPT YOUR ADDRESS AND THEN

20:16.300 --> 20:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SEND THAT ENCRYPTED ADDRESS

20:17.533 --> 20:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE SELLER OF THE DRUGS, SO

20:18.833 --> 20:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ONLY THE HE OR SHE CAN

20:19.900 --> 20:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECRYPT IT AND SEE YOUR ACTUAL

WHERE YOU LIVE.

20:23.033 --> 20:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT LOTS OF USERS ARE CARELESS.

20:24.900 --> 20:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WOULD SAY A MAJORITY OF USERS,

FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN ON DARK WEB

20:28.200 --> 20:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:35.100 --> 20:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO HAVE A

20:36.233 --> 20:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIG IMPACT, BUT THIS IS AN

20:37.266 --> 20:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:43.433 --> 20:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

20:44.666 --> 20:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:00.900 --> 21:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE ARE ADDICTED TO DRUGS AND

21:03.000 --> 21:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:04.966 --> 21:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:06.600 --> 21:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:12.100 --> 21:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:17.400 --> 21:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:30.933 --> 21:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO THE SITE IN 2014.

21:38.600 --> 21:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS THE FIRST CLUE THAT

21:39.966 --> 21:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOWED AUTHORITIES TO START

21:41.266 --> 21:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRACING HIM BACK TO HIS HOME

21:42.400 --> 21:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THAILAND, ARREST HIM.

21:43.466 --> 21:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE ACTUALLY COMMITTED SUICIDE IN

THE THAI JAIL.

21:46.366 --> 21:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IN THAT CASE, IT DOESN'T

21:47.833 --> 21:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEM THAT THERE WAS ANY KIND OF

21:49.133 --> 21:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOUR BREAK THAT WAS NECESSARY.

21:51.833 --> 21:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN OTHER CASES, IT DOES

21:53.033 --> 21:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEM THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS

21:54.533 --> 21:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROKEN TOR.

21:55.633 --> 21:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EACH TIME, TOR USUALLY FIGURES

21:57.100 --> 21:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT WHAT WENT WRONG AND

21:58.533 --> 21:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
