GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.

00:06.039 --> 00:06.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:08.742 --> 00:11.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
For more than half-a-century,
the sight of

00:11.478 --> 00:15.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a U.S. president here in Havana
would have
been unimaginable.

00:15.782 --> 00:21.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Moving to defuse
decades of hostility,
President Obama meets with Cuban
President

00:21.855 --> 00:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Raul Castro in a historic trip
to the communist
island.

00:25.893 --> 00:31.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead:
foreign policy
in focus. Candidates lay out
their vision

00:31.164 --> 00:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the United States in the
world ahead of
tomorrow's presidential
primaries.

00:35.569 --> 00:42.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And a rare look deep
in Colombia's
jungles, as FARC rebels emerge
after decades

00:42.409 --> 00:44.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of war and hiding.

00:44.311 --> 00:47.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BORIS, FARC (through
translator): We're preparing
ourselves here for political
battle, to get

00:47.848 --> 00:51.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ready for a new environment. We
will pick
up cameras and drop our arms.

00:51.752 --> 00:59.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:00.027 --> 01:02.963 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:02.996 --> 01:13.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The end of one
era, the beginning
of another. President Obama held
direct talks

01:14.007 --> 01:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today with the leader of Cuba in
his capital
city. And they took questions,
something the

01:19.880 --> 01:25.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
communist government rarely
allows.

01:25.552 --> 01:31.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a moment that made
history, "The Star-Spangled
Banner" played for an American
president in

01:31.558 --> 01:38.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the heart of Havana. Mr. Obama
stood side
by side with Cuban President
Raul Castro in

01:38.398 --> 01:42.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the city no U.S. leader had
visited in 88
years.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, they emerged from a
private meeting
to describe their summit.

01:46.573 --> 01:50.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
For more than half-a-century,
the sight of

01:50.110 --> 01:59.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a U.S. president here in Havana
would have
been unimaginable. But this is a
new day.

02:00.020 --> 02:02.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Es un nuevo dia.

02:02.856 --> 02:09.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAUL CASTRO, Cuban President
(through translator):
Today, I reaffirm that we should
exercise

02:09.796 --> 02:15.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the art of civilized
coexistence, which involves
accepting and respecting
differences and preventing

02:15.535 --> 02:18.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these from becoming the center
of our relationship.

02:18.138 --> 02:22.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the issue of
human rights
quickly interjected itself.

02:22.976 --> 02:29.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CNN reporter Jim Acosta, a
Cuban-American,
apparently struck a nerve when
he asked Castro

02:29.850 --> 02:31.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about political prisoners.

02:31.952 --> 02:38.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAUL CASTRO (through
translator): Give me
of can give me a list of the
political prisoners,

02:38.225 --> 02:43.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and I will release them
immediately. Just
mention a list. If we have those
political

02:43.163 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prisoners, they will be released
before tonight
ends.

02:45.899 --> 02:54.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In fact,
yesterday, just hours
ahead of Mr. Obama's arrival,
Cuban officials

02:54.541 --> 03:01.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
detained dozens of dissidents.
Back at today's
briefing, President Obama
acknowledged differences

03:01.548 --> 03:06.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the issue, but said he
believes a constructive
dialogue is possible.

03:06.186 --> 03:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: As I think we both
indicated,
we had a very frank conversation
around issues

03:12.359 --> 03:18.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of democracy and human rights.
Our starting
point is that we have two
different systems.

03:18.765 --> 03:24.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as is true with countries
around the world
where we have normalized
relations, we will

03:24.104 --> 03:30.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continue to stand up for basic
principles
that we believe in.

03:30.243 --> 03:35.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Obama visit
is the product
of more than a year of work to
thaw relations.

03:35.482 --> 03:41.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During that time, embassies in
both countries
have reopened, with some
economic and trade

03:41.521 --> 03:43.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
barriers lifted.

03:43.356 --> 03:48.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Already, there's been an influx
of American
tourists and business interests
to the island

03:48.595 --> 03:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation. Coinciding with the
trip, Mr. Obama
announced Google will work to
expand Internet

03:54.568 --> 03:59.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coverage in Cuba, and he met
with American
and Cuban entrepreneurs.

03:59.806 --> 04:06.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separately, American hotel chain
Starwood
said it will begin operating in
Havana soon.

04:06.713 --> 04:12.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But referring to the commercial
opening, President
Castro said today it's not
enough, and he

04:12.119 --> 04:18.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pointed again to the decades-old
U.S. trade
embargo on Cuba, which Congress
has refused

04:18.492 --> 04:20.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to abolish.

04:20.393 --> 04:24.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAUL CASTRO (through
translator): Much more
could be done if the U.S.
blockade were lifted.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most recent measures adopted
by the Obama
administration are positive, but
insufficient.

04:28.869 --> 04:35.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The blockade remains enforced,
and it contains
discouraging elements and
intimidating effects

04:35.175 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and extraterritorial outreach.

04:36.977 --> 04:42.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Castro also
called again for
the U.S. to return the
Guantanamo Naval Base

04:42.082 --> 04:45.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
site to Cuban control.

04:45.152 --> 04:50.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite such disagreements,
there were also
gestures of goodwill. President
Obama laid

04:50.123 --> 04:57.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a wreath this morning at a
memorial for Cuban
independence hero Jose Marti.
And on Sunday,

04:57.797 --> 05:04.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
despite a steady rain, the first
family toured
old Havana, as hundreds of
people looked on.

05:04.304 --> 05:09.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): It
was very emotional,
very emotional. It was good. We
Cubans here,

05:09.943 --> 05:14.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as always, are happy and joyful
to receive
him. May this all be for good,
retaining our

05:14.915 --> 05:16.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
full identity.

05:16.716 --> 05:20.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLARISA PEREZ, Cuba (through
translator):
I don't disagree with his coming
to the island,

05:20.887 --> 05:25.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, well, what I want is that
changes be
for the benefit of the Cuban
people, because

05:25.926 --> 05:30.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are going through a difficult
economic
time here. There is no milk. We
are mistreated.

05:30.297 --> 05:34.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
plans to meet
with opposition figures tomorrow
before a

05:34.901 --> 05:41.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
baseball game between the Cuban
national team
and Major League Baseball's
Tampa Bay Rays.

05:41.841 --> 05:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will get a report from the
scene in Havana,
and analyze the Obama visit,
after the news

05:47.948 --> 05:49.749 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: Europe's
deal with Turkey to stem the
flow of migrants

05:52.786 --> 05:59.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and begin returning thousands
showed no sign
today of taking effect just yet.
Nearly 50,000

05:59.125 --> 06:02.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, many from Syria, are now
stranded
in Greece.

06:02.929 --> 06:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Greek Prime Minister Alexis
Tsipras said
he needs logistical help to
process and return

06:08.868 --> 06:10.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new arrivals.

06:10.704 --> 06:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greek Prime
Minister (through
translator): We have ahead of us
a hill to

06:15.542 --> 06:20.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climb because the implementation
of that agreement
will not be an easy matter. I
think that we

06:21.014 --> 06:25.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
avoided the worst. If there
wasn't an agreement
and cooperation with Turkey, we
would have

06:25.986 --> 06:29.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
found ourselves facing a domino,
one-sided
conclusion.

06:29.089 --> 06:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Turkish monitors
arrived on some
Greek islands today. France,
Germany and the

06:34.327 --> 06:36.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Netherlands have also pledged to
help.

06:36.763 --> 06:41.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The hunt is on in
Turkey for
three suspects believed to be
planning more

06:41.568 --> 06:47.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suicide attacks in the name of
the Islamic
State. It follows a weekend
bombing that killed

06:47.240 --> 06:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four people in Istanbul's
busiest pedestrian
shopping street. Funerals for
the dead began

06:53.280 --> 06:58.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. Three of those killed
were Israeli.
Two held dual citizenship with
the U.S., and

06:58.985 --> 07:00.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the fourth was Iranian.

07:00.787 --> 07:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Russia's prime
minister today
ordered officials to look into
tougher flight

07:05.091 --> 07:12.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
safety rules after a deadly
crash. All 62
people aboard died Saturday when
a FlyDubai

07:12.365 --> 07:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airliner went down in Southern
Russia as it
tried to land in strong winds.
Since then,

07:18.204 --> 07:23.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
search crews have combed the
snow-covered
wreckage for clues. Russian
officials say

07:23.076 --> 07:27.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the black box recorders were
badly damaged,
but they have been able to
recover some data.

07:27.514 --> 07:32.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. military
now confirms
that American Marines have
established a small

07:32.752 --> 07:38.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
artillery base in Northern Iraq.
It's the
first time since U.S. forces
returned to Iraq

07:38.491 --> 07:40.393 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2014.

07:40.427 --> 07:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Saturday, a Marine was killed
at the base
near Makhmour by Islamic State
rocket fire.

07:46.966 --> 07:50.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a U.S. spokesman said today
it is not
a combat mission.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
COL. STEVE WARREN, U.S.
Spokesman for Operation
Against ISIS: What they're there
to do is

07:52.839 --> 08:01.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simply shoot back if somebody
shoots at them
or at the forces in Makhmour.
So, they won't

08:01.748 --> 08:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of go off and conduct any
type of mission
on their own. They don't really
have that

08:06.286 --> 08:07.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
capability anyway.

08:08.021 --> 08:12.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The colonel says
the Marine
base was fired on again today,
but no one

08:12.392 --> 08:14.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was hurt.

08:14.294 --> 08:17.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, a new fight
over drawing congressional
districts for political

08:17.897 --> 08:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gain went before the U.S.
Supreme Court, at
issue, whether Virginia
lawmakers illegally

08:23.269 --> 08:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
packed black voters into one
district to help
Republican candidates in
neighboring districts.

08:28.708 --> 08:34.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vacancy on the Supreme Court
means a 4-to-4
tie would uphold a lower court
ruling against

08:34.514 --> 08:36.316 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those districts.

08:36.349 --> 08:41.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The two largest
daily fantasy
sports Web sites in the U.S.
will, for now,

08:41.521 --> 08:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stop taking bets in New York
state. DraftKings
and FanDuel reached agreement
today with the

08:47.293 --> 08:51.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state attorney general. They're
going to let
the New York state legislature
resolve their

08:51.531 --> 08:55.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
legal dispute. At issue is
whether the sites
promote gambling.

08:55.935 --> 09:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: New England braced
today for a
spring snowstorm that mostly
failed to deliver.

09:01.875 --> 09:06.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Forecasts had called for up to a
foot of snow
in places. Instead, about six
inches fell

09:06.379 --> 09:11.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
across much of Eastern
Massachusetts, Rhode
Island and Northeastern
Connecticut. Boston

09:11.418 --> 09:17.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw only three inches, but they
still closed
schools. Boston's had about 30
inches of snow

09:17.757 --> 09:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this winter, after getting 100
inches last
year.

09:20.360 --> 09:24.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street
opened the week
with a fairly quiet day. The Dow
Jones industrial

09:25.031 --> 09:33.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average gained 21 points to
close near 17624.
The Nasdaq rose 13 points, and
the S&amp;P 500

09:33.640 --> 09:35.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
added two.

09:35.442 --> 09:41.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a new era
of U.S.-Cuba relations;
presidential candidates

09:41.080 --> 09:47.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
make their case to the
pro-Israel lobby; Colombian
rebels emerge from the jungle in
hopes of

09:47.187 --> 09:56.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
peace; and much more.

09:57.030 --> 10:06.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now we turn to the
view from the
ground in Cuba during this
historic visit.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It comes from the BBC's Laura
Trevelyan, who
is reporting from Havana
tonight.

10:10.877 --> 10:15.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Laura, how has the U.S.
president been
received on the ground there?

10:15.248 --> 10:20.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA TREVELYAN, BBC: Well,
Gwen, by the young
20-something Cubans who I have
been talking

10:20.787 --> 10:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to, with tremendous excitement.

10:24.057 --> 10:30.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As one young Afro-Cuban said to
me: "Obama
is change. That's what he
represents."

10:30.396 --> 10:35.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the young Cubans that I have
been talking
to have been very struck by the
difference

10:35.401 --> 10:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between what they see as the
young American
president and, of course, their
own president,

10:41.107 --> 10:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Raul Castro, who is in his 80s.
So there is
a sense that his visit
represents a new era,

10:48.147 --> 10:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people feel that this is a
new beginning
that, after almost 60 years of a
hostile relationship

10:53.186 --> 10:58.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a superpower just 90 miles
away from
here, that now this is exciting,
that there

10:58.791 --> 11:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are endless possibilities for
young people
to study.

11:01.461 --> 11:06.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a generational
change there,
too, Gwen. And I think, for
parents of these

11:06.366 --> 11:11.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
20-somethings, this is a
difficult moment
for them, because they have
grown up with

11:11.237 --> 11:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a one-party state, with the
system as it is,
and they wonder what the change
will bring.

11:15.742 --> 11:21.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But what is the
practical effect
of the hope and the change that
you're talking

11:21.347 --> 11:26.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about? When we saw two
presidents side by
side today, there was clearly --
there are

11:26.219 --> 11:30.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
clearly wide areas of
disagreement between
them that are not just
generational.

11:30.056 --> 11:31.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAURA TREVELYAN: Absolutely.

11:31.791 --> 11:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the practical effects
of change
is that, for example, there are
cranes up

11:35.929 --> 11:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all over Havana. Some of the
hotels which
were playgrounds for wealthy
Americans in

11:40.967 --> 11:46.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the 1950s are now being
refurbished, because,
of course, for so many Caribbean
items, tourism

11:46.973 --> 11:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a lifeline, particularly
American tourism.

11:48.808 --> 11:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it could be the same for
Cuba, especially
with 110 direct flights a day
due to be coming

11:55.481 --> 11:59.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here from later in the year. So,
I have been
talking to Cubans who, for
example, for the

11:59.385 --> 12:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last year have been able to rent
out their
homes through Airbnb, that
American service

12:05.091 --> 12:07.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Internet where you let
out your homes
to people.

12:07.727 --> 12:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Cubans for years have been
letting out
their rooms. They call it casas
particulares,

12:11.464 --> 12:18.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but now it's on the Web. Here in
Havana, there
2,500 homes that are being
rented out on Airbnb.

12:18.371 --> 12:23.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people are so pleased to
have the extra
money, because the average Cuban
wage is about

12:23.610 --> 12:25.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
25 U.S. dollars a month.

12:25.445 --> 12:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Through Airbnb, the average
amount you get
from a stay is $250. So, there
is a huge change

12:31.684 --> 12:35.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for people who regularly
complain that they
just do not have enough money to
live on.

12:35.888 --> 12:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Yet, when the two
presidents talk
about -- admit that they have --
still have

12:39.659 --> 12:45.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
profound differences between the
two nations,
does that trickle down at all to
ordinary

12:45.765 --> 12:46.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Cubans?

12:46.666 --> 12:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURA TREVELYAN: Well, most
certainly.

12:48.601 --> 12:55.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As someone who's lived in
America 12 years,
coming here to Havana, Cuba,
what strikes

12:55.441 --> 13:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you is that this is a one-party
state, that
broadcasting is
state-controlled.

13:00.313 --> 13:05.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, this morning,
on morning
television, there was respectful
TV coverage

13:05.518 --> 13:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Obama visit, pictures of
the Obama
girls under an umbrella,
pictures of Michelle

13:10.957 --> 13:13.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coming down from Air Force One.

13:13.526 --> 13:17.664 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
But the tone is
state-controlled. And it was
made clear in the coverage that
Guantanamo

13:17.697 --> 13:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bay is something that will be
raised. And
then, of course, related to that
is the fact

13:21.668 --> 13:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there isn't freedom of
information here,
because the Internet service is
terrible.

13:26.639 --> 13:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the changes that Raul
Castro has introduced,
is there is more public Wi-Fi in
public parks,

13:32.311 --> 13:37.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but Cubans have to pay for it.
And the young
Cubans that I have been speaking
to, their

13:37.450 --> 13:41.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
biggest wish is that the
Internet service
could be better, so that they
could be online,

13:41.821 --> 13:45.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so they can use Facebook, they
can use Twitter,
they can use e-mail.

13:45.224 --> 13:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They just feel that their lives
are so restricted.
As one young Cuban said to me,
"Knowledge

13:49.862 --> 13:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is power, and without the
Internet, we can't
have the information we need to
make choices

13:54.333 --> 13:55.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about our lives."

13:55.868 --> 13:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's something,
watching change
happen right before our eyes.

13:58.504 --> 14:03.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Laura Trevelyan reporting for
the BBC and
for us from Havana tonight,
thank you.

14:03.476 --> 14:09.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we turn to
analysis of
today's historic meeting in
Havana and of

14:09.148 --> 14:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president's trip to Cuba.

14:11.184 --> 14:17.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, I'm joined by Maria de
Los Angeles
Torres, director of the
Inter-University Program

14:17.123 --> 14:22.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Latino Research and a
professor at the
University of Illinois, Chicago.
And Roger

14:22.862 --> 14:28.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Noriega of the American
Enterprise Institute.
He's a former assistant
secretary of state

14:28.534 --> 14:32.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Western Hemisphere affairs
in the George
W. Bush administration.

14:32.839 --> 14:35.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we welcome you both.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Roger Noriega, to you first.

14:36.609 --> 14:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's your impression so far of
how this
trip is going?

14:39.445 --> 14:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA, Former U.S.
Assistant Secretary
of State: Well, it was a little
clumsy today,

14:42.315 --> 14:45.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think, the very awkward press
conference.

14:45.585 --> 14:53.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I can understand the
excitement of the
Cuban people that was described
by your previous

14:53.192 --> 14:57.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guest. You know, there is
something sort of
exotic about Cuba. People
haven't been able

14:57.663 --> 15:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to travel there in a long time.
It's a tropical
island. It has a shortages of
fish and tropical

15:03.369 --> 15:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fruit. Something clearly is
wrong there.

15:06.873 --> 15:12.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, on the other hand, the
people aren't
that different than people
anywhere. And they

15:12.044 --> 15:19.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- you know, why would anybody
choose to be
in a dictatorship? Why wouldn't
they choose

15:19.285 --> 15:26.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
democracy? Because the
government has a totalitarian
hold on every aspect of their
lives.

15:26.492 --> 15:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that worries me, because the
government,
in the final analysis, will have
the say of

15:30.863 --> 15:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether the economic opening
achieves any
sort of meaningful change or
whether the people

15:37.870 --> 15:39.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are going to be left
disappointed.

15:39.305 --> 15:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maria Torres,
what's your sense
of the trip so far?

15:41.340 --> 15:44.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA DE LOS ANGELES TORRES,
University of
Illinois at Chicago: Well, for
not only for

15:44.243 --> 15:48.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cubans on the island, but I
think for Cubans
like myself that came to the
United States

15:48.414 --> 15:52.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as young children, this has been
very moving.

15:52.618 --> 15:58.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is historic, even though
that is a
very overused word when we speak
about Cuba.

15:59.025 --> 16:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would like to just remind all
of us that
this is not the first time that
we have had

16:04.964 --> 16:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rapprochement with Cuba. In
1978, Jimmy
Carter also opened the door. In
fact, there

16:11.537 --> 16:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was another historic moment in
which a Cuban
airline landed in Atlanta and
took over 100

16:17.877 --> 16:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cuban Americans to dialogue with
the Cuban
government.

16:20.346 --> 16:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Actually, that was my first trip
back to Cuba.
We were very excited at the
time. We thought

16:25.117 --> 16:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there could be change.
There was 3,600
political prisoners that were
released, and,

16:31.924 --> 16:35.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in fact, small businesses were
opened up at
the time.

16:35.595 --> 16:43.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what happened was that it
got out of control
and the Cuban government opened
up the floodgates,

16:43.069 --> 16:48.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and at the same time clamped
down. And after
that came Reagan. So, I am
hopeful, to the

16:48.841 --> 16:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extent that I think this is a
little bit more,
if you will, assertive
rapprochement on the

16:55.982 --> 17:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of President Obama, but we
still need
to remember it is a military
government.

17:01.254 --> 17:04.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Roger Noriega, do
you think
this time will be different? Do
you see something

17:05.024 --> 17:10.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
materially different this time?
Obviously,
the president's there, but what
do you believe

17:10.496 --> 17:12.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could come from this?

17:12.265 --> 17:15.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: Well, certainly,
that's very
dramatic. The president's made a
big bet on

17:15.334 --> 17:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this in terms of his legacy in
history.

17:17.803 --> 17:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, if he loses that
bet, it's
going to be 11 million Cubans
that pay the

17:23.075 --> 17:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
price, because by licensing
deals, as he has,
tractor factory and...

17:29.982 --> 17:31.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Business deals.

17:31.717 --> 17:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: .... hotels being
-- several
hotels being managed, these are
deals that

17:35.087 --> 17:40.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's licensed with entities that
are owned
and operated by the Cuban
military.

17:40.793 --> 17:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in a certain way, you know,
we sort of
counted on the actuarial table
to deal with

17:44.597 --> 17:52.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Castro brothers, but by the
president
sort of not only giving the
political normalization

17:52.371 --> 17:58.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and legitimization, but also
this economic
engagement, it may actually
create a certain

17:58.444 --> 18:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
momentum for transition in the
post-Castro
period to just more dictators.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that would be
extraordinarily
tragic if that were to happen.

18:09.055 --> 18:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maria Torres,
could that be
an outcome of this, that the
communist regime

18:12.892 --> 18:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is strengthened by this, rather
than moving
toward -- in any way toward
democracy?

18:17.363 --> 18:21.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA DE LOS ANGELES TORRES:
Well, I think
there's always -- that's a risk,
but I also

18:21.934 --> 18:24.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think that there's a couple of
factors that
are different this time around.

18:24.904 --> 18:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, one, I think there
is support
on this side of the Florida
Strait. Many of

18:30.643 --> 18:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the businesses today in Cuba are
being fueled
by family members who are in
Miami. There

18:36.649 --> 18:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is -- that's a very porous
border. I think
that the Cuban government
realizes they do

18:41.320 --> 18:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not have Soviet Union or a
Venezuela or Brazil
or Chinese government that will
bail them

18:47.126 --> 18:50.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out this time around. And so,
therefore, they
are forced to make changes.

18:50.596 --> 18:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think these are changes
that they
want to make. And they are, in
fact, very

18:55.434 --> 19:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
modest changes, given the depth
of the crisis
in Cuba. But, nonetheless, I
think for those

19:00.639 --> 19:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who would like to be part of
whatever configuration
of a government there is after
the Castro

19:06.245 --> 19:10.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brothers, there is a sense that
they have
got to make some changes.

19:10.116 --> 19:16.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one thing Cuba cannot do is
open up the
immigration floodgates, and so,
therefore,

19:16.455 --> 19:19.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is internally that the
changes have to
be made.

19:19.759 --> 19:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's pick
up on that
and pick up on the political
prisoner exchange

19:23.329 --> 19:25.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at today's news conference.

19:25.164 --> 19:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Roger Noriega, we saw President
Castro fire
back. He said, what political
prisoners? And

19:31.337 --> 19:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he said, give me a list and we
will release
them tonight.

19:34.473 --> 19:38.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you see going on there?
Because now
there are human rights
organizations saying,

19:38.077 --> 19:39.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're going to put out the
names.

19:39.879 --> 19:44.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: Well, quite
frankly, I can
see why he would lose track of
the political

19:44.683 --> 19:48.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prisoners, because they take
them every day,
and the arrests were very
dramatic because

19:48.654 --> 19:55.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were on the eve of the
president's visit,
the arrests yesterday of ladies
going to church,

19:56.028 --> 20:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Santeria Parish, as they do
every Sunday.
They are beaten up and roughed
up every Sunday

20:01.167 --> 20:02.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as well, so...

20:02.635 --> 20:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is just
on the eve
of President Obama arriving?

20:04.470 --> 20:10.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: Absolutely. And
that just sort
of affirms that the regime is
not going to

20:10.176 --> 20:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let up. And they have every
intention of holding,
you know, sort of restraining
any kind of

20:17.383 --> 20:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economical or political opening
that would
threaten its survival.

20:21.220 --> 20:27.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Maria Torres, why
isn't that
a pretty discouraging
development here, that

20:27.059 --> 20:31.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there really is very little sign
so far of
their move toward democracy and
certainly

20:31.530 --> 20:34.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not toward doing anything about
these prisoners,
political prisoners?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA DE LOS ANGELES TORRES: I
absolutely
agree.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one thing we have to
remember, change
doesn't necessarily mean it's
going to be

20:40.372 --> 20:47.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
positive. And I think, with the
crumbling,
if you will, of totalitarian
regimes oftentimes

20:48.013 --> 20:50.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
comes a moment of extreme
repression.

20:50.683 --> 20:58.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is why the fact
that Raul
Castro was asked on his own turf
about political

20:58.991 --> 21:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prisoners and about human rights
is something
that we normally don't see. And
I think that

21:03.829 --> 21:11.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, regardless of how little
Internet there
is in Cuba and how little press
there is,

21:11.670 --> 21:13.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people in Cuba will know this by
tonight.

21:13.506 --> 21:18.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think that that is --
in a sense,
that is creating another sense
of environment,

21:18.644 --> 21:24.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in fact, I would say a sense
of empowerment.
The repression -- as one of the
leaders of

21:24.817 --> 21:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the human rights groups in Cuba
said today,
there is a lot of repression
because there

21:29.121 --> 21:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a lot of democracy movement
on the ground.

21:31.390 --> 21:36.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Roger Noriega, so
could there
be empowerment just by the very
fact that

21:36.729 --> 21:42.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they had the president's visit
and this news
conference, that people will ask
questions?

21:42.434 --> 21:47.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER NORIEGA: I think this is a
very tough
totalitarian Stalinist regime,
as it's been

21:47.706 --> 21:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
described to me by Eastern
Europeans who've
lived there, but it's also a
brittle regime,

21:53.112 --> 21:55.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in my way of thinking.

21:55.181 --> 22:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that this is one
area. Can the
regime control expectations? If
that gets

22:04.256 --> 22:11.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of hand, it will be a
serious problem.
But my concern is that, did the
president

22:11.197 --> 22:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strengthen Castro's hand by
accepting engagement
with Cuba on his terms?

22:17.303 --> 22:21.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The regime has made this a
binary choice.
You either engage the regime or
you engage

22:21.707 --> 22:28.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the people. And since
Eisenhower, presidents
have chosen not to engage the
people. And

22:28.314 --> 22:32.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm afraid that this sends the
wrong message,
and the president also making a
commitment,

22:32.718 --> 22:35.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a statement that he's not about
changing the
regime.

22:35.854 --> 22:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, why wouldn't he be? This
is a totalitarian
regime. Why wouldn't anybody be
for changing

22:41.026 --> 22:42.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that regime?

22:42.828 --> 22:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're going to
have to leave
it there, but we thank you both
very much,

22:44.730 --> 22:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Roger Noriega, Maria de Los
Angeles Torres.
Thank you.

22:48.701 --> 23:00.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARIA DE LOS ANGELES TORRES:
Thank you.

23:00.679 --> 23:05.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to the race for
the White
House.

23:05.985 --> 23:10.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ahead of tomorrow's primaries,
campaigns focused
on foreign policy, as candidates
stopped off

23:10.990 --> 23:12.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the Capitol.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

23:14.093 --> 23:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Donald Trump spent
today in the
city he's railed against,
Washington, D.C.

23:21.233 --> 23:25.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of his stops was just blocks
from the
Capitol, a midday, closed-door
meeting with

23:25.804 --> 23:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a select group of Republicans,
including former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
Trump made another

23:31.110 --> 23:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stop to talk, this time on the
record, to
The Washington Post editorial
board, unveiling

23:36.282 --> 23:39.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his team of foreign policy
advisers.

23:39.118 --> 23:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alabama senator Jeff Sessions,
who has already
endorsed Trump, will lead the
group. Other

23:43.922 --> 23:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
names include a former Pentagon
inspector-general,
an oil and energy consultant,
and a retired

23:49.995 --> 23:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Army lieutenant general who
helped oversee
Iraq after the U.S. invasion.

23:54.900 --> 24:00.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the afternoon, he warned
Republicans who
are vowing to stop him not to
organize a third-party

24:00.873 --> 24:02.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
run.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Well, a third party means that
the Democrats

24:04.510 --> 24:09.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are going to win, almost
certainly. You can't
be that spiteful. You can't be
that spiteful,

24:09.481 --> 24:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because you will destroy the
country.

24:11.317 --> 24:14.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump held his news
conference
at a hotel development in
downtown Washington.

24:14.753 --> 24:21.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That allowed him to talk about
the jobs he's
creating, and also show it off
to the press.

24:21.293 --> 24:26.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's two remaining Republican
rivals, Ted
Cruz and John Kasich, were also
in town, at

24:26.699 --> 24:32.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the annual conference hosted by
AIPAC, the
pro-Israel lobbying group. It
was the Democratic

24:32.905 --> 24:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
front-runner, Hillary Clinton,
who spoke first.
She zeroed in on Trump, saying
he couldn't

24:38.377 --> 24:40.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be trusted.

24:40.279 --> 24:43.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Yes, we need steady hands, not a
president

24:43.248 --> 24:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who says he's neutral on Monday,
pro-Israel
on Tuesday and who knows what on
Wednesday,

24:48.987 --> 24:50.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because everything's negotiable.

24:50.456 --> 24:51.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

24:52.024 --> 24:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, my
friends,
Israel's security is
non-negotiable.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

25:01.567 --> 25:08.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: After the speech,
Clinton headed
to Arizona for campaigning. The
only candidate

25:08.140 --> 25:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to skip AIPAC? Bernie Sanders,
the race's
only Jewish candidate. He spent
the day campaigning

25:16.248 --> 25:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Arizona, Idaho and Utah,
which hold contests
tomorrow.

25:21.120 --> 25:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

25:23.422 --> 25:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on how the
candidates
are positioning themselves with
interest groups

25:27.659 --> 25:32.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and with voters, we turn to
Politics Monday,
with Tamara Keith of NPR, and
Stuart Rothenberg

25:32.898 --> 25:35.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of The Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales
Political Report.

25:35.968 --> 25:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tam, let's talk about that
Hillary Clinton
speech at AIPAC. First of all,
for people

25:40.072 --> 25:44.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who don't know, the American
Israel Public
Affairs Committee, what is it
and why is their

25:44.843 --> 25:48.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support significant? Why is
everybody lining
up, except for Bernie Sanders,
to be there

25:48.680 --> 25:50.416 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today?

25:50.449 --> 25:51.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well,
and I will say that Bernie
Sanders did give

25:51.950 --> 25:57.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a foreign policy speech tonight
in Utah at
a gymnasium at a high school.

25:57.356 --> 26:04.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a very significant Israeli
lobbying
group, a significant --
basically, you want

26:04.563 --> 26:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AIPAC on your side, generally
speaking, if
you're a politician in America.
It's just

26:10.068 --> 26:14.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- it's easier that way. And
it's a political
force.

26:14.506 --> 26:19.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton came out,
really, I think,
with a general election posture.
She came

26:19.912 --> 26:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out swinging at Donald Trump in
a significant
way. That was one clip. She came
out later

26:25.951 --> 26:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the speech and talked about,
you know,
not standing by as intolerance
and bullying

26:33.158 --> 26:34.993 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happens.

26:35.027 --> 26:39.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So she used that speech. She
used stronger
language than she has used,
though she's been

26:39.198 --> 26:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using increasingly stronger
language toward
Trump.

26:41.733 --> 26:46.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, what is it that
AIPAC can
do for candidates, and then this
particular

26:46.038 --> 26:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group of candidates? Because
John Kasich was
there this afternoon. He gave a
very strong

26:50.409 --> 26:52.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
speech, standing ovation.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Editor and
Publisher, The
Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales Political
Report: Well,

26:54.112 --> 26:56.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's remember AIPAC is not a
political action
committee in the sense that
other political

26:56.748 --> 27:00.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups are. They give money to
candidates.
They endorse candidates. They do
political

27:00.419 --> 27:01.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
activity.

27:01.787 --> 27:05.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They don't do that. It's
American Israel Public
Affairs Committee.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's right. That's
right. Good
catch.

27:07.059 --> 27:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And they do
is introduce
candidates to pro-Israel voters,
mostly Jewish

27:13.932 --> 27:18.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
voters, in an attempt to
generate support
for Israel.

27:18.036 --> 27:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, look, if you're at AIPAC,
you are going
to meet contributors. you are
going to meet

27:21.840 --> 27:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who want to decide what
candidate to
support. Israel is a key issue.
So, AIPAC

27:27.513 --> 27:33.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a really important advocate
for Israel,
but in that regard, it has
strong support

27:33.385 --> 27:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Jewish community, not
throughout the
Jewish community.

27:36.188 --> 27:39.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is another group, J
Street, which is
more...

27:39.424 --> 27:41.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: More liberal?

27:41.159 --> 27:45.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: ... more
critical, more
critical of Israeli domestic
policy.

27:45.998 --> 27:50.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But AIPAC has a lot of groups
around the country,
a lot of supporters. It is a
great place to

27:50.969 --> 27:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go if you're going to talk about
U.S.-Israel
relations.

27:52.938 --> 27:54.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

27:54.740 --> 27:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's stick with Donald Trump
for a while.
He was in Washington today not
only to meet

27:57.476 --> 28:03.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with AIPAC, but also to meet
with -- at least
it was billed as a meeting with
establishment

28:03.115 --> 28:03.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But that didn't --
didn't exactly
live up to that.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: No. This was
another case
where the billing, I think, was
off.

28:08.654 --> 28:16.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right. We expected this to be
Republican insiders,
veteran party strategists,
long-term GOP maybe

28:16.628 --> 28:21.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
money folks. No, it was
basically mostly people
who had already endorse him,
members from

28:21.466 --> 28:27.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Hill, Tom Reed of New York,
Duncan Hunter
of California, a number of...

28:27.172 --> 28:27.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

28:27.806 --> 28:29.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Jeff Sessions.

28:29.608 --> 28:31.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Jeff Sessions
of Alabama,
as well as a couple of other
Republicans who

28:31.677 --> 28:35.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hadn't, Jim DeMint, now the head
of the Heritage
Foundation.

28:35.714 --> 28:41.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was very odd in that he
seemed to be talking
to the choir there, not reaching
out to moderate,

28:41.753 --> 28:45.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pragmatic Republicans and party
insiders,
which is I thought he probably
needed to do

28:45.958 --> 28:47.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and probably he was going to do.

28:48.026 --> 28:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does that mean this
pivot to being
embraced by the mainstream
Republican Party

28:53.599 --> 28:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not quite all the way there
yet?

28:55.167 --> 28:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It's not there
yet.

28:58.303 --> 29:03.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stages of denial of the
Republican establishment
are ongoing and they haven't
moved on to acceptance

29:03.342 --> 29:10.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a lot of ways. And Donald
Trump held that
meeting. Again, it wasn't a
broad meeting.

29:10.849 --> 29:17.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't, you know, going to
the Senate Republican
Caucus and doing the lunches.

29:17.122 --> 29:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Actually, the Senate is out of
town. I think
it happens to be that Donald
Trump was in

29:22.761 --> 29:29.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
town for AIPAC, and this press
conference
at the hotel, and he had a
meeting with a

29:29.835 --> 29:31.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
few people, and it got big
billing.

29:31.637 --> 29:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
this pivot, this
general election pivot, because
both Hillary

29:34.840 --> 29:38.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton and Donald Trump would
like it if
we didn't talk about Ted Cruz or
John Kasich,

29:38.477 --> 29:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are still -- and Bernie
Sanders, who are
still out there.

29:41.847 --> 29:45.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that what they're using this
little interregnum
for?

29:45.217 --> 29:52.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: They're definitely
making that
shift. But it's not done. It's
definitely

29:52.824 --> 29:54.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not done on...

29:54.493 --> 29:56.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In part because, for
instance,
Bernie Sanders outraised Hillary
Clinton.

29:56.795 --> 30:02.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, absolutely.
We got the
February numbers, and he
outraised her by

30:02.467 --> 30:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something like $12 million or
something. He
raised more than $40 million.
She raised more

30:07.539 --> 30:10.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the $30 million range.

30:10.242 --> 30:16.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Interestingly, though, she ends
February with
more cash on hand than he does,
and he actually

30:16.848 --> 30:23.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spent significantly more money.
He outspent
her by about $10 million in
February. The

30:23.155 --> 30:30.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
results of that were not
immediately apparent,
given Super Tuesday, given what
just happened

30:31.029 --> 30:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
semi,sort of Super Tuesday last
Tuesday, where
he didn't win any of those
states.

30:37.335 --> 30:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's -- but Bernie Sanders
is sticking
it out and he is able to raise a
lot of money,

30:43.642 --> 30:49.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so he is not ready in any way to
make that
turn. One quick interesting
thing, Elizabeth

30:49.514 --> 30:55.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Warren, Senator Elizabeth Warren
today went
on a massive tweet storm,
calling Donald Trump

30:55.854 --> 30:58.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a loser, among other things.

30:58.457 --> 31:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she has moved on. She hasn't
endorsed
anyone in the Democratic race,
but she has

31:03.328 --> 31:05.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
begun attacking the Republican
front-runner.

31:05.497 --> 31:08.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I would just say
what Donald
Trump's response is, but it
would require

31:08.967 --> 31:09.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
too much explanation.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, let's talk a
little bit more
about that, though.

31:12.971 --> 31:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have Elizabeth Warren
calling him a loser,
clearly trying to stir the pot.
You have more

31:18.744 --> 31:21.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
primaries coming up tomorrow.
What are we
all watching for now?

31:21.947 --> 31:25.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, we have
two. We have
the Utah caucuses and the
Arizona primary

31:25.617 --> 31:28.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the Republican side.

31:28.320 --> 31:32.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump has had the
advantage in Arizona.
There isn't a lot of polling in
either state,

31:32.557 --> 31:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen, so we're kind of feeling
our way through
this, not that the surveys have
always been

31:37.796 --> 31:38.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accurate anyway.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: True.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: But in this
case, I think
the endorsements, former
Governor Jan Brewer,

31:42.834 --> 31:47.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a number of other elected
officials in Arizona
have endorsed Trump. We're kind
of assuming

31:47.739 --> 31:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he's the favorite there,
and going to
win, although Ted Cruz is
running well apparently

31:51.376 --> 31:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in what limited polling we have.

31:53.411 --> 31:57.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Utah, on the other hand,
though, it's all
about Ted Cruz, and will he get
50 percent?

31:57.983 --> 32:07.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As it turns out, Donald Trump's
personality,
style, criticism of Mitt Romney,
language

32:07.192 --> 32:12.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has alienated a lot of LDS
Mormon voters.
And right now, it appears that
Ted Cruz is

32:12.364 --> 32:14.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the overwhelming favorite there.

32:14.733 --> 32:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is playing around. Kasich
is playing
around to try to keep Cruz under
50 percent.

32:19.204 --> 32:24.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Cruz exceeds 50 percent in
Utah, he gets
all of the delegates. It's like
a winner-take-all.

32:24.109 --> 32:26.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So there is still some
maneuvering going on
here.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: A lot of
maneuvering.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: The two
states are likely,
most likely, at least we think,
most likely

32:30.849 --> 32:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to divide between the two
candidates, which
would, in a sense, I guess, keep
the race

32:35.654 --> 32:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Trump the front-runner, Cruz
the contender,
and John Kasich still looking to
win a race

32:41.860 --> 32:43.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other than Ohio.

32:43.762 --> 32:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Bernie Sanders
obviously deciding
there is something to be gotten
out West at

32:46.565 --> 32:48.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this point.

32:48.366 --> 32:52.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely, there
is. And he
is about to begin, most likely,
a very decent

32:52.704 --> 32:57.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
run, possibly a very good run of
states that
really favor him.

32:58.009 --> 33:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tamara Keith, Stu
Rothenberg,
thank you both very much.

33:02.447 --> 33:07.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Thanks, Gwen.

33:07.552 --> 33:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

33:12.691 --> 33:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

33:16.294 --> 33:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
living in a city
targeted by terrorists; and
celebrating 50

33:22.767 --> 33:25.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
years of music in a
world-renowned jazz club.

33:25.971 --> 33:32.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, we return to Latin
America, and
efforts to end the world's
longest-running

33:32.277 --> 33:34.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conflict, in Colombia.

33:34.079 --> 33:39.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Havana today, Secretary of
State John Kerry
met with negotiators ahead of a
Wednesday

33:39.451 --> 33:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deadline for Colombia's peace
talks. It included
a meeting with the main rebel
faction, the

33:45.457 --> 33:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or
FARC.

33:49.160 --> 33:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, I sat down with
Colombian President
Juan Manuel Santos to discuss
his peace initiative.

33:55.300 --> 34:01.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, the view from the rebel
side, in
Putumayo, deep in Colombia's
south.

34:01.439 --> 34:06.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondents Bruno
Federico and
Nadja Drost recently traveled
there for this

34:06.544 --> 34:12.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exclusive report before the
Colombian government
banned reporters from events
like what you're

34:12.817 --> 34:13.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about to see.

34:13.985 --> 34:17.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The story is narrated by Ms.
Drost.

34:17.055 --> 34:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Beyond the end of
the road, the
Caqueta River winds deep into
Putumayo. There's

34:24.663 --> 34:28.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
endless jungle and the FARC.

34:28.133 --> 34:33.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After decades of cloaking their
movements
to evade the military, these
rebels are emerging

34:33.271 --> 34:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the jungle. It's for no
small reason:
In light of an expected peace
deal, the government

34:39.411 --> 34:44.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of President Juan Manuel Santos
has pulled
back its forces temporarily from
the area

34:44.716 --> 34:50.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to allow FARC commanders in
Havana to travel
here to talk peace directly with
their troops.

34:50.855 --> 34:55.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAMIRO, FARC (through
translator): We had
the idea to do this out of a
necessity, so

34:55.260 --> 35:00.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people, the guerrilla and
our communities,
can learn what is happening, so
that people

35:00.165 --> 35:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have a hand in the peace
process.

35:02.267 --> 35:07.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NADJA DROST: Hundreds of
guerrillas gather
for a landmark event on the road
towards peace.

35:07.939 --> 35:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FARC have also invited the
people they
have lived among for decades,
and us, the

35:12.610 --> 35:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only foreign TV crew, to witness
the biggest
gathering of rebels and
civilians in over

35:17.615 --> 35:19.551 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a decade.

35:19.584 --> 35:23.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been following units of
the FARC over
the last year, traveling to
their camps camouflaged

35:23.121 --> 35:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the jungle. Now it's the
first time seeing
them outside of their
clandestine life. After

35:28.426 --> 35:33.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years of discreetly moving
through villages,
it's a rare and exceptional
sight to see dozens

35:33.565 --> 35:38.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of them walking in town
alongside civilians,
as everyone prepares for the
events.

35:38.703 --> 35:43.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): It's
important
because it might help clarify
doubts that

35:43.975 --> 35:45.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
many people have.

35:45.777 --> 35:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: It's no wonder
people have doubts;
50 years of conflict have killed
nearly a

35:54.652 --> 36:01.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quarter-million people, and
displaced some
six million. Another 40,000 are
the disappeared.

36:01.259 --> 36:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Crimes have been committed by
all parties:
guerrilla groups, government
forces, and right-wing

36:06.898 --> 36:13.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paramilitary groups who often
acted as a proxy
for the state. The FARC started
out in the

36:13.438 --> 36:19.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1960s as small groups of armed
peasants defending
the rights of the poor. It
became a Marxist

36:19.244 --> 36:25.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insurgency that later bolstered
its forces
using the drug trade,
kidnappings and extortion

36:25.183 --> 36:27.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to finance its their fight.

36:27.318 --> 36:32.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 2000, the Colombian
military, backed
by billions of U.S. dollars, has
decimated

36:32.490 --> 36:37.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FARC, and their ranks have
dropped to
an estimated 7,000 rebels today.
It was a

36:37.829 --> 36:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weakened, but undefeated FARC
that came to
the negotiating table.

36:41.966 --> 36:47.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joaquin Gomez, the nom de guerre
for the commander
of the FARC's powerful southern
bloc, got

36:47.205 --> 36:54.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
safe passage from Havana to
visit home. Alexandra
Narino, also an alias, has
returned with him.

36:54.579 --> 36:59.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Dutch woman famous for being a
foreign rebel,
she's wanted in the U.S. for her
role in the

36:59.617 --> 37:06.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kidnapping of three American
military contractors
in 2003. They're big names here,
and across

37:06.591 --> 37:11.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colombia, but rarely have they
shown their
faces in the territory they call
home.

37:11.863 --> 37:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People gather to ask the FARC if
what they
hear about the peace process is
true.

37:16.101 --> 37:21.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Will
there really
be a peace agreement signed by
March 23?

37:21.639 --> 37:27.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAQUIN GOMEZ, FARC (through
translator):
This is not possible. It's not
possible because

37:27.612 --> 37:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government has to fulfill a
series of
commitments that, until now, it
hasn't.

37:31.783 --> 37:36.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Despite more than
three years
of negotiations, Gomez says
there are many

37:36.221 --> 37:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sticking points that have yet to
be resolved,
like how the FARC would disarm
and concentrate

37:41.025 --> 37:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their troops in rural areas, and
one of them
is a key demand by the FARC:

37:46.865 --> 37:53.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOAQUIN GOMEZ (through
translator): That paramilitarism
ends as a state policy. That's
it, that they

37:53.738 --> 37:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get rid of it. It's the only
obstacle that
exists, because, while it
exists, it's like

37:58.176 --> 38:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
walking with one foot in the
grave.

38:02.247 --> 38:07.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Gomez and other
rebels worry
that if the FARC become a purely
political

38:07.318 --> 38:12.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organization, they will meet the
same fate
as thousands of activists,
social and political

38:12.257 --> 38:15.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leaders who have been
assassinated.

38:15.093 --> 38:19.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the FARC are to disarm, Gomez
says the
state should stop using its
weapons as a tool

38:19.597 --> 38:21.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of political repression.

38:21.432 --> 38:27.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOAQUIN GOMEZ (through
translator): That would
mean that weapons of the state
aren't used

38:27.505 --> 38:31.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in assassinations of political
leaders, trade
unionists, or leftists. And our
weapons would

38:32.010 --> 38:35.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be kept at a distance from us.
We propose
that a third country hold on to
them.

38:35.713 --> 38:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: While the presence
of the guerrilla
is feared in various regions,
the vacuum of

38:39.951 --> 38:42.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their absence worries many
locals.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LILIANA, Colombia (through
translator): At
the point of signing a peace
agreement, which

38:45.890 --> 38:51.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we support, we will feel very
worried, because,
with living in a conflict zone,
paramilitaries

38:51.062 --> 38:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
may come in and disappear us,
one by one,
or kill us, and who will protect
us? With

38:55.900 --> 38:59.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the FARC here, one feels a
security that that
won't happen.

38:59.537 --> 39:04.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOAQUIN GOMEZ (through
translator): What is
being sought is reconciliation.,
not impunity,

39:04.742 --> 39:06.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but reconciliation.

39:06.945 --> 39:12.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Commander Joaquin
Gomez faces
narco-trafficking charges in the
U.S. and

39:12.984 --> 39:19.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a $2.5 million reward for his
capture. In
Colombia, he's wanted for the
kidnapping and

39:19.224 --> 39:21.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
assassination of a governor.

39:21.659 --> 39:27.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOAQUIN GOMEZ (through
translator): There
has to be a general amnesty,
except for crimes

39:27.332 --> 39:32.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against humanity. And there has
to be a form
of justice that isn't punitive,
but restorative.

39:32.604 --> 39:37.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: A peace agreement
will call all
parties to the conflict, the
FARC, as much

39:37.809 --> 39:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as members of the state and
military, to face
a special justice system that
offers alternative

39:43.314 --> 39:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sentences. Most of the FARC's
rank-and-file
will receive amnesties, and for
when they

39:48.586 --> 39:53.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do, some are being trained to
use new tools
for political communication.

39:53.591 --> 39:58.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BORIS, FARC (through
translator): We're preparing
ourselves here for political
battle, to get

39:58.630 --> 40:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ready for a new environment. We
will pick
up cameras and drop our arms.

40:03.301 --> 40:09.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: Welcoming the
prospect of peace,
but wary of the uncertainties to
come.

40:10.008 --> 40:18.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDRA NARINO, FARC (through
translator):
When a peace accord is signed,
that doesn't

40:18.783 --> 40:23.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean that peace starts. The
silencing of weapons
isn't peace. I think it's
afterwards that

40:23.921 --> 40:32.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the difficult part starts. And
the most interesting
part, the construction of peace
with social

40:32.697 --> 40:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
justice, I want to be there.

40:35.600 --> 40:42.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NADJA DROST: For tonight, an air
of optimism
and hope takes over, as one step
of many is

40:42.507 --> 40:48.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken on the long and difficult
road to peace.

For the "PBS NewsHour,"

Putumayo, Colombia.

40:55.186 --> 40:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Extraordinary
reporting.

40:58.056 --> 41:03.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And later this week, we will
look at how Colombia's
massive cocaine trade could be
affected by

41:03.528 --> 41:08.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a peace agreement.

GWEN IFILL: Now back to terror
in Turkey.

41:20.011 --> 41:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attack on a pedestrian
street in Istanbul
on Sunday, the fourth suicide
bombing in Turkey

41:25.149 --> 41:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this year, was, according to
President Erdogan,
one of the biggest and bloodiest
terrorist

41:31.656 --> 41:33.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
waves in its history.

41:33.758 --> 41:37.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take an intimate look now at
the violence,
and how it shapes daily life.

Decorated Marine veteran Elliot
Ackerman served
in Iraq and Afghanistan. His
debut novel,

41:43.267 --> 41:49.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Green on Blue," is a war story
told from
the perspective of an Afghan
boy. Ackerman

41:49.273 --> 41:51.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
now lives with his family in
Istanbul.

41:51.876 --> 41:55.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLIOT ACKERMAN, Author, "Green
on Blue":
On an unseasonably warm morning
the past January

41:55.513 --> 42:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Istanbul, an Islamic State
suicide bomber
detonated himself in a
Sultanahmet, a central

42:01.085 --> 42:02.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sightseeing district.

42:02.920 --> 42:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He killed eleven tourists, 10 of
them Germans.
At the moment of the blast, I
was sitting

42:07.725 --> 42:12.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in an outside cafe nearby.
Almost immediately,
my phone lit up with concerned
calls from

42:12.864 --> 42:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
friends and family back home in
the U.S.

42:15.833 --> 42:20.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was the third Islamic State
bombing in
Turkey since June. I had moved
to Istanbul

42:20.705 --> 42:25.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two years before with my family
to work on
a book. But I had also moved
here to give

42:25.243 --> 42:28.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my children the experience of
living abroad.

42:28.546 --> 42:33.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What better place to expand
their world view
than Istanbul? It's a city
defined by its

42:33.151 --> 42:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
divisions, by Bosphorus Strait
that splits
Europe from Asia and by its
religious history,

42:38.689 --> 42:41.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having once been the seat of
power for both
Christian and Islamic empires.

42:41.959 --> 42:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of my fondest memories is of
the spring
we moved here. That's when the
tulips are

42:47.031 --> 42:52.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in bloom. They blossom
everywhere, in long
rows along the streets, in
planters tucked

42:52.670 --> 42:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the city squares, even
sprouting up through
the broken sidewalks.

42:56.607 --> 43:03.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spent those months watching my
children
explore this ancient city among
its new flowers.

43:03.214 --> 43:07.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The night after the bombing, I
went out to
dinner with a few Turkish
friends. Among them

43:07.952 --> 43:12.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a well-known journalist. Weeks
before, the
authorities had imprisoned two
of his colleagues

43:13.024 --> 43:18.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for spying and revealing state
secrets after
they printed a story about
government collusion

43:18.262 --> 43:21.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Islamic fighters inside of
Syria.

43:21.065 --> 43:26.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the topic of the bombing
came up, he
said that he was far more afraid
of Turkey's

43:26.370 --> 43:31.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more increasingly toxic politics
around the
issue of terrorism than of
terrorism itself.

43:31.509 --> 43:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Politics, he said, can be
defined as the acquisition
or maintenance of power. You can
do this in

43:37.248 --> 43:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two ways, by either dividing
people or uniting
them.

43:41.452 --> 43:46.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Uniting people is very
difficult, he explained.
But dividing them is far easier.
When I asked

43:46.390 --> 43:51.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how you divide people, his
answer was a single
word: fear.

43:51.696 --> 43:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We then speculated about why the
bombing had
taken place in Sultanahmet,
close to the famous

43:55.900 --> 44:00.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Blue Mosque. The bomber could
have killed
far more people if he had
attacked a subway

44:00.104 --> 44:05.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
station at rush hour or a
shopping mall. Consensus
was that the Islamic State
wanted to harm

44:05.943 --> 44:07.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the tourist industry.

44:07.712 --> 44:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I remembered all of the
concerned phone
calls I had received from home,
it seemed

44:10.882 --> 44:15.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likely that fewer and fewer
Westerners would
be planning their vacations to
the city.

44:15.052 --> 44:20.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then the man at the table next
interrupted
us. He owned a hotel in
Sultanahmet, and told

44:20.791 --> 44:25.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
us that a wonderful and
surprising thing had
happened after the bombing. In a
small act

44:25.630 --> 44:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of defiance and solidarity,
German vacationers
had booked his hotel to
capacity. They had

44:31.068 --> 44:34.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
chosen not to be afraid.

44:34.105 --> 44:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much of current U.S. politics is
defined by
the rhetoric of fear. Whether
the topic is

44:38.809 --> 44:44.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism, gun control or
immigration, our
fears are manipulated. We are
encouraged to

44:44.448 --> 44:46.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be divided.

44:46.317 --> 44:50.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The longer I stay in Istanbul,
the more I
realize that the education I'm
giving my children

44:50.421 --> 44:55.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not so much as cultural, but
moral. It's
about teaching them to live
without fear.

44:55.293 --> 44:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is a choice, but not an
easy one.

44:59.096 --> 45:04.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a photo from that first
spring in Istanbul.
It's of my daughter. She stands
in a bed of

45:04.168 --> 45:09.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yellow tulips in the shadow of
the ancient
Blue Mosque. She wears a little
pink coat.

45:09.173 --> 45:13.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And she's looking at the
flowers. She's not
even 4 years old.

45:13.444 --> 45:17.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I look at it, I feel that
sweet ache
in my heart, the one any father
recognizes

45:17.315 --> 45:22.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he looks at his daughter. I
also feel
such joy for all she is
experiencing so young.

45:22.486 --> 45:27.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But two years after this picture
was taken,
looking at it also presents with
me a choice.

45:27.658 --> 45:34.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can see something different in
it if I choose.
You see, this photograph was
taken exactly

45:34.198 --> 45:38.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where the bomb went off.

45:39.003 --> 45:49.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
it's Monday night,
and for 50 years that's meant
big band music

JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
it's Monday night,

45:54.385 --> 45:57.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a world-famous jazz club in
New York.

45:57.722 --> 46:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

46:00.891 --> 46:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The song is
called "Mean What
You Say. And, says trombonist
Douglas Purviance,

46:09.767 --> 46:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's a veritable lesson in big
band music.

46:12.803 --> 46:17.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS PURVIANCE, Musician: It
starts out,
it just a rhythm section, and
then it adds

46:17.475 --> 46:26.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and adds and adds until it's
really coming
at you.

46:26.751 --> 46:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a sound
that, every Monday
night, comes at audiences at the
famous Village

46:37.695 --> 46:44.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vanguard jazz club. In a dark
basement space
in Lower Manhattan, the Vanguard
is a jazz

46:44.502 --> 46:47.204 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mecca.

46:47.238 --> 46:51.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the greats have played here,
and some
of the most renowned live
recordings have

46:51.609 --> 46:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been made here. The club was
founded in 1935
by Max Gordon, and 81 years
later, it's still

46:59.016 --> 47:05.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a family affair, run now by his
daughter Deborah
Gordon, and still not your
average small business.

47:05.756 --> 47:11.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DEBORAH GORDON, Village
Vanguard: I was looking
for just a recent payroll sheet
or something,

47:11.696 --> 47:18.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and accidentally put my hand on
one from 1962
with John Coltrane's signature
on the bottom.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

47:20.237 --> 47:24.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBORAH GORDON: Things like that
are part
of the fabric of the place.

47:24.442 --> 47:28.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you realize
how unusual
that is, right? I mean, not many
places...

47:28.079 --> 47:29.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBORAH GORDON: I do. I'm not
going to tell
you where it is.

47:29.980 --> 47:32.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:32.049 --> 47:38.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Vanguard
recently celebrated
an important part of its
history: a 50-years-and-counting

47:38.322 --> 47:48.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
residency that blows the lid off
the place
every Monday night.

47:48.199 --> 47:55.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It began in 1966 as the Thad
Jones/Mel Lewis
Orchestra. Jones was a trumpeter
and composer

47:55.106 --> 48:08.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who'd played with Count Basie,
Lewis a veteran
drummer. Big bands weren't then
in vogue.

48:08.986 --> 48:11.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The economics were too
difficult, for one
thing.

48:11.455 --> 48:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the two gathered some of New
York's best
studio and session musicians for
what many

48:16.527 --> 48:21.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thought would be a one-time gig,
held on a
night that jazz clubs are
usually closed.

48:21.465 --> 48:26.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIMMY OWENS, Musician: I took
the taxicab
here, and when I got to 11th
Street, I saw

48:27.004 --> 48:32.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of these people lined up
outside of the
Vanguard. I mean, I know we're
playing here

48:32.977 --> 48:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight, but I have never seen a
crowd like
that.

48:36.113 --> 48:40.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Trumpet player
Jimmy Owens
and trombonist Garnett Brown
were part of

48:40.117 --> 48:44.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the original group, which is
credited with
recreating the big band sound.

48:44.655 --> 48:52.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The thing that made this band
really different
at this day in age was the fact
that Thad's

48:52.329 --> 48:59.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writing, he wasn't writing big
band music,
per se, compositions. He was
like writing

48:59.370 --> 49:03.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
small group compositions, only
for the big
band.

49:03.440 --> 49:10.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARNETT BROWN, Musician: They
had those times
when the band as one unit would
just knock

49:10.281 --> 49:17.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everybody out because everybody
was so in
synch. And then Thad would rely
on the solos

49:17.354 --> 49:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and knowing exactly what to do
in order to
make the soloists rise higher in
his emotion

49:25.529 --> 49:27.565 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and playing.

49:27.598 --> 49:31.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: "All My
Yesterdays," a newly-released
recording of the band's debut
sessions, captures

49:31.969 --> 49:37.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the original sound and
excitement.

49:37.741 --> 49:48.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZEV FELDMAN, Resonance Records:
This is one
of great traditions in jazz
music.

49:48.485 --> 49:51.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Zev Feldman is
with Resonance
Records.

49:51.188 --> 49:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZEV FELDMAN: When I'm listening
to this music,
I hear a fresh energy amongst
the musicians

49:57.561 --> 50:04.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the stage. You hear the
energy within the
applause of that room. We built
a time machine

50:04.134 --> 50:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that can take you back to what
it was like
on that opening night.

50:08.639 --> 50:15.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Most amazing of
all perhaps,
the band and its Monday night
tradition have

50:15.112 --> 50:23.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continued. It's been called the
Vanguard Jazz
Orchestra since the death of Mel
Lewis in

50:23.087 --> 50:24.855 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1990.

50:24.889 --> 50:32.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 17 musicians, crowded on the
Vanguard's
small stage, make their livings
from teaching,

50:32.196 --> 50:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
playing in Broadway shows and
other work.
Monday nights are different.

50:36.333 --> 50:41.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Because this isn't a living for
anybody, right?

50:41.472 --> 50:46.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MOSCA, Musician: Depends on
how you live.
No.

50:46.143 --> 50:47.978 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:48.012 --> 50:52.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: These days,
trombonists John
Mosca and Douglas Purviance
serve, respectively,

50:52.650 --> 50:54.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the band's director and
manager.

50:54.885 --> 51:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS PURVIANCE: This whole
phenomenon is
about the music. And it's about,
you know,

51:00.624 --> 51:07.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the quality of the arrangements
and the compositions.
So, Thad Jones is the core of
what we do.

51:07.364 --> 51:15.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have always tried to add
other composers
and arrangers on that level,
which is not

51:15.873 --> 51:17.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an easy thing to do.

51:17.808 --> 51:23.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MOSCA: We feel about our
book the way
classical musicians would feel
about the repertoire

51:23.948 --> 51:31.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Haydn and Mozart and
Beethoven. You can
never really master it. It just
-- it demands

51:31.622 --> 51:34.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
everything you have.

51:34.992 --> 51:41.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So it's possible
to keep going?

51:41.865 --> 51:50.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MOSCA: Yes. People are
always going to
want to do this. And this music
is a great

51:50.374 --> 51:52.076 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
teacher.

51:52.109 --> 51:57.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From the Village

make that live from the Village
