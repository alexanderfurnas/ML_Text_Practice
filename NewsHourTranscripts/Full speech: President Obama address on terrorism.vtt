00:02.002 --> 00:05.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Good evening. On Wednesday, 14
Americans were killed as they
came together to celebrate

00:05.405 --> 00:11.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the holidays. They were taken
from family and friends who
loved them deeply. They were

00:11.111 --> 00:18.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white and black, Latino and
Asian, immigrants, and American
born, moms and dads, daughters

00:18.652 --> 00:23.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sons. Each of them served
their fellow citizens. All of
them were part of our American

00:23.490 --> 00:27.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

00:27.127 --> 00:32.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight I want to talk with you
about this tragedy, the broader
threat of terrorism and

00:32.232 --> 00:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how we can keep our country
safe. The FBI is still gathering
the facts about what happened

00:38.238 --> 00:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in San Bernardino, but here's
what we know. The victims were
brutally murdered and injured

00:43.610 --> 00:49.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by one of their co-workers and
his wife. So far, we have no
evidence that the killers

00:49.149 --> 00:53.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were directed by a terrorist
organization overseas or that
they were part of a broader

00:53.587 --> 01:00.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conspiracy here at home. But it
is clear that the two of them
had gone down the dark path

01:00.027 --> 01:05.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of radicalization, embracing a
perverted interpretation of
Islam that calls for war against
America

01:05.699 --> 01:12.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the West. They had
stockpiled assault weapons,
ammunition, and pipe bombs.

01:12.339 --> 01:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this was an act of terrorism
designed to kill innocent
people. Our nation has been

01:19.379 --> 01:26.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at war with terrorists since Al
Qaeda killed nearly 3,000
Americans on 9/11. In the
process,

01:26.420 --> 01:32.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we've hardened our defenses,
from airports, to financial
centers, to other critical
infrastructure.

01:32.993 --> 01:37.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Intelligence and law enforcement
agencies have disrupted
countless plots here and
overseas

01:37.331 --> 01:41.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and worked around the
clock to keep us safe.

01:41.935 --> 01:46.473 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
Our military and
counterterrorism professionals
have relentlessly pursued
terrorist networks

01:46.473 --> 01:51.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overseas, disrupting safe havens
in several different countries,
killing Osama Bin Laden,

01:51.945 --> 01:55.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and decimating Al
Qaeda's leadership.

01:55.549 --> 02:02.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Over the last few years,
however, the terrorist threat
has evolved into a new phase. As
we've

02:02.956 --> 02:09.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
become better at preventing
complex multifaceted attacks
like 9/11, terrorists turn to
less

02:09.696 --> 02:16.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complicated acts of violence
like the mass shootings that are
all too common in our society.

02:16.336 --> 02:21.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is this type of attack that
we saw at Fort Hood in 2009, in
Chattanooga earlier this

02:21.074 --> 02:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year, and now in San Bernardino.

02:25.812 --> 02:32.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as groups like ISIL grew
stronger amidst the chaos of war
in Iraq and then Syria, and

02:32.352 --> 02:37.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the Internet erases the
distance between countries, we
see growing efforts by
terrorists

02:37.691 --> 02:45.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to poison the minds of people
like the Boston Marathon bombers
and the San Bernardino killers.

02:45.532 --> 02:50.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For seven years, I've confronted
this evolving threat each and
every morning in my intelligence

02:50.804 --> 02:56.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
briefing, and since the day I
took this office, I have
authorized U.S. forces to take
out

02:56.877 --> 03:02.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorists abroad precisely
because I know how real the
danger is.

03:02.682 --> 03:07.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As commander in chief, I have no
greater responsibility than the
security of the American people.

03:07.687 --> 03:13.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As a father to two young
daughters who are the most
precious part of my life, I know

03:13.693 --> 03:17.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we see ourselves with
friends and co-workers at a
holiday party like the one in
San Bernardino.

03:17.898 --> 03:23.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know we see our kids in the
faces of the young people killed
in Paris.

03:23.437 --> 03:28.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know that after so much
war, many Americans are asking
whether we are confronted by a

03:28.208 --> 03:32.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cancer that has no
immediate cure.

03:32.512 --> 03:38.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OBAMA: Well, here's what I want
you to know. The threat from
terrorism is real, but we

03:38.785 --> 03:44.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will overcome it. We will
destroy ISIL and any other
organization that tries to harm

03:44.691 --> 03:52.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us. Our success won't depend on
tough talk, or abandoning our
values or giving into fear.

03:52.265 --> 03:58.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what groups like ISIL are
hoping for. Instead, we will
prevail by being strong and

03:58.472 --> 04:06.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smart, resilient and relentless.
And by drawing upon every aspect
of American power.

04:06.947 --> 04:14.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's how. First, our military
will continue to hunt down
terrorist plotters in any
country

04:14.287 --> 04:20.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where it is necessary. In Iraq
and Syria, air strikes are
taking out ISIL leaders, heavy

04:20.293 --> 04:24.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weapons, oil tankers,
infrastructure.

04:24.231 --> 04:28.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And since attacks in Paris, our
closest allies, including
France, Germany, and the United

04:28.768 --> 04:32.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kingdom, have ramped up their
contributions to our military
campaign which will help us

04:32.639 --> 04:37.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accelerate our effort
to destroy ISIL.

04:37.410 --> 04:42.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, we will continue to
provide training and equipment
to tens of thousands of Iraqi

04:42.482 --> 04:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Syrian forces fighting ISIL
on the ground so that we take
away their safe havens.

04:48.488 --> 04:52.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In both countries, we're
deploying special operations
forces who can accelerate that

04:52.392 --> 04:56.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offensive. We've stepped up this
effort since the attacks in
Paris, and will continue to

04:56.696 --> 05:01.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
invest more in approaches that
are working on the ground.

05:01.735 --> 05:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Third, we're working with
friends and allies to stop
ISIL's operations, to disrupt
plots,

05:07.807 --> 05:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cut off their financing, and
prevent them from recruiting
more fighters.

05:12.846 --> 05:16.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the attacks in Paris,
we've surged merged intelligence
sharing with our European
allies.

05:16.917 --> 05:22.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're working with Turkey to
seal its border with Syria, and
we are cooperating with Muslim

05:22.722 --> 05:27.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
majority countries, and with our
Muslim communities here at home,
to counter the vicious ideology

05:27.494 --> 05:31.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that ISIL promotes online.

05:31.998 --> 05:39.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Fourth, with American
leadership, the international
community has begun to establish
a process

05:39.372 --> 05:45.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and timeline to pursue
cease-fires and a political
resolution to the Syrian war.

05:45.912 --> 05:50.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Doing so will allow the Syrian
people and every country,
including our allies, but also

05:50.450 --> 05:54.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries like Russia, to focus
on the common goal of destroying
ISIL, a group that threatens

05:54.788 --> 05:59.125 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us all.

05:59.125 --> 06:04.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is our strategy to destroy
ISIL. It is designed and
supported by our military
commanders

06:04.998 --> 06:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and counterterrorism experts,
together with 65 countries that
have joined an American-led

06:11.838 --> 06:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coalition. And we constantly
examine our strategy to
determine when additional steps
are needed

06:15.508 --> 06:18.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get the job done.

06:18.812 --> 06:22.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why I've ordered the
Departments of State and
Homeland Security to review the

06:22.082 --> 06:27.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visa waiver program under which
the female terrorist in San
Bernardino originally came

06:27.587 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to this country. And that's why
I will urge high-tech and law
enforcement leaders to make

06:32.492 --> 06:38.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it harder for terrorists to use
technology to escape from
justice.

06:38.598 --> 06:45.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, here at home, we have to
work together to address the
challenge. There are several

06:45.572 --> 06:50.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
steps that Congress should take
right away. To begin with,
Congress should act to make

06:50.610 --> 06:57.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure no one on a no- fly list is
able to buy a gun. What could
possibly be the argument

06:57.584 --> 07:01.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for allowing a terrorist suspect
to buy a semiautomatic weapon?
This is a matter of

07:01.588 --> 07:05.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
national security.

07:05.659 --> 07:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also need to make it harder
for people to buy powerful
assault weapons, like the

07:09.896 --> 07:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ones that were used in San
Bernardino. I know there are
some who reject any gun-safety
measures,

07:15.468 --> 07:20.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but the fact is that our
intelligence and law-enforcement
agencies, no matter how
effective

07:20.774 --> 07:25.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are, cannot identify every
would-be mass shooter, whether
that individual was motivated

07:25.945 --> 07:30.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by ISIL or some other
hateful ideology.

07:30.183 --> 07:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What we can do, and must do, is
make it harder for them to kill.

07:36.956 --> 07:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next, we should put in place
stronger screening for those who
come to America without a visa

07:43.129 --> 07:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that we can take a hard look
at whether they've traveled to
war zones. And we're working

07:47.133 --> 07:51.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with members of both parties in
Congress to do exactly that.

07:51.538 --> 07:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, if Congress believes,
as I do, that we are at war with
ISIL, it should go ahead

07:58.011 --> 08:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and vote to authorize the
continued use of military force
against these terrorists.

08:04.050 --> 08:08.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For over a year, I have ordered
our military to take thousands
of air strikes against ISIL

08:08.621 --> 08:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
targets. I think it's time for
Congress to vote to demonstrate
that the American people

08:12.158 --> 08:18.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are united and committed
to this fight.

08:18.531 --> 08:21.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My fellow Americans, these are
the steps that we can take
together to defeat the terrorist

08:21.534 --> 08:24.771 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
threat.

08:24.771 --> 08:31.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me now say a word about what
we should not do. We should not
be drawn once more into

08:31.978 --> 08:40.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a long and costly ground war in
Iraq or Syria. That's what
groups like ISIL want. They know

08:40.153 --> 08:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they can't defeat us on the
battlefield. ISIL fighters were
part of the insurgency that

08:44.991 --> 08:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we faced in Iraq. But they also
know that if we occupy foreign
lands, they can maintain

08:50.430 --> 08:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurgencies for years, killing
thousands of our troops and
draining our resources,

08:55.835 --> 09:00.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and using our presence
to draw new recruits.

09:00.673 --> 09:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The strategy that we are using
now -- air strikes, special
forces, and working with

09:05.945 --> 09:11.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
local forces who are fighting to
regain control of their own
country -- that is how we'll

09:11.418 --> 09:17.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
achieve a more sustainable
victory, and it won't require us
sending a new generation

09:17.624 --> 09:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Americans overseas to fight
and die for another decade on
foreign soil.

09:24.197 --> 09:30.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's what else we cannot do.
We cannot turn against one
another by letting this fight

09:30.136 --> 09:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be defined as a war between
America and Islam. That, too, is
what groups like ISIL want.

09:39.212 --> 09:46.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIL does not speak for Islam.
They are thugs and killers, part
of a cult of death. And

09:46.653 --> 09:52.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they account for a tiny fraction
of a more than a billion Muslims
around the world, including

09:52.926 --> 09:57.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
millions of patriotic
Muslim-Americans who reject
their hateful ideology.

09:57.831 --> 10:04.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moreover, the vast majority of
terrorist victims around the
world are Muslim.

10:04.103 --> 10:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we're to succeed in defeating
terrorism, we must enlist Muslim
communities as some

10:09.709 --> 10:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of our strongest allies, rather
than push them away through
suspicion and hate.

10:17.717 --> 10:21.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That does not mean denying the
fact that an extremist ideology
has spread within some

10:21.855 --> 10:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Muslim communities. It's a real
problem that Muslims must
confront without excuse.

10:29.128 --> 10:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Muslim leaders here and around
the globe have to continue
working with us to decisively

10:34.200 --> 10:40.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and unequivocally reject the
hateful ideology that groups
like ISIL and Al Qaeda promote,

10:40.340 --> 10:45.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to speak out against not just
acts of violence, but also those
interpretations of Islam that

10:45.745 --> 10:53.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are incompatible with the values
of religious tolerance, mutual
respect, and human dignity.

10:53.286 --> 10:58.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But just as it is the
responsibility of Muslims around
the world to root out misguided
ideas

10:58.224 --> 11:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that lead to radicalization, it
is the responsibility of all
Americans, of every faith, to
reject

11:05.131 --> 11:11.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discrimination. It is our
responsibility to reject
religious tests on who we admit
into

11:11.771 --> 11:17.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this country. It's our
responsibility to reject
proposals that Muslim-Americans
should somehow

11:17.210 --> 11:25.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be treated differently. Because
when we travel down that road,
we lose. That kind of
divisiveness,

that betrayal of our values
plays into the hands of groups
like ISIL.

Muslim-Americans are our friends
and our neighbors, our co-
workers, our sports heroes. And,
yes,

11:41.267 --> 11:46.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are our men and women in
uniform who are willing to die
in defense of our country.

11:46.539 --> 11:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to remember that.

11:51.344 --> 11:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My fellow Americans, I am
confident we will succeed in
this mission because we are on

11:56.482 --> 12:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the right side of history. We
were founded upon a belief in
human dignity that no matter

12:03.856 --> 12:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who you are, or where you come
from, or what you look like or
what religion you practice,

12:08.995 --> 12:15.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you are equal in the eyes of God
and equal in the eyes of the
law. Even in this political

12:15.768 --> 12:21.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
season, even as we properly
debate what steps I and future
presidents must take to keep

12:21.140 --> 12:28.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our country safe. Let's make
sure we never forget what makes
us exceptional. Let's not

12:28.848 --> 12:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forget that freedom is more
powerful than fear. That we have
always met challenges,

12:35.622 --> 12:42.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether war or depression,
natural disasters or terrorist
attacks, by coming together
around

12:42.061 --> 12:48.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our common ideals as one
nation and one people.

12:48.201 --> 12:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So long as we stay true to that
tradition, I have no doubt that
America will prevail.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you. God bless you. And
may God bless the United States
of America.
