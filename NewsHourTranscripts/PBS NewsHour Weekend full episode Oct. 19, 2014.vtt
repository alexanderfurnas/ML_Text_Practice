LIBERIA.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.498
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE OUT AND

04:58.498 --> 04:59.666
ABOUT WHEN YOU FIRST GOT HOME.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.034
IN FACT, YOU WERE ONMEET THE

05:01.034 --> 05:02.536
PRESSLAST SUNDAY.

05:02.536 --> 05:03.703
I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE ON SOME

05:03.703 --> 05:04.738
SORT OF SELF-IMPOSED QUARANTINE

05:04.738 --> 05:09.376
NOW.

05:09.376 --> 05:10.877
>> IT IS SORT OF A MODIFIED

05:10.877 --> 05:12.379
QUARANTINE AS WELL, I CAME BACK

05:12.379 --> 05:14.114
FROM LIBERIA ON SATURDAY AND I

05:14.114 --> 05:16.316
WENT ON MEET THE PRESS.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.151
I AM NOT SYMPTOMATIC, I HAVE

05:18.151 --> 05:19.186
BEEN TAKING MY TEMPERATURE AND

05:19.186 --> 05:20.887
ALL OF THAT BUT THEN I STARTED

05:20.887 --> 05:22.389
THINKING ABOUT IT WHEN IT IS

05:22.389 --> 05:23.423
TIME TO GO BACK TO THE OFFICE

05:23.423 --> 05:24.724
AND GO TO THE PENTAGON WHICH IS

05:24.724 --> 05:27.260
WHERE I ACTUALLY WORK OFTEN AND

05:27.260 --> 05:28.962
I REALIZED THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

05:28.962 --> 05:31.498
WERE GOING TO FEEL WEIRD AROUND

05:31.498 --> 05:33.934
ME, SO I WORKED IT OUT WITH THE

05:33.934 --> 05:35.335
TIMES THAT I WOULD WORK FROM

05:35.335 --> 05:36.603
HOME, I WOULDN'T GO INTO THE

05:36.603 --> 05:38.205
PENTAGON AND INTO THE PRESS

05:38.205 --> 05:40.407
BULLPEN WHICH IS A CROWDED AREA

05:40.407 --> 05:42.042
AND WHAT I I AM TRYING TO DO IS

05:42.042 --> 05:43.376
JUST FOR THE REST -- UNTIL I

05:43.376 --> 05:45.412
REACH THE 21 DAY POINT IS TO

05:45.412 --> 05:47.214
STAY AWAY FROM CROWDS, I AM NOT

05:47.214 --> 05:49.649
TOUCHING ANYBODY, I AM BASICALLY

05:49.649 --> 05:51.084
BEHAVING THE SAME WAY I DID

05:51.084 --> 05:52.986
WHILE I WAS IN LIBERIA, WHICH IS

05:52.986 --> 05:54.921
DON'T TOUCH ANYBODY, NO HUGGING,

05:54.921 --> 05:56.623
NO KISSING NONE OF THAT AND

05:56.623 --> 05:58.258
DON'T ALLOW ANYBODY TO TOUCH ME.

05:58.258 --> 06:01.628
IF I DO GET SICK BY SOME CHANCE

06:01.628 --> 06:03.830
AND PEOPLE ARE, HAVE CONTACT, I

06:03.830 --> 06:05.365
WOULD LICK TO BE OH WOW SHE

06:05.365 --> 06:07.234
DIDN'T TOUCH ANYBODY FOR 21 DAYS

06:07.234 --> 06:09.669
SO YOU ARE NOT HAVING TO PUT

06:09.669 --> 06:10.637
OTHER PEOPLE UNDER OBSERVATION

06:10.637 --> 06:11.471
BECAUSE OF ME.

06:11.471 --> 06:12.806
>> THIS IS ADVICE FROM DOCTORS

06:12.806 --> 06:13.873
YOU GOT WHEN YOU CAME BACK OR

06:13.873 --> 06:14.708
THIS IS --

06:14.708 --> 06:16.109
>> NO, THIS IS NOT ADVICE.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.644
THIS IS MUCH MORE, I THINK WE

06:17.644 --> 06:19.312
ARE ALL TRYING TO FEEL OUR WAY

06:19.312 --> 06:21.748
AROUND THIS AND STRIKE A BALANCE

06:21.748 --> 06:23.583
BETWEEN CAUTION AND PANIC.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.185
I AM TAKING MY TEMPERATURE, I

06:25.185 --> 06:27.254
HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE INTIMATE,

06:27.254 --> 06:29.055
THE WAY MY TEMPERATURE IS IN MY

06:29.055 --> 06:32.025
LIFE AND I TEND TO STAY BETWEEN

06:32.025 --> 06:36.096
97.6 AND 98.4, EVEN THOUGH I DID

06:36.096 --> 06:38.031
ONCE GO UP TO 98.5 AND STREAK

06:38.031 --> 06:38.898
OUT.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.700
>> THE KRIENS IS THAT I AM NOT

06:40.700 --> 06:41.801
SICK BECAUSE I DIDN'T TOUCH

06:41.801 --> 06:43.036
ANYBODY WHILE I WAS IN LIBERIA

06:43.036 --> 06:45.105
AND YOU DON'T GET EBOLA UNLESS

06:45.105 --> 06:46.906
YOU COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE

06:46.906 --> 06:51.611
BODILY FLUIDS OF A SYMPTOMATIC

06:51.611 --> 06:53.146
EBOLA PATIENT BUT I UNDERSTAND A

06:53.146 --> 06:55.015
LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE

06:55.015 --> 06:57.083
AT THE IDEA OF BEING ANYBODY

06:57.083 --> 06:58.318
NEAR SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN TO

06:58.318 --> 07:00.220
HIGH BEREA SO IN A WAY THIS IS

07:00.220 --> 07:01.721
MUCH MORE PSYCHOLOGICAL BUT I

07:01.721 --> 07:03.390
ALSO THINK THERE IS SOME THINGS

07:03.390 --> 07:04.758
THAT WE MAYBE PERHAPS DON'T

07:04.758 --> 07:05.792
UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE DISEASE SO

07:05.792 --> 07:07.827
I AM JUST TRYING TO BE AS

07:07.827 --> 07:10.530
CAUTIOUS AS POSSIBLE AND TO SORT

07:10.530 --> 07:12.332
OF TREAT EVERYBODY I COME --

07:12.332 --> 07:14.034
EVERYBODY I SEE THE SAME WAY I

07:14.034 --> 07:16.002
WOULD TREAT MY FOUR-YEAR-OLD

07:16.002 --> 07:17.904
NEPHEW, WHO I DEFINITELY AM NOT

07:17.904 --> 07:19.606
TOUCHING FOR 21 DAYS.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.141
SO MY SORT OF THE WAY I AM

07:21.141 --> 07:23.543
LOOKING AT IT IS, OF IF I AM NOT

07:23.543 --> 07:25.312
GOING TO TOUCH COOPER FOR 21

07:25.312 --> 07:26.746
DAYS FOR 21 DAYS I WON'T TOUCH

07:26.746 --> 07:27.747
ANYBODY FOR 21 DAYS.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.215
>> PAINT A PICTURE WHAT IT WAS

07:29.215 --> 07:31.184
LIKE ON THE STREETS OF LIBERIA,

07:31.184 --> 07:32.752
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT HEALTHCARE

07:32.752 --> 07:34.020
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SOME OF THE

07:34.020 --> 07:35.255
IMAGES WE HAVE SEEN COMING FROM

07:35.255 --> 07:36.956
THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN SO GRAPHIC

07:36.956 --> 07:38.224
IN HOW PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY

07:38.224 --> 07:39.826
LYING ON THE GROUND OUTSIDE OF

07:39.826 --> 07:41.194
HOSPITALS WAITING FOR CARE.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.729
>> I DIDN'T SEE PEOPLE LYING ON

07:42.729 --> 07:44.064
THE GROUND OUTSIDE HOSPITALS

07:44.064 --> 07:45.865
BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE

07:45.865 --> 07:47.067
REPORTING ON THAT IS MAYBE A

07:47.067 --> 07:49.969
COUPLE OF WEEKS OLD, BUT WHAT

07:49.969 --> 07:51.638
YOU DO SEE ON THE STREET IN HIGH

07:51.638 --> 07:54.441
BEREA RIGHT NOW IS PEOPLE .. NOT

07:54.441 --> 07:55.642
TOUCHING, YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE

07:55.642 --> 07:56.976
HOLDING HANDS, YOU DON'T SEE

07:56.976 --> 07:58.578
PEOPLE HUGGING AND KISSING AND

07:58.578 --> 07:59.546
THAT SORT OF THING.

07:59.546 --> 08:02.382
THE DAILY LIFE OF THE LIBERIAN

08:02.382 --> 08:04.617
HAS IN MANY WAYS ALMOST COME TO

08:04.617 --> 08:05.452
A SCREECHING HALT.

08:05.452 --> 08:07.487
THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA HAS

08:07.487 --> 08:09.289
CLOSED ALL NONESSENTIAL SERVICES

08:09.289 --> 08:11.391
AND SCHOOLS ARE NOT OPEN, SO YOU

08:11.391 --> 08:13.426
HAVE, IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE

08:13.426 --> 08:14.861
ORDINARY LIBERIAN WHO DOES NOT

08:14.861 --> 08:17.097
HAVE EBOLA, THEY ARE DEALING

08:17.097 --> 08:18.498
WITH, YOU KNOW, TRANSPORTATION

08:18.498 --> 08:20.066
IS A LOT HARDER, THEY ARE NOT

08:20.066 --> 08:21.434
GOING INTO THE OFFICE AND ONE OF

08:21.434 --> 08:23.269
THE THINGS THAT REALLY STRUCK ME

08:23.269 --> 08:25.305
AS SO MANY PEOPLE WITH SCHOOL

08:25.305 --> 08:27.674
AGE CHILDREN ARE MOCK ARE,

08:27.674 --> 08:29.142
LOCKING THE KIDS UP IN THE HOUSE

08:29.142 --> 08:30.910
AND SO YOU DO HAVE A CASE FOR

08:30.910 --> 08:32.212
INSTANCE MY SISTER WHO IS A

08:32.212 --> 08:33.079
NINE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, MY

08:33.079 --> 08:34.147
THAT'S THAT'S HAS BEEN LOCKED IN

08:34.147 --> 08:36.349
THE HOUSE FOR TWO MONTHS SO IT

08:36.349 --> 08:38.618
IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR HER AND

08:38.618 --> 08:40.086
FOR THOSE SORTS OF PEOPLE BUT

08:40.086 --> 08:41.254
THEN YOU HAVE THE OTHER SIDE OF

08:41.254 --> 08:43.723
THE EQUATION, THESE ARE THE

08:43.723 --> 08:45.258
PEOPLE COMING IN CONTACT WITH

08:45.258 --> 08:46.860
EBOLA AND THERE YOU SEE

08:46.860 --> 08:50.263
SUFFERING OF THE MAGNITUDE THAT

08:50.263 --> 08:52.198
WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO SORT OF

08:52.198 --> 08:53.933
GET ANY HEAD AROUND BECAUSE ONE

08:53.933 --> 08:55.468
OF THE WORST THINGS ABOUT THIS

08:55.468 --> 08:57.737
DISEASE IS IT MAKES PARIAHS OUT

08:57.737 --> 08:59.172
OF THE PEOPLE WHO GET IT SO IF

08:59.172 --> 09:01.007
YOU GET EBOLA, PEOPLE AROUND YOU

09:01.007 --> 09:02.208
ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO TOUCH

09:02.208 --> 09:03.843
YOU, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO -- IT

09:03.843 --> 09:05.445
HAS BECOME YOU IMMEDIATELY

09:05.445 --> 09:06.813
BECOME, YOU ARE SICK, YOU ARE

09:06.813 --> 09:08.515
VOMITING AND HAVE DIARRHEA AND

09:08.515 --> 09:10.383
AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE SORT OF

09:10.383 --> 09:11.918
-- YOU ARE A MENACE TO ANYBODY

09:11.918 --> 09:13.086
ELSE AROUND YOU AN THAT'S ONE OF

09:13.086 --> 09:14.621
THE THINGS THAT REALLY STRUCK ME

09:14.621 --> 09:16.556
ABOUT IT AND YET IN THE MIDDLE

09:16.556 --> 09:18.258
OF ALL OF THAT YOU STILL HAVE

09:18.258 --> 09:19.692
PEOPLE TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF

09:19.692 --> 09:23.096
THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.031
AT GREAT PERIL TO THEMSELVES,

09:25.031 --> 09:26.433
PEOPLE NOW TO PUT ON GLOVES AND

09:26.433 --> 09:28.368
MASKS AND THAT SORT OF THING,

09:28.368 --> 09:29.869
BUT THIS IS A POOR COUNTRY WHERE

09:29.869 --> 09:31.204
EVERYBODY DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO

09:31.204 --> 09:33.973
THAT, SO IT IS REALLY

09:33.973 --> 09:35.408
HEARTBREAKING, IT IS ONE OF THE

09:35.408 --> 09:36.142
HARDEST REPORTING EXPERIENCES I

09:36.142 --> 09:37.010
HAVE EVER HAD.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.646
>> IS THE U.S. INTERVENTION WE

09:39.646 --> 09:41.047
HAD PLANNED ON DEPLOYING

09:41.047 --> 09:43.149
THOUSAND OF MARINES MARINES IN

09:43.149 --> 09:43.983
THE AREA, IS THAT MAKING A

09:43.983 --> 09:44.684
DIFFERENCE?

09:44.684 --> 09:45.752
>> NOT YET BUT IT IS STARTING

09:45.752 --> 09:46.553
TO.

09:46.553 --> 09:47.921
I WENT IN, WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED

09:47.921 --> 09:49.756
I CAME IN WITH THE U.S. MILITARY

09:49.756 --> 09:51.391
AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH

09:51.391 --> 09:52.826
THEM AND THEY ARE BUILDING,

09:52.826 --> 09:54.694
WORKING TOWARD BUILDING 17

09:54.694 --> 09:56.496
TREATMENT UNITS BUT IT IS

09:56.496 --> 09:57.297
DEFINITELY SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE

09:57.297 --> 09:58.531
IN A RACE AGAINST TIME AND THEY

09:58.531 --> 10:00.233
ARE TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE

10:00.233 --> 10:01.401
DISEASE THAT IS GALLOPING AHEAD

10:01.401 --> 10:02.669
OF THEM.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.370
SO THE CONSTRUCTION HAS STARTED

10:04.370 --> 10:06.005
WHILE I WAS THERE ON SEVERAL OF

10:06.005 --> 10:07.774
THESE CENTERS, THESE MILITARY

10:07.774 --> 10:09.375
GUYS ARE IN THERE AND THEY ARE

10:09.375 --> 10:10.577
DOING THEIR BEST AND THEY ARE

10:10.577 --> 10:12.178
GOING AS FAR AS -- AS FAST AS

10:12.178 --> 10:13.780
THEY CAN BUT THERE IS SOME

10:13.780 --> 10:15.381
FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THIS SORT OF

10:15.381 --> 10:16.316
THING TAKES TIME.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.184
IT IS NOT AS EASY OR AS FAST AS

10:18.184 --> 10:20.053
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.621
I THINK NOW WE ARE SEEING THE

10:21.621 --> 10:23.189
POINT NOW THEY HAVE STOOD UP ONE

10:23.189 --> 10:24.724
OF THE HOSPITALS AND THEY ARE

10:24.724 --> 10:25.758
WORKING ON SEVERAL OTHER THAT

10:25.758 --> 10:27.093
HAVE STARTED AND I THINK YOU ARE

10:27.093 --> 10:28.995
NOW SEEING THE POINT WHERE THAT

10:28.995 --> 10:30.663
YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE BENEFIT

10:30.663 --> 10:31.431
ON THE GROUND.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.800
ONE THING THAT REALLY, IT REALLY

10:33.800 --> 10:35.768
DID DO, I THINK, IS THE ARRIVAL

10:35.768 --> 10:37.837
OF THE AMERICAN MILITARY GAVE A

10:37.837 --> 10:39.772
LOT OF LIBERIANS HOPE, YOU KNOW,

10:39.772 --> 10:41.541
SORT OF LIKE HOPE THAT MAYBE

10:41.541 --> 10:42.542
OTHER PEOPLE ARE COMING IN TO

10:42.542 --> 10:43.476
HELP THEM.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.611
THEY ARE NOT ON THEIR OWN.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.312
THEY HAVE A LOT OF OPTIMISM WHEN

10:46.312 --> 10:47.413
THE AMERICAN MILITARY SHOWED UP.

10:47.413 --> 10:50.049
>> YES, AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE

10:50.049 --> 10:51.918
LIBERIAN PRESIDENT SAYING ON THE

10:51.918 --> 10:53.620
BBC NEWSHOUR, SORT OF WROTE A

10:53.620 --> 10:54.721
LETTER TO THE WORLD, QUOTE IT IS

10:54.721 --> 10:56.923
THE DUTY OF ALL OF US AS GLOBAL

10:56.923 --> 10:58.391
CITIZENS TO SEND A MESSAGE WE

10:58.391 --> 11:00.059
WILL NOT LEAVE MILLIONS OF WEST

11:00.059 --> 11:02.328
AFRICANS TO DEFEND FOR

11:02.328 --> 11:03.763
THEMSELVES AGAINST AN ENEMY WHOM

11:03.763 --> 11:04.664
THEY DO NOT KNOW AND HAVE NO

11:04.664 --> 11:05.365
DEFENSE.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.933
>> IT IS JUST -- IT IS TRAGIC

11:06.933 --> 11:08.368
THAT WE HAVE LITERALLY GOT A

11:08.368 --> 11:09.569
PRESIDENT NOW THAT IS JUST

11:09.569 --> 11:11.237
PLEADING FOR HELP AROUND FOR THE

11:11.237 --> 11:12.238
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO GET

11:12.238 --> 11:13.039
IN THERE.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.641
>> IT IS.

11:14.641 --> 11:18.144
THE WHOLE RESPONSE HAS BEEN A

11:18.144 --> 11:19.746
LOT SLOWER THAN THE DISEASE, AND

11:19.746 --> 11:20.914
THAT IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.448
I MEAN, I KEPT ASKING PEOPLE,

11:22.448 --> 11:25.285
WHY HAVE THEY TAKEN TO THE END

11:25.285 --> 11:27.253
OF SEPTEMBER FOR US TO START

11:27.253 --> 11:28.021
FOR THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

11:28.021 --> 11:29.055
TO GET?

11:29.055 --> 11:30.323
AND YOU KNOW, THERE IS NOT

11:30.323 --> 11:32.559
REALLY A REAL ANSWER TO THAT.

11:32.559 --> 11:33.826
EVERYBODY THOUGHT, IT SEEMS AS

11:33.826 --> 11:36.896
IF THE CDC, WHO, ALL OF THESE

11:36.896 --> 11:38.498
DIFFERENT ENTITIES THOUGHT THIS

11:38.498 --> 11:39.799
WAS GOING TO GO AWAY.

11:39.799 --> 11:42.001
IN MARCH WHEN THIS FIRST ENTERED

11:42.001 --> 11:43.202
LIBERIA, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A

11:43.202 --> 11:44.270
BRIEF MOMENT AND THEN THINGS

11:44.270 --> 11:46.072
SEEMED TO GET UNDER CONTROL AND

11:46.072 --> 11:48.374
THEN IT SHOWED UP AGAIN IN JUNE.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.543
AND SO IT TOOK A LONG TIME, A

11:50.543 --> 11:52.345
COUPLE OF PEOPLE EVEN SAID WELL

11:52.345 --> 11:54.113
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE ON VACATION,

11:54.113 --> 11:55.848
IT DIDN'T TAKE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE

11:55.848 --> 11:57.083
DIDN'T REALIZE HOW BIG OF A DEAL

11:57.083 --> 12:00.353
THIS WAS GOING TO BE AND THAT IS

12:00.353 --> 12:01.487
SORT OF THE FACT OF WHERE WE ARE

12:01.487 --> 12:02.322
RIGHT NOW.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.356
>> CONSIDERING YOU WERE ON THE

12:03.356 --> 12:05.291
STREETS IN LIBERIA WHERE EBOLA

12:05.291 --> 12:07.594
IS FAR MORE RAMPANT, COMPARED TO

12:07.594 --> 12:08.795
THE UNITED STATES, NOW THAT YOU

12:08.795 --> 12:10.930
ARE BACK, AND THE REACTION TO

12:10.930 --> 12:12.131
EBOLA THAT YOU MUST HAVE SEEN ON

12:12.131 --> 12:13.466
CABLE NEWS AND ELSEWHERE,

12:13.466 --> 12:15.001
COMPARE THE TWO FOR US.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.569
>> WELL, THAT IS A REALLY GOOD

12:16.569 --> 12:17.437
QUESTION.

12:17.437 --> 12:21.341
I HAVE TO SAY PEOPLE ARE LIKE A

12:21.341 --> 12:22.675
LOT MORE CALM THAN THEY ARE

12:22.675 --> 12:23.476
HERE.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.713
THEY SEEM -- THERE IS A

12:26.713 --> 12:29.449
RESIGNATION IN LIBERIA TO THIS

12:29.449 --> 12:30.450
-- THE FACT THEY ARE DEALING

12:30.450 --> 12:32.552
WITH THIS, AND LIBERIANS SEEM

12:32.552 --> 12:34.587
TO KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT HOW IT

12:34.587 --> 12:36.122
IS SPREAD AND THAT IS NATURAL HE

12:36.122 --> 12:36.923
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN DEALING

12:36.923 --> 12:37.991
WITH IT SINCE MARCH.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.627
SO PEOPLE IN LIBERIA, THE

12:40.627 --> 12:41.561
AVERAGE PERSON ON THE STREET,

12:41.561 --> 12:42.795
YOU KNOW, IS NOT TOUCHING

12:42.795 --> 12:44.998
ANYBODY BUT THEY ALSO SEEM TO

12:44.998 --> 12:46.566
KNOW YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CATCH

12:46.566 --> 12:47.767
EBOLA FROM SOMEBODY TOUCHING

12:47.767 --> 12:49.836
YOU, YOU ARE GOING TO CATCH

12:49.836 --> 12:52.505
EBOLA FROM A SIMILAR TICK.

12:52.505 --> 12:57.543
SYMPTOMATIC THAT IS KEY,

12:57.543 --> 12:58.611
SYMPTOMATIC EBOLA PATIENT SO YOU

12:58.611 --> 13:00.346
ARE NOT SEEING THE PANIC ON THE

13:00.346 --> 13:03.182
STREETS IN LIBERIA, NOT

13:03.182 --> 13:04.384
NECESSARILY ON STREETS HERE BUT

13:04.384 --> 13:05.918
YOU SEE WHEN YOU TURN ON CABLE

13:05.918 --> 13:07.553
NEWS AND YOU SEE, YOU HEAR ABOUT

13:07.553 --> 13:09.756
ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT INSTANCES

13:09.756 --> 13:10.690
OF PEOPLE THEIR CHILDREN FROM

13:10.690 --> 13:12.025
SCHOOL AND THAT SORT OF THING

13:12.025 --> 13:14.427
HERE AND I THINK THEIR TOLERANCE

13:14.427 --> 13:16.763
FOR RISK IS PROBABLY A LOT

13:16.763 --> 13:19.365
HIGHER THAN WE ARE HERE, THAT

13:19.365 --> 13:20.199
OUR TOLERANCE FOR RISK HERE IN

13:20.199 --> 13:21.334
THE UNITED STATES.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.236
>> ALL RIGHT, HELENE COOPER OF

13:23.236 --> 13:24.671
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" JOINING US

13:24.671 --> 13:26.406
UNDER HOUSE QUARANTINE, SO TO

13:26.406 --> 13:27.774
SPEAK IN WASHINGTON, D.C. VIA

13:27.774 --> 13:28.608
HER PHONE.

13:28.608 --> 13:29.575
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.177
>> THANK YOU.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.785
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

13:38.785 --> 13:40.820
SIGNATURE PIECE.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.789
LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, AFTER THE

13:42.789 --> 13:44.323
WEBSITE WHERE AMERICANS COULD

13:44.323 --> 13:45.324
SIGN UP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE

13:45.324 --> 13:46.659
UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

13:46.659 --> 13:48.227
WAS FINALLY FIXED, THERE WERE

13:48.227 --> 13:49.729
ALMOST DAILY REPORTS ABOUT HOW

13:49.729 --> 13:50.730
MANY PEOPLE WERE ENROLLING.

13:50.730 --> 13:51.731
THE IMPRESSION THAT MAY HAVE

13:51.731 --> 13:52.732
BEEN LEFT WAS THAT GETTING

13:52.732 --> 13:53.533
INSURANCE WOULD LEAD TO GETTING

13:53.533 --> 13:55.368
CARE.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.469
BUT A RECENT REPORT BY THE

13:56.469 --> 13:57.537
INSPECTOR GENERAL AT THE

13:57.537 --> 13:58.905
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

13:58.905 --> 14:00.206
SERVICES SAYS ACCESS TO MEDICAL

14:00.206 --> 14:01.074
CARE VARIES WIDELY FROM STATE TO

14:01.074 --> 14:02.709
STATE.

14:02.709 --> 14:03.910
AS A RESULT, IT SAYS, MEDICAID

MENTAL ILLNESS.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.447

SEEM TO BLEND IN WITH SOCIETY,

14:47.053 --> 14:49.889
WHAT SOCIETY SAYS WHAT THE WORLD

BADLY BY THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM.

15:42.441 --> 15:45.011
EITHER THEY HAVEN'T HAD

15:45.011 --> 15:46.445

ABLE TO GET CARE, OR THEY USED

EMERGENCY ROOMS IN HOSPITALS FOR

15:48.848 --> 15:50.183
THEIR CARE.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.684

PEOPLE AND CONVINCE THEM THAT

15:52.652 --> 15:53.486
THEY CAN GET HELP AND THEY CAN

17:13.933 --> 17:15.134
MEANS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

17:49.869 --> 17:50.937
MEAN YOU'RE GETTING THE COVERAGE

YOU NEED.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.441
FOR GAIL, SIGNING UP FOR

HER THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

18:09.689 --> 18:10.856
WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO WIND DOWN

CEASE.

BREAK THAT UP?

18:40.686 --> 18:42.088
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I FELT LIKE
