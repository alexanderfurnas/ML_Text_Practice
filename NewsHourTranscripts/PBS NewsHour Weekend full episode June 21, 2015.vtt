01:30.933 --> 01:33.067
LAST EVENING, HUNDREDS OF

01:33.067 --> 01:35.033
DEMONSTRATORS MARCHED PEACEFULLY

01:35.033 --> 01:36.400
THROUGH CHARLESTON, PROTESTING

RACISM AND MOURNING THE DEATHS

OF THE NINE SHOOTING VICTIMS.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.700
THE STATE CAPITAL, PROTESTERS

01:53.700 --> 01:54.967
DEMANDED THAT THE STATE

01:54.967 --> 01:56.500
LEGISLATURE REMOVE THE

CONFEDERATE BATTLE FLAG.

01:57.667 --> 02:00.700
TALK OF THE FLAG DOMINATED THE

02:00.700 --> 02:01.733
SUNDAY TALK SHOWS.

02:01.733 --> 02:02.933
ON ABC's "THIS WEEK," SOUTH

02:02.933 --> 02:04.300
CAROLINA LEGISLATOR AND PASTOR

02:04.300 --> 02:05.400
CARL ANDERSON SAID HE WILL

02:05.400 --> 02:06.667
SUPPORT A BILL TO REMOVE THE

02:06.667 --> 02:08.100
FLAG WHEN STATE LAWMAKERS

02:08.100 --> 02:09.533
RECONVENE EARLY NEXT YEAR.

02:09.533 --> 02:11.500
>> IT WILL BE A BIPARTISAN BILL

02:11.500 --> 02:13.000
FOR US TO MOVE THAT CONFEDERATE

02:13.000 --> 02:14.967
FLAG, PUT IT IN A MUSEUM

02:14.967 --> 02:16.267
SOMEWHERE IN COLUMBIA, WHERE IT

02:16.267 --> 02:17.333
WILL BE OFF OF THE STATE CAPITOL

02:17.333 --> 02:18.533
GROUNDS.

02:18.533 --> 02:19.733

02:21.233 --> 02:22.933
WILLIAM BROOKS TOLD CBS NEWS'

02:22.933 --> 02:25.500
FACE THE NATION THE CONFEDERATE

02:25.500 --> 02:26.600
FLAG REPRESENTS BIGOTRY.

02:26.600 --> 02:27.933
>> THERE ARE WHITE NATIONALIST

02:27.933 --> 02:29.267
GROUPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO

02:29.267 --> 02:31.100
SEE THAT FLAG AS REPRESENTING

02:31.100 --> 02:33.367
THEIR VALUES.

02:33.367 --> 02:35.167
IT'S AN ANACHRONISTIC EMBLEM OF

02:35.167 --> 02:36.933
A BYGONE ERA AT BEST, AND MOST

02:36.933 --> 02:40.167
LIKELY AND MOST REPRESENTATIVE

02:40.167 --> 02:42.367
OF A SET OF VALUES THAT RUN

02:42.367 --> 02:43.767
CONTRADICTORY, THAT RUN COUNTER

02:43.767 --> 02:45.233
TO WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS.

02:45.233 --> 02:46.233
IT HAS TO COME DOWN, IT MUST

02:46.233 --> 02:47.600
COME DOWN.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.233
>> Sreenivasan: BUT ON THE SAME

02:49.233 --> 02:50.933
BROADCAST, SOUTH CAROLINA

02:50.933 --> 02:52.200
REPUBLICAN SENATOR TIM SCOTT

02:52.200 --> 02:53.467
WOULD NOT SAY IF HE WANTED THE

02:53.467 --> 02:54.767
FLAG TO STAY OR GO.

02:54.767 --> 02:56.300
>> I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR

02:56.300 --> 02:58.067
STATE LEADERS GETTING TOGETHER

02:58.067 --> 02:59.667
AND HAVING A ROBUST CONVERSATION

02:59.667 --> 03:01.267
AFTER THE FUNERALS ABOUT WHAT'S

03:01.267 --> 03:04.233
THE NEXT STEP.

03:04.233 --> 03:05.667
>> Sreenivasan: FORMER

03:05.667 --> 03:06.667
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL

03:06.667 --> 03:07.700
CANDIDATE MITT ROMNEY CALLED FOR

03:07.700 --> 03:09.133
REMOVING THE FLAG FROM THE STATE

03:09.133 --> 03:10.267
CAPITOL GROUNDS IN A TWEET, BUT

03:10.267 --> 03:11.967
SOME CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL

03:11.967 --> 03:13.133
REPUBLICAN CONTENDERS SAY IT IS

03:13.133 --> 03:14.733
AN ISSUE FOR SOUTH CAROLINIANS

03:14.733 --> 03:16.200
TO SORT OUT.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.800
CANDIDATE AND FORMER SENATOR

03:17.800 --> 03:19.267
RICK SANTORUM SAID AS MUCH TO

03:19.267 --> 03:20.433
ABC'S MARTHA RADDATZ.

03:20.433 --> 03:21.600
>> I TAKE THE POSITION THAT THE

03:21.600 --> 03:22.567
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NO ROLE

03:22.567 --> 03:23.500
IN THIS.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.667
>> BUT YOU'RE A CANDIDATE, YOU

03:24.667 --> 03:26.933
TAKE NO POSITION?

03:26.933 --> 03:29.600
>> I'M NOT A SOUTH CAROLINIAN,

03:29.600 --> 03:32.200
THESE ARE DECISIONS TO BE MADE.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.367
I DON'T THINK FEDERAL CANDIDATES

03:33.367 --> 03:34.600
SHOULD BE MAKING DECISIONS OR

03:34.600 --> 03:43.833
OPINING.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.033
>> Sreenivasan: LIKE MANY ALL

03:45.033 --> 03:46.367
BLACK CHURCHES IN THE SOUTH,

03:46.367 --> 03:48.000
CHARLESTON'S A.M.E. CHURCH HAS

03:48.000 --> 03:49.433
FACED RACIALLY MOTIVATED

03:49.433 --> 03:50.700
VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT ITS 200-YEAR

03:50.700 --> 03:51.800
HISTORY, FORCING ITS DOORS TO BE

03:51.800 --> 03:52.733
SHUT SEVERAL TIMES.

03:52.733 --> 03:53.500
NEWSHOUR'S IVETTE FELICIANO

03:53.500 --> 03:56.567
REPORTS.

03:56.567 --> 03:57.867
>> Reporter: IT'S ONE OF THE

03:57.867 --> 03:58.867
MOST HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT

03:58.867 --> 04:00.267
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS IN THE

04:00.267 --> 04:05.767
SOUTH WITH A FORMATION IS

04:05.767 --> 04:06.733
CLOSELY TIED TO CHARLESTON'S

04:06.733 --> 04:07.667
HISTORY AS A MAJOR SLAVE TRADE

04:07.667 --> 04:10.933
PORT.

04:10.933 --> 04:12.000
IN THE EARLY 1800S A FREED SLAVE

04:12.000 --> 04:13.067
LEFT HIS METHODIST CHURCH IN

04:13.067 --> 04:14.433
PROTEST OF DISCRIMINATORY RULES

04:14.433 --> 04:15.533
AGAINST ITS BLACK MEMBERS.

04:15.533 --> 04:17.133
MORRIS BROWN BECAME THE FIRST

04:17.133 --> 04:18.367
ORDAINED MINISTER OF THE AFRICAN

04:18.367 --> 04:20.933
METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH AND

04:20.933 --> 04:22.233
ALIGNED THE GROUP WITH THE "FREE

04:22.233 --> 04:23.833
AFRICAN SOCIETY" FOUNDED THREE

04:23.833 --> 04:28.933
DECADES EARLIER IN

04:28.933 --> 04:29.967
DECADES EARLIER IN PHILADELPHIA.

04:29.967 --> 04:31.733
THOUSANDS OF THE CHARLESTON'S

04:31.733 --> 04:33.933
BLACK WORSHIPPERS FOLLOWED HIM.

04:33.933 --> 04:34.800
IN 1822 THE BUILDING WAS BURNED

04:34.800 --> 04:36.133
DOWN BY AN ANGRY MOB OF WHITE

04:36.133 --> 04:38.333
SUPREMACISTS AFTER CHURCH

04:38.333 --> 04:39.600
LEADERS WERE ACCUSED OF TRYING

04:39.600 --> 04:40.633
TO ORGANIZE A SLAVE REVOLT, FOR

04:40.633 --> 04:41.833
WHICH DOZENS OF THE ACCUSED WERE

04:41.833 --> 04:43.100
TRIED AND EXECUTED.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.133
IN 1834, SOUTH CAROLINA OUTLAWED

04:45.133 --> 04:46.933
ALL BLACK CHURCHES, FORCING THE

04:46.933 --> 04:49.800
CONGREGATION TO GO UNDERGROUND

04:49.800 --> 04:52.000
UNTIL THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.633
AFTER REORGANIZING, THE CHURCH

04:54.633 --> 04:58.467
ADDED THE WORD "EMANUEL" TO ITS

04:58.467 --> 04:59.467
NAME, HEBREW FOR "GOD IS WITH

04:59.467 --> 05:00.500
US".

05:00.500 --> 05:05.400
IN 1886 THE BUILDING WAS RAVAGED

05:05.400 --> 05:06.267
BY AN EARTHQUAKE AND REBUILT

05:06.267 --> 05:08.800
FIVE YEARS LATER WITH THE NOW

05:08.800 --> 05:09.667
ICONIC STEEPLE.

05:09.667 --> 05:10.967
IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED

05:10.967 --> 05:12.600
LUMINARIES SUCH AS BOOKER T.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.667
WASHINGTON AND MARTIN LUTHER

05:14.667 --> 05:15.733
KING JR. VISITED THE CHURCH.

05:15.733 --> 05:17.433
AND TODAY, ONCE AGAIN FOLLOWING

05:17.433 --> 05:18.633
AN ACT OF VIOLENCE, THE CHURCH

05:18.633 --> 05:20.467
HAS REOPENED ITS DOORS,

05:20.467 --> 05:21.933
MAINTAINING ITS POSITION AS

05:21.933 --> 05:25.167
BEACON OF COMFORT AND STRENGTH

05:25.167 --> 05:34.667
FOR THE CITY'S BLACK POPULATION.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.933
>> Sreenivasan: NOW TO GREECE,

05:35.933 --> 05:37.267
WHERE PRIME MINISTER ALEXIS

05:37.267 --> 05:38.800
TSIPRAS IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME

05:38.800 --> 05:41.000
TO SAVE HIS COUNTRY FROM

05:41.000 --> 05:42.100
POTENTIAL ECONOMIC COLLAPSE.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.400
TSIPRAS WILL MAKE HIS CASE FOR

05:43.400 --> 05:44.967
FINANCIAL RELIEF AT AN EMERGENCY

05:44.967 --> 05:46.267
EUROZONE SUMMIT TOMORROW, HOPING

05:46.267 --> 05:48.733
TO HEAD OFF A LOOMING ONE-POINT-

05:48.733 --> 05:50.067
SIX BILLION EURO DEBT PAYMENT

05:50.067 --> 05:53.133
WHICH IS DUE BY JUNE 30TH.

05:53.133 --> 05:54.433
WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER IAN

05:54.433 --> 05:55.633
TALLEY JOINS ME TO EXPLAIN

05:55.633 --> 05:58.400
WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THESE

05:58.400 --> 06:01.100
NEGOTIATIONS.

06:01.100 --> 06:03.067
>> SO IAN, WE ALL KIND OF HAVE

06:03.067 --> 06:05.100
THIS DEBT FATIGUE, THIS CYCLE,

06:05.100 --> 06:07.367
GROSS IS ON THE BRINK, GREECE IS

06:07.367 --> 06:10.367
NOT ON THE BRINK.

06:10.367 --> 06:11.300
HOW SIGNIFICANTLY IS THIS?

06:11.300 --> 06:15.200
>> TOMORROW IS A CRITICAL

06:15.200 --> 06:17.033
JUNCTURE.

06:17.033 --> 06:19.233
A FAILURE TO GET AGREEMENT AFTER

06:19.233 --> 06:20.767
MONTHS OF NEGOTIATIONS.

06:20.767 --> 06:22.667
WHAT'S AT STAKE IS A FAILED

06:22.667 --> 06:24.167
STATE IN EUROPE.

06:24.167 --> 06:26.533
AT STAKE IS POTENTIAL FINANCIAL

06:26.533 --> 06:28.333
CONTAGION.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.467
SOME PEOPLE SAY EUROPE IS BETTER

06:30.467 --> 06:34.967
PREPARED BUT AS BEN BERNANKE

06:34.967 --> 06:36.700
SAID, THE FINANCES WEREN'T

06:36.700 --> 06:38.933
REALLY AT HANDS BEFORE THE

06:38.933 --> 06:40.933
FINANCIAL CRISIS NO ONE KNOWS

06:40.933 --> 06:41.967
HOW BAD THINGS COULD GET.

06:41.967 --> 06:44.500
>> WE SAW VIDEO OF PEOPLE TAKING

06:44.500 --> 06:47.733
OUT MONEY FROM ATMs ABOUT

06:47.733 --> 06:49.200
WHAT'S SO UNCERTAIN WHAT'S GOING

06:49.200 --> 06:49.767
TO HAPPEN TOMORROW.

06:49.767 --> 06:50.433
>> YEAH.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.000
I THINK IF THERE'S A DECISION

06:52.000 --> 06:53.267
TOMORROW, A DEAL THEN THERE

06:53.267 --> 06:55.367
COULD BE A SLOW UNWINDING OF THE

06:55.367 --> 06:57.067
CRISIS OVER THE MONTHS.

06:57.067 --> 06:58.967
BUT FEW PEOPLE ARE GIVING THAT

06:58.967 --> 07:02.667
DEAL A -- GOOD ODDS.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.267
MORE LIKELY IS FAILURE TO GET

07:04.267 --> 07:05.633
AGREEMENT AND TUESDAY COMES

07:05.633 --> 07:08.433
ALONG AND THERE'S BASICALLY

07:08.433 --> 07:11.167
FINANCIAL MARTIAL LAW IMPOSED.

07:11.167 --> 07:13.500
CAPITAL CONTROLS SO THAT FRANTIC

07:13.500 --> 07:16.167
CUSTOMERS, MARKETS, DEPOSITORS

07:16.167 --> 07:18.167
CAN'T TAKE THEIR CASH OUT EN

07:18.167 --> 07:20.233
MASSE WHICH WOULD PUT GREECE

07:20.233 --> 07:23.367
ALREADY IN A CRISIS INTO A

07:23.367 --> 07:25.067
FINANCIAL MAELSTROM.

07:25.067 --> 07:27.767
>> WHAT HAPPENS WITH THEIRS

07:27.767 --> 07:29.700
POSITION IN THE EURO ZONE IF

07:29.700 --> 07:33.333
THIS DEBT DEAL DOESN'T GOES

07:33.333 --> 07:34.467
THROUGH?

07:34.467 --> 07:36.567
>> MANY HAVE BEEN WARNING OF A

07:36.567 --> 07:37.200
FINANCIAL EXIT.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.933
NO ONE'S RULING THAT OUT.

07:38.933 --> 07:40.133
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE

07:40.133 --> 07:42.067
OTHER POSSIBILITIES THAT GREECE

07:42.067 --> 07:47.800
COULD ISSUE IOU'S DENOMINATED IN

07:47.800 --> 07:49.733
EUROS, THEY COULD KEEP IT WITHIN

07:49.733 --> 07:51.933
THE EURO ZONE, STILL HAVING A

07:51.933 --> 07:53.467
FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL CRISIS.

07:53.467 --> 07:56.200
THERE IS VERY MUCH A RISK OF A

07:56.200 --> 07:56.933
GREEK EXIT.

07:56.933 --> 07:59.933
I THINK ANOTHER WORRY ABOUT NOT

07:59.933 --> 08:01.500
JUST GREECE EXITING IS THAT

08:01.500 --> 08:04.500
BEING THE FIRST DOMINO OF OTHER

08:04.500 --> 08:06.000
POLITICAL FACTIONS GAINING

08:06.000 --> 08:07.933
GROUND IN EUROPE THAT ALSO WANT

08:07.933 --> 08:08.933
TO LEAVE EUROPE.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.667
THOUGH MANY ANALYSTS AND

08:16.667 --> 08:19.233

MEMBERS OF A FUTURE PALESTINIAN

16:28.633 --> 16:29.500
STATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE LINE.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.667
THE PROPOSAL MIGHT HAVE BEEN

16:30.667 --> 16:32.633
CAMPAIGN SLOGANEERING-- MOST

16:32.633 --> 16:33.767
ANALYSTS CONSIDER THE SWAP IDEA

16:33.767 --> 16:35.100
A NON-STARTER.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.200
BUT SOME ARABS CALL IT A MOVE TO

16:37.200 --> 16:38.233
DE-LEGITIMIZE THEIR CITIZENSHIP.

16:38.233 --> 16:39.233
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU DOESN'T

16:39.233 --> 16:40.433
SUPPORT THE SWAP PLAN.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.967
AND SPOKESMAN MARK REGEV SAYS

16:41.967 --> 16:43.567
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SPENT ONE AND

16:43.567 --> 16:45.467
A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE

16:45.467 --> 16:46.933
LAST FIVE YEARS TO HELP CLOSE

16:46.933 --> 16:49.967
THE GAP BETWEEN ARAB AND OTHER

16:49.967 --> 16:54.867
CITIZENS.

16:54.867 --> 16:55.900
THAT'S $200 PER PERSON PER YEAR,

16:55.900 --> 16:56.667
SPENT ON.

16:56.667 --> 16:57.667
>> EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE,

16:57.667 --> 16:59.533
HOUSING, OTHER SERVICES FOR THE

16:59.533 --> 17:01.367
ARAB COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY TO

17:01.367 --> 17:02.467
NARROW THOSE GAPS, WHICH ARE

17:02.467 --> 17:04.800
UNACCEPTABLE QUITE FRANKLY.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.233
>> Reporter: BUT THAT'S NOWHERE

17:06.233 --> 17:07.233
NEAR ENOUGH, SAYS ODETTE HILWI,

17:07.233 --> 17:08.600
WHO RUNS A SCHOOL IN THE

17:08.600 --> 17:09.600
NORTHERN TOWN OF ACRE ON

17:09.600 --> 17:11.200
ISRAEL'S COAST, FUNDED BY AN

17:11.200 --> 17:12.500
NGO, PAYMENTS FROM PARENTS WHO

17:12.500 --> 17:14.033
CAN AFFORD IT, AND SMALL

17:14.033 --> 17:16.233
GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES.

17:16.233 --> 17:17.467
SHE SAYS ARAB ISRAELI DAYCARE

17:17.467 --> 17:19.100
CENTERS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY,

17:19.100 --> 17:20.567
SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

17:20.567 --> 17:22.767
CLASSROOMS, AND ALL THAT MEANS

17:22.767 --> 17:24.433
ARAB ISRAELI CHILDREN GET A

17:24.433 --> 17:25.567
WORSE EDUCATION THAN JEWISH

17:25.567 --> 17:31.633
CHILDREN.

17:31.633 --> 17:32.567
>> (translated): IF THERE

17:32.567 --> 17:33.533
WOULD BE MONEY I WOULD OPEN A

17:33.533 --> 17:34.967
KIDS CLUB HERE, BUT WE NEED

17:34.967 --> 17:36.400
MONEY, A PLACE TO HELP WITH

17:36.400 --> 17:37.267
HOMEWORK AND TO PLAY.

PARLIAMENT, ARAB LAWMAKERS

17:39.367 --> 17:40.467
AGREE.

17:40.467 --> 17:41.467
THEY SAY A LOT MORE IS NEEDED

17:41.467 --> 17:57.600
THAN JUST TALK.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.933
REPORT REVEALS THAT THE WORLD'S

18:13.933 --> 18:17.167
REFUGEE CRISIS IS GETTING WORSE.

18:17.167 --> 18:20.600
THESE NUMBERS HAVE GROWN TO 59.5

18:20.600 --> 18:21.700
MILLION, A 40% INCREASE WITHIN A

18:21.700 --> 18:24.033
SPAN OF JUST THREE YEARS.

18:24.033 --> 18:28.933
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT, THE

18:28.933 --> 18:30.000
THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF THE

18:30.000 --> 18:31.067
ENTIRE POPULATION OF ITALY,

18:31.067 --> 18:32.200
EITHER FLEEING WAR ZONES, ETHNIC

18:32.200 --> 18:33.233
OR POLITICAL PERSECUTION.

18:33.233 --> 18:34.333
FOR SOME INSIGHT ON THE CRISIS,

18:34.333 --> 18:35.500
YESTERDAY I SPOKE WITH SOMINI

18:35.500 --> 18:39.633
SENGUPTA OF THE NEW YORK TIMES.

18:39.633 --> 18:40.433
I BEGAN BY ASKING HER TO PUT THE

18:40.433 --> 18:41.367
60 MILLION IN PERSPECTIVE.

18:41.367 --> 18:42.433
>> WHAT THAT MEANS IS, OF THOSE

18:42.433 --> 18:44.567
60 MILLION, ABOUT 14 MILLION OF

18:44.567 --> 18:46.267
THEM WERE FORCED TO FLEE IN THE

18:46.267 --> 18:48.367
LAST YEAR.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.933
AND THE REST HAVE JUST BEEN

18:50.933 --> 18:51.267
STUCK.

18:51.267 --> 18:52.967
BECAUSE THE CONFLICTS IN THEIR

18:52.967 --> 18:54.867
HOME LANDS HAVE NOT SUBSIDED.

18:54.867 --> 18:55.900
AT ALL.

18:55.900 --> 18:56.933
AND SOME OF THEM ARE STUCK FOR

18:56.933 --> 18:58.067
GENERATIONS.

18:58.067 --> 19:00.267
>> SO WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING

19:00.267 --> 19:02.267
ABOUT POVERTY OR ECONOMIC

19:02.267 --> 19:03.467
OPPORTUNITY PEOPLE CHOOSING TO

19:03.467 --> 19:04.667
LEAVE BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO

19:04.667 --> 19:06.433
ARE FORCED TO LEAVE.

19:06.433 --> 19:07.133
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:07.133 --> 19:08.467
YES.

19:08.467 --> 19:10.800
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE WHO THE

19:10.800 --> 19:13.300
UNITED NATIONS CALLS REFUGEES OR

19:13.300 --> 19:14.167
DISPLACED PEOPLE.

19:14.167 --> 19:14.967
THEY ARE FLEEING WAR OR

19:14.967 --> 19:15.767
PERSECUTION.

19:15.767 --> 19:17.633
THEY ARE NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE

19:17.633 --> 19:18.933
LEAVING HOME TO FIND A BETTER

19:18.933 --> 19:22.833
LIFE ABROAD LIKE MY PARENTS DID,

19:22.833 --> 19:24.533
LIKE MANY AMERICANS DID.

19:24.533 --> 19:27.400
THESE ARE PEOPLE BEING FORCED TO

19:27.400 --> 19:27.933
FLEE.

19:27.933 --> 19:30.267
THEY THINK THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO

19:30.267 --> 19:31.533
GO AWAY FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS

19:31.533 --> 19:34.067
BUT THEY ARE STUCK IN A REFUGEE

19:34.067 --> 19:35.933
CAMP WHERE THEY LACK PROPER FOOD

19:35.933 --> 19:37.933
OR WATER, OFTEN THEIR KIDS ARE

19:37.933 --> 19:38.700
NOT IN SCHOOL FOR YEARS AT A

19:38.700 --> 19:39.767
TIME.

19:39.767 --> 19:42.933
>> OKAY AND WHERE ARE SOME OF

19:42.933 --> 19:44.267
THESE PATHWAYS HAPPENING, WHERE

19:44.267 --> 19:46.133
ARE THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE

19:46.133 --> 19:47.767
CREATING THE REFUGEES AND WHERE

19:47.767 --> 19:48.833
DO THEY LAND?

19:48.833 --> 19:50.400
>> SYRIA REMAINS FOR THE LAST

19:50.400 --> 19:52.267
COUPLE OF YEARS THE LARGEST

19:52.267 --> 19:53.667
SINGLE DRIVER OF THIS.

19:53.667 --> 19:56.500
THERE ARE 7.9 MILLION SYRIANS

19:56.500 --> 19:57.600
WHO ARE DISPLACED.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.700
SOME OF THEM ARE STILL INSIDE

19:59.700 --> 20:01.567
SYRIA BUT MANY HAVE LEFT IN THE

20:01.567 --> 20:02.933
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.

20:02.933 --> 20:06.767
TURKEY IS TODAY THE NUMBER ONE

20:06.767 --> 20:10.033
HOSTING COUNTRY THERE ARE 1.5

20:10.033 --> 20:11.300
MILLION SYRIANS IN TURKEY.

20:11.300 --> 20:13.333
>> IT IS A STRAIN ON TURKEY.

20:13.333 --> 20:16.267
>> ABSOLUTELY.

20:16.267 --> 20:25.033
TURKEY, LEN -- LEBANON, JORDAN.

20:25.033 --> 20:28.200
JORDAN, WATER SCARCE, CAUSES A

20:28.200 --> 20:30.133
LOT OF TENSION NECESSARY THOSE

20:30.133 --> 20:30.733
COUNTRIES SOMETIMES.

20:30.733 --> 20:32.433
ONE OF THE REVEALING THINGS IN

20:32.433 --> 20:34.533
THIS REPORT IS THAT ONE IN FOUR

20:34.533 --> 20:36.333
DISPLACED PEOPLE ONE IN FOUR

20:36.333 --> 20:37.600
REFUGEES ARE ACTUALLY IN THE

20:37.600 --> 20:38.967
POOREST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.

20:38.967 --> 20:42.533
SO FOR EXAMPLE, ETHIOPIA, ONE OF

20:42.533 --> 20:45.400
THE POOREST NATIONS ON EARTH HAS

20:45.400 --> 20:47.367
SOMETHING LIKE 600,000 REFUGEES.

20:47.367 --> 20:49.400
>> THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE

20:49.400 --> 20:50.133
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THEM

20:50.133 --> 20:50.933
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:50.933 --> 20:51.833
>> NOT AT ALL.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.800
>> YOU HAVE MENTIONED THE

20:53.800 --> 20:55.333
REACTIONS HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IN

20:55.333 --> 20:56.867
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD.

20:56.867 --> 20:58.567
EUROPE IS TIGHTENING, WE HAVE

20:58.567 --> 21:02.633
SEEN THE BOAT PEOPLE ACROSS THE

21:02.633 --> 21:04.667
MEDITERRANEAN, THE TRAGEDIES,

21:04.667 --> 21:07.267
AND THE BOATS THAT HAVE BEEN

21:07.267 --> 21:08.967
SUNK OR SINKING.

21:08.967 --> 21:11.933
WHAT IS EUROPE STRUGGLING WITH

21:11.933 --> 21:16.933
COMPARED TO TURKEY TAKES 1 MUCH

21:16.933 --> 21:20.500
6 -- 1.6 MILLION SO FAR RIGHT?

21:20.500 --> 21:25.067
>> IF THEY CAN SETTLE AMONG

21:25.067 --> 21:33.067
THEIR 28 MEMBER STATES, 40,000

21:33.067 --> 21:36.200
REFUGEES, VERSUS 600,000 IN

21:36.200 --> 21:36.800
ETHIOPIA ITSELF.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.067
>> THE LONG TERM IMPACT, EXPLAIN

21:38.067 --> 21:39.500
THAT.

21:39.500 --> 21:42.667
>> THE LONG TERM ASPECT CAN BE

21:42.667 --> 21:46.200
ESPECIALLY HARD, FOR WOMEN AND

21:46.200 --> 21:48.467
CHILDREN.

21:48.467 --> 21:51.267
CHILDREN DON'T GO TO SCHOOL FOR

21:51.267 --> 21:51.933
YEARS.

21:51.933 --> 21:55.867
IN SYRIA HIGH LEVEL OF LIT READY

21:55.867 --> 21:57.400
BUT CAN'T GET A JOB.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.633
REFUGEES ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WORK

21:59.633 --> 22:01.200
IN MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.933
WOMEN IF THEY'RE RUNNING AWAY

22:02.933 --> 22:04.200
FROM HOME BY THEMSELVES WITH

22:04.200 --> 22:05.700
THEIR CHILDREN ARE ESPECIALLY

22:05.700 --> 22:07.133
VULNERABLE.

22:07.133 --> 22:09.700
SEXUAL HARASSMENT, RAPE, ALL

22:09.700 --> 22:12.133
KINDS OF PROTECTION ISSUES FOR

22:12.133 --> 22:13.233
WOMEN.

22:13.233 --> 22:15.267
>> OKAY SOMINI SENGUPTA OF THE

22:15.267 --> 22:17.933
NEW YORK TIMES, THANKS SO MUCH.

22:17.933 --> 22:22.933

22:47.500 --> 22:49.100
AT THE SAME TIME, THE LAWMAKERS

22:49.100 --> 22:51.933
ARE DEMANDING COMPLETE REMOVAL

22:51.933 --> 22:53.100
OF ALL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS IN

EXCHANGE FOR ANY NUCLEAR PACT.

22:54.733 --> 22:56.433
THE VOTE HAS NOT BEEN ENACTED

22:56.433 --> 22:58.233
INTO LAW, BUT IT DOES CONTRADICT

22:58.233 --> 23:00.567
A TENTATIVE AGREEMENT IRANIAN

23:00.567 --> 23:02.700
NEGOTIATORS MADE WITH CHINA,

U.S. AND GERMANY, THAT ALLOWS

23:17.200 --> 23:18.433
PERCENT HIGHER THAN IT WAS A

23:18.433 --> 23:19.733
YEAR AGO.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.833
IN THE WAKE OF A SCANDAL OVER

23:21.833 --> 23:22.933
FALSE RECORDS AND LONG WAITING

23:22.933 --> 23:24.167
LISTS, THE DEPARTMENT OF

23:24.167 --> 23:25.500
VETERANS AFFAIRS EXPANDED ITS

23:25.500 --> 23:26.700
PATIENT CAPACITY.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.200
BUT ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK

23:28.200 --> 23:29.733
TIMES, THE V.A. DID NOT

23:29.733 --> 23:31.333
ANTICIPATE THE DEMAND FOR

23:31.333 --> 23:32.600
MEDICAL CARE WOULD CONTINUE TO

23:32.600 --> 23:33.733
SOAR.

23:33.733 --> 23:35.233
THE V.A. IS ALSO FACING A NEARLY

23:35.233 --> 23:36.500
$3 BILLION BUDGET SHORTFALL.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.300
THE AGENCY IS REPORTEDLY

CONSIDERING FURLOUGHS AND HIRING

23:39.467 --> 23:43.933
FREEZES.

23:43.933 --> 23:44.833
AND IN RURAL VIRGINIA: AN

23:44.833 --> 23:46.333
INFUSION OF FUNDING AND A CHANGE

23:46.333 --> 23:48.400
IN LEADERSHIP COULD KEEP A

23:48.400 --> 23:49.667
HISTORIC PRIVATE WOMEN'S COLLEGE

23:49.667 --> 23:50.567
OPEN, AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT

23:50.567 --> 23:51.600
YEAR.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.033
IN MARCH, SWEET BRIAR COLLEGE

23:53.033 --> 23:54.600

AFTER MORE THAN 100 YEARS OF

23:56.367 --> 23:57.400
SERVICE.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.067
BUT GRADUATES COLLECTED

23:59.067 --> 24:00.367
$12 MILLION IN PLEDGES.

24:00.367 --> 24:02.067
LAST NIGHT, THE STATE'S ATTORNEY

24:02.067 --> 24:03.633
GENERAL ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT

24:03.633 --> 24:05.100

24:05.100 --> 24:07.200
THE MONEY WHILE THE SCHOOL MAKES

24:07.200 --> 24:08.133
SWEEPING CHANGES IN LEADERSHIP.

24:08.133 --> 24:09.233
A JUDGE STILL NEEDS TO APPROVE

24:09.233 --> 24:11.300
THE DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.700
AS WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT,

24:22.700 --> 24:24.133
CONGREGANTS IN CHURCHES ACROSS

SOUTH CAROLINA ARE PLANNING A

24:25.667 --> 24:27.633
SPECIAL CHURCH SERVICE OUTSIDE

MOTHER EMANUEL THIS EVENING.

24:29.267 --> 24:30.833
THE CHURCH OPENED THIS MORNING

24:30.833 --> 24:32.100
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE A LONE

24:32.100 --> 24:33.633
GUNMAN SHOT NINE PARISHIONERS
