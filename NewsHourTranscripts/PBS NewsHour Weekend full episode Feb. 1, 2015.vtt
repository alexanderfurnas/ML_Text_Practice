POPULATION AND GENETICALLY

00:23.290 --> 00:24.925

00:52.419 --> 00:53.320
THE GOVERNMENT OF JORDAN TODAY

00:54.421 --> 00:55.389
WOMAN BOMBER IT'S HELD FOR

00:55.389 --> 00:57.958
NEARLY A DECADE, IF THE

00:57.958 --> 00:58.692
EXTREMIST GROUP KNOWN AS ISIS

00:58.692 --> 00:59.493
FREES A JORDANIAN PILOT IT'S

00:59.493 --> 01:00.027
HOLDING.

01:00.027 --> 01:01.261
JORDANIAN OFFICIALS HAVE

01:01.261 --> 01:02.262
DEMANDED PROOF THAT THE PILOT IS

01:02.262 --> 01:05.165
STILL ALIVE BEFORE ANY DEAL CAN

01:54.448 --> 01:55.816
BOKO HARAM HOPES TO MAKE THE

01:55.816 --> 01:56.850
CITY THE CAPITAL OF A BREAKAWAY

01:56.850 --> 01:59.653
ISLAMIST STATE.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.321

02:01.321 --> 02:02.756
ESCALATE IN EASTERN UKRAINE,

DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS FOR THE

02:27.381 --> 02:30.017
TERRITORY'S NEXT LEADER IN 2017.

02:30.017 --> 02:31.718
LAST SUMMER, CHINESE LEGISLATORS

02:31.718 --> 02:33.320
APPROVED A PLAN THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:33.320 --> 02:35.088
BEIJING TO SCREEN THE CANDIDATES

02:35.088 --> 02:36.823
FIRST, A MOVE WHICH PROMPTED

02:36.823 --> 02:38.425
PRO-DEMOCRACY PROTESTS THAT SHUT

02:38.425 --> 02:39.593
DOWN PARTS OF THE CITY FOR

02:39.593 --> 02:42.095
ALMOST THREE MONTHS LAST YEAR.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.663
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES

02:45.098 --> 02:47.434
FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH AND HELPED

02:47.434 --> 02:48.668

02:48.668 --> 02:49.970
TODAY OF HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN

02:49.970 --> 02:51.571
BOEHNER'S DECISION TO INVITE

02:54.307 --> 02:54.975
WITHOUT CONSULTING THE WHITE

02:54.975 --> 02:56.476
HOUSE FIRST.

02:56.476 --> 02:57.344
>> IS THAT A SIGNIFICANT BREACH

02:57.344 --> 03:01.148
OF PROTOCOL?

03:01.148 --> 03:04.117
>> YES.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.719

03:07.921 --> 03:09.056
>> WELL, I DON'T, I CAN'T

03:09.056 --> 03:09.890
REMEMBER AN INCIDENT WHERE IT'S

03:09.890 --> 03:11.091
EVER BEEN DONE.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.025
NOW LET ME SAY THIS, THE SPEAKER

03:12.025 --> 03:13.093
OF THE HOUSE CAN INVITE WHOEVER

03:13.093 --> 03:13.927
HE WANTS TO SPEAK TO THE HOUSE,

03:13.927 --> 03:14.661
IT'S A CO-EQUAL BRANCH OF

03:14.661 --> 03:15.328
GOVERNMENT.

03:15.328 --> 03:16.930
BUT IT IS BEST DONE, OUR FOREIGN

03:16.930 --> 03:18.131
POLICY IS BEST DONE, WHEN THERE

03:18.131 --> 03:19.733
IS AT LEAST COOPERATION BETWEEN

03:19.733 --> 03:20.567
THE LEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE

03:20.567 --> 03:22.669
BRANCHES.

03:22.669 --> 03:24.071
>> Brangham: PRESIDENT OBAMA

03:24.071 --> 03:25.505
WILL ASK CONGRESS TO INCREASE

03:25.505 --> 03:26.940
CORPORATE TAXES, AND TAXES ON

03:27.874 --> 03:28.675
HE'LL SUBMIT TO CONGRESS

03:28.675 --> 03:30.043
TOMORROW.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.611
A WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL TOLD

03:31.611 --> 03:33.013
REPORTERS THAT THE PRESIDENT

03:33.013 --> 03:35.115
WILL ASK LAWMAKERS TO APPROVE A

03:35.115 --> 03:36.917
ONE-TIME 14% TAX ON $2 TRILLION

03:36.917 --> 03:38.351
WORTH OF CORPORATE PROFITS

03:38.351 --> 03:40.053
EARNED AND HELD OVERSEAS.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.621
THIS, TO HELP PAY FOR A SERIES

03:41.621 --> 03:42.489
OF PROPOSED BIG PUBLIC WORKS

03:42.489 --> 03:43.924
PROJECTS.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.826
THE PRESIDENT ALSO WANTS TO

03:45.826 --> 03:47.260
CLOSE WHAT HE CALLS THE "TRUST

03:47.260 --> 03:48.695
FUND LOOPHOLE" BY REQUIRING

03:48.695 --> 03:50.464
HIGH-EARNERS TO PAY CAPITAL

03:50.464 --> 03:51.932
GAINS TAXES ON SOME INHERITED

03:51.932 --> 03:52.632

03:57.370 --> 03:58.271
MEANS COMMITTEE, SAID TODAY HE

03:58.271 --> 04:00.841
OPPOSES THAT IDEA.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.242
>> SO WHAT I THINK THE PRESIDENT

04:02.242 --> 04:04.377
IS TRYING TO DO HERE IS TO,

04:04.377 --> 04:05.979
AGAIN, EXPLOIT ENVY ECONOMICS.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.114
THIS TOP-DOWN REDISTRIBUTION

04:07.114 --> 04:08.014
DOESN'T WORK.

04:08.014 --> 04:08.782
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR SIX

04:08.782 --> 04:10.550
YEARS.

04:10.550 --> 04:11.751
LOOK, IT MIGHT MAKE GOOD

04:11.751 --> 04:12.786
POLITICS BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE FOR

04:12.786 --> 04:14.554
GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH.

04:14.554 --> 04:15.388
>> Brangham: THERE'S BEEN

04:15.388 --> 04:16.223
ANOTHER SHOOTING BY A VERY YOUNG

04:16.223 --> 04:17.124

04:26.099 --> 04:27.467
AUTHORITIES SAY THE PARENTS, WHO

04:27.467 --> 04:28.235
ARE RECOVERING FROM THEIR

04:28.235 --> 04:29.035
INJURIES, COULD FACE NEGLIGENCE

04:29.035 --> 04:30.537
CHARGES.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.673
THIS INCIDENT COMES A MONTH

04:33.673 --> 04:37.511
AFTER A SIMILAR INCIDENT IN

04:37.511 --> 04:38.178
IDAHO, WHERE A TWO-YEAR-OLD

04:38.178 --> 04:39.179
REACHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S PURSE

04:39.179 --> 04:40.046

04:51.591 --> 04:52.325

04:53.193 --> 04:54.294
ABOUT A FOOT OF SNOW IN AND

04:54.294 --> 04:55.128
AROUND CHICAGO AND OTHER PARTS

04:55.128 --> 04:56.029
OF THE NORTHERN MIDWEST.

04:56.029 --> 04:56.997
THE STORM IS MOVING EAST AND IS

04:56.997 --> 04:57.797
EXPECTED TO LEAVE SIGNIFICANT

04:57.797 --> 04:58.465
SNOWFALL THERE AS WELL.

CARL DJERASSI, A CHEMIST WHOSE

04:59.166 --> 04:59.900
RESEARCH LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT

04:59.900 --> 05:00.700
OF THE BIRTH CONTROL PILL, HAS

05:00.700 --> 05:01.434
DIED.

05:01.434 --> 05:02.769
IN 1951, HE AND TWO COLLEAGUES

05:02.769 --> 05:04.371
GOT A PATENT ON A SYNTHESIZED

05:04.371 --> 05:05.939
HORMONE THAT BECAME THE KEY

05:05.939 --> 05:07.641
INGREDIENT IN THE PILL.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.642
HE ALSO HELD A PATENT ON THE

05:08.642 --> 05:10.410
FIRST ANTIHISTAMINE.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.012
DJERASSI, AN AUSTRIAN JEW, FLED

05:12.012 --> 05:13.413
EUROPE WITH HIS FAMILY AT THE

05:13.413 --> 05:15.015
START OF WORLD WAR II.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.349
ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES,

05:16.349 --> 05:17.784
THEY WERE SWINDLED OUT OF THEIR

05:17.784 --> 05:19.319
LAST $20 BY A NEW YORK CABBIE.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.021
BUT DJERASSI LATER WROTE FIRST

05:21.021 --> 05:22.622
LADY ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, ASKING

05:22.622 --> 05:23.723
FOR HELP, AND LATER WAS GIVEN A

05:23.723 --> 05:25.025
COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.626
DURING HIS CAREER, HE WROTE

05:26.626 --> 05:28.261
1,200 SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES.

05:28.261 --> 05:29.462
CARL DJERASSI DIED IN SAN

05:29.462 --> 05:30.564
FRANCISCO FRIDAY.

05:30.564 --> 05:42.075
HE WAS 91.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.743
>> Brangham: A NEW STUDY

05:43.743 --> 05:44.878
CONDUCTED BY THE PEW RESEARCH

05:44.878 --> 05:46.580
CENTER FOUND A LARGE GAP BETWEEN

05:46.580 --> 05:47.747
WHAT THE PUBLIC BELIEVES IS

05:47.747 --> 05:48.782
DANGEROUS AND WHAT SCIENTISTS

05:48.782 --> 05:49.649
BELIEVE.

05:49.649 --> 05:50.817
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS, WE ARE

05:50.817 --> 05:51.751
JOINED NOW FROM WASHINGTON BY

05:51.751 --> 05:52.953
LEE RAINIE.

DIRECTOR OF INTERNET, SCIENCE

05:55.255 --> 05:57.991
AND TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.326
YOUR SURVEY SHOWED SOME

05:59.326 --> 06:00.660
REALLY DRAMATIC GAPS BETWEEN

06:00.660 --> 06:02.195
WHAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND

06:02.195 --> 06:03.230
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE ABOUT

06:03.230 --> 06:04.297
THINGS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE

06:04.297 --> 06:05.999
AND VACCINES AND SCIENTIFIC

06:05.999 --> 06:06.700
RESEARCH.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.834
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF

06:07.834 --> 06:08.735
THOSE GAPS.

06:08.735 --> 06:09.469
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE FOOD

06:09.469 --> 06:10.437
THAT WE EAT.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.205
YOU POSED A STATEMENT THAT

06:12.205 --> 06:14.274
IT'S QUOTE SAFE TO EAT

06:14.274 --> 06:15.675
GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS

06:15.675 --> 06:17.711
OR GMOs.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.479
37% GENERAL PUBLIC SAYS IT'S

06:19.479 --> 06:21.114
SAFE WHEREAS 88% OF

06:21.114 --> 06:21.982
SCIENTISTS SAID IT WAS.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.850
ON THE STATEMENT, QUOTE,

06:23.850 --> 06:25.285
IT'S SAFE TO EAT FOODS GROWN

06:25.285 --> 06:27.320
WITH PESTICIDES, 28% OF THE

06:27.320 --> 06:28.688
PUBLIC AGREED THOSE FOODS

06:28.688 --> 06:30.790
WERE SAFE WHILE 668% OF

06:30.790 --> 06:31.825
SCIENTISTS SAID THEY WERE.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.894
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT

06:34.894 --> 06:37.030
SEEMING CHASM THERE?

06:37.030 --> 06:38.965
>> ONE OF THE STRIKING

06:38.965 --> 06:40.000
THINGS THAT HAS HAPPENED IN

06:40.000 --> 06:40.800
OUR CULTURE IN THE PAST

06:40.800 --> 06:42.435
COUPLE OF YEARS IS THAT FOOD

06:42.435 --> 06:43.803
THROUGH POLITICS, FOOD

06:43.803 --> 06:45.505
POLICY, FOOD IS JUST A PART

06:45.505 --> 06:47.040
OF SOCIAL LIFE, HAS BEEN

06:47.040 --> 06:48.375
MUCH MORE ELEVATED.

06:48.375 --> 06:49.643
AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE

06:49.643 --> 06:51.011
PERHAPS MORE TUNED IN TO

06:51.011 --> 06:53.146
SORT OF FOOD ISSUES NOW IN A

06:53.146 --> 06:54.080
WAY THEY WEREN'T BEFORE.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.849
BUT IT ALSO MAKES THEM MORE

06:55.849 --> 06:57.884
SENSITIVE ABOUT FOOD ISSUES.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.252
SO THEY'RE SKEPTICAL ABOUT

06:59.252 --> 07:00.987
THE SAFETY OF GENETICALLY

07:00.987 --> 07:01.721
MODIFIED FOOD.

07:01.721 --> 07:03.390
THEY'RE ALSO NOT SURE THAT

07:03.390 --> 07:04.891
SCIENTISTS ARE AWARE OF ALL

07:04.891 --> 07:06.793
THE SAFETY DANGERS THAT ARE

07:06.793 --> 07:07.527
CONNECTED WITH IT.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.262
ON THE PESTICIDES QUESTION,

07:09.262 --> 07:11.631
IT WAS MUCH MORE A CASE OF

07:11.631 --> 07:12.999
PEOPLE JUST BEING WARY OF

07:12.999 --> 07:14.401
THINGS THAT ARE GOING INTO

07:14.401 --> 07:16.102
THEIR BODIES AND A LITTLE

07:16.102 --> 07:18.438
LESS SURE THAT THE FOOD WE

07:18.438 --> 07:20.140
ARE EATING MIGHT BE AS SAFE

07:20.140 --> 07:21.908
AS SCIENTISTS THINK IT IS.

07:21.908 --> 07:22.742
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT ONE OF

07:22.742 --> 07:23.877
THE SURVEY QUESTIONS ABOUT

07:23.877 --> 07:25.278
THE GROWING POPULATION OF

07:25.278 --> 07:25.912
PEOPLE ON EARTH.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.681
YOU POSED THE STATEMENT THAT

07:27.681 --> 07:28.682
QUOTE THE GROWING POPULATION

07:28.682 --> 07:30.750
WILL BE A MAJOR PROBLEM.

07:30.750 --> 07:31.751
59% OF THE GENERAL

07:31.751 --> 07:33.186
POPULATION FELT IT WILL BE A

07:33.186 --> 07:35.155
PROBLEM WHILE 82% OF

07:35.155 --> 07:36.256
SCIENTISTS SAID IT WOULD BE.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.957
SOME OF OUR VIEWERS MIGHT

07:37.957 --> 07:39.392
REMEMBER PAUL EHRLICH IN THE

07:39.392 --> 07:41.027
LATE 60s, THERE WAS A

07:41.027 --> 07:42.128
POPULATION BOMB, RAISING

07:42.128 --> 07:43.396
CONCERNS ABOUT THE GROWING

07:43.396 --> 07:44.164
POPULATION ON EARTH.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.565
SINCE THAT TIME, OUR

07:45.565 --> 07:46.866
POPULATION HAS DOUBLED AND

07:46.866 --> 07:48.234
YET IT SEEMS THAT THE

07:48.234 --> 07:49.135
GENERAL POPULATION DOESN'T

07:49.135 --> 07:50.337
SEEM TO SEE THIS AS AN

07:50.337 --> 07:50.670
ISSUE.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.372
>> I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE A

07:52.372 --> 07:53.406
LITTLE LESS CONCERNED IN

07:53.406 --> 07:55.442
PART BECAUSE THEY, SINCE THE

07:55.442 --> 07:57.644
TIME OF EHRLICH'S BOOK, EVEN

07:57.644 --> 07:59.913
SINCE THE TIME A COUPLE OF

07:59.913 --> 08:02.315
CENTURIES AGO THAT THOMAS

08:02.315 --> 08:03.083
MALFUS WAS WRITING ABOUT

08:03.083 --> 08:04.417
THESE ISSUES, WE'VE SEEN

08:04.417 --> 08:05.418
LARGE GROWTH IN THE

08:05.418 --> 08:06.453
POPULATION, AND YET THE

08:06.453 --> 08:07.620
AMOUNT OF CAT CHRISM THAT

08:07.620 --> 08:09.189
YOU MIGHT CONNECT WITH

08:09.189 --> 08:10.190
POPULATION GROWTH LIKE

08:10.190 --> 08:11.624
FAMINE AND THINGS LIKE THAT,

08:11.624 --> 08:12.592
HASN'T SEEMED TO BE ON THE

08:12.592 --> 08:12.992
RISE.

08:12.992 --> 08:13.993
THE OTHER THING THAT MIGHT

08:13.993 --> 08:15.362
BE GOING ON FROM THE

08:15.362 --> 08:16.396
SCIENTIST PERSPECTIVE HERE

08:16.396 --> 08:17.831
IS THAT THEY ARE WORRIED

08:17.831 --> 08:19.499
ABOUT WHAT THEY CALL WICKED

08:19.499 --> 08:20.200
PROBLEMS.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.968
THEY SEE ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE

08:21.968 --> 08:23.970
CHANGE, GLOBAL WARMING.

08:23.970 --> 08:26.139
AND THEY WORRY THAT SOME OF

08:26.139 --> 08:27.340
THE HUMAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO

08:27.340 --> 08:28.708
THAT IS MAKING A BIG

08:28.708 --> 08:29.042
PROBLEM.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.810
AND YET THE PUBLIC ISN'T

08:30.810 --> 08:32.178
NEARLY AS CLOSE TO WHERE

08:32.178 --> 08:33.146
SCIENTISTS ARE AND THE

08:33.146 --> 08:34.547
SOLUTIONS TO GLOBAL WARMING.

08:34.547 --> 08:35.315
>> YOU ASKED A QUESTION

08:35.315 --> 08:36.950
ABOUT THE VALUE OF ANIMAL

08:36.950 --> 08:37.617
TESTING.

08:37.617 --> 08:39.319
AND YOU SAID DO YOU FAVOR

08:39.319 --> 08:41.087
THE USE OF ANIMALS IN

08:41.087 --> 08:41.755
RESEARCH.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.123
47% OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC

08:43.123 --> 08:43.757
FAVORED IT.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.925
BUT 89% OF SCIENTISTS

08:45.925 --> 08:46.526
APPROVED OF IT.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.228
WHAT DOW MAKE OF THAT GAP?

08:48.228 --> 08:50.263
>> I THINK THERE'S A REAL

08:50.263 --> 08:51.965
VALUE CLASH THAT'S GOING ON

08:51.965 --> 08:52.365
HERE.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.733
WOMEN ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY

08:53.733 --> 08:55.435
THAN MEN, FOR INSTANCE, TO

08:55.435 --> 08:56.736
BELIEVE THAT ANIMALS SHOULD

08:56.736 --> 08:58.471
BE INVOLVED IN SCIENTIFIC

08:58.471 --> 08:58.838
RESEARCH.

08:58.838 --> 09:02.008
IN ADDITION, THE PEOPLE WHO

09:02.008 --> 09:03.676
HAVE HIGHER EDUCATION

09:03.676 --> 09:05.545
DEGREES, A COLLEGE DEGREE OR

09:05.545 --> 09:06.613
GRADUATE DEGREE ARE MUCH

09:06.613 --> 09:08.148
MORE LIKELY TO SUPPORT THE

09:08.148 --> 09:09.182
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND ITS

09:09.182 --> 09:11.017
USE OF ANIMALS AND RESEARCH

09:11.017 --> 09:12.152
THAN PEOPLE WITH A HIGH

09:12.152 --> 09:13.052
SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

09:13.052 --> 09:14.754
SO THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

09:14.754 --> 09:15.789
FACTORS THAT TIE THE

09:15.789 --> 09:17.490
PEOPLE'S VALUES AS WELL AS

09:17.490 --> 09:18.324
THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT

09:18.324 --> 09:20.193
IS GOING ON.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.027
>> LEE RAINIE, THANK YOU

09:21.027 --> 09:23.029
VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US.

OLD PROBLEM-- AMERICA'S

09:37.043 --> 09:38.545
DECLINING SAVINGS RATE.

09:38.545 --> 09:39.979
SEVERAL STATES AROUND THE

09:39.979 --> 09:41.281

09:41.281 --> 09:42.782
WITH PROGRAMS THAT HAVE WORKED

09:42.782 --> 09:44.250
OVERSEAS-- BOOSTING PERSONAL

09:44.250 --> 09:45.618
SAVINGS BY LINKING SAVINGS

09:45.618 --> 09:47.287
ACCOUNTS TO LOTTERIES.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.988
HERE'S THE HOOK-- YOU MIGHT NOT

WIN, BUT YOU CAN'T LOSE A PENNY.

HUGE, LIFE-CHANGING AMOUNT OF

10:12.445 --> 10:15.748
MONEY.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.183
BUT NOW SOME STATES ARE

10:17.183 --> 10:18.117
EXPERIMENTING WITH A DIFFERENT

10:18.117 --> 10:20.553
KIND OF LOTTERY.

10:20.553 --> 10:21.921
ONE WHERE YOU WON'T NECESSARILY

WIN, BUT YOU CAN'T LOSE.

LOTTERY OR WHY DO PEOPLE GAMBLE,

13:15.161 --> 13:17.296
PERIOD?

13:17.296 --> 13:18.731
YOU KNOW, IT'S WITH THE HOPE OF-

13:18.731 --> 13:19.632
- OF-- OF WINNING SOMETHING

13:19.632 --> 13:21.401
MORE.

13:21.401 --> 13:22.635
THERE'S A SENSE THAT THIS

13:22.635 --> 13:25.505
ACTUALLY MAKES SAVINGS FUN.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.820
BUT SINCE STARTING SAVE TO WIN,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.588
CRYSTAL IS CONVINCED THAT SHE'S

13:42.588 --> 13:44.457
BEEN ABLE TO SAVE MORE MONEY,

13:44.457 --> 13:46.125
ESPECIALLY AFTER SHE GOT SOME

AFTER HER FIRST DEPOSIT.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.433
(LAUGHS)

13:53.433 --> 13:55.001
I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT IT.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.537
WITH THE MONEY THAT YOU WON?

13:57.537 --> 13:59.305
>> I REINVESTED IT.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.074
BECAUSE EVERY $25 INCREMENT YOU

GET YOUR NAME PUT BACK INTO THE

14:01.808 --> 14:03.342
DRAWING.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.144
AND I WOULD BE AN IDIOT IF I

14:05.144 --> 14:06.946
DIDN'T PUT IT BACK IN TO GET MY

14:06.946 --> 14:07.680

YES, YES, YES, I WANT TO PLAY.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.172
APRIL OF 2013, EXPRESS HAS

14:33.172 --> 14:34.440
SIGNED UP MORE THAN 100 "SAVE TO

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT- OR

14:42.081 --> 14:42.982
CDs.

14:42.982 --> 14:43.883
HALL SAYS EVEN THOUGH THE

14:43.883 --> 14:44.650
ACCOUNTS AREN'T PROFITABLE FOR

14:44.650 --> 14:45.318
THE CREDIT UNION, SHE'S

14:45.318 --> 14:46.486
ENCOURAGED BY THE RESULTS SO

14:46.486 --> 14:48.087
FAR.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.288
THE SAVE TO WIN ACCOUNTS AVERAGE

14:49.288 --> 14:50.590
$358, WHICH IS MORE THAN 20%

14:50.590 --> 14:51.524
HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE SAVINGS

14:51.524 --> 14:53.192
BALANCE AT THE CREDIT UNION.

14:53.192 --> 14:55.161
DO YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS

14:55.161 --> 14:56.429
GOING TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR OR

14:56.429 --> 14:57.630
TEACH PEOPLE THE VALUE OF HAVING

14:57.630 --> 15:01.100
A SAVINGS ACCOUNT?

15:01.100 --> 15:02.602
>> I THINK IT'S FORCED BEHAVIOR

15:02.602 --> 15:05.004
WHICH IS REALLY-- I HATE TO SAY

15:05.004 --> 15:06.839
THAT, BUT THE REASON WHY THEY'RE

15:06.839 --> 15:08.975
CDs IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO KEEP

15:08.975 --> 15:11.244
IT IN THERE FOR 12 MONTHS.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.146
SO IF YOU'VE LEARNED THAT YOU

15:13.146 --> 15:14.480
CAN LIVE WITHOUT THAT $25 FOR 12

15:14.480 --> 15:15.782
MONTHS, IT'S A BEHAVIORAL

15:15.782 --> 15:17.517
CHANGE.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.485
PRIZES ARE BIG ENOUGH TO DRAW

15:19.485 --> 15:20.686
PEOPLE IN?

15:20.686 --> 15:21.788
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT THE GRAND

15:21.788 --> 15:23.556
PRIZE IS.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.024
AND THE MORE FINANCIAL

15:25.024 --> 15:26.058
INSTITUTIONS THAT PARTICIPATE,

15:26.058 --> 15:27.660
THE BIGGER THE PRIZE IS.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.529
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A

15:29.529 --> 15:31.898
MILLION DOLLARS, BUT YOU KNOW,

15:31.898 --> 15:33.499
IT'S ENTICING ENOUGH TO DRAW--

15:33.499 --> 15:34.634

15:43.009 --> 15:44.443
PRIZED LINKED SAVINGS ACCOUNTS

15:44.443 --> 15:46.078

15:47.580 --> 15:48.948
DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH SHARE OF

15:48.948 --> 15:50.850
THEIR INCOME PLAYING LOTTERIES.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.451
>> IT'S OFTEN THOUGHT THAT

15:52.451 --> 15:53.820
PEOPLE ARE IRRATIONAL WHEN THEY

15:53.820 --> 15:55.154
PLAY THE LOTTERY.

15:55.154 --> 15:55.855
BUT I WOULD CHALLENGE THAT

15:55.855 --> 15:56.889
ASSUMPTION.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.391
IF YOU'RE A LOW INCOME

15:58.391 --> 15:59.759
INDIVIDUAL, HOW ELSE CAN YOU

15:59.759 --> 16:01.427
POTENTIALLY WIN ENOUGH MONEY TO

16:01.427 --> 16:02.261
BUY A HOUSE, OR REALLY CHANGE

16:11.170 --> 16:12.638
SHE'S THINKS THESE LOTTERY-BASED

16:12.638 --> 16:13.639

16:13.639 --> 16:14.507
LEVERAGING THEIR DESIRE TO WIN

16:21.180 --> 16:23.082
MODERATE INCOME INDIVIDUALS DO,

16:23.082 --> 16:24.884
YOU'RE ONLY ACCUMULATING A FEW

16:24.884 --> 16:26.485
DOLLARS EVERY MONTH, OR EVEN

16:26.485 --> 16:28.421
EVERY YEAR.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.223
AND IT WILL TAKE THEM TEN YEARS

16:30.223 --> 16:31.724
TO ACCUMULATE ENOUGH INTEREST

16:31.724 --> 16:33.092
PAYMENTS ON, LET'S SAY, A LOW

16:33.092 --> 16:33.960
DEPOSIT CHECKING ACCOUNT, TO

16:33.960 --> 16:34.794
MAKE ANY SORT OF DOWN PAYMENT OR

16:34.794 --> 16:35.928

16:42.101 --> 16:42.935
KEARNEY HELPED DESIGN AN

16:42.935 --> 16:44.570
EXPERIMENT TO FIND OUT.

16:44.570 --> 16:45.238
>> THE RESULTS WERE QUITE

16:45.238 --> 16:46.772
STRIKING.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.441
WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO SAY AT THE

16:48.441 --> 16:50.309
END OF THE DAY IS THAT FOR A

16:50.309 --> 16:53.145
GIVEN AMOUNT OF INTEREST PAYMENT

16:53.145 --> 16:54.247
A CREDIT UNION CAN ACTUALLY

16:54.247 --> 16:56.182
ENTICE A LOT MORE DEPOSITS, AND

16:56.182 --> 16:57.483
MORE SAVINGS, IF THEY STRUCTURE

16:57.483 --> 16:58.951
THE INTEREST TO HAVE SOME

16:58.951 --> 16:59.952
LOTTERY OR PRIZE LINK COMPONENT

16:59.952 --> 17:01.921
TO IT.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.489
THE RESULTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH

17:03.489 --> 17:05.258
WHAT'S BEEN SEEN IN MICHIGAN,

17:05.258 --> 17:06.726
WHERE THE AVERAGE AMOUNT SAVED

17:06.726 --> 17:08.127
WITH "SAVE TO WIN" HAS GROWN

17:08.127 --> 17:08.828
DRAMATICALLY SINCE BEING

17:08.828 --> 17:12.031
LAUNCHED IN 2009.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.332

17:13.332 --> 17:14.100
PRIZED LINKED SAVINGS SWEPT

17:14.100 --> 17:15.968
ACROSS THE US?

17:15.968 --> 17:17.703
TURNS OUT, THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE

17:17.703 --> 17:18.638
TO EXPANDING THESE TYPES OF

17:18.638 --> 17:19.705
SAVINGS ACCOUNTS WAS FEDERAL

17:19.705 --> 17:21.374
LAW.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.242
UNLIKE STATE-REGULATED CREDIT

17:23.242 --> 17:24.810
UNIONS, BANKS, WHICH ARE

17:24.810 --> 17:26.045
FEDERALLY-CHARTERED

17:26.045 --> 17:26.913
INSTITUTIONS, COULD NOT

17:26.913 --> 17:29.048
PARTICIPATE IN LOTTERIES.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.083
BUT THAT CHANGED LAST FALL, WHEN

17:31.083 --> 17:32.885
A BIPARTISAN BILL, CO-SPONSORED

17:32.885 --> 17:34.253
BY DEREK KILMER, WHO IS NOW A

17:34.253 --> 17:35.221
U.S. REPRESENTATIVE, PASSED

17:35.221 --> 17:37.123
CONGRESS.

17:37.123 --> 17:38.958
THE LEGISLATION, CALLED THE

17:38.958 --> 17:40.760
AMERICAN SAVINGS PROMOTION ACT,

17:40.760 --> 17:42.528
WAS SIGNED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA IN

17:42.528 --> 17:43.462
DECEMBER AND ANNOUNCED IN A

17:43.462 --> 17:45.464
WHITE HOUSE PRESS RELEASE.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.099
ADVOCATES ARE HOPEFUL THAT THE

17:47.099 --> 17:49.068
PASSAGE OF THE BILL WILL LEAD TO

17:49.068 --> 17:50.836
DRAMATICALLY MORE ACCESS TO

17:50.836 --> 17:52.705
PRIZE-LINKED SAVINGS PROGRAMS

17:52.705 --> 17:54.073
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IN TURN,

17:54.073 --> 17:56.175
HELP BOOST SAVINGS RATES.

17:56.175 --> 17:57.743
AT THE END OF THE DAY IS IT

17:57.743 --> 17:58.844
REALLY TEACHING PEOPLE TO BE

17:58.844 --> 18:00.713
BETTER SAVERS?

18:00.713 --> 18:02.281
OR IS IT JUST TEACHING THEM TO

18:02.281 --> 18:03.049
DO THIS JUST BECAUSE YOU MIGHT

18:03.049 --> 18:05.151
GET A PRIZE?

18:05.151 --> 18:06.352
>> SO, TO-- TO SOME DEGREE THIS

18:06.352 --> 18:07.186
IS-- YOU KNOW, THIS IS INTER--

18:07.186 --> 18:08.321
BASICALLY INTERMITTENT POSITIVE

18:08.321 --> 18:09.855
REINFORCEMENT.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.891
AS SOMEONE SAVES MORE MONEY,

18:11.891 --> 18:13.893
THEY EARN MORE CHANCES AND

18:13.893 --> 18:14.994
THAT'S POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT TO

18:14.994 --> 18:17.596
SAVE MORE MONEY.

18:17.596 --> 18:19.699
AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.300
I MEAN, WE'VE JUST GONE THROUGH

18:21.300 --> 18:23.069
SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT

18:23.069 --> 18:24.737
FINANCIAL YEARS A NATION CAN GO

18:24.737 --> 18:26.639
THROUGH, AND SO I THINK THERE'S

18:26.639 --> 18:28.107
AN APPRECIATION FOR THE VALUE

18:28.107 --> 18:29.241
OF-- OF A TOOL LIKE THIS TO-- TO

18:29.241 --> 18:41.854
HELP PEOPLE SAVE.

18:41.854 --> 18:42.989
>> Brangham: TODAY, OF COURSE,

18:42.989 --> 18:44.090
IS SUPER BOWL SUNDAY.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.424
IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE

18:45.424 --> 18:46.959
GAME, FANS DEBATED WHICH TEAM

18:46.959 --> 18:48.561
WILL WIN, AND ECONOMISTS DEBATED

18:48.561 --> 18:49.562
THE WISDOM OF CITIES TRYING TO

18:49.562 --> 18:51.697
HOST THE BIG GAME.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.132
YESTERDAY, HARI SREENIVASAN

18:53.132 --> 18:54.667
SPOKE WITH MINA KIMES, A SENIOR

18:54.667 --> 18:59.372
WRITER FOR ESPN, THE MAGAZINE.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.840
>> Sreenivasan: SO EACH YEAR

19:00.840 --> 19:01.774
WE SEE CITIES COMPETE FOR

19:01.774 --> 19:03.309
THE SUPER BOWL AS IF IT IS

19:03.309 --> 19:05.177
THE OLYMPICS, AS IF IT IS

19:05.177 --> 19:06.879
GOING TO BRING TONS OF MONEY,

19:06.879 --> 19:07.913
ENERGY AND EXCITEMENT.

19:07.913 --> 19:09.015
IS IT WORTH HOSTING THE

19:09.015 --> 19:09.682
SUPER BOWL?

19:09.682 --> 19:11.717
>> WELL, SO FOR GLENDALE,

19:11.717 --> 19:13.152
WHICH IS WHERE THIS YEAR'S

19:13.152 --> 19:14.453
GAME IS, IT MIGHT NOT SHALL.

19:14.453 --> 19:15.855
THE CITY HOSTED THE GAME

19:15.855 --> 19:17.256
THERE 2008 AND I READ THAT

19:17.256 --> 19:18.657
THEY ACTUALLY SAID OH, WE

19:18.657 --> 19:19.592
LOST MONEY WHICH WAS

19:19.592 --> 19:20.426
SURPRISING.

19:20.426 --> 19:21.394
SO I CALLED THE MAYOR WHO

19:21.394 --> 19:23.095
TOLD ME NOT ONLY DID WE LOSE

19:23.095 --> 19:24.530
MONEY THEN, WE ARE TOTALLY

19:24.530 --> 19:25.564
GOING TO LOSE MONEY THIS

19:25.564 --> 19:26.065
YEAR.

19:26.065 --> 19:28.401
WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTELY

19:28.401 --> 19:29.568
STUNNING STATEMENT FROM A

19:29.568 --> 19:30.236
PUBLIC OFFICIAL.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.871
>> HOW IS IT LOSING MONEY.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.372
>> THE GAME IS IN GLENDALE

19:33.372 --> 19:35.941
MANY OF THE EVENTS, ARE IN

19:35.941 --> 19:37.710
SCOTTS DALE, AND SO MANY

19:37.710 --> 19:38.911
PEOPLE WILL COME IN, AND

19:38.911 --> 19:40.079
LEAVE, THE CITY HAS TO SPEND

19:40.079 --> 19:41.447
MONEY ON SECURITY.

19:41.447 --> 19:42.148
>> Sreenivasan: THIS ALSO

19:42.148 --> 19:42.882
HAPPENED LAST YEAR WITH THE

19:42.882 --> 19:44.583
SUPER BOWL IN NEW YORK,

19:44.583 --> 19:46.585
RIGHT, I SAID NEW YORK.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.486
>> THE ACTUAL GAME WAS IN

19:47.486 --> 19:48.654
NEW JERSEY BUT EVERYONE

19:48.654 --> 19:50.022
REMEMBERS THAT IT WAS IN NEW

19:50.022 --> 19:50.689
YORK SUPER BOWL.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.124
SO AS A RESULT, NEW JERSEY

19:52.124 --> 19:53.426
FELT KIND OF SPURNED IN A

19:53.426 --> 19:54.493
WAY BY THE GAME.

19:54.493 --> 19:55.594
>> Sreenivasan: OKAY S SO

19:55.594 --> 19:57.296
HOW DID THE NFL OWNERS FEEL

19:57.296 --> 19:59.098
IN THESE TOWNS, IS THERE

19:59.098 --> 20:00.299
TENSION BETWEEN THE MAYORS

20:00.299 --> 20:01.233
AND OWNERS?

20:01.233 --> 20:03.002
>> THERE DEFINITELY IS IN

20:03.002 --> 20:03.402
ARIZONA.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.104
THE OWNERS, THEY WANT GAME

20:05.104 --> 20:06.472
THERE ARE HUGE BENEFITS TO

20:06.472 --> 20:07.506
HAVE IT AT THE STADIUM, FOR

20:07.506 --> 20:08.507
THE TEAM.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.609
THE CARDINALS OWNER MIKE

20:10.609 --> 20:11.944
BIDWELL HAS PUBLICLY CLASHED

20:11.944 --> 20:13.612
WITH THE MAYOR OF GLENDALE

20:13.612 --> 20:16.048
ABOUT HIS, WE SAY LACK OF

20:16.048 --> 20:17.149
ENTHUSIASM OVER HOSTING THE

20:17.149 --> 20:18.117
GAME THIS YEAR.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.151
>> AND CITIES AND TOWNS PUT

20:19.151 --> 20:20.119
A LOT OF MONEY INTO BUILDING

20:20.119 --> 20:20.719
STADIUMS.

20:20.719 --> 20:21.620
>> YES.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.288
>> Sreenivasan: SO THAT THEY

20:22.288 --> 20:24.290
CAN GET EVENTS LIKE THIS.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.257
>> GLENDALE BEING A PERFECT

20:25.257 --> 20:26.092
EXAMPLE OF WHERE THAT HAS

20:26.092 --> 20:26.959
GONE WRONG.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.327
THIS CITY HAS CONTRIBUTED

20:28.327 --> 20:30.963
MONEY TO THREE MAJOR SPORTS

20:30.963 --> 20:32.131
FACILITIES OVER THE LAST TEN

20:32.131 --> 20:33.833
YEARS AND NOW IT'S

20:33.833 --> 20:35.167
ABSOLUTELY MIRED IN DEBT.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.869
>> Sreenivasan: THERE ARE

20:36.869 --> 20:38.671
ECONOMISTS IT THAT ARE GOING

20:38.671 --> 20:40.306
TO SAY OR I SHOULD SAY MAYBE

20:40.306 --> 20:42.007
EVEN THE NFL WILL SAY LOOK

20:42.007 --> 20:43.409
AT ALL THE MONEY THAT COMES

20:43.409 --> 20:44.777
IN WITH ALL THE TOURISTS.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.212
DON'T THEY SPEND A COUPLE

20:46.212 --> 20:47.913
EXTRA BUCKS HERE OR THERE,

20:47.913 --> 20:51.117
SO YOU ARE SAYING THE MAYORS IS

20:51.117 --> 20:52.118
SAYING IT DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR

20:52.118 --> 20:53.285
THE COPS THEY PUT ON THE BEAT.

20:53.285 --> 20:55.488
>> THE NFL SAYS-- ECONOMISTS

20:55.488 --> 20:56.388
SAY THEY DON'T.

20:56.388 --> 20:57.156
ECONOMISTS WHO ARE

20:57.156 --> 20:58.424
INDEPENDENT, WILL COME OUT

20:58.424 --> 20:59.458
AND SAY ACTUALLY THE

20:59.458 --> 21:00.826
BENEFITS OF THESE GAMES AND

21:00.826 --> 21:02.495
ESPECIALLY STADIUMS ARE

21:02.495 --> 21:04.196
INCREDIBLY OVERBLOWN BECAUSE

21:04.196 --> 21:06.298
A LOT OF CASES YOU ARE

21:06.298 --> 21:07.433
DISPLACING OUR TOURISTS THAT

21:07.433 --> 21:09.401
WOULD NORMALLY BE IN,

21:09.401 --> 21:10.202
ESPECIALLY A WARM PLATES

21:10.202 --> 21:11.437
LIKE PHOENIX IN THE WINTER.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.505
AND OFTEN TIMES IT IS

21:12.505 --> 21:14.240
INDIRECT SPENDING, PUBLICITY,

21:14.240 --> 21:15.241
THINS YOU CAN'T REALLY PUT A

21:15.241 --> 21:15.774
CLEAR NUMBER ON.

21:15.774 --> 21:16.909
>> Sreenivasan: AND I WOULD

21:16.909 --> 21:18.043
IMAGINE THAT THE NFL IS ALSO

21:18.043 --> 21:20.079
GOING TO SAY THAT WHAT ABOUT

21:20.079 --> 21:21.780
THE SORT OF BRAND THAT YOU

21:21.780 --> 21:22.882
BUILD AND THE EXPOSURE

21:22.882 --> 21:23.816
ARGUMENT, THAT YOU ARE

21:23.816 --> 21:25.117
GETTING ALL THIS FREE AIR

21:25.117 --> 21:25.451
TIME.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.519
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT

21:26.519 --> 21:28.220
THE SUPER BOWL IN YOUR TOWN.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.255
>> AND YET YOU JUST SAID THE

21:29.255 --> 21:32.458
SUPER BOWL IN NEW YORK, A

21:32.458 --> 21:33.492
PERFECT EXAMPLE.

21:33.492 --> 21:35.694
REALLY,, WHAT BRANDING, IN

21:35.694 --> 21:36.729
AMERICA AND NEW YORK, ARE

21:36.729 --> 21:37.463
PEOPLE GOING TO REMEMBER THE

21:37.463 --> 21:39.165
SUPER BOWL WAS IN GLENDALE.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.167
SOME PEOPLE WILL BUT I GUESS

21:41.167 --> 21:42.234
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL

21:42.234 --> 21:43.369
JUST SAY PHOENIX.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.638
>> Sreenivasan: AND ALL THE

21:45.638 --> 21:46.305
CELEBRITIES-- CELEBRITIES,

21:46.305 --> 21:47.673
ITS TRAFFIC GOES TO PHOENIX,

21:47.673 --> 21:48.974
THEY DON'T COME OUT TO

21:48.974 --> 21:50.409
GLENDALE EXCEPT FOR THE GAME,

21:50.409 --> 21:51.410
THERE FOR THE GAME AND THEN

21:51.410 --> 21:52.111
THEY LEAVE.

21:52.111 --> 21:52.778
>> MUCH LIKE NEW YORK.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.180
I DON'T THINK MOST OF THESE

21:54.180 --> 21:55.214
CELEBRITIES WERE STAYING IN

21:55.214 --> 21:59.652
NEW JERSEY LAST YEAR.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.753
>> Sreenivasan: MINKA KIMES,

22:23.175 --> 22:24.009
BUT WIPED OUT THE NORTHERN WHITE

22:24.009 --> 22:25.177
RHINO.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.545
THERE ARE ONLY FIVE OF THEM LEFT

22:26.545 --> 22:27.313
ON THE PLANET, AND THEY'RE ALL

22:27.313 --> 22:29.181
TOO OLD TO BREED.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.483
NOW, TEST TUBE FERTILITY

22:31.483 --> 22:36.755
TREATMENTS ARE THE BREED'S LAST

22:45.531 --> 22:47.099

22:47.099 --> 22:48.167
THE LAST MAN STANDING, TWO TONS

22:48.167 --> 22:51.070
OF FORLORN AND FRUSTRATED

22:51.070 --> 22:52.004
MASCULINITY.

22:52.004 --> 22:52.771
HE CAN FIGHT THE FEMALES WITH

22:52.771 --> 22:53.772
WHICH HE SHARES HIS TWILIGHT

22:53.772 --> 22:54.773
YEARS, BUT NOT MUCH ELSE.

22:54.773 --> 22:55.474
HE'S TOO OLD TO BREED.

22:55.474 --> 22:56.141
AND THEY CAN NO LONGER BEAR

22:56.141 --> 22:59.612
YOUNG.

22:59.612 --> 23:00.379
SUDAN IS GUARDED DAY AND NIGHT

23:00.379 --> 23:01.180
FROM POACHERS WHO PRIZE THE

23:01.180 --> 23:02.014
RHINO'S HORN MORE HIGHLY THAN

23:02.014 --> 23:02.815
THE LIVING CREATURE, BUT FOR THE

23:02.815 --> 23:03.749
NORTHERN WHITE THAT BATTLE IS

23:03.749 --> 23:05.384
LOST.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.585
INSTEAD, THE MEN WHO MIGHT SAVE

23:06.585 --> 23:07.686
THIS SPECIES COME ARMED NOT WITH

23:07.686 --> 23:13.626
GUNS BUT WITH SCIENCE.

23:13.626 --> 23:14.560
THE PLAN IS TO HARVEST SPERM AND

23:14.560 --> 23:16.328
EGGS FROM THESE SURVIVORS, IN

23:16.328 --> 23:17.429
THE HOPE THAT SOME DAY

23:17.429 --> 23:18.597
TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW THEM TO

23:18.597 --> 23:27.606
FIND A SURROGATE MOTHER.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.408
>> WHICH WOULD COULD BE

23:29.408 --> 23:32.077
LIKING AT THESE ANIMALS, FOR

23:32.077 --> 23:33.812
REINTRODUCTION BACK ON TO

23:33.812 --> 23:34.813
PLANET EARTH SEEM IN THE

23:34.813 --> 23:35.814
FUTURE THAT IS DEFINITELY A

23:35.814 --> 23:36.582
POSSIBILITY.

23:36.582 --> 23:37.383
>> 20 YEARS AGO WE REPORTED

23:37.383 --> 23:38.350
ON THE STRUGGLE

23:38.350 --> 23:40.586
20 YEARS AGO WE REPORTED ON THE

23:40.586 --> 23:41.920
STRUGGLE TO SAVE THE LAST WHITE

23:41.920 --> 23:42.921
RHINOS IN THE WILD BY TAGGING

23:42.921 --> 23:43.856
THEM WITH TRACKERS.

23:43.856 --> 23:44.623
PART OF THAT TEAM WAS DR. PETER

23:44.623 --> 23:45.457
MORKEL.

23:45.457 --> 23:46.325
20 YEARS ON HE HASN'T ENTIRELY

23:46.325 --> 23:54.066
GIVEN UP.

23:54.066 --> 23:54.867
>> CAN THE WORLD AFFORD TO

23:54.867 --> 23:55.968
LOSE CREATURES LIKE THIS.

23:55.968 --> 23:56.935
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.270
I THINK THE WORLD WILL BE A

23:58.270 --> 23:59.905
MUCH POORER PLACE WITHOUT

23:59.905 --> 24:01.173
THEM.

24:01.173 --> 24:04.743
>> FOR SUDAN

24:04.743 --> 24:05.577
FOR THE SUDAN, IT IS A MINUTE TO

24:05.577 --> 24:06.312
MIDNIGHT.

24:06.312 --> 24:07.146
NO ONE CAN TURN THE CLOCK BACK.

24:07.146 --> 24:07.913
BUT IF SCIENCE CAN PERFORM

24:07.913 --> 24:09.915
MIRACLES, HIS KIND MIGHT JUST

24:09.915 --> 24:22.027
MIGHT HAVE A FUTURE.
