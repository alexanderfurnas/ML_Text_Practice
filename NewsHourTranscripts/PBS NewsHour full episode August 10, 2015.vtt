WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:06.373
GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.575
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.575 --> 00:13.881
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Donald Trump defends
his record on women, as Hillary

00:13.881 --> 00:18.385
Clinton wades into the fray.
Surveying the week ahead in
politics.

00:18.385 --> 00:22.623
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then: protests
and a state of emergency again
in Saint Louis and Ferguson,

00:22.623 --> 00:24.491
Missouri.

00:24.491 --> 00:29.997
GWEN IFILL: A pious nation
resists family planning efforts
to address poverty, political

00:29.997 --> 00:33.934
pushback to providing free
contraceptives in the
Philippines.

00:33.934 --> 00:37.938
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, a doctor
recounts his struggle for
survival after contracting
Ebola.

00:44.344 --> 00:49.549
to get Ebola, we're all going to
die. In West Africa, the fear
presented itself as

00:49.549 --> 00:52.819
denial that Ebola was even real.

00:52.819 --> 00:58.825
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:58.825 --> 01:02.596
(BREAK)

01:02.596 --> 01:13.140
JUDY WOODRUFF: This was a day
of bombings and bloodshed in
three major countries across

01:13.140 --> 01:19.746
the Muslim world. In Iraq,
Islamic State suicide bombers
killed nearly 60 people and

01:19.746 --> 01:24.117
wounded more 100 others. The
attackers struck after nightfall
in Diyala province, just over

01:24.117 --> 01:27.020
30 miles northeast of Baghdad.

01:27.020 --> 01:32.392
GWEN IFILL: And in Afghanistan,
Taliban suicide bombers struck
again, killing at least

01:32.392 --> 01:37.631
five people and wounding 16
outside Kabul's international
airport. The blast at a busy

01:37.631 --> 01:41.868
roundabout followed Friday's
attacks that killed nearly 50.

01:41.868 --> 01:45.605
And the Afghan president
demanded a crackdown today on
Taliban elements based in
neighboring

01:45.605 --> 01:47.841
Pakistan.

01:47.841 --> 01:54.881
ASHRAF GHANI, President of
Afghanistan (through
translator): If Pakistan
doesn't have the

01:54.881 --> 01:59.553
capacity to bring them to the
table, they have this capacity
to stop their activities,

01:59.553 --> 02:03.023
to close their offices, to bring
the insurgents to justice, and
to not allow their wounded

02:03.023 --> 02:05.592
to be treated in the hospital.

02:05.592 --> 02:09.029
GWEN IFILL: President Ghani
also spoke by phone with
Secretary of State John Kerry to

02:09.029 --> 02:11.865
express his concern.

02:11.865 --> 02:17.304
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S.
Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey,
came under fire today as attacks
rocked

02:17.304 --> 02:23.410
that country. Investigators
said two women belonging to a
far-left radical group shot

02:23.410 --> 02:26.913
at the consulate. Witnesses
said police wounded one of the
attackers after she refused

02:26.913 --> 02:30.217
to surrender.

02:30.217 --> 02:38.492
MAN (through translator): It
was about 6:30 in the morning.
We heard the sound of gunfire.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.929
The woman and the police officer
started clashing. I guess the
woman was an amateur

02:42.929 --> 02:46.333
because she had dropped her
ammunition clip. She was
throwing what looked like
stones.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.503
The officer shouted at her once
or two times, "Lay down, lay
down."

02:49.503 --> 02:55.342
JUDY WOODRUFF: No one else was
hurt there, but three militants
and two policemen died

02:55.342 --> 03:01.181
in a car bombing and gun battle
at a police station in Istanbul.
Elsewhere, a roadside

03:01.181 --> 03:05.685
bomb killed four Turkish police
officers. It all came amid a
government crackdown

03:05.685 --> 03:10.290
on Islamic State, Kurdish
elements and far-left militants.

03:10.290 --> 03:15.529
GWEN IFILL: Migrants fleeing
conflict in Syria and
Afghanistan arrived by the
hundreds

03:15.529 --> 03:21.501
in Greece this weekend. Coast
Guard vessels rescued more than
1,400 people in dozens of

03:21.501 --> 03:26.173
operations. Meanwhile, a
policeman on Kos Island pulled a
knife and struck migrants

03:26.173 --> 03:30.710
as tempers flared in a crowd
waiting for immigration papers.

03:30.710 --> 03:35.849
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the governor of
Colorado declared a disaster
today

03:35.849 --> 03:40.921
after a major toxic spill, this
as word came that the disaster
is far worse than it first

03:40.921 --> 03:44.624
appeared.

03:44.624 --> 03:50.397
The Environmental Protection
Agency has now confirmed the
spill totals three million
gallons,

03:50.397 --> 03:56.570
three times larger than
initially estimated. The mix of
heavy metals, including arsenic

03:56.570 --> 04:01.908
and lead, has transformed the
Animas River into
mustard-colored soup.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.878
MAN: It's definitely not how
the river is supposed to look.
It's already hard enough

04:04.878 --> 04:07.547
to catch fish in the Animas, and
you know this stuff, it's
definitely not good for them,

04:07.547 --> 04:10.050
going to kill a lot
of these fish off.

04:10.050 --> 04:15.088
JUDY WOODRUFF: It started
Wednesday, when an EPA team
accidentally released
contaminated

04:15.088 --> 04:21.795
water from the abandoned Gold
King Mine north of Silverton,
Colorado. It spewed into the

04:21.795 --> 04:28.235
Animas and headed downstream.
The tainted torrent has now
traveled south more than 100

04:28.235 --> 04:33.974
miles, flowing into New Mexico,
where the Animas meets the San
Juan River.

04:33.974 --> 04:38.378
New Mexico's governor, Susana
Martinez, yesterday got an
aerial view of the contamination
in

04:38.378 --> 04:39.913
Farmington.

04:39.913 --> 04:43.517
GOV. SUSANA MARTINEZ (R), New
Mexico: You can't even describe
it. It's like when I

04:43.517 --> 04:48.889
flew over the fires. And you
see something that your mind
isn't ready or adjusted to

04:48.889 --> 04:50.724
see.

04:50.724 --> 04:57.164
JUDY WOODRUFF: The EPA says it
doesn't expect a major effect on
wildlife. And because

04:57.164 --> 05:02.869
utilities closed their intake
valves, there's no sign that
drinking water has been
contaminated.

05:02.869 --> 05:06.907
Still, homeowners like
Rosemary Hart are frustrated.

05:06.907 --> 05:11.211
ROSEMARY HART, Homeowner: I'm
here on my property, and I
cannot shower. I cannot

05:11.211 --> 05:15.515
cook. I cannot do anything with
the water from my water well.

05:15.515 --> 05:20.820
JUDY WOODRUFF: Adding to the
frustration, it took the EPA a
full day to notify communities

05:20.820 --> 05:28.061
of the spill. Now the yellow
flow is heading west toward Lake
Powell in Utah, a popular

05:28.061 --> 05:33.733
tourist destination, and EPA
officials have yet to indicate
how long cleanup will take.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.308
the spill.

05:41.308 --> 05:45.712
GWEN IFILL: Billionaire
investor Warren Buffett
announced his company's biggest
deal

05:45.712 --> 05:50.850
ever today. Berkshire Hathaway
will buy Precision Castparts, an
aerospace and industrial

05:50.850 --> 05:54.721
company, for $37 billion.

05:54.721 --> 05:59.759
That news, plus a rise in oil
prices, sent Wall Street
surging. The Dow Jones
industrial

05:59.759 --> 06:05.632
average gained more than 240
points to close above 17600.
The Nasdaq rose 58 points,

06:05.632 --> 06:09.903
and the S&P 500 added 26.

06:09.903 --> 06:15.375
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Google will
become part of a new holding
company known as Alphabet.

06:15.375 --> 06:20.847
The search giant unveiled the
change in operating structure
after the markets closed.

06:20.847 --> 06:24.417
The switch will take place later
this year, and Google's stock
will automatically be converted

06:24.417 --> 06:28.355
to Alphabet stock.

06:28.355 --> 06:32.759
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the week ahead in politics with
Tamara Keith and Susan

06:32.759 --> 06:44.104
Page; protests and a state of
emergency called again in
Ferguson, plus much more.

06:44.104 --> 07:03.757
GWEN IFILL: Donald Trump
continues to consume the
post-debate debate, Hillary
Clinton lashes

07:03.757 --> 07:08.328
out at the Republicans, and
Bernie Sanders draws huge West
Coast crowds.

07:08.328 --> 07:13.133
You may have heard Trump sparked
an uproar when he described FOX
News moderator Megyn

07:13.133 --> 07:18.238
Kelly as having "blood coming
out of her eyes, blood coming
out of her wherever." She was

07:18.238 --> 07:21.041
-- he said, "In my opinion,
she was off-base."

07:21.041 --> 07:25.412
The next day, he said he meant
blood coming out of her nose.

07:25.412 --> 07:29.149
Today, Hillary Clinton,
campaigning in New Hampshire,
said Trump was outrageous, but

07:29.149 --> 07:33.687
that Republicans who oppose all
abortions are just as bad.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.890
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: While
what Donald Trump said about
Megyn

07:36.890 --> 07:42.796
Kelly is outrageous, what the
rest of the Republicans are
saying about all women is

07:42.796 --> 07:49.202
also outrageous. They brag
about slashing women's health
care funding. They say they

07:49.202 --> 07:54.040
would force women who have been
raped to carry their rapist's
child.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.378
GWEN IFILL: Sounds like a
perfect time for a Politics
Monday.

07:58.378 --> 08:01.314
We're joined from New Hampshire
tonight by Tamara Keith of NPR,
and here in the studio

08:01.314 --> 08:04.451
by Susan Page of USA Today.

08:04.451 --> 08:09.823
Tamara, you were in New
Hampshire with Hillary covering
Hillary Clinton today. Tell us

08:09.823 --> 08:14.227
a little bit about this whole
idea, this broad idea of women's
issues. So far, we're talking

08:14.227 --> 08:19.666
about the slur was that Donald
Trump did or didn't intend.
We're talking about abortion,

08:19.666 --> 08:22.635
but women's issues, it seems to
me, especially when it comes to
an unknown candidate like

08:22.635 --> 08:24.738
Donald Trump, is much
broader than that.

08:24.738 --> 08:28.375
TAMARA KEITH, National
Public Radio: Certainly.

08:28.375 --> 08:33.580
And Donald Trump, over the
weekend, said that he's huge on
women's issues. It's not
entirely

08:33.580 --> 08:40.820
clear what that means. Trump,
before he was pro-life, was
pro-choice. And, of course,

08:40.820 --> 08:45.058
that's one of many issues where
there are lots of substantive
questions that could be

08:45.058 --> 08:49.496
asked of a candidate, but,
typically, he spends a lot of
time feuding instead.

08:49.496 --> 08:54.601
GWEN IFILL: Has the Clinton
campaign decided this is an
opportunity for them?

08:54.601 --> 08:59.939
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, absolutely.
Hillary Clinton was having a lot
of fun in that media

08:59.939 --> 09:03.910
availability today, though --
and you also got the sense that
she would have been perfectly

09:03.910 --> 09:08.515
happy if someone, anyone, had
asked her a detailed policy
question about her college

09:08.515 --> 09:11.785
affordability plan, which
is what she was there for.

09:11.785 --> 09:16.656
But, clearly, Clinton is using
this to go after the Republican
field as a whole, to

09:16.656 --> 09:21.828
tie them to Donald Trump, and
also, in particular, today, she
was talking about Marco Rubio.

09:21.828 --> 09:27.100
That's the Florida senator who
many say performed quite well in
that debate last week,

09:27.100 --> 09:36.176
and she was talking about his
position on abortion to not
include incest or rape, and

09:36.176 --> 09:40.980
making the argument that that
was the more extreme position
than any of the entertaining

09:40.980 --> 09:44.851
things that Donald Trump said.
And she described him as an
entertainer.

09:44.851 --> 09:48.588
GWEN IFILL: OK, Susan, let's
talk about Donald Trump. It's
-- we have to. He's

09:48.588 --> 09:51.524
still leading the polls. He
doesn't appeared to have been
hurt at all by whatever happened

09:51.524 --> 09:55.195
in that debate or people's
interpretations of it.

09:55.195 --> 09:58.965
But when we talk about Donald
Trump and we talk about where he
stands on issues, we know

09:58.965 --> 10:01.034
about the things he says. What
does he believe, especially when
it comes to these issues?

10:05.238 --> 10:08.374
who has ever served in public
office, so there's no voting
record that we can go look at,
as

10:08.374 --> 10:12.111
we can with people who served
as governors and senators.

10:12.111 --> 10:16.749
And, in fact, if you go on
DonaldJTrump.com, his Web site,
as I did just before we came

10:16.749 --> 10:20.887
on board, there are ways to buy
T-shirts with Trump's name,
there are a lot of news stories

10:20.887 --> 10:24.657
posted about how well he's doing
in the polls, you can contribute
to his campaign, but there

10:24.657 --> 10:29.596
is not even a tab that takes you
to his policy positions on
issues.

10:29.596 --> 10:32.499
There's nothing on his Web site
up to this point that explains
where he stands on issues

10:32.499 --> 10:36.369
like education, or health care,
or jobs or terrorism. These are
all issues that of

10:36.369 --> 10:39.372
course women care
about, as do men.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.774
GWEN IFILL: Well, that's the
thing. We're talking about --
when we say women's issues,

10:41.774 --> 10:45.512
we're also talking about health
care and education and college
affordability.

10:45.512 --> 10:48.548
But we have heard nothing
from him on any of that.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.017
SUSAN PAGE: And you know what?
I think, for his core
supporters, it doesn't matter.

10:51.017 --> 10:55.822
They're endorsing kind of an
attitude that has served him
well so far.

10:55.822 --> 11:00.159
But if he wants to grow his
support, if he wants to become
somebody who is actually taken

11:00.159 --> 11:02.929
seriously as a potential
nominee, he's going to have to
take positions on some of these

11:02.929 --> 11:05.131
big issues.

11:05.131 --> 11:08.234
GWEN IFILL: Tamara, we saw how
Hillary Clinton has been
responding to this. How about
the

11:08.234 --> 11:11.804
others, especially all the
Republican candidates? How have
they been responding? They have

11:11.804 --> 11:16.209
obviously been trying to fight
to get themselves heard in all
of this.

11:16.209 --> 11:20.847
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, any number
of candidates have said things
like, well, don't you just

11:20.847 --> 11:27.086
want to ask me about what I want
to do, John Kasich being one of
them. Senator Lindsey

11:27.086 --> 11:33.092
Graham of South Carolina came
out with another strongly-worded
statement saying, come on,

11:33.092 --> 11:36.896
let's just ditch this guy,
basically, more or less.

11:36.896 --> 11:42.735
And I think what's going on
here, what's interesting though
is that Donald Trump keeps going
from

11:42.735 --> 11:47.974
feud to feud to feud. He said
mean things about Megyn Kelly.
Then he moved on and

11:47.974 --> 11:52.612
said mean things about Carly
Fiorina, one of the other
presidential candidates, and

11:52.612 --> 11:58.585
he keeps doing that, keeps
sparking these feuds. It's kind
of like rap feuds of the

11:58.585 --> 12:04.591
'90s, where they're feuding and
actually the feud gives
everybody more publicity. So

12:04.591 --> 12:08.828
some candidates are embracing
the fight with Trump.

12:08.828 --> 12:13.333
GWEN IFILL: It's true. I have
been following this feud between
Meek Mill and Drake over

12:13.333 --> 12:16.202
the last week. I have no idea
what it's about, but I know it's
a beef.

12:16.202 --> 12:20.073
OK. So, we have the same thing
happening here. But here's what
I'm curious about,

12:20.073 --> 12:25.044
Susan. There's power in this,
isn't there? He was mad at FOX
News, but now it appears

12:25.044 --> 12:29.215
he's going to appear on FOX News
because he made up with Roger
Ailes.

12:29.215 --> 12:32.552
SUSAN PAGE: So, here's the
amazing thing. Not only does he
lead in the polls, but

12:32.552 --> 12:35.989
Donald Trump is defining
the entire conversation.

12:35.989 --> 12:41.327
So the other nominees, the other
candidates either try to get
into the story, like Rand

12:41.327 --> 12:45.264
Paul criticizing him as not
really a real conservative or
Bobby Jindal saying that he's

12:45.264 --> 12:48.067
going to just say Trump's name
randomly through his speeches in
an effort to get attention,

12:48.067 --> 12:51.204
or they're trying to figure out
how to talk about something
else.

12:51.204 --> 12:55.541
That's what you see with Marco
Rubio and John Kasich, where
they are really desperate to

12:55.541 --> 12:59.512
try to break through on the
issues that they want to talk
about and avoid having to
respond

12:59.512 --> 13:03.816
every day in every way to
outrageous comments by Donald
Trump. And I don't think that

13:03.816 --> 13:07.587
they have quite figured out how
to do that at the moment,
because Donald Trump is still,

13:07.587 --> 13:10.857
as he likes to be,
right at center stage.

13:10.857 --> 13:15.395
GWEN IFILL: OK, Tamara, let's
talk about Bernie Sanders. He
was on a West Coast swing

13:15.395 --> 13:20.366
this week and he attracted tens
of thousands of people to his
rallies in Seattle, in Portland,

13:20.366 --> 13:24.337
Oregon. And he's on his
way to Los Angeles today.

13:24.337 --> 13:28.007
Is this something -- first of
all, what is the appeal for
Bernie Sanders? Why is he

13:28.007 --> 13:31.277
getting these massive crowds at
this time, in August, for
heaven's sakes? And what

13:31.277 --> 13:34.180
are the Hillary Clinton
people thinking about this?

13:34.180 --> 13:39.419
TAMARA KEITH: Well, and, also,
he was endorsed today by the
nurses union. That's what he

13:39.419 --> 13:43.256
was doing in L.A., was picking
up this big national
endorsement.

13:43.256 --> 13:49.862
So Bernie Sanders has captured
something. He's really captured
a desire among many

13:49.862 --> 13:54.534
people to fix income inequality.
He's talking about college
affordability. He has been

13:54.534 --> 14:02.141
talking about that for months.
He really, in stark terms,
spells out the feeling that

14:02.141 --> 14:06.379
a lot of people have that it's
just harder to get ahead, and
that's what he's capturing,

14:06.379 --> 14:09.315
and people are showing
up to see him.

14:09.315 --> 14:13.886
Now, I can't tell you what
portion of the people in those
arenas are just there to say,

14:13.886 --> 14:18.958
hey, who is this guy and how
many of them would go out and,
say, caucus for him in Iowa

14:18.958 --> 14:24.263
or volunteer for his campaign.
It's not clear to me what the
share is in those people

14:24.263 --> 14:26.399
that are showing up.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.734
GWEN IFILL: That's the same
question that could be asked
about Donald Trump at this

14:27.734 --> 14:30.002
stage.

14:30.002 --> 14:33.539
But what I'm curious about,
Susan, also is whether the
Hillary Clinton people are
worried

14:33.539 --> 14:35.842
about it. She was asked about
it today and she just said, oh,
he's a nice colleague.

14:35.842 --> 14:38.945
She didn't have anything
negative to say about him.

14:38.945 --> 14:42.482
SUSAN PAGE: There is no
percentage for Hillary Clinton
to attack Bernie Sanders.

14:42.482 --> 14:45.384
There's every -- because
everything she wants to do is to
get Bernie Sanders supporters

14:45.384 --> 14:49.388
to support her either now or
later. She's really focused her
fire on the people she

14:49.388 --> 14:54.794
thinks will be her potential
opponents, Jeb Bush and today
Marco Rubio.

14:54.794 --> 14:59.465
But, certainly, Bernie Sanders
is underscoring some of the
vulnerabilities that Hillary
Clinton

14:59.465 --> 15:03.035
has. I don't think the Hillary
Clinton thinks he's going to
take the nomination, but when

15:03.035 --> 15:09.008
he gets 28,000 people to come to
a rally in Portland, Oregon, it
underscored -- could

15:09.008 --> 15:12.945
she get 20,000 people to come
there with no organization, with
no money for ads, with

15:12.945 --> 15:15.348
no infrastructure?

15:15.348 --> 15:20.653
So I think he's concerning in
that way, not so much that he
takes the nomination, but

15:20.653 --> 15:24.724
he shows the kind of energy
that she has yet to show.

15:24.724 --> 15:29.028
GWEN IFILL: You begin to wonder
if, at this stage of the
campaign, what we're really
watching

15:29.028 --> 15:34.033
for is the cumulative effect of
either the negative or e-mail
questions which don't go

15:34.033 --> 15:37.470
away, of the outrage from Trump
or even just the crowds building
on themselves for Bernie

15:37.470 --> 15:39.338
Sanders. Maybe
that's where we are.

15:39.338 --> 15:40.106
SUSAN PAGE: And, of course,
we're pretty far away from the
election.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.275
GWEN IFILL: No, we are?

15:42.275 --> 15:42.809
SUSAN PAGE: Yes, we are. We
are going to be talking about
this for a long time.

15:48.915 --> 15:52.318
is going to be, who has got
strengths and weaknesses and how
they might play out. But,

15:52.318 --> 15:55.621
a year from now, we will still
be talking about some of these
same characters.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.857
GWEN IFILL: And a year from
now, Tamara Keith will probably
still be in New Hampshire,

15:57.857 --> 15:59.659
but maybe we will see you
here this next week.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.993
TAMARA KEITH: Maybe.

16:00.993 --> 16:04.330
GWEN IFILL: Tamara Keith of
NPR, Susan Page with USA Today,
thank you both.

16:04.330 --> 16:14.707
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

16:14.707 --> 16:24.817
JUDY WOODRUFF: Authorities in
Saint Louis County, Missouri,
imposed a new state of emergency

16:24.817 --> 16:30.089
today after police critically
wounded an 18-year-old black man
overnight.

16:30.089 --> 16:34.961
It happened at the end of
protests in the town of Ferguson
marking the death of Michael

16:34.961 --> 16:41.133
Brown one year ago. Police said
a late-night demonstration got
rowdy, and Tyrone Harris

16:41.133 --> 16:44.770
Jr. and others opened fire on
them. They said officers shot
back, wounding Harris.

16:50.209 --> 16:53.212
convention today in Pittsburgh.

16:53.212 --> 16:58.517
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: I strongly condemn the
violence that was perpetrated

16:58.517 --> 17:06.259
against the community, including
the police officers, in Ferguson
last evening. Not

17:06.259 --> 17:13.132
only does violence obscure any
message of peaceful protest. It
places the community

17:13.132 --> 17:19.038
as well as the officers who are
seeking to protect it in harm's
way.

17:19.038 --> 17:24.043
JUDY WOODRUFF: There were new
protests around Ferguson and
Saint Louis today. Some 100

17:24.043 --> 17:28.648
people rallied at the county
courthouse. Nearly 60 were
arrested.

17:28.648 --> 17:33.219
I spoke a short time ago with
reporter Yamiche Alcindor, who's
covering the story for USA

17:33.219 --> 17:34.654
Today.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.923
Yamiche, welcome.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.725
What is the situation right now?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.962
YAMICHE ALCINDOR, USA Today:
Well, moments ago, several
protesters were arrested outside

17:42.962 --> 17:46.365
a federal courthouse building.

17:46.365 --> 17:51.270
And some of them are really
people that are really prominent
protesters, along with Cornel

17:51.270 --> 17:54.473
West. So, right now, they're
being processed at that federal
courthouse and they're actually

17:54.473 --> 17:59.312
facing federal charges. But
it's going to be really a $125
fine. They wouldn't really

17:59.312 --> 18:03.749
say whether or not it's a
misdemeanor or a felony, but of
course it's a $125 fine.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.286
So, it's not -- it's still a
summons. It's not going to be
anything too serious, but

18:07.286 --> 18:11.123
this is still part of the Moral
Monday that people had here
today, where it was really

18:11.123 --> 18:15.261
a series of civil disobediences
that they wanted to have in
coordination and really

18:15.261 --> 18:17.563
in memory of Michael Brown.

18:17.563 --> 18:21.067
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this was
planned before any of this
violence last night? Is that

18:21.067 --> 18:23.035
right?

18:23.035 --> 18:25.538
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Yes, before
any of the violence that
happened last night, before

18:25.538 --> 18:29.375
any of the looting, before the
second police-involved shooting.

18:29.375 --> 18:33.646
There are people that had
already planned to have acts of
civil disobedience. They

18:33.646 --> 18:37.950
were thinking about the idea
that, after Michael Brown's,
several people, hundreds of
people

18:37.950 --> 18:42.188
took to the streets protesting
and demonstrating, mostly
peacefully. But also of course
we

18:42.188 --> 18:45.658
remember that burned QuikTrip
that really put this whole story
on the nation's spotlight.

18:51.931 --> 18:55.868
Louis, there were several actual
acts of disobedience, but the
one that I attended today was at
the

18:55.868 --> 18:58.971
federal courthouse where several
members of the clergy got
together and were purposefully

18:58.971 --> 19:00.706
arrested.

19:00.706 --> 19:04.643
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we know
there is a state of emergency
that has been declared

19:04.643 --> 19:08.080
in the area as a
result of last night.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.717
But take us back to yesterday.
This was supposed to be a day --
in fact, it was a

19:11.717 --> 19:15.521
day of peaceful protest in
memory of Michael Brown. But
then what happened last night?

19:19.859 --> 19:23.829
night in Ferguson
when things get bad.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.466
Usually, what happens in
Ferguson, if there is going to
be violence, because I should

19:27.466 --> 19:30.669
say that there usually isn't
violence in Ferguson -- I have
been here several months -- but

19:30.669 --> 19:33.506
when there is violence, what
happens is that you get to a
point in the night where you

19:33.506 --> 19:37.610
think, OK, it's time to -- I can
go home, the crowd is kind of
dispersing.

19:37.610 --> 19:41.447
And then, out of nowhere, that's
what happened last night. There
was a line of police officers,

19:41.447 --> 19:44.483
protesters yelling at them, and
then after a while, it kind of
just lulled and people

19:44.483 --> 19:48.387
were kind of wandering around.
I myself was thinking about
getting into my car. And

19:48.387 --> 19:51.690
then we just heard a barrage of
gunshots. It was really the
most terrifying moments

19:51.690 --> 19:54.627
of my journalistic career.

19:54.627 --> 19:59.265
I ducked and was trying to run
behind cars. Dozens of police
officers were also cowering

19:59.265 --> 20:03.803
behind their cars. You know the
situation is really important
and really dangerous when

20:03.803 --> 20:08.507
the police are also running and
taking fire. And we later
learned that a young man was

20:08.507 --> 20:12.545
shot, and that it was a
police-involved shooting. The
police say there was one --
there was

20:12.545 --> 20:14.447
at first a group of two people
shooting and then one of the
people that were shooting

20:14.447 --> 20:16.549
ran away.

20:16.549 --> 20:20.419
They're calling him a suspect.
And that man ran away. And when
police spotted him,

20:20.419 --> 20:24.824
he started again firing at the
police. That's what police say.
And then they also returned

20:24.824 --> 20:27.193
fire and this young
man was shot.

20:27.193 --> 20:30.563
JUDY WOODRUFF: So there clearly
seem to be two sides to the
story. The young man's

20:30.563 --> 20:34.700
father is saying that he was
unarmed. The police are saying
they believed he shot at

20:34.700 --> 20:38.671
them. So, that remains
to be squared away.

20:38.671 --> 20:43.776
Yamiche, I want to read you
something that one of the Saint
Louis aldermen, Antonio French,

20:43.776 --> 20:47.613
who has been very active in the
protest movement, he told a
reporter, he said, there is an
active

20:47.613 --> 20:51.784
protest group, and then he said
there are some people who are
just waiting for stuff

20:51.784 --> 20:55.387
to happen, just sitting back and
waiting for an opportunity to,
in his words, steal stuff

20:55.387 --> 20:57.022
and cause trouble.

20:57.022 --> 20:59.592
Is that what you're seeing?

20:59.592 --> 21:02.695
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: That's
what I'm observing too.

21:02.695 --> 21:08.100
I must say that the protesters,
the frequent protesters that I
have see them, they're
well-known

21:08.100 --> 21:11.604
faces. They know the police
officers. I have been covering
this story for more than

21:11.604 --> 21:15.508
a year. So, these protesters,
not only do they know each other
and not only do they

21:15.508 --> 21:18.677
how to act peaceably, not only
do they how to de-escalate
situations, but they also know

21:18.677 --> 21:21.213
police officers. And they
trust some of these officers.

21:21.213 --> 21:25.451
And they will walk up to them
and say, hey, things are getting
out of hand, or I saw an

21:25.451 --> 21:28.354
officer mace somebody, we really
didn't think that that was
appropriate.

21:28.354 --> 21:32.725
So, really, Ferguson has come a
long way since last year.
Protesters are really now in

21:32.725 --> 21:37.396
some ways, dare I say,
friendships with officers. So I
think that that's a different --
completely

21:37.396 --> 21:40.933
different relationship than
those people -- I don't know if
you would call agitators -- but

21:40.933 --> 21:45.704
there are people that are really
there not in any way connected
to the memory of Michael

21:45.704 --> 21:48.541
Brown, not any way connected to
the issues that the protesters
are talking about, but

21:48.541 --> 21:52.511
really they're just
there to cause trouble.

21:52.511 --> 21:56.215
And these are the people that
the protesters don't want to be
associated with. And,
yesterday,

21:56.215 --> 22:00.352
last night, I thought it was
really an important moment when
Chief Jon Belmar really said
during

22:00.352 --> 22:04.957
his press conference that these
are not protesters, these are
criminals.

22:04.957 --> 22:08.661
And that's a really big deal for
the protesters that come out
here every night and are
peaceful

22:08.661 --> 22:12.631
for hundreds of days, when you
have the police also
differentiating that person.

22:12.631 --> 22:16.569
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jon Belmar, of
course, being the Saint Louis
police chief.

22:16.569 --> 22:22.841
Just quickly, Yamiche, based on
what you know, what do you
expect to happen now?

22:22.841 --> 22:29.615
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: I really want
to say that I expect that people
will try to remain as

22:29.615 --> 22:34.753
peaceful as possible, that
people will really try to see --
when they see things escalating,

22:34.753 --> 22:38.490
try to alert the police. But
that's what they did last night.

22:38.490 --> 22:42.461
So, I'm really kind of cautious
to say what's going to happen
tonight because I want to

22:42.461 --> 22:45.898
say that things are going to go
calmly. But I know that there
is still -- even with the

22:45.898 --> 22:49.368
peaceful protesters, they don't
want to be told when to go home.
They're really into

22:49.368 --> 22:53.372
protesting. They're really into
observing their First Amendment
rights.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.508
And that's really important to
them, so people are really going
to be out there tonight.

22:56.508 --> 23:00.379
They are going to be out there
late. I imagine they will have a
really long night tonight

23:00.379 --> 23:04.083
and to stay out probably past
5:00 in the morning, because
that's what people do in

23:04.083 --> 23:06.952
Ferguson, because even when
they're protesting peacefully,
they don't go to sleep early at

23:06.952 --> 23:09.822
all. They stay out
very, very late.

23:09.822 --> 23:14.560
So I'm really worried though
about when the sun sets and
these people that don't want

23:14.560 --> 23:17.730
to be protesters, that don't
want to be peaceful, but these
people that really want to break

23:17.730 --> 23:21.367
into businesses, whether or not
they are going to be back
tonight. I have a scary feeling

23:21.367 --> 23:25.170
that they might be back tonight.
And I think that all journalists
and all people that are

23:25.170 --> 23:28.073
there are really just trying to
be as cautious as we can be to
really prepare ourselves for

23:28.073 --> 23:29.942
tonight.

23:29.942 --> 23:34.613
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
Yamiche Alcindor, reporter for
USA Today, we certainly hope

23:34.613 --> 23:41.954
nothing happens, but we know, as
you said, you will be there if
it is. Thank you.

23:41.954 --> 23:46.525
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: Thank you.

23:46.525 --> 23:53.465
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

23:53.465 --> 23:57.836
Coming up on the "NewsHour": an
American doctor tells the story
of his efforts to halt the

23:57.836 --> 24:03.008
spread of Ebola and his own
fight against the deadly virus;
and how parents who are

24:03.008 --> 24:07.913
not religious can teach their
children about God and faith.

24:07.913 --> 24:13.686
But first, the rollout of a
controversial reproductive
health law in the Philippines

24:13.686 --> 24:16.989
long resisted by the
Catholic Church there.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.792
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro reports from Manila.

24:19.792 --> 24:24.196
A version of this story aired on
PBS' "Religion & Ethics
Newsweekly."

24:24.196 --> 24:30.202
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
It's known as the baby

24:30.202 --> 24:34.139
factory. But unlike most
factories, the people who run
Manila's biggest public hospital

24:34.139 --> 24:36.975
wish this one were
less productive.

24:36.975 --> 24:42.548
The staff here at the maternity
ward say this is a fairly
typical, if not slightly quieter

24:42.548 --> 24:51.924
than usual day. Still, there
are 165 new mothers squeezed
into 127 beds. About 70

24:51.924 --> 24:56.662
babies are delivered every day.
Their mothers are treated free
of charge. They couldn't

24:56.662 --> 25:02.434
afford much anyway, with
household incomes of $5 a day,
often less.

25:02.434 --> 25:08.107
Most, like Irene Ocampo, who's
19, will tell you their
pregnancy was unplanned.

25:08.107 --> 25:12.077
IRENE OCAMPO, Mother (through
translator): I didn't know
anything about family planning

25:12.077 --> 25:15.914
before becoming pregnant.
That's why I had my baby. I
would have preferred to start

25:15.914 --> 25:20.018
having children at
20-plus, maybe 25.

25:20.018 --> 25:26.058
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
hospital recently added a new
service that could help her
better

25:26.058 --> 25:29.962
control when or even whether
to have more children.

25:29.962 --> 25:32.297
IRENE OCAMPO (through
translator): I want to have
three to five years between
them.

25:38.737 --> 25:43.976
in congress and court. It
requires public health
facilities to offer free
contraceptive

25:43.976 --> 25:48.414
services. These have long been
legally available in private
clinics, which poor patients
like

25:48.414 --> 25:51.283
these women could never afford.

25:51.283 --> 25:55.754
DR. SYLVIA DE LA PAZ,
Philippines: We want all
pregnancies should be wanted and
should

25:55.754 --> 25:59.491
end in a healthy
baby and mother.

25:59.491 --> 26:04.263
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Obstetrician Sylvia De La Paz
has worked in these wards for 22

26:04.263 --> 26:08.200
years. In that time, she says,
most patients have seen their
living conditions go from

26:08.200 --> 26:10.602
poor to poorer.

26:10.602 --> 26:15.073
DR. SYLVIA DE LA PAZ: Before,
there used to be street
children. Now you see street

26:15.073 --> 26:18.877
families. They sleep in the
streets. They have no homes.

26:18.877 --> 26:23.649
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Most
disturbing, she says, has been a
spike in teen pregnancies:

26:23.649 --> 26:27.686
up 50 percent in the country in
the last decade, more than
double in this hospital.

26:27.686 --> 26:29.655
Why do you think that is?

26:29.655 --> 26:34.526
DR. SYLVIA DE LA PAZ: I think
it's also exposure to early
sexual encounters. The

26:34.526 --> 26:47.306
age is now, I think, 12 to 14,
where, before, it used to 16 to
18. It's slid down now.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.942
ANGEL, Philippines (through
translator): I had no idea that
young people like me could

26:49.942 --> 26:52.144
have family planning.

26:52.144 --> 26:56.682
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Angel came
to this clinic run by a
nonprofit group to be fitted
with

26:56.682 --> 27:01.153
a contraceptive implant. Like
most teenagers who come here,
she only learned of this service

27:01.153 --> 27:04.890
after becoming pregnant at 14.

27:04.890 --> 27:09.561
ANGEL (through translator): I
wanted to finish my studies to
become a teacher. Becoming

27:09.561 --> 27:12.231
pregnant broke my dreams.

27:12.231 --> 27:16.201
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Some
proponents of the new
reproductive health law say an
entire

27:16.201 --> 27:21.840
nation's dream has been broken
by its failure to control
population growth.

27:21.840 --> 27:26.979
For instance, the Philippines
and neighboring Thailand once
has similar poverty levels,

27:26.979 --> 27:32.518
but Thailand cut its population
growth rate substantially in
recent decades, the result,

27:32.518 --> 27:37.589
Thais are far better off
economically, says Dr. Esparanza
Cabral, a former Philippine

27:37.589 --> 27:41.059
health minister and one of the
architects of the new law.

27:41.059 --> 27:44.363
DR. ESPARANZA CABRAL, Former
Health Minister: We know that
there is a big correlation

27:44.363 --> 27:51.670
between number of children and
poverty incidents. So the less
number of children you have,

27:51.670 --> 27:58.710
the lesser are your chances that
your family is poor. So that is
one aspect. And we

27:58.710 --> 28:04.049
can see this not just a family
basis, but on a countrywide
basis.

28:04.049 --> 28:08.186
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Father Joel
Jason is a spokesman for the
Catholic Archdiocese of

28:08.186 --> 28:12.724
Manila. He argues people are an
economic asset. He says they
have been poorly served

28:12.724 --> 28:15.160
by their government.

28:15.160 --> 28:20.265
REV. JOEL JASON, Archdiocese of
Manila: Give people job
opportunities, give children
education,

28:20.265 --> 28:26.605
and then you bring them out of
poverty. Just giving them
condoms and contraceptives will

28:26.605 --> 28:31.977
not automatically draw
them out of poverty.

28:31.977 --> 28:37.749
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The church
has long been a huge influence
in this predominantly

28:37.749 --> 28:44.122
Catholic nation, its moral
teachings imprinted not just in
liturgy, but also in law.

28:44.122 --> 28:49.194
The Philippine constitution,
updated in 1987, says that the
state shall equally protect

28:49.194 --> 28:54.933
the mother and the unborn from
conception, and that's the basis
of opposition to the

28:54.933 --> 28:58.971
reproductive health law.
Opponents argue that just about
all methods of artificial

28:58.971 --> 29:03.342
contraception can
lead to abortion.

29:03.342 --> 29:08.380
Despite church opposition, the
court upheld most of the new
law, directing the country's

29:08.380 --> 29:15.654
food and drug administration to
approve non-abortion-causing
contraceptives. But the fight
hasn't ended.

29:15.654 --> 29:21.026
Some opponents plans to go back
to court. They argue the
methods now approved, like

29:21.026 --> 29:26.965
injectables or implants, pills
and IUDs, make the uterus
hostile to implantation, that
is,

29:26.965 --> 29:31.770
they prevent an embryo, which is
legally protected, from
attaching to the womb.

29:31.770 --> 29:36.041
Maria Noche is an attorney with
the group Alliance for the
Family.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.410
MARIA CONCEPCION NOCHE, Alliance
for the Family: All the
contraceptives that have been
registered

29:38.410 --> 29:43.415
right now, per our studies,
are all abortifacient.

29:43.415 --> 29:48.553
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That is,
using them can lead to abortion.

29:48.553 --> 29:53.025
Father Jason draws a distinction
between contraception and family
planning, for which the church

29:53.025 --> 29:55.994
has no problem, he says.

29:55.994 --> 30:02.034
REV. JOEL JASON: You will not
find any single document,
present or in the past, that the

30:02.034 --> 30:06.071
church says women should have as
many children as they can
possibly bear.

30:06.071 --> 30:10.108
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In fact,
Pope Francis drew worldwide
attention after recently
visiting

30:10.108 --> 30:14.713
the Philippines when he said
Catholics need not breed like
rabbits.

30:14.713 --> 30:20.385
But the pontiff reiterated that
the only acceptable birth
control method is natural family
planning,

30:20.385 --> 30:25.991
or NFP, where couples abstain
from sex on days when the woman
is fertile. Jason says

30:25.991 --> 30:30.028
artificial methods are a
symbol of a moral decay.

30:30.028 --> 30:35.867
REV. JOEL JASON: Why did we
invent contraceptives? Not
because NFP doesn't work, but
because

30:35.867 --> 30:42.340
we do not want to say no. And
that is why we are actually
slowly losing our sense of

30:42.340 --> 30:45.477
what sexuality
really is all about.

30:45.477 --> 30:51.850
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Back in the
maternity ward, Blessy Padua, a
laundry assistant who

30:51.850 --> 30:56.855
did go to high school, says she
and her husband did try what she
calls the calendar method,

30:56.855 --> 30:59.391
without success.

30:59.391 --> 31:03.562
BLESSY PADUA, Philippines
(through translator): I am
Catholic, and I am aware the
Church

31:03.562 --> 31:09.334
does not approve of family
planning, that God said go and
multiply. But at the same

31:09.334 --> 31:13.271
time, I already have a lot of
kids. I had to stop getting
pregnant.

31:13.271 --> 31:17.476
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: After
delivering her seventh child,
34-year-old Padua opted to

31:17.476 --> 31:20.445
be sterilized.

31:20.445 --> 31:25.617
Obstetrician De La Paz says, for
many women here, especially
those younger and unmarried,

31:25.617 --> 31:29.788
natural family planning is not a
good choice or a choice at all.

31:29.788 --> 31:33.925
DR. SYLVIA DE LA PAZ: Yes, a
lot of them have challenges with
their partners, who have

31:33.925 --> 31:38.630
issues with alcoholism, no job,
or inadequate income, so...

31:38.630 --> 31:44.136
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: How many of
them are married, would you
guess?

31:44.136 --> 31:48.707
DR. SYLVIA DE LA PAZ:
The majority not.

31:48.707 --> 31:53.545
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: One year
since implementation of the new
law began, she says most urban

31:53.545 --> 31:58.550
women now have access to family
planning services. About a
third of Philippine women still

31:58.550 --> 32:03.855
lack such access, most in rural
areas of this sprawling
archipelago.

32:03.855 --> 32:08.093
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam Lazaro in the
Philippines.

32:08.093 --> 32:11.930
GWEN IFILL: Fred's reporting is
a partnership with the
Under-Told Stories Project at
Saint

32:11.930 --> 32:19.905
Mary's University in Minnesota.

32:19.905 --> 32:32.551
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: the
medical doctor who was airlifted
from Liberia to the U.S.

32:32.551 --> 32:37.255
one year ago this month after he
contracted Ebola while treating
patients in West Africa.

32:44.663 --> 32:49.000
treated with the experimental
drug ZMapp at Emory University
Hospital in Atlanta. Both

32:49.000 --> 32:52.070
eventually recovered.

32:52.070 --> 32:56.908
Now Dr. Brantly and his wife,
Amber, have written a book about
the experience. He

32:56.908 --> 33:00.212
recently sat down with Hari
Sreenivasan in our New York
studio.

33:00.212 --> 33:04.549
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, it's
almost exactly a year ago, after
you quarantined yourself.

33:04.549 --> 33:10.856
You have got all the symptoms.
You have got the vomiting, the
diarrhea, the bloodshot

33:10.856 --> 33:15.460
eyes, things that you have been
seeing in patients and treating.
And, for the most

33:15.460 --> 33:19.064
part, those patients have been
dying. What's going through
your head?

33:19.064 --> 33:22.567
DR. KENT BRANTLY, Ebola
Survivor: Before I received my
diagnosis, the main symptoms

33:22.567 --> 33:29.074
I had were fever, fatigue,
body aches and diarrhea.

33:29.074 --> 33:36.181
When the diarrhea started, that
was more mounting evidence that
this really is probably Ebola.

33:36.181 --> 33:40.752
But I held on to that hope that
it was something else until we
had the definitive test result.

33:47.692 --> 33:53.465
been a dozen, maybe 18 monkeys
had got it. What went through
your mind in making that

33:53.465 --> 33:58.737
decision to say either yourself
or your colleague at the time
Nancy should take this?

33:58.737 --> 34:03.742
DR. KENT BRANTLY: Nancy and I
actually talked on the phone. I
remember she called me and

34:03.742 --> 34:09.281
said, after we had the kind of
informed consent discussion with
the doctor that was in charge

34:09.281 --> 34:12.918
of our care, she said, "Kent,
what are you going to do?
Because I'll probably do
whatever

34:12.918 --> 34:15.787
you do."

34:15.787 --> 34:20.091
And I said, "I think I would
be willing to receive it."

34:20.091 --> 34:24.529
But it was -- you know, I
thought, otherwise, I'm probably
going to otherwise, and this

34:24.529 --> 34:30.769
may or may not help, but at
least I could be a guinea pig
and let the world know whether

34:30.769 --> 34:33.171
there is any benefit
to it or not.

34:33.171 --> 34:38.109
HARI SREENIVASAN: Once you get
this special air ambulance that
is arranged, the State

34:38.109 --> 34:41.513
Department, lots of people
working to try to make this
happen, it's a bit cloak and

34:41.513 --> 34:46.184
dagger. You're literally taken
to the airport at night.
There's -- before this, there

34:46.184 --> 34:48.920
are countries that don't even
want you flying over their
airspace.

34:48.920 --> 34:55.393
DR. KENT BRANTLY: It did seem
like something from a movie.

34:55.393 --> 34:59.364
When I got out of that, what we
called an ambulance -- it was
the back of a pickup truck

34:59.364 --> 35:05.670
-- and was being helped on to
the airplane, you know, I --
part of me really thought,

35:05.670 --> 35:09.407
this is pretty cool. I'm being
evacuated on like this
top-secret jet. And I wanted

35:09.407 --> 35:14.312
to look around and look at the
airplane, but it took every bit
of effort I had just to

35:14.312 --> 35:17.482
put one foot in front of the
other to get on to that
airplane.

35:17.482 --> 35:22.220
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
little bit about your loved
ones. While you're in this

35:22.220 --> 35:26.458
kind of medically necessary
quarantine, your wife and your
kids were almost in a socially

35:26.458 --> 35:29.394
necessary quarantine of sorts.

35:29.394 --> 35:37.135
DR. KENT BRANTLY: They left
Liberia three days before I got
sick. And once my diagnosis

35:37.135 --> 35:44.709
was confirmed, they were put
in a quarantine of sorts.

35:44.709 --> 35:48.279
They were monitored by the
Health Department, had to check
their temperature several times

35:48.279 --> 35:54.319
a day, had to have two people
sign off on the temperatures
every day. But there was

35:54.319 --> 36:00.658
a lot of fear surrounding that
whole situation in the general
public. And people weren't

36:00.658 --> 36:06.231
sure what to make of a patient
with Ebola being brought back to
the United States, and

36:06.231 --> 36:09.000
then the recognition that, oh,
there other people who have been
in that country who are

36:09.000 --> 36:11.636
now walking around in public.

36:11.636 --> 36:15.507
And I think that created a lot
of fear because of the unknown.

36:15.507 --> 36:20.178
HARI SREENIVASAN: You also
mentioned that there were
certain cultural hurdles and
obstacles,

36:20.178 --> 36:22.647
that some of that fear was also
happening in West Africa in a
totally different way.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.288
Africa and here.

36:30.288 --> 36:34.692
Here, everybody was afraid that,
we're all going to get Ebola,
we're all going to die.

36:34.692 --> 36:43.835
In West Africa, the fear kind of
presented itself as denial that
Ebola was even real

36:43.835 --> 36:48.673
or that a loved one who had all
the symptoms of Ebola, but it
must be something else.

36:48.673 --> 36:52.043
HARI SREENIVASAN: What role do
you think your faith played in
all this?

36:52.043 --> 36:58.216
DR. KENT BRANTLY: That's a hard
question for me to answer,
because I try not to
compartmentalize

36:58.216 --> 37:04.189
my life into, this is my faith
life, this is my work life, this
is my family life.

37:04.189 --> 37:10.261
My faith is an integral part of
who I am. It's part of the lens
through which I view

37:10.261 --> 37:17.635
everything in life. So, I can't
separate this experience from my
faith.

37:17.635 --> 37:20.738
HARI SREENIVASAN: Some people
are going to say, look, the
difference might not be

37:20.738 --> 37:25.543
his faith. It's that he's an
American and he got literally
the best care on the planet

37:25.543 --> 37:28.913
for this, vs. all the people who
don't get that, not just in
Liberia, but anywhere else.

37:36.521 --> 37:42.227
I don't think there is anything
special about my faith that
saved my life. If anything,

37:42.227 --> 37:48.666
my faith is what put me in a
position where I got Ebola. And
I'm really thankful to

37:48.666 --> 37:54.806
the United States government, to
the government of Liberia, to
Emory University Hospital,

37:54.806 --> 37:59.577
to Phoenix Air, to the State
Department, all of the people
that played a role in providing

37:59.577 --> 38:03.681
me with the treatment
I received.

38:03.681 --> 38:08.720
I don't say that, oh, it was my
faith that saved me, not those
people. I believe God

38:08.720 --> 38:18.930
used those people to save my
life, not because of my great
faith. It just is. And so

38:18.930 --> 38:21.900
I give God the credit for it.
But I thank all of those people,
and I -- I love them.

38:22.734 --> 38:25.703
HARI SREENIVASAN: Would
you do this again?

38:25.703 --> 38:29.707
DR. KENT BRANTLY:
I would. I would.

38:29.707 --> 38:35.380
That is what Amber and I feel
like. That's the kind of life
God has called us to. And

38:35.380 --> 38:40.485
in some ways, we're really eager
to get back to that, to get out
of a life where we're

38:40.485 --> 38:44.856
doing book tours and stuff and
get back to the life of service
that we feel called to.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.427
The book is called
"Called for Life."

38:49.427 --> 38:51.596
Thanks so much for joining us.

38:51.596 --> 39:01.673
DR. KENT BRANTLY:
Thank you, Hari.

39:01.673 --> 39:07.879
GWEN IFILL: We will be back
with a conversation about how to
talk to your children about
religion.

39:14.619 --> 39:18.122
to ask for your support. And
that support helps keep programs
like ours on the air.

39:20.558 --> 39:30.735
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the latest
addition to the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

39:30.735 --> 39:36.741
Raising children is a journey
generously sprinkled with what
many view as teachable moments,

39:36.741 --> 39:40.712
perhaps none as challenging as
those surrounding faith and
religion.

39:40.712 --> 39:44.616
Author, journalist and
"NewsHour" online parenting
columnist Wendy Thomas Russell
comes at this

39:44.616 --> 39:50.622
from a different angle in her
new book, "Relax, It's Just God:
How and Why to Talk to Your

39:50.622 --> 39:53.591
Kids About Religion When
You're Not Religious."

39:53.591 --> 39:59.497
She recently talked with Jeffrey
Brown and explained how the book
came to be.

39:59.497 --> 40:04.802
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL, Author,
"Relax, It's Just God: How and
Why to Talk to Your Kids

40:04.802 --> 40:09.440
About Religion When You're Not
Religious": I was in the car,
and my daughter announced

40:09.440 --> 40:14.045
to me that God had made her and
that God had, in fact, made all
children and all people.

40:14.045 --> 40:14.679
And...

40:14.679 --> 40:17.515
JEFFREY BROWN: And you thought?

40:17.515 --> 40:22.487
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL: And I was
so -- you know, she was so
incredulous because she just

40:22.487 --> 40:24.389
thought, this seems like really
big news, and how you don't know
it, mommy, is really

40:24.389 --> 40:25.823
beyond me.

40:25.823 --> 40:30.128
So -- but it did. It struck me.
I was really caught off guard by
it. And it...

40:30.128 --> 40:33.598
JEFFREY BROWN: And what
did you say to her?

40:33.598 --> 40:40.672
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL: I didn't
say much at the time. I sort of
stumbled through

40:40.672 --> 40:43.975
the conversation, oh, who is
God? And I sort of stumbled
through the conversation,

40:43.975 --> 40:47.679
and then later went home
and talked to my husband.

40:47.679 --> 40:53.651
And he said, you know, it's not
what Maxine believes, but what
she does in life that matters.

40:53.651 --> 41:01.225
And it was a turning point for
me, this idea that, if we raise
kids to be moral and

41:01.225 --> 41:05.163
ethical and kind and generous,
then what they believe is
secondary. And it was -- it's

41:05.163 --> 41:07.865
been a guiding
force to the book.

41:07.865 --> 41:11.569
JEFFREY BROWN: I want to ask
you about the title. For so
many people, God and their

41:11.569 --> 41:13.805
religion are a basic component
of who they are. It's not just
God.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.606
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL: Right.

41:15.606 --> 41:18.276
JEFFREY BROWN: And yet you use
that, just God, relax, it's just
God.

41:18.276 --> 41:19.477
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL: Right.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.879
JEFFREY BROWN:
What do you mean?

41:21.879 --> 41:26.884
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL: I don't
mean to be flippant or
insensitive in any way, but it

41:26.884 --> 41:32.023
does seem like there are certain
topics that are hard for parents
to talk about and to

41:32.023 --> 41:34.759
broach with their children.

41:34.759 --> 41:42.867
And, increasingly, religion is
becoming a one of them, and in a
lot of secular families,

41:42.867 --> 41:46.237
the word God is almost replacing
sex as kind of this taboo
subject. So...

41:46.237 --> 41:47.972
JEFFREY BROWN: The hard
discussion that parents might
have.

41:47.972 --> 41:50.141
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL:
Exactly. Yes.

41:50.141 --> 41:56.881
What I was getting at was that
it's not such a difficult
subject if you approach it in

41:56.881 --> 42:01.853
the right way. And so we
can all sort of lighten up.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.654
JEFFREY BROWN: You are coming
at this as a secular,
nonreligious parent.

42:03.654 --> 42:06.424
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL: Correct.

42:06.424 --> 42:10.361
JEFFREY BROWN: You see a
growing need for this kind of
discussion.

42:10.361 --> 42:12.663
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL: I do.

42:12.663 --> 42:16.901
Religion isn't going anywhere.
Religion is going to be around
for a very long time.

42:16.901 --> 42:21.839
But it's true that secularism is
on the rise. And it's growing
rapidly. And it's

42:21.839 --> 42:27.245
grown in the last 20 years. The
problem with a lot of parents in
this particular group

42:27.245 --> 42:33.551
is that they are trying to raise
their kids in this era of
transition or this era of
change.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.988
So let's come up with a way that
we can talk to our kids about
religion that's completely

42:38.923 --> 42:42.193
honest, that values critical
thinking, that values religious
tolerance and literacy, and

42:42.193 --> 42:46.731
that kind of leaves the door for
kids to really make up their own
minds.

42:46.731 --> 42:51.068
JEFFREY BROWN: Give me an
example of a common dilemma that
parents find when it comes to

42:51.068 --> 42:52.837
raising their children
vis-a-vis religion.

42:52.837 --> 42:56.507
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL:
There are quite a few.

42:56.507 --> 43:02.914
And I did a survey of 1,000
nonreligious parents to find out
exactly that. And the top
reason

43:02.914 --> 43:05.583
cited was, people weren't sure
how to talk about religion
without indoctrinating their

43:05.583 --> 43:08.519
kids into what they believed
themselves. That was a hard
line.

43:08.519 --> 43:11.889
The other one was interacting
with religious family members
and keeping the peace in
families.

43:11.889 --> 43:17.261
When you're raising a child who
is in a secular household, how
do you bridge the gap

43:17.261 --> 43:21.199
between the older generations
who may be more rigidly
religious?

43:21.199 --> 43:28.072
JEFFREY BROWN: This word
indoctrinating is an important
one, because it comes up time

43:28.072 --> 43:33.110
and time again here. What's the
difference between
indoctrinating and guiding
children,

43:33.110 --> 43:34.011
right?

43:34.011 --> 43:37.682
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL: Right.

43:37.682 --> 43:52.096
Indoctrination, I see, as almost
the antithesis of critical
thinking. Of course it's fine

43:52.096 --> 43:55.967
to guide your children, but I
see indoctrination as sort of
this middle ground between
full-on

43:55.967 --> 43:59.704
brainwashing and guidance. it's
stronger than -- it's stronger
than just merely guidance.

43:59.704 --> 44:14.719
I see indoctrination as telling
children that there is only one
way to believe, and that

44:16.687 --> 44:28.599
all other ways and people who
believe all other things are
less worthy of our respect,

44:28.599 --> 44:37.975
less intelligent, less moral.
It's that -- that's the crucial
issue, because I think

44:37.975 --> 44:48.519
that, when you do that, you set
up your child to be bigoted
against those who don't believe

44:48.519 --> 44:51.756
the way that you do. You know,
we are -- it's not a
black-and-white world.

44:51.756 --> 44:56.127
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so give me
an example of the most basic
question of -- your child

44:56.127 --> 45:01.666
says, mommy, does God exist and
what is God or who is God?

45:01.666 --> 45:09.140
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL: The way
that I go about it is to say,
that's a great question,

45:09.140 --> 45:18.316
and I'm glad you're thinking
about it, that there are a lot
of different ways that people

45:18.316 --> 45:21.285
describe God and
describe what God is.

45:21.285 --> 45:31.896
And this is what some people
believe, and this is what other
people believe. And this

45:31.896 --> 45:37.735
is -- and I don't believe in
God, but that's OK. It's all
OK. And you get to make up

45:37.735 --> 45:40.871
your own mind about
what to believe.

45:40.871 --> 45:53.951
JEFFREY BROWN: Isn't that kind
of mushy? Isn't it the job of a
parent to guide -- I

45:53.951 --> 46:32.123
will use the word guide again --
their child to say, well, no,
it's not just this, it could

46:32.123 --> 46:39.897
be this, it could be that,
whatever you think, whatever
goes?

46:39.897 --> 46:42.533
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL: Right.

46:42.533 --> 46:48.439
Well, I think within reason.
And I do -- I see a difference
between guiding your child

46:48.439 --> 46:52.410
to be a moral person, an ethical
person, a self-respecting
person, a critical thinker.

46:52.410 --> 46:55.279
Those are all really
important things.

46:55.279 --> 47:17.034
Guiding them to believe in a
certain way, in a certain God or
a certain prophet, that

47:17.034 --> 47:56.340
is not so important. I really
want to focus on what people do
in life and not what they
believe, because if we can

47:56.340 --> 48:13.124
judge people on their actions,
and not what we think the
reasons behind their actions

48:13.124 --> 48:24.401
are, it makes for a more
tolerant world and a better
world.

48:24.401 --> 48:26.403
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

48:26.403 --> 48:37.615
The book is "Relax,
It's Just God."

48:37.615 --> 48:44.155
Wendy Thomas Russell,
thank you so much.

48:44.155 --> 48:55.399
WENDY THOMAS RUSSELL:
Thank you, Jeff.

48:55.399 --> 49:07.611
