THE SO-CALLED SILVER TSUNAMI

20:07.361 --> 20:08.991
>> WELL, THIS IS TERRIFIC NEWS.
THE SO-CALLED SILVER TSUNAMI
THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN SCARED OF

20:08.993 --> 20:12.821
THE SO-CALLED SILVER TSUNAMI
THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN SCARED OF
HAS JUST BEEN GRADE DOWN GRADED

20:12.823 --> 20:14.653
THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN SCARED OF
HAS JUST BEEN GRADE DOWN GRADED
FROM GRADE 5 TO GRADE 4.

20:14.655 --> 20:16.851
HAS JUST BEEN GRADE DOWN GRADED
FROM GRADE 5 TO GRADE 4.
THE KEY THING TO KNOW IS WE'RE

20:16.853 --> 20:19.482
FROM GRADE 5 TO GRADE 4.
THE KEY THING TO KNOW IS WE'RE
NOT OUT OF THE WOODS BUT

20:19.484 --> 20:21.647
THE KEY THING TO KNOW IS WE'RE
NOT OUT OF THE WOODS BUT
SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS OR EVEN

20:21.649 --> 20:23.845
NOT OUT OF THE WOODS BUT
SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS OR EVEN
SLIGHTLY I DON'T THINKER COHORT

YEARS PAWRT MAY NOT HAVE THE
SAME RISK.

20:27.877 --> 20:28.841
YEARS PAWRT MAY NOT HAVE THE
SAME RISK.
SO IN OTHER WORDS OUR CHILDREN

20:28.843 --> 20:30.506
SAME RISK.
SO IN OTHER WORDS OUR CHILDREN
OR OUR GRANDCHILDREN MAY NOT

20:30.508 --> 20:33.870
SO IN OTHER WORDS OUR CHILDREN
OR OUR GRANDCHILDREN MAY NOT
HAVE THE SAME RISK FOR

HAVE THE SAME RISK FOR
ALZHEIMER'S THAT WE DO.

20:34.871 --> 20:37.367
HAVE THE SAME RISK FOR
ALZHEIMER'S THAT WE DO.
THE SECOND THING THAT THESE

20:37.369 --> 20:39.332
ALZHEIMER'S THAT WE DO.
THE SECOND THING THAT THESE
STUDIES ARE POINTING OUT IS IF

20:39.334 --> 20:41.297
THE SECOND THING THAT THESE
STUDIES ARE POINTING OUT IS IF
THE RISK FOR ALZHEIMER'S IS

20:41.299 --> 20:43.163
STUDIES ARE POINTING OUT IS IF
THE RISK FOR ALZHEIMER'S IS
GOING DOWN FOR SUCCESSIVE

20:43.165 --> 20:44.028
THE RISK FOR ALZHEIMER'S IS
GOING DOWN FOR SUCCESSIVE
GENERATIONS THEN THAT IS GOOD

20:44.030 --> 20:45.493
GOING DOWN FOR SUCCESSIVE
GENERATIONS THEN THAT IS GOOD
NEWS BECAUSE IT INDICATES THAT

20:45.495 --> 20:47.858
GENERATIONS THEN THAT IS GOOD
NEWS BECAUSE IT INDICATES THAT
IT IS LIKELY TO BE DUE TO

20:47.860 --> 20:49.423

IT IS LIKELY TO BE DUE TO
ENVIRONMENTAL OR LIFESTYLE
