JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.205 --> 00:06.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.206 --> 00:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is on assignment.

00:07.808 --> 00:11.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: the
tightening
presidential race.

00:11.245 --> 00:15.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We break down the latest poll
numbers and
delve into where the candidates
stand on the

00:15.983 --> 00:17.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issue of climate change.

00:17.885 --> 00:25.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: As Chicago mourns its
500th homicide
in this year alone, residents
desperately

00:25.225 --> 00:28.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
search for solutions to the rise
in gun violence.

00:28.195 --> 00:31.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMAR MANASSEH, Mothers Against
Senseless
Killings: It's going to take a
lot of people

00:31.398 --> 00:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all doing something, not saying
something,
but doing something to fix that
problem.

00:37.104 --> 00:43.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And 15 years
after 9/11, a
new battlefront for fighting
terrorism.

00:43.777 --> 00:50.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much responsibility do
social media networks
have to stop the spread of
extremism online?

00:50.183 --> 00:55.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA LLANSO, Free Expression
Project: It seems
appealing to say, oh, just have
the major

00:55.756 --> 00:59.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
social media companies take a
hard-line approach
to anything having to do with
ISIS.

00:59.660 --> 01:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the fact is, that will end
up blocking
a lot of speech.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will end up deactivating
the accounts
of many users.

01:06.800 --> 01:10.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:10.637 --> 01:14.741 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:14.775 --> 01:27.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's an emerging
question in
the presidential campaign: Who
would be the

01:27.054 --> 01:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
better commander in chief?

01:29.256 --> 01:34.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton
will both
make their cases tonight on a
television special.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump was out this morning with
an early peek
at his argument.

01:37.764 --> 01:44.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Three crucial words that should
be at center,

01:44.771 --> 01:51.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always, of our foreign policy,
peace through
strength.

01:51.511 --> 01:58.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump's
visit to Philadelphia
today was all about military
policy.

01:58.518 --> 02:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He called for big increases in
defense spending
to beef up the Army, Navy and
Air Force after

02:04.725 --> 02:08.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
years of congressionally
mandated spending
limits.

02:08.061 --> 02:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: As soon as I take
office, I
will ask Congress to fully
eliminate the defense

02:12.399 --> 02:16.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sequester and will submit a new
budget to
rebuild our military.

02:16.436 --> 02:18.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is so depleted.

02:18.271 --> 02:23.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, Trump
and Hillary
Clinton appear separately in a
televised forum

02:23.343 --> 02:25.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on national security.

02:25.312 --> 02:32.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign
unveiled a list
of 95 retired generals and
admirals backing

02:32.152 --> 02:33.620 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

02:33.653 --> 02:38.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That a came a day after Trump's
team touted
a list of 88 endorsing him.

02:38.658 --> 02:44.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, former President
Clinton stumped
in Orlando, Florida, and called
out Trump's

02:44.331 --> 02:47.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks on his wife and on the
family foundation.

02:47.434 --> 02:51.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, Former President
of the United
States: I mean, I saw where her
opponent attacked

02:51.738 --> 02:54.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my foundation.

02:54.241 --> 02:58.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that is because he knew
they were
about to report that he used his
foundation

02:58.111 --> 03:02.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to give money to your attorney
general, but
-- which is not legal.

03:02.049 --> 03:08.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trump has denied
that his donation
of $25,000 to support Florida's
Republican

03:08.855 --> 03:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorney General Pam Bondi in
2013 was meant
to influence her office's
possible review

03:16.430 --> 03:18.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Trump University.

03:18.298 --> 03:24.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, there is fallout from
Trump's meeting
in Mexico last week with
President Pena Nieto.

03:24.404 --> 03:31.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has drawn wide criticism in
Mexico, and,
today, the treasury minister
resigned, amid

03:31.144 --> 03:33.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reports he arranged the Trump
visit.

03:33.980 --> 03:38.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will turn to the changing
shape of the
presidential race as reflected
in the polls

03:38.919 --> 03:40.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after the news summary.

03:40.821 --> 03:45.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
President Obama urged
Americans to learn more about
the world and

03:45.959 --> 03:47.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to reject isolationism.

03:48.028 --> 03:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was in Laos, where he toured
a centuries-old
Buddhist temple, and then held a
town hall

03:53.200 --> 03:55.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with youth leaders from across
Southeast Asia.

03:55.936 --> 04:00.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I believe that the United States
is and can

04:00.040 --> 04:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be a great force for good in the
world.

04:02.409 --> 04:09.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you're in the United
States, sometimes,
you can feel lazy, and think,
we're so big,

04:09.249 --> 04:13.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't have to really know
anything about
other people.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's part of what I'm
trying to change.

04:15.322 --> 04:21.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, at a
regional summit,
the president met informally
with Philippines

04:21.161 --> 04:23.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leader Rodrigo Duterte.

04:23.430 --> 04:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House called off a
formal meeting
when Duterte referred to Mr.
Obama using foul

04:29.336 --> 04:31.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
language.

04:31.271 --> 04:36.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Philippines also used the
summit to highlight
China's expansionism in the
South China Sea.

04:36.710 --> 04:41.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Filipino officials released
images said to
show an increased number of
Chinese ships

04:41.948 --> 04:43.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
near a contested island.

04:43.683 --> 04:49.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The summit issued a vaguely
worded statement,
but didn't mention China by
name.

04:49.456 --> 04:56.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United Nations reports
intense new fighting
in Western Syria has put at
least 100,000

04:56.263 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people to flight.

04:58.098 --> 05:03.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're fleeing homes in Hama
province, where
Islamist rebels launched an
offensive last

05:03.069 --> 05:05.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week, triggering government
airstrikes.

05:05.505 --> 05:12.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An estimated 11 million Syrians
have fled
since the war began in 2011.

05:12.179 --> 05:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of those migrants have gone
to Europe,
and Germany alone took in one
million people

05:17.484 --> 05:19.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last year.

05:19.286 --> 05:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That has caused a political
backlash, but
today German Chancellor Angela
Merkel went

05:23.723 --> 05:28.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before Parliament and insisted
the country
can handle the influx.

05:28.195 --> 05:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through
translator): The situation today
is many times

05:31.831 --> 05:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
better than a year ago for
everyone, but there
remains a lot to do.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Change is not a bad thing.

05:37.804 --> 05:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we especially -- and I can
speak for myself
-- who experienced German
unification have

05:41.942 --> 05:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seen how change can be a very
positive thing.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That will not change.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Germany will remain Germany,
with everything
that we love and treasure.

05:49.082 --> 05:53.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today,
Britain said it
is building a wall at the French
seaport of

05:53.620 --> 06:00.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Calais to stop illegal arrivals
of migrants
through the English Channel
Tunnel.

06:00.560 --> 06:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the
president has nominated
a man who could become the first
Muslim American

06:05.699 --> 06:07.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
federal judge.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Abid Riaz Qureshi is a
Washington, D.C., lawyer.

06:10.604 --> 06:15.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He would need Senate
confirmation, and it
is not clear if he can get it
before Congress

06:15.709 --> 06:18.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
goes home next month.

06:18.278 --> 06:24.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average
lost nearly 12 points to close
at 18526.

06:24.784 --> 06:29.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose eight points,
and the S&amp;P
500 slipped a fraction.

06:30.023 --> 06:35.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a woman who flew non-combat
missions in
World War II, and died just last
year, was

06:35.662 --> 06:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
finally laid to rest today in
Arlington National
Cemetery.

06:40.100 --> 06:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elaine Harmon served with the
WASPs, Women
Air Force Service Pilots.

06:45.205 --> 06:51.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But last year, the secretary of
the Army ruled
them ineligible for Arlington,
citing limited

06:51.544 --> 06:52.646 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
space.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took an act of Congress to
revoke that
ruling.

06:55.115 --> 07:00.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the newest
polls showing Donald Trump and
Hillary Clinton

07:00.220 --> 07:07.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in a dead heat; the two
candidates' views
on climate change; Chicago's
struggle to stem

07:07.127 --> 07:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its growing gun violence; and
much more.

07:21.374 --> 07:26.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we return to politics and a
tightening
race for president, both across
the nation

07:26.413 --> 07:28.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and in key battleground states.

07:28.848 --> 07:34.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New polls indicate Hillary
Clinton has a small
advantage, but Donald Trump is
closing the

07:34.354 --> 07:36.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gap in a few places.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There's a theme
in a this
week's political headlines,
different polls

07:41.895 --> 07:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with one conclusion: Nationally,
the race
between Donald Trump and Hillary
Clinton is

07:46.666 --> 07:47.834 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
getting closer.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The big picture?

07:49.569 --> 07:55.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton leads by three points,
according to
the RealClearPolitics polling
average.

07:55.675 --> 07:57.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is half of her lead a month
ago.

07:57.744 --> 08:01.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, her convention
bounce is almost
gone.

08:01.581 --> 08:06.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She still has some key
advantages, leading
in states with a bonanza of
electoral votes,

08:06.653 --> 08:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like California and New York.

08:08.722 --> 08:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton also has narrow leads in
pivotal battleground
states like Colorado and
Virginia.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Also in Clinton's favor, some
demographics.

08:17.664 --> 08:22.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is now far in front with a
much-watched
group, white college-educated
women, that

08:23.002 --> 08:24.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
according to The Washington
Post.

08:24.771 --> 08:29.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a reverse from 2012, when
Republican
Mitt Romney won with that group.

08:29.476 --> 08:32.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Trump, he has got strengths,
too.

08:32.746 --> 08:37.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is leading in the Midwest
overall, and
he is in striking distance in
Michigan and

08:37.650 --> 08:42.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wisconsin, which typically vote
Democratic
at the presidential level.

08:42.722 --> 08:48.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has also widened his lead
among older
white voters, and among those
without college

08:48.161 --> 08:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
degrees, he now leads Clinton in
at least
43 states.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What might be most important
here is the timing.

08:55.368 --> 08:59.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These dynamics are in play 60
days out from
the election.

08:59.272 --> 09:05.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past four elections, this
is exactly
when breakaway shifts began in
the polls.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

09:07.714 --> 09:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what do all
these polls
tell us about what's driving
voters?

09:13.086 --> 09:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And nine weeks out from Election
Day, what
do the candidates need to do to
drive their

09:17.357 --> 09:19.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
message home?

09:19.125 --> 09:24.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a deeper look with Dan
Balz, chief
correspondent for The Washington
Post, and

09:24.664 --> 09:26.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Carroll Doherty.

09:26.065 --> 09:30.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the director for political
research for
the Pew Research Center.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you back
to the program.

09:31.938 --> 09:36.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dan, I'm going to start with you
and your
newspaper's 50-state poll out
today.

09:36.843 --> 09:41.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do these numbers tell you
about where
the race stands today?

09:41.514 --> 09:44.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BALZ, Chief Political
Reporter, The Washington
Post: Judy, it tells us several
important

09:44.150 --> 09:49.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things, first, that the race has
tightened
from where it was after the
conventions.

09:49.622 --> 09:52.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton got a bigger
bounce out of
the Democratic Convention than
Donald Trump

09:53.026 --> 09:57.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
got from the Republican
Convention, and that
moved the polls in early and
mid-August.

09:58.031 --> 10:01.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what we have seen since then
is a tightening.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen a different Donald
Trump on the
campaign trail.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't say what reason it is
that it's tightened,
but it has tightened.

10:07.373 --> 10:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So that's the first point.

10:09.209 --> 10:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second point is that our
50-state poll
underscores the degree to which
Hillary Clinton

10:14.414 --> 10:20.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still has an easier path to 270
electoral
votes than Donald Trump does.

10:20.320 --> 10:26.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our numbers show that all she
would need to
do at this point is add Florida,
and she would

10:26.226 --> 10:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have 270 or more electoral
votes.

10:29.529 --> 10:32.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump has a long, long
way to go to
get there.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He has very few options.

10:34.767 --> 10:39.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has to thread the needle, and
she has many
choices and many options, both
in an effort

10:39.672 --> 10:44.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to block him in the states he
has to win,
but also to open up the map in
some areas

10:44.577 --> 10:46.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where she's might be able to
expand.

10:46.346 --> 10:50.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Carroll
Doherty, looking
at the polls you look at, which
are a lot

10:50.049 --> 10:55.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them, including your own Pew
poll, what
do you see there in terms of
Hillary Clinton's

10:55.922 --> 10:57.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
path?

10:57.824 --> 10:59.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARROLL DOHERTY, Director of
Political Research,
Pew Research Center: Well, I
mean, we look

10:59.826 --> 11:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the national picture, and
what you see
is two candidates who just are
viewed in extraordinarily

11:03.096 --> 11:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
negative ways, in different
ways, but in negative
ways.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In our poll in August, only
about three in
10 voters said that Hillary
Clinton would

11:10.970 --> 11:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make a good or great president,
and 27 percent
said Donald Trump would make a
good or great

11:15.708 --> 11:17.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are more people voting
against than
for these candidates in some
ways.

11:20.213 --> 11:24.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so negativity is really
driving a motivating
factor in this election.

11:24.951 --> 11:28.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Dan, given
that -- and
we have been hearing about this
negativity

11:28.054 --> 11:32.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for some time -- given that, how
do you explain
Hillary Clinton's advantage?

11:32.058 --> 11:38.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BALZ: Well, I think that, at
this point,
she has become less unacceptable
than Donald

11:38.097 --> 11:39.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump is.

11:39.666 --> 11:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, we have -- as Carroll
said, we have
to keep this in negative terms.

11:42.502 --> 11:47.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, one of the things we
looked at , we
asked a question of, do you
think Donald Trump

11:47.941 --> 11:52.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or Hillary Clinton would -- if
they became
president, would threaten the
well-being of

11:52.579 --> 11:54.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States?

11:54.414 --> 11:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ninety-five percent of the
people across the
country, when you aggregate it
up, believe

11:59.752 --> 12:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that one or both would be a
threat to the
well-being.

12:02.355 --> 12:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there is great concern about
these two
candidates.

12:05.224 --> 12:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But because of many of the
things that Donald
Trump has said up to now, the
record he has

12:10.229 --> 12:16.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
established as a candidate has
raised more
questions about him than Hillary
Clinton.

12:16.202 --> 12:21.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Carroll
Doherty, it is
the case that questions are out
there about

12:21.207 --> 12:24.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump, but there are also
some opportunities
for him which show up in the
polls.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARROLL DOHERTY: Absolutely.

12:26.546 --> 12:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you know, 43 percent say
he would
make not just a bad, but a
terrible president.

12:31.250 --> 12:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's probably an opportunity
to move some
of these numbers a little more
in his direction.

12:36.289 --> 12:41.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of these key groups,
such as whites,
whites with college degrees,
importantly,

12:41.761 --> 12:44.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who have been trending
Republican in recent
years, I think there is an
opportunity for

12:44.998 --> 12:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him there possibly to bring some
of those
voters back.

12:47.367 --> 12:52.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we have
already -- Dan,
we have already seen some
movement on his

12:52.038 --> 12:55.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part, as you mentioned, just
since the conventions.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAN BALZ: Well, we have.

12:57.243 --> 13:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the polling that we did,
which we did,
the online polling with the firm
SurveyMonkey,

13:01.047 --> 13:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the things we noticed is
that he does
have strength in the Midwest.

13:06.285 --> 13:10.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a number of Midwestern
states, some
of which have gone Democratic
for five or

13:10.723 --> 13:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six elections in a row, where
he's doing reasonably
well and is within striking
distance.

13:16.562 --> 13:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's opportunity in those
areas where
the electorate is older and
whiter.

13:22.602 --> 13:29.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Carroll said, one of the
problems
he has at this point, not
certainly it will

13:29.409 --> 13:33.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be the case on Election Day, but
right now,
is with white college-educated
voters and

13:33.880 --> 13:36.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particularly white women who
have college
degrees.

13:36.816 --> 13:41.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney won whites with
college educations
with 56 percent of the vote, and
Hillary Clinton

13:41.788 --> 13:43.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is winning that group at this
point.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So Donald Trump needs to do
that.

13:45.391 --> 13:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing he needs to
do, which
you would expect over time he
will have some

13:49.429 --> 13:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
success on, and that is
consolidating the
Republican vote in the way that
Hillary Clinton

13:54.434 --> 13:56.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has already consolidated the
Democratic vote.

13:56.703 --> 14:03.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why has he had a
hard time
with the white, more educated
voter and Republicans?

14:03.376 --> 14:09.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARROLL DOHERTY: Well, and
Republicans, a
bitter primary -- people forget
that he won

14:09.215 --> 14:15.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very divided -- over a divided
field, and
didn't win a majority of all
Republican votes

14:15.121 --> 14:16.889 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the primary.

14:16.923 --> 14:21.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So some of this is normal
consolidation, and
then some of it is
self-inflicted in terms

14:21.327 --> 14:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of some of the things he has
said and done
since then.

14:23.896 --> 14:29.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
Carroll Doherty,
how undecided are -- how many
voters out there

14:29.502 --> 14:30.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are undecided?

14:30.536 --> 14:33.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How malleable is voters'
thinking at this
point?

14:33.506 --> 14:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARROLL DOHERTY: The broadest
range we have
been able to estimate, maybe one
in five.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's probably down from where
it's been.

14:38.945 --> 14:43.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to factor in the third-
and fourth-party
factor this time and where they
might go as

14:43.916 --> 14:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well with Gary Johnson and Jill
Stein, but
about one in five or so.

14:47.353 --> 14:49.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's less than in prior
elections at
this stage.

14:49.522 --> 14:53.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dan, how do you
see this question
of how malleable, how -- how
many voters are

14:54.026 --> 15:00.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there out there who still might
make up their
minds, might change their minds,
go in another

15:00.333 --> 15:01.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
direction?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAN BALZ: It's very hard to
estimate.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think polling doesn't help
us a lot
on this.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, as Carroll said, there's
a sizable
number who say they haven't
quite made up

15:08.841 --> 15:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their mind or might change their
mind.

15:10.576 --> 15:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as we have said, this is
such an unhappy
electorate.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to think that most
people kind of
know where they're going to end
up, but they're

15:18.518 --> 15:22.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not -- they're just so
conflicted about the
choice, that they're not really
ready to say

15:22.722 --> 15:25.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with any certainty that they
will definitely
do that.

15:25.057 --> 15:29.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it leaves some
uncertainty
out there in where these polls
might move

15:29.328 --> 15:31.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the next 60 days.

15:31.264 --> 15:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And quick final
question to
Carroll Doherty about these
third-party candidates,

15:35.301 --> 15:37.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gary Johnson and Jill Stein.

15:37.637 --> 15:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you say at this point how
much of a factor
they can make?

15:41.541 --> 15:46.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CARROLL DOHERTY: History
suggests that August
measures of third-party support,
that would

15:46.145 --> 15:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decline over time, perhaps, but
this is a
very unusual election.

15:49.582 --> 15:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had Gary Johnson at 10
percent in our most
recent national poll.

15:53.152 --> 15:58.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His profile voter, very young,
very young
profile voters for Gary Johnson
at this point.

15:58.891 --> 16:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as you say,
typically
-- and, Dan, I will come back to
you very

16:02.895 --> 16:04.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quickly on this.

16:04.630 --> 16:08.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Typically, the third-party
candidates lose
ground in the final weeks of an
election?

16:08.401 --> 16:12.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN BALZ: That's usually true,
but I think
that the issue is if Gary
Johnson were able

16:12.939 --> 16:18.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to qualify and hit that 15
percent threshold
to get into the presidential
debates, that

16:18.044 --> 16:21.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would change that, because he
would then have
national visibility that he
doesn't have at

16:21.948 --> 16:22.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this point.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, so far, he is not quite at
that level.

16:25.117 --> 16:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's an
election like
we have never seen in so many
ways.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you, both, Dan Balz,
Carroll Doherty.

16:31.357 --> 16:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARROLL DOHERTY: Thank you.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAN BALZ: Thank you.

16:34.160 --> 16:38.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And next, we turn
now to our
periodic look at the major
issues facing the

16:38.130 --> 16:41.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
country, and where the
presidential candidates
stand on them.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tonight, the focus is climate
change.

16:43.569 --> 16:48.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a subject that has gotten
very little
attention so far during the
campaign, even

16:48.608 --> 16:52.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as it highlights one of the
starkest differences
between the candidates.

16:52.912 --> 16:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has our report.

16:55.047 --> 16:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This past
weekend, the U.S.
and China officially ratified
the so-called

16:59.819 --> 17:01.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Paris climate accords.

17:01.621 --> 17:05.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are the most substantial
move by the
world's nations to put some
limits on the

17:05.725 --> 17:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
greenhouse gas emissions that
are driving
global temperatures upwards.

17:09.929 --> 17:11.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And upwards, they keep going.

17:11.898 --> 17:16.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2016 is on pace to be the
hottest year in
recorded history, breaking the
record set

17:16.702 --> 17:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by 2015, and 2014 before that.

17:20.673 --> 17:25.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As many climate models
predicted, a warming
planet has coincided with
increased heat waves

17:25.278 --> 17:28.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and droughts, as well as more
intense storms.

17:28.281 --> 17:32.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Glaciers and ice sheets continue
to shrink,
sending sea levels upwards and
threatening

17:32.885 --> 17:38.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coastal communities all over the
world with
potentially catastrophic, costly
flooding.

17:38.090 --> 17:40.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Oppenheimer is a climate
scientist
at Princeton University.

17:40.726 --> 17:44.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL OPPENHEIMER, Princeton
University:
If we don't start with rapid
emissions reductions

17:44.830 --> 17:49.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and substantial emissions
reductions, that
we will pass a danger point,
beyond which

17:49.635 --> 17:55.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the consequences for many people
and countries
on Earth will simply become
unacceptable and

17:55.241 --> 17:56.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
eventually disastrous.

17:56.976 --> 18:01.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But the Paris
accords only
set voluntary caps on carbon
emissions.

18:01.147 --> 18:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So how seriously the United
States follows
through on these commitments, as
well as its

18:05.318 --> 18:09.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other efforts to curtail carbon,
will fall
largely on the next president.

18:09.789 --> 18:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while there are plenty of
policies where
Clinton and Trump have different
views, there's

18:13.626 --> 18:18.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably no greater divergence
between them
than on the issue of climate
change.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One thinks it is real and poses
a grave threat;
the other thinks it's a fantasy.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I think it's a big scam for a
lot of people

18:24.437 --> 18:25.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make a lot of money.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Donald Trump
has repeatedly
called climate change a hoax.

18:28.941 --> 18:33.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He claims the planet is
freezing, and that
scientists are -- quote --
"stuck in ice."

18:33.579 --> 18:38.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump argues that environmental
regulation
is an enormous anti-competitive
tax on U.S.

18:38.384 --> 18:42.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industry which also threatens
American jobs,
especially in the coal industry.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The federal
government, the
regulations that they have, they
put the coal

18:45.458 --> 18:46.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
miners out of business.

18:46.926 --> 18:48.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The coal mines are shut.

18:48.794 --> 18:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He says a
Trump administration
will undo as many regulations as
possible,

18:52.865 --> 18:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starting with President Obama's
Clean Power
Plan, which has put limits on
coal emissions.

18:57.703 --> 19:02.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has also promised to rip
up or cancel
the Paris accords, and block any
funding for

19:02.141 --> 19:04.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
international climate change
efforts.

19:04.310 --> 19:08.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He supports the expansion of
coal and oil
and natural gas as main energy
sources for

19:08.981 --> 19:10.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Climate change is such a
consequential crisis

19:12.985 --> 19:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to everybody in the world.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hillary
Clinton, on the
other hand, has repeatedly
called climate

19:17.490 --> 19:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change an urgent threat, and one
that is driven
in large part by human activity,
namely the

19:21.927 --> 19:23.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
burning of fossil fuels.

19:23.896 --> 19:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton supports cutting carbon
emissions,
supports the goals of the Paris
accords, as

19:28.034 --> 19:30.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well as President Obama's clean
energy plan.

19:30.936 --> 19:34.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton acknowledges these plans
will cost
coal industry jobs, and she has
proposed a

19:34.940 --> 19:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
multibillion-dollar renewable
energy plan
that she says will attempt to
replace some

19:39.678 --> 19:41.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of those lost jobs.

19:41.414 --> 19:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help understand what a
Clinton or Trump
administration might mean with
regards to

19:45.718 --> 19:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climate change, I'm joined now
by Coral Davenport,
who is an environmental reporter
for The New

19:49.855 --> 19:54.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York Times, and Chris Mooney,
who covers science
and the environment for The
Washington Post.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you both very much for
being here.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chris, I would like to start
with you.

19:58.097 --> 20:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before we get to the candidates,
let's talk
for a moment about, what does
the current

20:01.534 --> 20:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
science tell us about the
current impacts
of climate change?

20:05.404 --> 20:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS MOONEY, The Washington
Post: Well, 2016
is a very, very hot year.

20:08.774 --> 20:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're probably going to have
three hottest
year records in a row, 2014,
2015, 2016 topping

20:14.780 --> 20:16.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them all.

20:16.749 --> 20:22.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen some really
striking climate-related
effects on the world, most
starkly this year,

20:22.254 --> 20:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, the bleaching of coral
reefs, big
disaster at the Great Barrier
Reef.

20:25.491 --> 20:28.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is something that climate
scientists
have been predicting for a long
time, and

20:28.527 --> 20:29.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now it's happening.

20:29.695 --> 20:31.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's all kinds of impacts
all around
the world.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are losing more and more ice
from the polar
regions.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Seas are rising.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, temperature records
are being broken.

20:37.636 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Anything you
would add to
that, Coral?

20:39.472 --> 20:45.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORAL DAVENPORT, The New York
Times: I would
just say, the specific sort of
marker that

20:45.211 --> 20:52.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a lot of scientists and
scientific institutions
have put forth is the warming of
the atmosphere

20:52.151 --> 20:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beyond 3.7 degrees Fahrenheit,
on average.

20:56.489 --> 21:00.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's kind of the point at
which a lot of
scientists say we will be
irrevocably locked

21:00.726 --> 21:06.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a future of these climate
impacts, and
we're at the point right now
where scientists

21:06.732 --> 21:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say a lot of that is already
baked in.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There was a point...

21:10.736 --> 21:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There's no way
we're going
to stop hitting that mark.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CORAL DAVENPORT: Right.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a point in the climate
debate where
it was about, how do we keep
from getting

21:16.208 --> 21:18.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there?

21:18.043 --> 21:22.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this point, in terms of the
emissions that
are already in the atmosphere
and the rate

21:22.414 --> 21:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of emissions now being produced
today, scientists
are saying, we're probably set
to go past

21:28.654 --> 21:30.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that tipping point.

21:30.322 --> 21:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the debate is really about,
how do you
keep it from getting far, far
worse?

21:35.227 --> 21:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you keep the planet
inhabitable by
humans?

21:38.030 --> 21:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: OK, staying
with you, I'm
going to put the crystal ball in
your hands

21:41.700 --> 21:42.668 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's January 2017.

21:44.270 --> 21:46.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump is inaugurated
president.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does U.S. energy policy and
climate change
policy look like?

21:49.341 --> 21:54.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORAL DAVENPORT: Oh, well, the
most significant
climate policy that Donald Trump
has talked

21:54.446 --> 21:58.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about is, he calls it canceling
the Paris
agreement.

21:58.250 --> 22:04.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Paris agreement was a
landmark accord
reached last year in Paris which
for the first

22:04.623 --> 22:11.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time joined almost every country
on Earth,
over 195 countries, into
committing to taking

22:11.063 --> 22:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actions to reducing their carbon
emissions.

22:15.534 --> 22:18.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was key for the U.S. to be a
centerpiece
of that.

22:18.804 --> 22:26.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. and China are the
world's two largest
emitters of carbon emissions,
the U.S. historically

22:26.212 --> 22:27.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the largest.

22:28.013 --> 22:33.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the U.S. actually were to
pull out of the
Paris agreement, the deal could
potentially

22:33.152 --> 22:34.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unravel.

22:34.920 --> 22:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the question now is, what
would happen
in a Trump administration?

22:40.926 --> 22:47.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the rest of the world, led
by U.N. Secretary-General
Ban Ki-Moon, is trying to kind
of figure out,

22:48.000 --> 22:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, how do we keep the Paris
accord intact
if there were to be a President
Trump?

22:53.973 --> 22:55.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, Chris,
take on that
question.

22:55.774 --> 23:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does a president have the
ability, do they
have the levers to rip up the
Paris accords?

23:00.879 --> 23:05.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS MOONEY: It depends what
happens during
this administration before the
next president

23:05.951 --> 23:07.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
comes in.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a sort of rapid push
right now by
the Obama administration and
many nations

23:11.323 --> 23:13.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the world to bring it into
force.

23:13.792 --> 23:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once it actually enters into
force, then
-- you have to have 55 countries
representing

23:19.598 --> 23:21.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
55 percent of the global
emissions in order
to achieve that.

23:21.900 --> 23:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once that happens, there is
language in the
agreement saying you need three
years before

23:26.205 --> 23:27.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you can withdraw again.

23:27.306 --> 23:29.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then there's a year waiting
period.

23:29.108 --> 23:34.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it sounds like, from that
language, the
hands of the next president
could be tied

23:34.079 --> 23:35.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if this thing enters into force.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we're going to have to see.

23:37.316 --> 23:41.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, only about 40 percent
of global
emissions, 39 percent have
signed on, and

23:41.654 --> 23:43.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's because U.S. and China
just did.

23:43.289 --> 23:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you need India, you need
Canada, you need
Great Britain.

23:47.092 --> 23:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can do the math, right, but
you have to
get to 55, and you have to do it
this year.

23:51.997 --> 23:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then it would be more difficult
to withdraw.

23:54.700 --> 24:00.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a President Trump, if he
didn't want to
comply, but couldn't make it go
away, could

24:00.306 --> 24:01.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just not cooperate.

24:01.307 --> 24:03.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's not clear what would
happen then.

24:03.075 --> 24:06.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
crystal ball
is in your hands now.

24:06.178 --> 24:09.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
January 2017, Hillary Clinton is
inaugurated.

24:09.481 --> 24:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does energy policy look
like?

24:11.317 --> 24:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS MOONEY: I think it looks
like a pretty
strong continuation of Obama
climate policy.

24:14.720 --> 24:18.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think absolutely you would be
fulfilling
the Paris climate agreement and
trying to

24:18.424 --> 24:19.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
reduce U.S. emissions.

24:19.925 --> 24:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the goal is to get them 26
to 28 percent
below 2005 levels by 2025.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there's going to be a
process where
we ratchet up and try to make it
even more

24:28.267 --> 24:29.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ambitious.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure President Clinton would
be very much
on board with that.

24:31.570 --> 24:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, domestically, one of
the most interesting
things that you would see under
President

24:35.007 --> 24:38.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton is going to be the big
energy infrastructure
transition.

24:38.911 --> 24:40.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How much solar can we install?

24:40.846 --> 24:42.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do we integrate it onto the
grid?

24:42.881 --> 24:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much of a role is natural
gas still playing
as coal dwindles?

24:45.818 --> 24:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are going to be the kind
of real issues
during the Clinton years that
are going to

24:49.788 --> 24:52.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
determine how much the United
States puts
into the atmosphere.

24:52.458 --> 24:55.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Coral, I know
you have been
following this somewhat.

24:55.561 --> 25:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton got into some
trouble when
he said, as we make this push to
renewables,

25:00.666 --> 25:02.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coal jobs are going to be lost.

25:02.434 --> 25:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, she has put out a big
proposal to say,
I'm going to beef up renewables,
we're going

25:05.671 --> 25:08.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to try to save some of those
jobs.

25:08.073 --> 25:09.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How realistic is that?

25:09.942 --> 25:14.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CORAL DAVENPORT: It's
interesting to see Hillary
Clinton, even if it didn't come
out quite

25:14.246 --> 25:20.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way she meant it to, openly
acknowledge
that climate policy really does
direct take

25:20.519 --> 25:22.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aim at coal.

25:22.221 --> 25:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Burning coal for electricity is
the largest
source of planet-warming
emissions in the

25:27.259 --> 25:28.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.

25:28.927 --> 25:32.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if you're trying on stop
global warming,
you're going to take aim at
coal.

25:32.064 --> 25:37.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means eventually the coal
community,
coal miners, the coal-fired
power plants,

25:37.169 --> 25:38.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are going to get hurt.

25:38.404 --> 25:40.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Chris, last
question to
you.

25:40.739 --> 25:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ability of a president to
really make
meaningful contributions to this
debate, if

25:45.644 --> 25:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you were to go forward 50, 100,
150 years,
would we be able to tell the
difference between

25:52.718 --> 25:57.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Clinton administration and a
Trump administration,
meaning, how much influence do
presidents

25:57.489 --> 26:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really have on this policy when
we're talking
about a global problem?

26:01.193 --> 26:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS MOONEY: Some significant
influence,
but I agree with you that there
are so many

26:05.130 --> 26:06.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other things going on.

26:06.932 --> 26:11.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, one of the reasons
the United
States has actually been
reducing its emissions

26:11.036 --> 26:14.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in recent years is actually that
there's been
a boom in natural gas.

26:14.373 --> 26:15.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's displacing coal.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It emits less carbon dioxide
when you burn
it.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not really an Obama
policy.

26:19.378 --> 26:22.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's just something that
happened because
of technology and the free
market.

26:22.481 --> 26:28.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, globally, you're seeing a
big, big trend
towards large installations of
renewable energies

26:28.086 --> 26:29.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the world.

26:29.755 --> 26:33.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You are going to see huge
installations of
wind and solar in places like
Africa.

26:33.158 --> 26:35.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These things are going to happen
no matter
what.

26:35.060 --> 26:39.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to happen for
largely non-policy
free market reasons even in the
United States.

26:39.231 --> 26:43.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that there are
forces moving that
are not really at the
presidential level.

26:43.602 --> 26:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, the Obama
administration
kind of shows how you can use
diplomacy to

26:49.241 --> 26:51.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bring the most important
countries together
and get the whole world on
board.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I wouldn't discount that
either.

26:54.413 --> 26:58.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that the world will
continue trying
to grapple with the climate
problem, no matter

26:58.884 --> 27:00.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who is U.S. president.

27:00.786 --> 27:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that, depending on
who that president
is, it can have a significant
influence on

27:04.289 --> 27:06.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the trajectory.

27:06.058 --> 27:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Chris Mooney,
Coral Davenport, thank you both
very much.

27:17.035 --> 27:21.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:21.206 --> 27:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
woman who
revitalized the traditional
textile industry

27:26.178 --> 27:32.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Laos; and what social media
networks should
do to combat terrorism online.

27:32.217 --> 27:36.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first: a bloody year in
Chicago.

27:36.788 --> 27:42.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And residents, police and
community leaders
are asking why the violence is
getting worse,

27:42.227 --> 27:44.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
instead of better?

27:44.129 --> 27:51.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is already the deadliest year
in more than
two decades, 500 homicides so
far, 90 in August

27:51.069 --> 27:52.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
alone.

27:52.471 --> 27:56.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The killings were mostly
clustered on the
city's South and West Sides.

27:56.575 --> 28:02.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Yang went to Chicago to try
to find out
why, despite calls for new
action, the violence

28:02.714 --> 28:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there is so hard to rein in.

28:04.650 --> 28:13.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On this busy street
corner in Englewood,
one of the hardest-hit
neighborhoods on the

28:13.125 --> 28:16.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city's troubled South Side, it
looks like
a party.

28:16.094 --> 28:18.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kids are playing.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The grill is fired up.

28:20.999 --> 28:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the past, though, 75th and
Stewart felt
like a war zone.

28:25.871 --> 28:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMAR MANASSEH, Mothers Against
Senseless
Killings: This corner is a
corner where a

28:31.043 --> 28:33.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man was killed -- well, several
men, a woman
was killed, and a child was
killed.

28:33.111 --> 28:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A 9-year-old girl was killed
right across
the street over there washing
her dog in broad

28:36.648 --> 28:38.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
daylight.

28:38.517 --> 28:43.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But for two summers,
a group called
Mothers Against Senseless
Killings, or MASK,

28:43.121 --> 28:49.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led by Tamar Manasseh, has been
out on this
corner, and there hasn't been a
single shooting.

28:49.861 --> 28:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Volunteer Laura Lambert (ph)
comes from nearby
Hyde Park.

28:53.599 --> 28:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And 91-year-old Edwina Knight
(ph) crosses
the street every day from the
house she's

28:58.904 --> 29:00.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lived in for 57 years.

29:00.305 --> 29:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMAR MANASSEH: Just show up.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's all you have to do.

29:03.408 --> 29:07.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Show up, grab a lawn chair and a
pair of sunglasses,
and you can do this.

29:07.512 --> 29:09.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can change the world with
that.

29:09.314 --> 29:16.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But the moms of MASK
are only on
one corner in a city of 2.7
million people.

29:16.722 --> 29:19.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Killings have spiked this
summer.

29:19.124 --> 29:23.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chicago has already recorded
more homicides
this year than it did in all of
last year.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:25.631 --> 29:26.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY SLUTKIN, University of
Illinois at Chicago:
This is also very typical of all
epidemics.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can see the high density of
shootings.

29:29.034 --> 29:35.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: University of
Illinois at Chicago
physician Gary Slutkin says
epidemic is exactly

29:35.407 --> 29:36.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the right word.

29:36.975 --> 29:40.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He argues that violence is a
contagious disease.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.747 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY SLUTKIN: For example,
you're exposed
to flu, you're more likely to
get flu.

29:43.482 --> 29:46.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't actually get flu
without being exposed.

29:46.151 --> 29:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Same thing for T.B., cholera and
violence.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, why does someone who was
exposed to
child abuse, abuse their own
kids?

29:52.758 --> 29:56.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would be the person who you
would think
would be least likely to do it,
because he

29:56.795 --> 29:58.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
knows how bad it was.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in fact, he's picked up
this contagious
set of behaviors.

30:00.799 --> 30:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So Dr. Slutkin treats
gun violence
as a contagious disease.

30:06.071 --> 30:11.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He founded Cure Violence, now an
international
effort that trains former gang
members and

30:11.610 --> 30:16.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
felons to stop violence in its
tracks, violence
interrupters.

30:16.214 --> 30:18.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

30:18.083 --> 30:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY SLUTKIN: They are always in
the community,
aware of what's going on, and
asking families

30:22.754 --> 30:25.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and people, you know, who's
upset?

30:25.057 --> 30:30.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, who is -- somebody
slept with someone's
girlfriend, someone was
disrespected, someone

30:30.862 --> 30:32.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
owes somebody money.

30:32.197 --> 30:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we can reach those people
with these health
workers.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They may not look like health
workers to everybody.

30:37.703 --> 30:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They know how to cool people
down, know how
to buy time,

30:41.406 --> 30:47.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Chicago violence
interrupter Chico
Tillmon knows how to cool people
down.

30:47.112 --> 30:51.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He drove us around the South
Side last week,
where much of the violence
happens.

30:51.149 --> 30:55.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON, Violence
Interrupter: In early
January, two cliques were
arguing.

30:55.487 --> 31:00.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So one clique went into another
clique's neighborhood
and got on Facebook Live and was
like: F.

31:00.959 --> 31:01.993 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you all.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're in your all neighbor.

31:03.662 --> 31:05.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're in your all gas station.

31:05.897 --> 31:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within 30 minutes, on that walk
from the gas
station back to the house, two
were dead,

31:12.738 --> 31:13.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one was wounded.

31:13.905 --> 31:18.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's not like this is
a gang war
over turf.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is just sort of...

31:19.745 --> 31:21.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHICO TILLMON: Interpersonal.

31:21.680 --> 31:28.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said something you didn't
agree with, you
responded negatively, it ended
up in gun violence.

31:28.320 --> 31:33.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Violence interrupter
Ulysses "U.S."
Floyd was a leader in one of
Chicago's most

31:33.291 --> 31:36.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
notorious gangs, the Gangster
Disciples.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ULYSSES "U.S." FLOYD, Violence
Interrupter:
I know I helped start this mess,
so I wanted

31:39.397 --> 31:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to help clean it up.

31:40.999 --> 31:44.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He told us that gangs
are very
different now than they were in
his day.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ULYSSES "U.S." FLOYD: One or two
men control
everything.

31:46.638 --> 31:51.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now you have got a lot of
different little
gangs split all over.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are offsprings of the major
gangs, what
they call cliques.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they just do what they want
to do.

31:56.982 --> 31:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ain't nobody really in control,
no structure,
no rules.

31:59.851 --> 32:03.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: The number of
neighborhoods where
Chicago's branch of Cure
Violence operates

32:03.855 --> 32:05.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
varies based on funding.

32:06.024 --> 32:10.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a Justice Department study
found that,
at one point, the group helped
reduce violence

32:10.629 --> 32:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by 40 percent to 70 percent in
some of the
areas where they were operating.

32:15.801 --> 32:21.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, they are in only five of
the city's
77 neighborhoods.

32:21.273 --> 32:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On our drive through the South
Side, we saw
children walking home from
school.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think when you look
at kids that
age?

32:27.946 --> 32:34.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHICO TILLMON: I'm praying that
they survive
through this -- through this
epidemic that's

32:34.052 --> 32:36.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going on in the city.

32:36.555 --> 32:37.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a Woodlawn problem.

32:38.023 --> 32:39.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a South Shore problem.

32:40.025 --> 32:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's everybody's problem.

32:41.993 --> 32:47.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we don't understand that
until the disease
hits home, until one of our
loved ones is

32:47.566 --> 32:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
killed by gun violence.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then we want to get involved.

32:50.435 --> 32:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Police have seized
6,000 illegal
guns this year.

32:54.539 --> 33:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's one every hour, many from
nearby Indiana,
where laws aren't as tough.

33:00.545 --> 33:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chicago cops are feeling the
heat, a federal
probe of the use of deadly force
and public

33:06.318 --> 33:11.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trust at a breaking point after
last year's
release of a dash-cam video
showing a white

33:12.023 --> 33:17.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officer fatally shooting a black
teenager
16 times.

33:17.362 --> 33:22.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After another deadly weekend,
Superintendent
Eddie Johnson virtually threw up
his hands.

33:22.267 --> 33:24.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDDIE JOHNSON, Chicago Police
Superintendent:
It's not a police issue.

33:24.336 --> 33:27.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a society issue.

33:27.038 --> 33:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Impoverished neighborhoods,
people without
hope do these kinds of things.

33:30.809 --> 33:34.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You show me a man that doesn't
have hope,
I show you one that is willing
to pick up

33:34.346 --> 33:36.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a gun and do anything with it.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANCE WILLIAMS, Northeastern
Illinois University:
I really see this problem as a
cultural problem.

33:38.917 --> 33:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lance Williams is an
associate
professor of urban affairs at
Northeastern

33:43.588 --> 33:46.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Illinois University and an
inner-city youth
advocate.

33:46.591 --> 33:48.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LANCE WILLIAMS: This is not a
law enforcement
problem.

33:48.493 --> 33:50.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you can hire all of the
police that
you want.

33:51.029 --> 33:57.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're not going to solve this
problem, because
these young men are acting in
alignment with

33:57.369 --> 33:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their cultural value system.

33:59.604 --> 34:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They need a cultural retooling
process.

34:02.374 --> 34:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Williams says it's a
culture that's
developed in the absence of
working institutions

34:06.978 --> 34:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and in the midst of crushing
poverty.

34:09.881 --> 34:13.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One big cause of much
frustration?

34:13.285 --> 34:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly half of black men in
Chicago aged 20
to 24 are not in school and out
of work, far

34:20.258 --> 34:22.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
higher than the national rate of
32 percent.

34:22.961 --> 34:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LANCE WILLIAMS: There's a lot of
rage.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's a lot of anger.

34:27.666 --> 34:30.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just see their lives, you
know, just
passing them by.

34:30.435 --> 34:32.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't -- they haven't been
to school.

34:32.037 --> 34:33.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not qualified for jobs.

34:33.772 --> 34:37.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are no viable businesses
in their neighborhood,
so they're really depressed.

34:37.809 --> 34:41.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they're self-medicating
through drinking
and drugging.

34:41.813 --> 34:48.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the only individuals around
them are other
young African-American males
like themselves

34:48.586 --> 34:50.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who have these -- these same
forms of depression.

34:50.889 --> 34:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Another structural
factor playing
into the violence, Chicago is
one of the nation's

34:56.461 --> 34:58.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most segregated cities.

34:58.330 --> 35:05.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANCE WILLIAMS: All of the poor
blacks live
way, way, way, way away from
affluent people,

35:05.704 --> 35:09.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the business district, from
the tourist
district.

35:09.074 --> 35:12.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, you have some kids in
these neighborhoods
far south that have never been
downtown.

35:12.477 --> 35:14.145 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

35:14.179 --> 35:17.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have folks in the white
communities
who have never been to the South
Side.

35:17.983 --> 35:21.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what happens is, you have an
out-of-sight,
out-of-minute kind of deal.

35:21.252 --> 35:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHICO TILLMON: I was 23 when I
went to prison.

35:23.722 --> 35:30.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For Chico Tillmon,
who spent 16
years and three months in
federal prison,

35:30.395 --> 35:36.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violence is never out of sight
or mind, turning
other people's lives around
after turning

35:36.668 --> 35:38.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his own around.

35:38.470 --> 35:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHICO TILLMON: Being able to see
all the violence
and chaos in the community that
I once was

35:43.475 --> 35:50.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a part of, and that I once
helped produce,
pushed me or gave me an
obligation to make

35:50.115 --> 35:51.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a change.

35:51.116 --> 35:52.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Since you got out of
prison...

35:52.584 --> 35:53.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes.

35:53.618 --> 35:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: ... you got your
bachelor's degree.

35:54.652 --> 35:55.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes, sir.

35:55.653 --> 35:56.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You got your master's
degree.

35:56.855 --> 35:57.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes, sir.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: You're working on
your Ph.D.

35:59.057 --> 36:00.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes, sir.

36:00.425 --> 36:01.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How long, how many
years are we
talking about here?

36:01.159 --> 36:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHICO TILLMON: Five years.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Pretty determined.

36:04.429 --> 36:05.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Pretty motivated.

36:06.464 --> 36:08.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes, sir.

36:08.333 --> 36:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I got out with a purpose, and I
got out trying
to not only do something that
was beyond what

36:15.373 --> 36:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believed I could do, but to
inspire hope
within all the people that I
left behind in

36:19.577 --> 36:21.212 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
prison.

36:21.246 --> 36:25.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Back on the corner of
75th and
Stewart, Tamar Manasseh is also
determined

36:25.817 --> 36:27.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that change will happen.

36:27.752 --> 36:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMAR MANASSEH: It's going to
take a lot of
people all doing something, not
saying something,

36:32.791 --> 36:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but doing something to fix that
problem.

36:35.460 --> 36:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the doing something is the
sitting here.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the sitting here, having a
conversation.

36:39.764 --> 36:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I live on this block with you.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I live in this city with you.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I live in this country with you.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're all affected by the
same things.

36:45.537 --> 36:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, sometimes, when we don't
talk to each
other, when we don't interact,
we miss that.

36:49.474 --> 36:55.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On one corner, a
small effort in
response to a big problem.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Chicago.

36:58.583 --> 37:03.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And online, you
can take a
closer look at Chicago's history
of violence.

37:04.022 --> 37:11.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We go back 50 years to count all
of the city's
homicide victims.

37:11.996 --> 37:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

37:23.575 --> 37:32.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: how the U.S. government is
trying to
stem the tide of terrorism
messages online,

37:32.617 --> 37:35.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the role played by social
media.

37:35.320 --> 37:40.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The story is part of our
coverage of the 15th
anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

37:40.125 --> 37:47.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was produced in partnership
with tonight's
PBS "NOVA" special, "15 Years of
Terror,"

37:47.098 --> 37:52.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reported by Miles O'Brien, and
it's our weekly
segment about the Leading Edge
of technology.

37:52.904 --> 37:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They called it
Think Again,
Turn Away.

37:58.176 --> 38:00.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The concept?

38:00.311 --> 38:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Use sarcasm as way to turn
Islamic State images
into an argument against their
grim techniques

38:06.851 --> 38:08.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of terror.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The creator and producer?

38:10.555 --> 38:13.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The U.S. State Department.

38:13.858 --> 38:18.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, everyone agrees the
message was worse
than ineffective.

38:18.329 --> 38:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It played right into the hands
of the terrorists.

38:20.765 --> 38:24.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD STENGEL, U.S.
Undersecretary of State:
You know, part if it is that I
don't think

38:24.302 --> 38:27.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the government should do snark
or sarcasm.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think we're good at it.

38:29.641 --> 38:35.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Richard Stengel
is the undersecretary
of state for public diplomacy
and public affairs.

38:35.113 --> 38:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He realized he was the one who
needed to think
again.

38:38.416 --> 38:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD STENGEL: So, one of the
things that
we realized is that we're not
the best messenger

38:42.887 --> 38:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the message that we want to
get out there.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, when we are a messenger
at all, they
use that against us.

38:48.259 --> 38:53.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So they stopped
trying to do
it themselves, and hired some
marketing pros.

38:53.097 --> 38:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY SGRO, Advertising and
Marketing Veteran:
I think that they just -- it was
out of their

38:56.234 --> 38:57.969 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
league.

38:58.002 --> 39:01.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Tony Sgro is an
advertising
and marketing veteran who is
spearheading

39:01.239 --> 39:06.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a novel competition for college
students to
create a counter or alternative
narrative

39:06.911 --> 39:09.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the Islamic State propaganda
campaign.

39:09.047 --> 39:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY SGRO: The government is not
the most
capable person to develop a
counternarrative

39:13.184 --> 39:14.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for a 21-year- old.

39:14.419 --> 39:15.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no credibility factor
there.

39:15.887 --> 39:19.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The competition
is called Peer
to Peer.

39:19.724 --> 39:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Undergraduates at two dozen
schools all over
the world have participated.

39:23.595 --> 39:30.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Afghanistan, they created a
campaign that
included a talk show that
focused on understanding

39:30.435 --> 39:34.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the real message of the Koran
against extremism.

39:34.239 --> 39:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They reached more than five
million people.

39:38.042 --> 39:46.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lahore University produced a
plea from students
to students to turn apathy into
empathy.

39:46.084 --> 39:54.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The winner of the competition
was the Rochester
Institute of Technology.

39:54.058 --> 39:57.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Students there came up with this
multiplatform
campaign.

39:57.862 --> 40:00.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Join the campaign.

40:00.698 --> 40:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Because it's time.

40:01.699 --> 40:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: To ex-app.

40:02.834 --> 40:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TONY SGRO: It's beyond bombs,
bullets, and
drones.

40:05.803 --> 40:06.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It really is.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, we need that stuff.

40:08.172 --> 40:10.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we really -- how are you
going to win
the hearts and minds?

40:10.908 --> 40:11.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's communications.

40:11.909 --> 40:13.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a marketing communications
issue.

40:13.578 --> 40:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Countering the
messages is
one thing.

40:16.347 --> 40:19.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trying to stop them from
spreading in the
first place is another.

40:19.417 --> 40:24.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For years, the social networking
platforms
took a laissez-faire approach to
this problem.

40:24.289 --> 40:26.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it only got worse.

40:26.691 --> 40:29.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But in 2013, things started to
change.

40:30.028 --> 40:34.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During a horrifying assault on a
shopping
mall in Nairobi, Kenya,
attackers with the

40:34.632 --> 40:42.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
al-Qaida affiliate Al-Shabaab
live-tweeted
for hours as they shot more than
175 people,

40:42.173 --> 40:43.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
killing 67.

40:43.908 --> 40:51.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF WEYERS, Intelligence
Analyst: That was
the first time where Twitter was
actively

40:51.049 --> 40:52.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
removing the content that they
were posting.

40:52.917 --> 40:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jeff Weyers is a
police officer
and terrorism analyst based in
Ontario, Canada.

40:57.722 --> 41:02.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF WEYERS: They were actively
tweeting their
attack online, and it was the
first time we

41:02.293 --> 41:03.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
really saw that.

41:03.995 --> 41:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIS completely blew that out of
the water.

41:06.331 --> 41:07.465 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

41:07.498 --> 41:10.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They took that concept and
magnified it by
a million.

41:10.335 --> 41:15.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Today, Twitter
claims it aggressively
goes after accounts linked to
terrorists.

41:15.807 --> 41:19.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company says it closed
360,000 of them
in the past year.

41:19.911 --> 41:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF WEYERS: They were very much
pushed into
it, as opposed to wanting to go
down that

41:23.247 --> 41:25.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
road.

41:25.083 --> 41:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now I have no doubt that
they're spending
millions of dollars just
countering that message.

41:30.388 --> 41:36.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Facebook is the
largest social
networking platform on the
planet.

41:36.828 --> 41:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says it has a zero tolerance
policy for
extremists, but it must contend
with a tsunami

41:42.734 --> 41:44.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of content.

41:44.302 --> 41:48.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Facebook has more than a billion
users actively
posting every day.

41:48.840 --> 41:53.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company says about one-half
of 1 percent
of flagged items are linked to
terrorism.

41:53.644 --> 41:56.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that is still a lot of
material.

41:56.581 --> 41:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monika Bickert is Facebook's
head of global
policy management.

41:59.550 --> 42:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONIKA BICKERT, Head of Global
Policy Management,
Facebook: We use photo-matching
technology

42:03.254 --> 42:08.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to identify when somebody is
trying to upload
to Facebook an image that we
have already

42:08.493 --> 42:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
removed for violation our
policies.

42:11.162 --> 42:16.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, the image may or may
not violate
our policies when it's uploaded
again, because

42:16.534 --> 42:20.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it could be somebody who is
sharing a terrorist
image the Times Square part of a
news story

42:20.438 --> 42:22.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or to condemn violence.

42:22.306 --> 42:27.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we use automation to flag
content that
we will then have our teams
review.

42:27.245 --> 42:32.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But are there
more advanced
ways to stop the extremist
messages from spreading?

42:32.517 --> 42:34.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is there a better technological
solution?

42:34.318 --> 42:39.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANY FARID, Dartmouth College:
We have the
technology to disrupt, not
eliminate, but

42:39.590 --> 42:44.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to disrupt the global
transmission of
extremism-related
content.

42:44.796 --> 42:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Hany Farid is a
computer scientist
at Dartmouth College.

42:49.100 --> 42:55.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has developed a technique to
permanently
attach unique digital signatures
to images,

42:55.072 --> 42:59.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making it possible for the
social networking
companies to identify and stop
the spread

42:59.811 --> 43:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of videos made by, of and for
terror.

43:03.448 --> 43:08.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANY FARID: So, here is the
actual raw frame
that you're seeing processing
one frame at

43:08.619 --> 43:09.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a time.

43:09.987 --> 43:13.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the frame, we actually
analyze multiple
blocks within it.

43:13.925 --> 43:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The yellow crosshairs that
you're seeing are
enumerating the various blocks
of the video

43:18.529 --> 43:20.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we're analyzing.

43:20.865 --> 43:24.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This yellow histogram is a
distribution of
the measurements that we're
making from each

43:24.936 --> 43:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individual block, and then that
gets translated
into an actual digital
signature, which I

43:30.508 --> 43:32.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
visualize here with a stemplot.

43:32.610 --> 43:38.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The sheer volume
of the problem
is daunting, billions of uploads
a day, each

43:38.282 --> 43:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of them with millions of pixels.

43:40.751 --> 43:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can a computer possibly be
trained to sort
through it all and find the
images that inspire

43:46.123 --> 43:53.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
new recruits, incite new
violence and terrify
us all?

43:53.731 --> 43:56.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Farid has already proven the
technology works.

43:56.767 --> 43:58.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He got the idea 10 years ago.

43:59.003 --> 44:02.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Internet had become a
platform for child
pornographers.

44:02.907 --> 44:08.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Applying digital signatures to
those images
has greatly reduced child
pornography on the

44:08.513 --> 44:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
big social networking sites.

44:10.581 --> 44:15.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANY FARID: So, if there's just
one image
in an upload of yours that has
child pornography,

44:16.020 --> 44:18.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we -- the account can be frozen.

44:18.089 --> 44:21.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The contents of that account can
be assessed,
and new content can be
discovered.

44:21.659 --> 44:26.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But extremist
content is much
harder to clearly define.

44:26.464 --> 44:31.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The director of the Free
Expression Project
at the Center for Democracy and
Technology

44:31.369 --> 44:33.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is Emma Llanso.

EMMA LLANSO, Free Expression
Project: The
challenge with having a
hard-and-fast rule

44:34.972 --> 44:41.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against any a kind of content is
that it really
does shut down the opportunity
for discussion

44:41.145 --> 44:42.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
around that sort of material.

44:42.914 --> 44:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In June 2016,
David Thomson,
a French journalist who reports
on Islamic

44:49.086 --> 44:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
extremism, found his Facebook
page suspended
for three days.

44:53.891 --> 44:55.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The offense?

44:55.793 --> 45:01.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A photo he had posted in 2013 as
part of the
story he was doing included a
partial depiction

45:01.299 --> 45:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Islamic State flag, a
cautionary tale
of the unintended consequences
of targeting

45:07.071 --> 45:08.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terrorism online.

45:08.839 --> 45:13.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA LLANSO: It seems appealing
to say, oh,
just have the major social media
companies

45:13.945 --> 45:17.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take a hard-line approach to
anything having
to do with ISIS.

45:17.181 --> 45:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the fact is, that will end
up blocking
a lot of speech.

45:20.952 --> 45:23.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will end up deactivating
the accounts
of many users.

45:23.854 --> 45:28.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, some of the platforms
have had issues
with just deactivating the
accounts that women

45:28.125 --> 45:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whose first name is Isis.

45:30.828 --> 45:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a difficult kind of
censorship to
enact.

45:34.999 --> 45:40.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's no longer
just a war of
bullets, drones and bombs.

45:40.071 --> 45:47.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Technology has created a new
battlefield online,
and civil society is still
grasping for strategies

45:47.311 --> 45:50.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to engage in a virtual battle.

45:59.423 --> 46:12.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on most PBS stations.

46:12.103 --> 46:18.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we return to Laos, a country
of rich and
deep history scarred by American
bombing during

46:18.442 --> 46:20.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Vietnam War.

46:20.277 --> 46:25.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Mike Cerre
reports now
from the capital, Vientiane, on
how one American

46:25.650 --> 46:31.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman helped heal frayed ties
between the
U.S. and Laos by preserving
tradition there

46:31.989 --> 46:34.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one thread at a time.

CAROL CASSIDY, Lao Textiles:
They actually
arrived in Laos, found us and
found something

46:52.143 --> 46:55.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we had in the colors that
were appropriate,
red, white and blue.

weaver from
Connecticut and her
Ethiopian-American husband

47:00.685 --> 47:06.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helped save an endangered

47:06.590 --> 47:13.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
waged here during the Vietnam
War, is the
stuff of Southeast Asia lore.

47:13.964 --> 47:18.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like Jim Thompson, the legendary
former CIA
agent who launched the Thai silk
industry

47:18.969 --> 47:24.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after World War II, before he
mysteriously
disappeared, Carol Cassidy
helped resurrect

47:24.275 --> 47:27.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the traditional Lao textile
trade after their
war.

47:27.545 --> 47:34.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL CASSIDY: He had a great
idea, which
was to build a business based on
traditional

47:34.285 --> 47:35.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
skills.

47:35.820 --> 47:38.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something that, here in
Laos, at Lao
Textiles, we have done as well.

47:38.856 --> 47:42.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One of the important
distinctions is, I am
a weaver.

47:42.526 --> 47:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have devoted my entire life
since the age
of 17 to weaving one and
designing.

47:47.965 --> 47:52.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: When she and her
husband came
here nearly 30 years ago as U.N.
development

47:52.903 --> 47:59.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advisers, full diplomatic
relations between
the U.S. and Laos had yet to be
restored.

47:59.944 --> 48:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans were still viewed
somewhat suspiciously
by the communist Lao government,
the U.S.

48:05.082 --> 48:09.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
having been on the losing side
of the Laos
civil war and communist
takeover.

48:09.420 --> 48:16.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL CASSIDY: So it was really
this rebuilding
of Lao-American relations, that
we have felt

48:16.093 --> 48:17.895 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

48:17.928 --> 48:21.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my husband and I, who we
built the business
together, he is much more
diplomatic than

48:22.032 --> 48:23.601 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I am.

48:23.634 --> 48:26.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's been very
helpful navigating
the complexities.

48:27.004 --> 48:31.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: They eventually set
up a textile
business of their own with a
core staff of

48:31.442 --> 48:37.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weavers from the north, many of
them the wives
and mothers of the Pathet Lao
communist forces

48:37.615 --> 48:42.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who had been living and working
out of caves
during the nearly 10 years of
U.S. bombing.

48:42.253 --> 48:45.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CAROL CASSIDY: So, our
technology is very
simple.

48:45.956 --> 48:47.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's portable.

48:47.691 --> 48:53.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they fled the bombing, they
were able
to take with them simple
technology and be

48:53.864 --> 48:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
able to keep their family
traditions.

48:55.766 --> 49:01.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: The work is
incredibly painstaking,
from the hand-dyeing of the
silk, to spinning

49:01.238 --> 49:08.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the silk yarn, and reproducing
traditional
designs from memory, using
traditional Lao

49:08.312 --> 49:13.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looms many consider to be the
inspiration
for the first computers and
binary code.

49:13.984 --> 49:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL CASSIDY: The important
part is this
vertical heddle, because that
the storage

49:18.889 --> 49:21.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system, and that is the floppy
drive.

49:21.258 --> 49:27.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the program, and the
strings below,
every string down there
represents one row

49:27.431 --> 49:29.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of program.

49:29.300 --> 49:33.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Carol produces
world-renowned
textiles for top interior
designers and architects

49:33.237 --> 49:35.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around the globe.

49:35.039 --> 49:41.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL CASSIDY: This is part of
the dying art,
which is the creation of complex
patterns.

49:41.212 --> 49:46.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is the skill Boua (ph)
and Chan (ph)
both learned from their
grandmother and their

49:46.150 --> 49:47.985 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mother.

49:48.018 --> 49:50.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Her real passions
and commitment
has been using her weaving
expertise to help

49:50.788 --> 49:55.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
empower local women, which she
first started
doing as a U.N. adviser in
Africa.

49:55.860 --> 50:00.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAROL CASSIDY: Most of the
artisans are indigenous
people, rural people.

50:00.531 --> 50:05.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are not the most visible
and they don't
have a voice, and that's really
what I have

50:05.035 --> 50:07.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been trying to do working with
these communities.

50:07.371 --> 50:11.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Carol Cassidy may
have started
her career as a globe-trotting
weaver, but

50:11.508 --> 50:15.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the years since she's been
here in Laos,
she has become more of a
cultural ambassador,

50:15.679 --> 50:21.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an evangelist for the role that
traditional
arts and crafts can play in the
economic development

50:21.118 --> 50:22.953 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

50:22.987 --> 50:25.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL CASSIDY: I feel that an
important part
of who you are is through your
heritage, and

50:25.923 --> 50:27.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's through your past.

50:27.725 --> 50:32.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Laos and in Southeast Asia in
general,
textiles are among the most
important parts

50:32.963 --> 50:34.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of their past.

50:34.565 --> 50:39.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, your uniqueness is expressed
what you
wear, how you wear it, what you
weave.

50:39.837 --> 50:45.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The director of the IMF,
Christine Lagarde,
was here earlier this year,
which was a very

50:45.142 --> 50:52.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important visit, because we had
the opportunity
to show her that stability,
ethnic identity,

50:52.182 --> 50:58.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
employment, women empowerment,
culture is
all interwoven in what we're
doing here at

50:58.489 --> 51:00.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Lao Textiles.

51:00.391 --> 51:03.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Carol lives and
works out of a
French colonial home in the
center of Vientiane,

51:03.994 --> 51:06.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where she also raised two
children.

51:06.163 --> 51:11.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Her husband and business
partner, Dawit Seyoum,
takes cares of the operational
side of the

51:11.201 --> 51:13.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
business.

51:13.070 --> 51:17.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's run more like an extended
family co-op,
with many of the original
weavers and their

51:17.141 --> 51:19.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children still working with
them.

51:19.043 --> 51:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL CASSIDY: Because we have
been able to
retain our staff for more than
25 years, through

51:23.347 --> 51:29.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our pension plan, through our
health plan,
we have been able to then weave
these extraordinary

51:29.987 --> 51:31.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
projects.

51:31.722 --> 51:34.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: She has experienced
firsthand
the many changes Laos has
undergone since

51:34.391 --> 51:40.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming here in 1989, when the
only way to
cross the Mekong River into
Thailand was by

51:40.130 --> 51:41.899 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
boat.

51:41.932 --> 51:46.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vientiane, the capital, had no
traffic lights
or buildings taller than a palm
tree, and

51:46.570 --> 51:48.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyone in her neighborhood
knew each other.

51:48.405 --> 51:54.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL CASSIDY: And you go away
for a month,
and this was all old buildings
that came down,

51:54.111 --> 51:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I guess it's going to be a
hotel.

51:56.981 --> 52:02.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: As successful as her
business
has become, both as an
enterprise and a model

52:02.353 --> 52:07.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for maintaining traditional
textiles, her
biggest concerns are with the
latest assaults

52:07.558 --> 52:12.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on traditional weaving from the
modern reality
of mass production of textiles
throughout

52:12.629 --> 52:13.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the region.

52:13.764 --> 52:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAROL CASSIDY: Oh, no, this
wasn't made in
Laos.

52:15.332 --> 52:17.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't have the industrial
capacity.

52:17.234 --> 52:23.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The extraordinary part of Laos
is that we
still handcraft high-quality,
excellent textiles.

52:23.340 --> 52:27.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE CERRE: Having embraced the
Lao culture
as completely as she has over
the years, she

52:28.012 --> 52:33.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has faith that traditional
weaving will somehow
withstand yet another challenge
to its legacy.

52:33.717 --> 52:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL CASSIDY: Where your spirit
goes in life,
in marriage, and death are all
interwoven

52:40.791 --> 52:42.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into the story of the textiles.

52:42.726 --> 52:51.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MIKE CERRE: For the "PBS
NewsHour," Mike Cerre
in Vientiane, Laos.

52:51.235 --> 52:58.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:58.909 --> 53:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow, our Making Sense
series catches
a wave and looks at how trade
with China affects

53:04.381 --> 53:07.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the economic and political
landscape here
at home.

53:07.651 --> 53:08.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:08.819 --> 53:11.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

53:11.355 --> 53:21.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS

you, and good night.

53:21.398 --> 53:31.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
