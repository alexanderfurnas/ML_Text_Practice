JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, another
look at the major news of this
week, both foreign and domestic,

00:04.766 --> 00:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from today's pivotal meeting
between two presidents,
to new developments
with the Senate GOP's

00:10.500 --> 00:12.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care plan.

00:12.133 --> 00:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Here to provide analysis
of all that and more
is Brooks and Marcus.

00:15.200 --> 00:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's New York Times columnist
David Brooks and Ruth Marcus,
deputy editorial page editor

00:20.033 --> 00:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for The Washington Post.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mark Shields is away this week.

00:23.366 --> 00:25.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you on both.

00:25.433 --> 00:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the lead story today,
of course, President Trump
meets President Putin.

00:29.866 --> 00:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David, all eyes on this
meeting, the body language,
what did they say.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then we have these
conflicting reports
coming out afterwards.

00:36.833 --> 00:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do we make of it?

00:38.833 --> 00:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it
was sort of normal for a
Trump administration event.

00:42.333 --> 00:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He did raise the meddling
issue, which is a good thing.

00:45.966 --> 00:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it seemed a little
like, from the talking
points, they hit Syria,
they hit all the prints

00:49.966 --> 00:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a U.S. president would talk
to with a Russian president.

00:52.233 --> 00:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It seemed a bit like a normal
meeting, which is a good thing.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The abnormal part to me is how
small it was, that there are
only four people and then the

01:00.600 --> 01:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two translators in the room,
no H.R. McMaster, no national
security adviser, which is an

01:04.600 --> 01:06.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
oddity.

01:06.666 --> 01:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that gives them maximum
flexibility to say whatever
they want in the room and not

01:09.366 --> 01:11.400 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
have it reported
out of the room.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what makes the point
about what they were saying
about the meddling or anything

01:14.900 --> 01:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
else totally mysterious.

01:16.500 --> 01:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Apparently, there were no
note-takers in the room.

01:19.300 --> 01:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it leaves a big
void in what they actually
said and whether Trump
really accepted the

01:25.433 --> 01:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fact that Putin claims
he didn't meddle.

01:27.666 --> 01:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's just a big void
that wouldn't exist if you
had the normal complement of

01:32.066 --> 01:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people in the room and the
normal note-takers in the room,
and you had some actual look

01:36.900 --> 01:39.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into what sort of what
was happening in there.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A long meeting,
Ruth, but a lot of questions.

01:41.166 --> 01:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Long meeting,
a lot of questions.

01:43.366 --> 01:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And normal is not the
way I would describe it.

01:46.600 --> 01:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think I should start by
the way President Trump started
with Vladimir Putin, which is,

01:52.800 --> 01:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's an honor to be
here with both of you.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is a true honor.

01:56.366 --> 02:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought for President Trump
to say -- and I understand we
have diplomatic niceties -- it

02:00.200 --> 02:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wasn't an honor to be with
someone who has attacked and
jailed dissidents and killed

02:07.166 --> 02:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dissidents in his country, who
has invaded other countries,
and who has tried to interfere

02:12.100 --> 02:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in an American election.

02:14.066 --> 02:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that simply to
accept that, oh, it's great,
at least he raised the question

02:20.766 --> 02:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Russian interference, but
we don't know - - and never
will probably -- precisely what

02:23.366 --> 02:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he said, is really defining
the presidency down.

02:28.166 --> 02:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That should have been a given
that he was going to raise that.

02:32.233 --> 02:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that it wasn't a given,
they left but on tenterhooks,
and that the day before, he

02:37.133 --> 02:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was still saying, well, nobody
really knows for sure what
happened, and seemed more eager

02:44.200 --> 02:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to blame President Obama
for not doing enough,
to question whether the
intelligence community

02:48.100 --> 02:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gets it right, to tweet
today about John Podesta,
Hillary Clinton's campaign
chairman, and say,

02:55.466 --> 02:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why didn't he turn over
the server, just really
underscores to me the
abnormality of the situation.

03:01.133 --> 03:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I have
successfully defined
deviancy so far down...

03:03.866 --> 03:04.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:04.866 --> 03:06.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

03:06.366 --> 03:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, that's the
point of normalizing, right?

03:08.366 --> 03:09.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

03:09.366 --> 03:11.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, that's fair.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But,
David, was using the
term honor going too far?

03:13.866 --> 03:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think no
normal person would say that.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:17.966 --> 03:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But, on the
other hand, I'm willing to give
diplomatic latitude to that.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a lot of people in a
lot of diplomatic circumstances.

03:23.933 --> 03:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure, if we went
back and looked at how other
presidents speak, you're trying

03:27.733 --> 03:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to establish a relationship
with a bad guy.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now, and you say things.

03:32.633 --> 03:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so I give
latitude toward that.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is whether
Donald Trump recognizes that
Vladimir Putin is a bad guy.

03:37.866 --> 03:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the larger question
here than whether he
used the word honor.

03:40.966 --> 03:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I guess there's no
indication that he regards
Putin as in any way a bad guy.

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does it matter,
Ruth, whether the president
accepted Putin's denials?

03:50.933 --> 03:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or are we just -- we're
going to be left wondering
about this forever.

03:54.866 --> 03:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, Secretary
of State Tillerson said that
they basically agreed it didn't

04:01.466 --> 04:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
make sense to relitigate
this, actually one
of my favorite words.

04:06.166 --> 04:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And maybe that's true.

04:08.333 --> 04:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The important point is that,
since before the election,
Donald Trump has been denying

04:15.166 --> 04:17.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that this happened.

04:17.700 --> 04:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has seemed entirely
unconcerned with figuring
out whether it happened
and with expressing

04:23.400 --> 04:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the outrage that any
American president should be
expressing that it did happen.

04:30.066 --> 04:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now I think we're supposed
to be satisfied that there is
this joint working group on

04:34.066 --> 04:35.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cyber-security.

04:35.033 --> 04:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I have a modest proposal.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

04:38.233 --> 04:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: If we're going to
have a joint working group on
cyber-security, let's combine

04:40.366 --> 04:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that with the election fraud
commission, and we can really
get to the bottom of everything.

04:44.366 --> 04:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Say we
had a normal president.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's actually an interesting
political problem.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you do with Russia?

04:50.700 --> 04:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you say, you interfered
with our elections,
you're interfering with
all these elections

04:53.666 --> 04:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across Europe, we're not dealing
with you until you behave by
some standards of normalcy?

04:57.933 --> 05:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a morally
satisfying position that, as
a columnist, would be fun.

05:01.333 --> 05:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are actually a
lot of issues you have got
to deal with Russia on.

05:04.033 --> 05:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so this is perpetually the
problem with rogue regimes.

05:06.066 --> 05:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got to -- you
deal with them and then
you don't deal with them.

05:09.433 --> 05:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even if we had a
normal administration,
it would be tough to know
how to treat Vladimir

05:12.633 --> 05:14.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

05:14.366 --> 05:18.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: And this is
my time to now say that
David has a fair point.

05:18.566 --> 05:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, sure, whenever you're
dealing with somebody who is
an adversary -- and Russia

05:22.333 --> 05:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is an adversary -- you are
going to have to calibrate,
because there are things that we

05:26.233 --> 05:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need their help on.

05:27.233 --> 05:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need their help on Syria.

05:28.466 --> 05:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need their help
on North Korea.

05:30.466 --> 05:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you don't want to let one
little attack on your democracy
and your election system

05:34.966 --> 05:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blow everything up.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:38.433 --> 05:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: But you do need to
assert yourself in a way that
we haven't seen him do publicly

05:41.700 --> 05:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that we're going to
still have questions about
whether he did privately.

05:44.500 --> 05:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of our democracy, yesterday,
in Poland, David, the president

05:48.733 --> 05:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
made a speech to
the Polish people.

05:50.733 --> 05:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he talked about Western
civilization and how it's under
siege, and how it's going to

05:58.100 --> 06:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
matter right now whether
we have the will to survive
the siege that we are under.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does this ring true?

06:08.000 --> 06:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Does it feel like
Western civilization is
under siege right now?

06:10.866 --> 06:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I think --
I 80 percent liked the speech.

06:14.066 --> 06:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was this famous clash
of civilization thesis from
Samuel Huntington, a political

06:18.466 --> 06:20.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
theorist.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the idea was that Western
civilization is at war with
Islam and maybe some of the

06:22.800 --> 06:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other civilizations
around the world.

06:24.566 --> 06:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I don't agree with that.

06:26.100 --> 06:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I do think there is such a
thing as Western civilization.

06:27.833 --> 06:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it starts with
the Greeks and the Romans.

06:30.466 --> 06:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then it goes through the
Enlightenment -- or the
Reformation, the Enlightenment.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It goes through
the scientific age.

06:35.933 --> 06:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it somewhat defines some
of the cultures and mores of
Europe and North America and

06:41.666 --> 06:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some other countries.

06:44.133 --> 06:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's obviously absorbed
a lot of immigrants and
it's absorbed a lot of
ideas and had exchange

06:46.533 --> 06:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with Asia and other
civilizations.

06:48.866 --> 06:51.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's a thing.

06:51.366 --> 06:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I like the fact that
he appealed to that,
especially when he's
trying to, I hope, reunify

06:57.566 --> 07:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Western alliance, which
has been a powerful force for
good in the world over the last

07:01.766 --> 07:04.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
70 years.

07:04.233 --> 07:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, to his credit, he
appealed to some of the
things that are finest
about Western civilization,

07:07.766 --> 07:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
artistic creativity, rights of
minorities, equality for woman.

07:11.766 --> 07:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He ran down the list.

07:13.833 --> 07:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether the guy actually lives
by those standards is another
matter, but at least he appealed

07:17.133 --> 07:19.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

07:19.133 --> 07:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's a big mistake
any time anybody makes an appeal
to the West or to America,

07:24.266 --> 07:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to patriotism to think,
oh, he's excluding.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's an identity formation.

07:28.766 --> 07:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we need our
identity formations.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think he did
it, in the speech at
least, reasonably well.

07:33.333 --> 07:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
do you read that?

07:34.533 --> 07:37.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: Well,
I'm not at 80 percent.

07:37.100 --> 07:38.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Surprise.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there are things to
like about the speech.

07:40.366 --> 07:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One thing to like about the
speech is that, unlike the
last time he was in Europe, he

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was -- and cut the words out
of the speech, we learned
later, he was able to at least

07:50.933 --> 07:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
read from the teleprompter
that he supports Article 5, the
fundamental provision of NATO

07:55.566 --> 07:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for common self-defense.

07:57.633 --> 08:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, last time,
when he was in Saudi Arabia,
he was able to not say the

08:01.933 --> 08:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
words radical Islamic terrorism.

08:03.900 --> 08:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I will give you Article
5, but I need my radical
Islamic terrorism.

08:08.766 --> 08:13.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it was very nice
to hear the summoning
of the importance of
a free press and all

08:15.700 --> 08:17.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those things.

08:17.766 --> 08:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A little hard to take from
somebody who had just tweeted
out that CNN beat-up wrestling

08:22.600 --> 08:24.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
video.

08:24.700 --> 08:28.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so that brings me to
my fundamental concern,
which is, which are we
paying attention to,

08:28.700 --> 08:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teleprompter Trump or
off-the-cuff tweeter Trump?

08:32.333 --> 08:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Both matter, right, his
willingness to say things.

08:35.600 --> 08:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was a little more put off
by the Western part of the
invocation of common values and

08:42.266 --> 08:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
democratic values that
we should all live by.

08:44.633 --> 08:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But teleprompter
Trump is one thing.

08:47.266 --> 08:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I think, when we see
the real Trump, it's a
lot more nervous-making,
to say the least.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do we know
which one is the real Trump?

08:53.900 --> 08:55.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No.

08:55.266 --> 08:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I take Ruth's point.

08:57.366 --> 09:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you remember Angela Merkel
had given this - - made this
comment about Europe has to go

09:02.566 --> 09:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it alone, because we
don't about this guy.

09:04.233 --> 09:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so this appeal to a
Western cohesion to me
was a valuable thing.

09:07.833 --> 09:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing is -- and
this is something Trump does
better than a lot of his critics

09:11.566 --> 09:14.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - he understands
sense of belonging.

09:14.733 --> 09:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of people think
globalization, any time you make
any particularity, you're sort

09:20.600 --> 09:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of offending some other group.

09:22.700 --> 09:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of people in this
country think they belong to
America anymore, and he at

09:25.700 --> 09:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
least appeals to some
sense of belonging.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like the idea that we belong
to Western traditions, so
I'm glad he appeals to that

09:31.833 --> 09:32.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sort of thing.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to -- we could talk
about this for a long time.

09:36.633 --> 09:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do want to bring us back
to something that we heard
Lisa Desjardins reporting on,

09:40.700 --> 09:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ruth, and that is the
health care, Republican
health care plan.

09:44.233 --> 09:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She -- by her reporting, it
sounds like that Republicans
are having a tougher time than

09:48.666 --> 09:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ever now getting the votes they
need to get something through.

09:51.966 --> 09:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, Senate
Majority Mitch McConnell
has been talking about
this as a Rubik's Cube.

09:56.733 --> 09:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But with the Rubik's Cube,
you know there's a solution.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

10:00.100 --> 10:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: With this
one, not so clear.

10:02.233 --> 10:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what I loved this week was
that McConnell, who is I think
absolutely dedicated to trying

10:08.600 --> 10:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to find the votes, and --
which wasn't totally clear.

10:11.733 --> 10:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe he just wanted to get
this put aside, so we can move
on to tax cuts, which they

10:16.066 --> 10:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really care about.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And no one discounts
his ability.

10:19.566 --> 10:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If anybody could do it, he can.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he brought out the
big guns this week,
threatening the ultimate
sanction, bipartisanship.

10:24.866 --> 10:26.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

10:26.933 --> 10:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: If you guys don't
go along, I'm going to have
to work with Democrats, and

10:30.533 --> 10:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then you will see how unhappy
you will be with the result.

10:32.600 --> 10:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

10:33.900 --> 10:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's the opposite
of a nuclear option?

10:34.833 --> 10:36.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

10:36.100 --> 10:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: It's
the talking option.

10:37.633 --> 10:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Like, we will
do something good, right?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will do something good.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Oh, my God,
we may have to work together.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does it look like?

10:42.833 --> 10:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I agree
with Ruth on this.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It looks dead.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just like -- not only have
you begun to see the burbling
concerns, and then out in

10:48.533 --> 10:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the few town halls
that have been out there,
you have seen those concerns.

10:52.233 --> 10:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're beginning to see all
these members come freelancing
off in different elections.

10:56.866 --> 10:58.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ted Cruz is freelancing
from that direction.

10:58.933 --> 11:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Lee is staking out a
position that will be completely
unacceptable to a lot of people.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then the moderates are
staking out their position.

11:05.033 --> 11:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, not only is it hard to
piece together this together.

11:08.033 --> 11:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're all going further apart.

11:10.033 --> 11:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so they're all
defending themselves.

11:12.100 --> 11:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's just -- the party
is not cohesive enough, so
I think there's no solution.

11:15.800 --> 11:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's super hard to take away a
benefit that is pretty deeply
embedded now, no matter what

11:21.600 --> 11:23.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your ideology is.

11:23.666 --> 11:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And to me -- and it's a genuine
question -- what do we do?

11:26.300 --> 11:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McConnell made the correct
point that you can't just do
nothing, because the markets,

11:32.400 --> 11:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the insurance markets
are struggling.

11:34.466 --> 11:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so something has to be
done, some normal repair
at least has to be done.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do we do that?

11:38.566 --> 11:39.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can we really imagine
a bipartisan solution?

11:39.600 --> 11:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Frankly, I cannot.

11:41.633 --> 11:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the
conservatives can't imagine it
would go along with shoring up

11:44.133 --> 11:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the current system.

11:46.166 --> 11:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUTH MARCUS: Well, it's going
to take a long time to get
to a bipartisan solution.

11:49.633 --> 11:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I want to kind of lay out
the possibility that there are
ways in which you could cobble

11:53.566 --> 11:55.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this together.

11:55.300 --> 11:59.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You say, OK, some of
these tax cuts for the
rich don't have to go.

11:59.900 --> 12:02.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's all sorts
of other things.

12:02.033 --> 12:04.533 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But that's going
to have to fail.

12:04.533 --> 12:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are people working,
Lamar Alexander, Susan Collins.

12:09.133 --> 12:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats are working with them
on this that - - and there are
ways to shore up the markets.

12:13.833 --> 12:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had a learning curve on
the Affordable Care Act, which
kind of suggests two things.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People like it, and it needs
some tinkering that are most
-- that's mostly around the

12:23.500 --> 12:25.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
edges.

12:25.633 --> 12:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we want
to leave this on a positive
note, so we're going to stop

12:26.966 --> 12:28.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right there.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And by next Friday,
we will know more.

12:29.366 --> 12:30.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ruth Marcus, David
Brooks, thank you both.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RUTH MARCUS: Thanks.

12:31.166 --> 12:31.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Thank you.
