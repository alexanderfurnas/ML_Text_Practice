JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.839 --> 00:06.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.742 --> 00:12.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: Our
counterintelligence
mission is investing the Russian
government's

00:12.813 --> 00:16.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
efforts to interfere in the 2016
presidential
election.

00:16.650 --> 00:23.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: FBI Director
James Comey confirms
a probe into Russian meddling,
including possible

00:23.090 --> 00:28.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
links between Moscow and the
Trump campaign,
while saying there's no evidence
for the president's

00:28.262 --> 00:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
charge he was wiretapped.

00:30.097 --> 00:36.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In our other lead story:
President Trump's
Supreme Court nominee, Judge
Neil Gorsuch,

00:36.103 --> 00:40.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
faces the Senate Judiciary
Committee on the
first day of confirmation
hearings.

00:40.040 --> 00:46.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH, Supreme Court
Nominee: Ninety-seven
percent of those 2,700 cases I
have decided

00:46.113 --> 00:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were decided unanimously, and
that I have
been in the majority 99 percent
of the time.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's my record and that's how
we do things
in the West.

00:56.089 --> 01:02.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And from the
items in a market
to celebrating work, how one art
exhibit is

01:02.062 --> 01:06.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defining the nature of home here
in the U.S.
for Latino Americans.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMIRO GOMEZ, Artist: So, I'm at
once Mexican
and American.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.204 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm in between.

01:11.238 --> 01:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That in-between space, that
in-between place
that I occupy is something that
is constantly

01:17.044 --> 01:18.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changing within myself.

01:18.312 --> 01:21.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:21.682 --> 01:24.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:24.851 --> 01:39.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: An unusually
newsy day in the
nation's capital, even by
Washington standards,

01:39.132 --> 01:45.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that make up our two leads: A
House committee
delves into a possible Russian
role in the

01:45.305 --> 01:50.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign that elected Donald
Trump, and a
Senate panel begins hearings on
the man chosen

01:50.677 --> 01:54.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by President Trump to serve on
the Supreme
Court.

01:54.047 --> 01:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We begin with the Russia file,
and Lisa Desjardins,
who has been watching it all.

01:59.453 --> 02:07.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In a rare open
hearing of
the House Intelligence
Committee, a rare admission

02:07.060 --> 02:08.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the FBI director.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY, FBI Director: I
have been authorized
by the Department of Justice to
confirm that

02:12.165 --> 02:18.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the FBI, as part of our
counterintelligence
mission, is investigating the
Russian government's

02:18.672 --> 02:23.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
efforts to interfere in the 2016
presidential
election.

02:23.443 --> 02:28.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that includes investigating
the nature
of any links between individuals
associated

02:28.882 --> 02:35.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Trump campaign and the
Russian government
and whether there was any
coordination between

02:35.322 --> 02:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the campaign and Russia's
efforts.

02:37.324 --> 02:42.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Beside Comey
sat National
Security Agency Chief Michael
Rogers.

02:42.562 --> 02:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both stood by the intelligence
community's
earlier report that Russian
President Vladimir

02:47.200 --> 02:50.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin clearly favored the
candidacy of Donald
Trump.

02:50.537 --> 02:56.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: Putin hated
Secretary Clinton
so much, that the flip side of
that coin was

02:56.376 --> 02:59.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had a clear preference for
the person running
against the person he hated so
much.

03:00.013 --> 03:04.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Committee
Democrats and Republicans
pursued sharply different lines
of questioning:

03:04.284 --> 03:06.086 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California: In
early July,
Carter Page, someone candidate
Trump identified

03:08.922 --> 03:13.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as one of his national security
advisers,
travels to Moscow on a trip
approved by the

03:13.927 --> 03:15.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump campaign.

03:15.729 --> 03:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Ranking
Democrat Adam Schiff
listed contacts between Trump
advisers and

03:19.666 --> 03:21.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russian officials and raised
concern.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Many of Trump
campaign personnel,
including the president himself,
have ties

03:26.940 --> 03:29.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to Russia and Russian interests.

03:29.576 --> 03:32.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is, of course, no crime.

03:32.412 --> 03:37.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, if the Trump
campaign or
anyone associated with it aided
or abetted

03:37.818 --> 03:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russians, it wouldn't only
be a serious
crime.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would also represent one of
the most shocking
betrayals of democracy in
history.

03:45.125 --> 03:49.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But committee
Chairman Devin
Nunes and other Republicans
pushed to show

03:49.663 --> 03:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Russians didn't directly
change vote
totals.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.701 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES (R), California:
Admiral Rogers,
do you have any evidence that
Russia cyber-actors

03:56.603 --> 03:58.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changed vote tallies?

03:58.338 --> 03:59.606 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE ROGERS, National Security
Agency Director:
No, I do not.

04:01.441 --> 04:05.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
soon after
tweeted that: "The NSA and FBI
tell Congress

04:05.579 --> 04:09.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Russia didn't influence
electoral process."

04:09.182 --> 04:14.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, back at the hearing,
Democrat Jim Himes
pounced, saying a lack of
manipulating votes

04:14.354 --> 04:17.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
directly is different than no
influence at
all.

04:17.324 --> 04:19.059 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM HIMES (D), Connecticut: So,
it's not too
far of a logical leap to
conclude that the

04:20.827 --> 04:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assertion that you have told the
Congress
that there was no influence on
the electoral

04:26.166 --> 04:27.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is not quite right?

04:27.267 --> 04:29.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: Right.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It certainly wasn't our
intention to say that
today, because we don't have any
information

04:32.072 --> 04:33.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on that subject.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not something that was
looked at.

04:35.642 --> 04:40.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: More than
anything, Republicans
raised alarm over leaks and
stories with reportedly

04:40.213 --> 04:43.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
classified information and names
in the investigation.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:44.985 --> 04:48.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREY GOWDY (R), South Carolina:
I thought
it was against the law to
disseminate classified

04:48.455 --> 04:49.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Is it?

04:50.757 --> 04:53.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES COMEY: Oh, yes.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sure, it's a serious crime.

04:56.396 --> 05:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: South Carolina
Congressman
Trey Gowdy went farther, warning
that unless

05:00.901 --> 05:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the leaks are stopped, a key
provision of
the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act,

05:05.272 --> 05:08.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or FISA, may not be reauthorized
by Congress
this year.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREY GOWDY: Trust me, you and I
both want
to see it reauthorized.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's in jeopardy if we don't get
this resolved.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The hearing hit
extraordinary
territory.

05:18.451 --> 05:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats pushed on President
Trump's charges
that President Obama wiretapped
him.

05:23.123 --> 05:27.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: With respect to the
presidents
tweets about alleged wiretapping
directed

05:27.260 --> 05:31.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
at him by the prior
administration, I have
no information that supports
those tweets.

05:31.798 --> 05:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republican
Chairman Nunes
agreed, but didn't rule out that
other measures

05:36.503 --> 05:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could have been involved.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES: It's still possible
that other
surveillance activities were
used against

05:41.541 --> 05:44.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Trump and his
associates.

05:44.144 --> 05:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President Trump
and his aides
have refused to back off the
surveillance

05:48.148 --> 05:49.482 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
charge.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say it's veracity is for
the investigation
to determine.

05:52.118 --> 05:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, today, White House
spokesman Sean
Spicer defended the president
and his campaign,

05:57.524 --> 06:02.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he also seemed to downplay
the campaign
role of two key players known
for their ties

06:02.996 --> 06:08.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Russia, former campaign
adviser Michael
Flynn and former campaign
manager Paul Manafort.

06:08.668 --> 06:12.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
Even General Flynn was a
volunteer of the

06:12.305 --> 06:14.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

06:14.107 --> 06:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, obviously, there's
been discussion
of Paul Manafort, who played a
very limited

06:17.811 --> 06:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
role for a very limited amount
of time.

06:19.913 --> 06:25.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At the hearing,
over it all
was Russia, a country the NSA
chief said changed

06:25.752 --> 06:26.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its tactics in 2016.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ADM.

06:29.022 --> 06:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE ROGERS: I would say the
biggest difference,
from my perspective, was both
the use of cyber,

06:33.560 --> 06:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the hacking as a vehicle to
physically gain
access, to information to
extract that information

06:40.967 --> 06:45.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then to make it widely
publicly available
without any alteration or
change.

06:45.338 --> 06:49.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: The only thing that
I would add
is that they were unusually loud
in their

06:49.309 --> 06:51.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intervention.

06:51.111 --> 06:54.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's almost as if they didn't
care that we
knew what they were doing or
that they wanted

06:54.347 --> 06:55.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
us to see what they were doing.

06:55.815 --> 06:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: FBI Director
Comey gave a
warning.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES COMEY: They will be back.

06:59.519 --> 07:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They will be back in 2020.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They may be back in 2018.

07:04.224 --> 07:08.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the lessons they may
draw from
this is that they were
successful, because

07:08.194 --> 07:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they introduced chaos and
division and discord.

07:10.830 --> 07:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Chairman Nunes
closed the
hearing with a stark verdict on
the five-hour

07:15.568 --> 07:16.536 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
session.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES: There is a big,
gray cloud that
you have now put over people who
have very

07:21.007 --> 07:23.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important work to do to lead
this country.

07:23.476 --> 07:29.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the faster you can get to
the bottom
of this, it's going to be better

LISA DESJARDINS: For "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins at the Capitol.

07:33.720 --> 07:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we turn now
to the ranking
member of the House Intelligence
Committee.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is Democratic Representative
Adam Schiff
of California.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congressman Schiff, welcome back
to the program.

07:44.230 --> 07:47.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the main thing that you
think was clarified
at today's hearing?

07:47.567 --> 07:48.568 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:48.601 --> 07:50.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think a
number of things.

07:50.570 --> 07:57.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, I think Director Comey
made the case
that he had opened an
investigation into potential

07:57.444 --> 08:02.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agency with a foreign power or
coordination
with a foreign power.

08:02.482 --> 08:07.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not done unless there is
specific and
credible information or evidence
that someone

08:07.253 --> 08:08.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is colluding.

08:08.922 --> 08:13.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I also think that it was
significant that
you had two directors directly
rebuff the

08:13.526 --> 08:19.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president's claims that he was
illegally wiretapped
or wiretapped at all by his
predecessor.

08:19.132 --> 08:24.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But more than that, I think the
main takeaway,
I hope, for the country from the
hearing is

08:24.237 --> 08:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a recognition of just what
serious business
this is, because, as Director
Comey says,

08:28.708 --> 08:30.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Russians will do this again.

08:30.810 --> 08:35.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we really need a thorough
investigation
to determine just what the
Russians did, how

08:35.115 --> 08:39.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did they do it, were there U.S.
persons involved,
and how do we protect ourselves
from their

08:39.886 --> 08:41.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
future efforts to interfere?

08:41.654 --> 08:46.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I hear you
say this,
Congressman Schiff, and yet
President Trump

08:46.860 --> 08:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tweeted today that Admiral
Rogers and the
FBI director, Jim Comey, told
Congress that

08:54.701 --> 08:59.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia didn't influence the
electoral process
in the United States last year.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that doesn't seem to square
with what
you just said.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, it didn't
square with what
the witnesses said at the
hearing either.

09:06.413 --> 09:10.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was pointed by my
colleague Jim Himes,
who followed up with both
directors and did

09:10.550 --> 09:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some real-time fact-checking on
the president.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, that's not what
the directors
said.

09:14.988 --> 09:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The directors can't really
comment.

09:17.056 --> 09:22.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not their mission, their
job or their
expertise to say what effect the
Russian interference

09:22.328 --> 09:27.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had in terms of outcomes, but
clearly they
interfered with the electoral
process.

09:27.967 --> 09:29.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And here's the problem.

09:29.769 --> 09:35.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the president is going to
distort what
the intelligence community says
in open hearing,

09:35.542 --> 09:39.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how can we have confidence when
the president
comes before the country to
share what the

09:39.646 --> 09:44.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence agencies have told
him in closed,
classified session, because the
country needs

09:44.617 --> 09:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to know, because the president
wants to take
action, where the president
needs to decide

09:49.022 --> 09:52.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the response should be to
North Korea
or around Iran?

09:52.992 --> 09:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How can we have confidence that
the president
is being truthful?

09:55.895 --> 09:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the short answer is, if he
keeps this
up, we can't.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a real danger to the
country.

10:01.201 --> 10:06.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what does
that mean,
Congressman Schiff?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are you saying you're
worried that could
happen?

10:08.374 --> 10:10.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, the best
example I can
give is, let's say, six months
from now, the

10:12.712 --> 10:15.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president says that Iran is
cheating on the
nuclear deal.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Obviously, if Iran isn't
cheating, that's
a big problem.

10:18.818 --> 10:23.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he's making this up, the way
he's making
up the claim that Barack Obama
wiretapped

10:23.356 --> 10:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him, that's a big problem.

10:25.158 --> 10:29.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the president is telling the
truth, in
a way, it's a bigger problem,
because, will

10:29.729 --> 10:31.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he be believed?

10:31.431 --> 10:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will he be believed by the
American people?

10:33.233 --> 10:37.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will he be believed by our
allies that he
needs to rally to reimpose
sanctions or take

10:37.737 --> 10:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
some other action against Iran?

10:40.073 --> 10:45.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Each time the president
undermines his own
credibility, he weakens himself,
he weakens

10:45.111 --> 10:49.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the institution of the
presidency, he weakens
the credibility of the entire
country and

10:49.249 --> 10:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our standing in the rest of the
world.

10:51.050 --> 10:54.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when there is a crisis, we
pay a dear
price for that loss of
credibility.

10:54.921 --> 10:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the other
hand, Congressman,
Republicans on the committee
today were calling

10:59.425 --> 11:03.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into question whether the
intelligence community
can be relied on.

11:03.296 --> 11:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They -- question after question
was about
leaks coming from the
intelligence community

11:07.867 --> 11:11.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and anyone who had access to
that information.

11:11.571 --> 11:16.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president, President Trump,
is saying
what the intelligence community
says is fake

11:16.576 --> 11:17.544 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

11:17.577 --> 11:19.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's dismissing it.

11:19.679 --> 11:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans are saying they're
leaking all
over the place.

11:23.216 --> 11:28.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I guess my question -- and
then you also
had Congressman Trey Gowdy, your
Republican

11:28.855 --> 11:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleague on the committee,
saying that perhaps
the FISA court, the courts that
authorize

11:33.626 --> 11:38.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much of their investigation, may
be in trouble.

11:38.164 --> 11:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you confident that an
investigation is
going to be thoroughly carried
out here?

11:42.201 --> 11:43.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:43.970 --> 11:46.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, on the leak
issue, first
of all, I think we have to
understand just

11:46.406 --> 11:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the breadth of what people are
talking about
when they talk about leaks.

11:49.275 --> 11:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leaks that most concern me,
that ought
to most concern the country is
when information

11:53.947 --> 12:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is leaked that betrays sources
and methods
of information that our allies
-- well, that

12:01.220 --> 12:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expose us to danger, because our
enemies can
then perpetrate attacks because
we lose those

12:06.960 --> 12:09.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
confidential sources of
information.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are the most serious
leaks.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What seems to really upset the
administration
is a different kind of leak.

12:14.968 --> 12:18.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's a leak that exposes
malfeasance within
the administration.

12:18.605 --> 12:23.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What really upset the president
wasn't the
fact that Mike Flynn was
unmasked to the country

12:23.242 --> 12:29.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that Mike Flynn was exposed
as having
lied to the country and the vice
president

12:29.415 --> 12:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about his conversations with the
Russian ambassador.

12:32.018 --> 12:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What really upset the president
was that,
essentially, he was caught in
the lie.

12:35.922 --> 12:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you will remember, even
after firing Flynn,
he wanted to praise Flynn and
castigate the

12:40.560 --> 12:41.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
press.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's something very different.

12:42.929 --> 12:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a leak that discloses
malfeasance in
the administration.

12:47.133 --> 12:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would say, look, this leak
problem,
every administration has it.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things my GOP
colleagues didn't
want to acknowledge today -- and
the president

12:55.708 --> 13:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly doesn't want to
acknowledge -- is,
they can say we think, we fear,
we suspect

13:00.380 --> 13:03.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this is coming from the
intelligence community.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're a bunch of Nazis.

13:04.417 --> 13:08.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's essentially the
president's original
tweet on this.

13:08.221 --> 13:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's also very possible that
some of these
leaks are coming from the White
House itself,

13:13.893 --> 13:17.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a division among people,
staff in the
White House...

13:17.363 --> 13:18.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:18.498 --> 13:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean from the
Trump White
House?

13:19.365 --> 13:21.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: From the Trump
White House, exactly,
because, of course, the Trump
White House

13:23.503 --> 13:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
knew this information as well.

13:25.838 --> 13:31.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there have been lots of
public reports
about how there's infighting
among the Trump

13:31.210 --> 13:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration and to watch your
back.

13:33.613 --> 13:38.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, maybe somebody wanted
Michael Flynn
out among the president's own
team.

13:38.317 --> 13:42.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I don't know that that's
happened, but if
we're serious about this, I
would say to my

13:42.388 --> 13:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOP colleagues, be careful what
you wish for,
because the trail may lead right
back to the

13:46.659 --> 13:48.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

13:48.594 --> 13:52.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman Adam
Schiff, the
ranking member of the House
Intelligence Committee,

13:52.265 --> 13:53.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thank you.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will be talking to you
again, I know.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.468 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you.

13:57.236 --> 14:00.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a moment, we
will hear from
Republican Senator Charles
Grassley.

14:00.540 --> 14:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, we want to turn to
that other
major story today, day one of
the confirmation

14:04.777 --> 14:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearings for Neil Gorsuch,
President Trump's
pick for the Supreme Court.

14:08.715 --> 14:13.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here are some excerpts of what
senators on
the Judiciary Committee, as well
as the nominee

14:13.486 --> 14:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself, had to say in opening
statements.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.056 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa:
Judge, welcome
to the Senate Judiciary
Committee.

14:19.759 --> 14:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was day one of
Judge Neil
Gorsuch's hearing, as senators
took turns

14:24.997 --> 14:30.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making opening statements, and
laying out
partisan attacks for the week to
come.

14:30.169 --> 14:34.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Judiciary Chairman Chuck
Grassley opened with
an alert for the nominee.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.342 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY: Judge, I'm
afraid, over
the next couple of days, you
will get some

14:39.078 --> 14:43.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions that will cause you
just to scratch
your head.

14:43.216 --> 14:48.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senators will cite some opinion
of yours,
and then we will hear that
you're for the

14:48.087 --> 14:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big guy and against the little
guy.

14:51.324 --> 14:56.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gorsuch's record
on corporate
cases was a theme that carried
through the

14:56.062 --> 14:57.029 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

14:58.898 --> 14:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D), Rhode
Island: Your
record on corporate vs. human
litigants comes

14:59.899 --> 15:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in, by one count, at 21-2 for
corporations.

15:03.970 --> 15:08.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tellingly, big special interests
and their
front groups are spending
millions of dollars

15:08.374 --> 15:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a dark money campaign to push
your confirmation.

15:11.644 --> 15:13.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:13.513 --> 15:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF FLAKE (R), Arizona: One of
my colleagues
said Judge Gorsuch is
pro-business or against

15:17.183 --> 15:19.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the little guy.

15:19.118 --> 15:23.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the record shows that we
can be confident
he will read the law as written
and not legislate

15:23.723 --> 15:25.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the bench.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For their part,
Republicans
spent most of the hearing
praising Gorsuch's

15:28.795 --> 15:29.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
legal resume.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.464 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah: Judge
Gorsuch's legal
experience is well-known.

15:33.332 --> 15:39.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My Democratic colleagues have
referred to
the American Bar Association's
rating as the

15:39.272 --> 15:43.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gold standard for evaluating
judicial nominees.

15:43.543 --> 15:49.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The ABA's unanimous
well-qualified rating
for Judge Gorsuch confirms that
he has the

15:49.782 --> 15:57.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highest level of professional
qualifications,
including integrity, confidence
and temperament.

15:57.523 --> 16:02.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: While Democrats
knocked his
constitutional philosophy as too
rigid.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: Judge Gorsuch
has also stated that he believes
judges should

16:07.266 --> 16:14.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look to the original public
meaning of the
Constitution when they decide
what a provision

16:14.640 --> 16:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Constitution means.

16:17.510 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is personal, but I find
this originalist
judicial philosophy to be really
troubling.

16:25.151 --> 16:32.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I firmly believe the American
Constitution
is a living document, intended
to evolve as

16:32.959 --> 16:34.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our country evolves.

16:34.293 --> 16:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
Senator Mike Lee
pushed back.

16:37.296 --> 16:38.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:38.798 --> 16:42.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKE LEE (R), Utah: Referring to
you as an
originalist just doesn't stick.

16:42.068 --> 16:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not a description that
was attributed
to you.

16:46.272 --> 16:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last time you stood before
this committee
and went through a confirmation
process, nowhere

16:52.245 --> 16:55.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the record is there any
reference to you
being outside the mainstream.

16:55.214 --> 17:00.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All this amidst a
bitter backdrop
for Democrats, after Republicans
last year

17:01.020 --> 17:07.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
blocked Merrick Garland,
President Obama's
pick to replace the late Justice
Antonin Scalia.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His seat has now been vacant for
more than
a year.

17:10.062 --> 17:11.731 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL), Minority
Whip: It was
clear that Senator McConnell was
making a

17:13.199 --> 17:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political decision, hoping a
Republican president
would be elected.

17:17.436 --> 17:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was willing to ignore the
tradition and
precedent of the Senate, so that
you could

17:21.741 --> 17:23.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sit at this witness table today.

17:23.643 --> 17:28.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fellow Coloradan
Democrat Senator
Michael Bennet, who helped
introduced Gorsuch,

17:28.648 --> 17:29.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
acknowledged the tension.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.417 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BENNET (D), Colorado: I
believe the
Senate has a constitutional duty
to give fair

17:33.953 --> 17:39.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consideration to this nominee,
just as we
had a duty to consider fairly
Judge Merrick

17:39.725 --> 17:40.826 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Garland.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Mr. Chairman, two wrongs
never make a
right.

17:43.262 --> 17:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some Democrats
also aimed their
attacks at President Trump.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.768 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D),
Connecticut: The independence
of those judges has never been
more threatened

17:51.804 --> 17:54.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and never more important.

17:54.140 --> 17:58.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a large part of the threat
comes from
the man who nominated you.

17:58.978 --> 18:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As for the
nominee, himself,
he spoke last, giving an opening
statement

18:04.016 --> 18:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of his own, and promising
independence.

18:05.985 --> 18:09.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH, Supreme Court
Nominee: Mr. Chairman,
these days, we sometimes hear
judges cynically

18:09.221 --> 18:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
described as politicians in
robes, seeking
to enforce their own politics,
rather than

18:13.893 --> 18:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
striving to apply the law
impartially.

18:15.661 --> 18:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I thought that were true, I
would hang
up the robe.

18:18.898 --> 18:23.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gorsuch tried to
deflect some
of the claims made by Democrats.

18:23.069 --> 18:27.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: My decisions have
never reflected
a judgment about the people
before me, only

18:27.506 --> 18:33.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a judgment about the law and the
facts at
issue in each particular case.

18:33.713 --> 18:41.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A good judge can promise no more
than that,
and a good judge should
guarantee no less,

18:41.921 --> 18:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a judge who likes every
outcome he reaches
is probably a pretty bad judge.

18:46.325 --> 18:51.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The hearings
continue tomorrow
and through the week.

18:51.597 --> 18:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now to my conversation with
the chairman
of the Senate Judiciary
Committee.

18:55.201 --> 18:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's Republican Chuck Grassley
of Iowa.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We spoke a short time ago.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I began by asking what the
country learned
about Judge Gorsuch today.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.143 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:04.176 --> 19:09.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY: I think they
learned that
he is willing to be a judge, and
not be a

19:09.749 --> 19:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legislator, and I think he tells
best what
he's up to when he says a judge
that likes

19:15.888 --> 19:19.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all his decisions isn't a very
good judge.

19:19.125 --> 19:25.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's getting back to the
independence that
a member of the judiciary branch
needs to

19:25.564 --> 19:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show if he's going to truly be a
referee within
our governmental system.

19:31.637 --> 19:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he showed that very clearly
by demonstrating
that you should look at the
facts of the days,

19:40.813 --> 19:45.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
look at the law and be
dispassionate, in other
words, leave your own personal
views out of

19:45.718 --> 19:46.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

19:46.919 --> 19:51.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's reinforced by
his writings
very well.

19:51.590 --> 19:56.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, we're going to go
through this
over the next 48 hours.

19:56.328 --> 19:59.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I believe what I'm telling
you kind of
sums up what we are going to
know at the end

19:59.899 --> 20:01.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of 48 hours.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, many
Republicans say
they want Judge Gorsuch to be as
close as

20:05.771 --> 20:09.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
possible to the late Justice
Antonin Scalia.

20:09.508 --> 20:14.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's clearly a different person,
but are his
views different from those of
Justice Scalia?

20:14.680 --> 20:16.215 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:16.248 --> 20:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY: Well, I think
the difference
is only in the sense of degrees.

20:22.488 --> 20:28.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't know whether there
has been enough
comparison to his writings with
Justice Scalia.

20:28.194 --> 20:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But from the standpoint of being
a strict
constructionist of the
Constitution and following

20:33.866 --> 20:40.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the intent of Congress, and not
legislating
from the bench, I think, in that
general way,

20:41.006 --> 20:43.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he fits very well in with
Scalia.

20:43.442 --> 20:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, quite frankly, I don't know
whether anybody
can replace Scalia.

20:47.146 --> 20:54.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we noticed,
Senator Grassley,
Democrats on the Judiciary
Committee today

20:54.787 --> 20:56.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said they're concerned about
Judge Gorsuch.

20:56.989 --> 21:02.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among other things, we heard
Senator Pat Leahy
say he's got support from
conservative interest

21:03.028 --> 21:09.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups that are anti-choice,
anti-environment,
pro-corporate.

21:09.068 --> 21:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are these areas, though, that
Republicans,
conservatives are counting on
him to reflect?

21:15.674 --> 21:17.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:17.476 --> 21:23.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY: Well, I think
that you're
not going to get any opinion out
of him other

21:23.749 --> 21:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than what he said in his cases,
and I don't
think it's fair to say that he's
pro one way

21:30.389 --> 21:33.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and anti another way.

21:33.092 --> 21:38.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in regard to corporate
interests
as an example, he's been on both
sides of

21:38.430 --> 21:40.232 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

21:40.266 --> 21:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He doesn't have a philosophy
that is easy
to predict, except that he's
going to interpret

21:45.437 --> 21:49.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the law and not read something
into the law
that Congress didn't intend.

21:49.909 --> 21:55.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Your fellow
Republican Senator
Lindsey Graham today deplored
the fact that

21:55.514 --> 22:01.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is increasing partisanship
in Senate
votes to confirm Supreme Court
and other judicial

22:01.787 --> 22:03.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nominees.

22:03.556 --> 22:09.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is the case, Senator,
that the votes
have been increasingly along
party lines.

22:09.862 --> 22:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think Judge Gorsuch will
end up winning
Democratic votes?

22:13.566 --> 22:14.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY: A few, but I
don't think
very many.

22:16.502 --> 22:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the base of the Democrat
Party is
very strongly wanting to
demonstrate two things,

22:24.109 --> 22:29.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one, that they may not approve
of his approach
to the law and the Constitution,
and, secondly,

22:29.682 --> 22:34.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they want to make a case that
Garland should
have been approved last year.

22:34.253 --> 22:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Senator
Grassley,
I want to ask you about the
other big story

22:39.058 --> 22:40.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the day.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It happened on the other side of
the Capitol.

22:41.660 --> 22:45.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the FBI director, the
head the
National Security Agency
testified before

22:45.864 --> 22:47.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the House Intelligence
Committee.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI director, Jim Comey,
confirmed that
his agency is looking into
connections, any

22:54.740 --> 23:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possible connections between the
Russian attempts
to influence the 2016 election
and the Trump

23:00.379 --> 23:02.214 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

23:02.248 --> 23:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also said that there's no
evidence that
President Obama ordered a
wiretap of President

23:07.219 --> 23:08.988 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

23:09.021 --> 23:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overall, do you believe, do you
have confidence
that the FBI is going to get to
the bottom

23:12.791 --> 23:13.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of all this?

23:13.859 --> 23:15.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:15.661 --> 23:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY: I think it's
going to be
very, very difficult and it's
going to go

23:18.397 --> 23:20.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on for a long time.

23:20.466 --> 23:28.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think that they should
be just as
vigorous in investigating the
leak possibility

23:28.507 --> 23:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well, because that's where
national security
could be at risk.

23:34.413 --> 23:40.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we talk all about
investigating Trump
or Trump people, but we -- I
don't hear enough

23:40.052 --> 23:48.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from them on investigating the
leaks, which
is a felony, if the person can
be found.

23:48.093 --> 23:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you think the
leaks are
more important than any possible
coordination

23:54.099 --> 23:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between the Trump campaign and
the Russian
interference in the election?

23:58.437 --> 23:59.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY: Not at all.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they're both of equal
importance.

24:02.174 --> 24:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But all I hear them talking
about is the relationship
between Trump people and Russia.

24:07.313 --> 24:11.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't hear anything about the
breaking of
leaks.

24:11.216 --> 24:17.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in the first place, in
regard to the
relationship, there is a lot of
accusations,

24:17.556 --> 24:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there's -- it was pretty
clear today it
didn't lead to them believing
that there was

24:22.761 --> 24:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any connection between the Trump
campaign
and the Russian government.

24:28.801 --> 24:32.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think,
finally, Senator,
that the FBI's statement they
don't see any

24:32.805 --> 24:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evidence that President Obama
ordered a wiretap
of President Trump during the
campaign, that

24:38.711 --> 24:40.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that puts that to rest?

24:40.112 --> 24:41.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:41.914 --> 24:46.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY: I think that
you're going
to have to wait until the Senate
Intelligence

24:46.919 --> 24:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee gets done in a couple
of weeks -- they
are going to get into that --
before I can

24:50.689 --> 24:52.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
draw that conclusion.

24:52.491 --> 24:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Charles
Grassley, the
chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee,

24:57.062 --> 24:58.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you very much.

24:58.063 --> 24:59.031 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:59.064 --> 25:00.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY: Thank you very
much, Judy.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And back to the
Supreme Court
nominee now.

25:03.001 --> 25:07.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to take a closer look
now at Judge
Gorsuch from those who know him
well and have

25:07.806 --> 25:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
studied his record closely.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has this portrait.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Today, I am keeping another
promise to the

25:15.013 --> 25:16.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
American people.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: President Trump
announced his
pick in the East Room of the
White House on

25:19.618 --> 25:21.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
January 31.

25:21.387 --> 25:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He is the man of
our country
and a man who our country really
needs and

25:26.225 --> 25:30.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needs badly to ensure the rule
of law and
the rule of justice.

25:30.829 --> 25:35.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And Americans had
a first chance
to meet Neil Gorsuch, his wife,
Louise, at

25:35.868 --> 25:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his side, a man who at age 49
could have a
profound effect on the nation's
laws, and

25:41.540 --> 25:43.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political life, for decades to
come.

25:43.675 --> 25:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH, Supreme Court
Nominee: Standing
here in a house of history, and
acutely aware

25:48.247 --> 25:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of my own imperfections, I
pledge that if
I am confirmed, I will do all my
powers permit

25:54.420 --> 25:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be a faithful servant of the
Constitution
and laws of this great country.

25:57.723 --> 25:59.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL TRENT, Friend of Neil
Gorsuch: He's
very humble.

25:59.525 --> 26:05.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you met him in a crowd of
people, he wouldn't
be the person that stood out and
tried to

26:05.931 --> 26:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capture the most attention of
the group.

26:07.733 --> 26:13.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would be the person that
would listen and
sort of wait for an opportunity
to share his

26:13.705 --> 26:15.507 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thoughts.

26:15.541 --> 26:18.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Michael Trent has
known Gorsuch
since they were freshman in high
school, and

26:18.343 --> 26:20.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
served as best man at his
wedding.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's talked with his friend in
recent days.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where is his head at right now?

26:24.450 --> 26:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL TRENT: It's very focused
on preparing
for the hearings.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wants to be sure that he gets
it right.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants to make sure that he
puts his best
foot forward.

26:32.524 --> 26:34.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He also knows, of
course, the
politics of our time.

26:34.893 --> 26:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL TRENT: I wish people
would look past,
you know, the rough-and-tumble
bit of politics

26:41.700 --> 26:45.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what's going on in the press
and look
to the person that he is.

26:45.304 --> 26:50.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Trent says Neil
Gorsuch is
a Coloradan through and through,
a lover of

26:50.209 --> 26:53.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the outdoors, fishing, hiking,
and skiing.

26:53.612 --> 26:59.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was raised in Denver with two
siblings,
his mother a prominent
Republican state legislator.

26:59.218 --> 27:03.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was tapped by Ronald Reagan
as the first
woman to head the EPA, bringing
the family

27:03.989 --> 27:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Washington, D.C., when Neil
was 14.

27:06.258 --> 27:10.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE GORSUCH BURFORD, Former EPA
Administrator:
I did submit my resignation to
the president

27:10.162 --> 27:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States, with
regret, last night
about 5:00.

27:14.600 --> 27:19.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Anne Gorsuch
Burford resigned
in the wake of a congressional
investigation

27:19.438 --> 27:25.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
into mismanagement of a
hazardous waste program
just 22 months into her tenure.

27:25.978 --> 27:30.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Politically conservative from an
early age,
Neil Gorsuch attended Columbia
University,

27:30.649 --> 27:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where he and friends started
their own conservative
paper called "The Federalist."

27:34.987 --> 27:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL TRENT: I think probably
what he saw
at Columbia was one side being
reported over

27:39.958 --> 27:42.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and over again, and he wanted to
provide another
side.

27:42.828 --> 27:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even more than
that, he wants
to put a kind of conservative
view into a

27:47.332 --> 27:48.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
liberal bastion.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.102 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

27:50.135 --> 27:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL TRENT: Well, it was
Columbia, I mean,
you know New York City in the
1980s.

27:53.205 --> 27:58.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that he was ambitious
enough to start
his own paper and get his own
thoughts out

27:58.076 --> 28:02.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there, I think, speaks a lot to
the type of
person that he is.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, a lot of people will go
off and do
wild things in college.

28:04.950 --> 28:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, Neil basically
took that opportunity
to put his thoughts on paper and
get them

28:09.688 --> 28:11.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there.

28:11.523 --> 28:15.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Gorsuch attended
Harvard Law
School, and was a Marshall
Scholar at Oxford,

28:15.227 --> 28:17.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where he met his wife.

28:17.062 --> 28:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He clerked for Supreme Court
Justices Byron
White and Anthony Kennedy, who
remains a key

28:22.334 --> 28:24.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
player on the court today.

28:24.303 --> 28:28.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spent 10 years in private
practice, and
one in the Justice Department
under George

28:28.807 --> 28:34.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
W. Bush, who appointed Gorsuch,
then just
38, to a seat on the 10th
Circuit Court of

28:34.813 --> 28:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Appeals, based in Denver.

28:36.181 --> 28:38.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not surprised that he's
up for a Supreme
Court nomination?

28:39.017 --> 28:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIL JAFFER, Former Clerk:
Well, actually,
I'm shocked.

28:40.852 --> 28:42.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You are?

28:42.554 --> 28:44.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIL JAFFER: Yes, to be honest
with you,
because he's such a
down-to-earth guy.

28:44.089 --> 28:50.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just don't get that sense
of, he's going
to go try and run the world.

28:50.162 --> 28:53.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jamil Jaffer
worked with Gorsuch
at the law firm and later as his
law clerk

28:54.032 --> 28:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and has remained a friend.

28:55.901 --> 29:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jaffer now teaches at the
Antonin Scalia Law
School at George Mason
University, named for

29:01.173 --> 29:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the man who Neil Gorsuch may
replace.

29:03.041 --> 29:07.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMIL JAFFER: One of the
interesting things
about Judge Gorsuch is that he
really is a

29:07.212 --> 29:08.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
judge's judge.

29:08.213 --> 29:09.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What does that
mean, exactly?

29:09.548 --> 29:11.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMIL JAFFER: So he's not
looking to get a
particular outcome.

29:11.083 --> 29:14.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't have a particular
policy view that
he wants to impose upon the law.

29:14.219 --> 29:18.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What it is, is it's applying the
laws Congress
wrote, applying the Constitution
as the people

29:18.790 --> 29:22.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who wrote it understood it,
right, and not
sort of going outside of those
bounds.

29:22.427 --> 29:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so maybe that's a
conservative philosophy,
in the sense that it's
originalist, it's textualist,

29:28.066 --> 29:32.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the mold of, I would say,
Justice Scalia,
but also very mainstream, in the
sense that

29:32.104 --> 29:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you apply it to any given
case, you're
not going to necessarily like
all the outcomes.

29:35.807 --> 29:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, I understand
it, but it
also sounds a little maybe naive
in the political

29:40.212 --> 29:41.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
context we're talking about,
right?

29:41.647 --> 29:43.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMIL JAFFER: Sure.

29:43.548 --> 29:47.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Scalia was a
lightning rod
on all kinds of social and all
kinds of political

29:47.252 --> 29:48.220 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

29:48.253 --> 29:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMIL JAFFER: Don't get me
wrong.

29:49.254 --> 29:50.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, Judge Gorsuch is
certainly conservative.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I would say he's in the
mainstream of
conservatism.

29:52.524 --> 29:56.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not going to get a
liberal judge from
President Donald Trump, right?

29:56.128 --> 29:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's not what he ran on.

29:57.996 --> 30:00.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you're looking for sort
of a mainstream
conservative, a judge's judge,
somebody who's

30:00.732 --> 30:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not going to go out of the way
to either get
to a conservative outcome or a
liberal outcome,

30:04.670 --> 30:06.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then you have got Neil Gorsuch.

30:06.171 --> 30:09.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What is known of
Neil Gorsuch's
views?

30:09.408 --> 30:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among his early writings, a book
on assisted
suicide, arguing against the
practice and

30:14.579 --> 30:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the inviolability of human
life, and a
"National Review" article, from
before he

30:20.085 --> 30:25.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
became a judge, critical of
liberals who -- quote
-- "have become addicted to the
courtroom,

30:25.357 --> 30:29.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rather than elected leaders and
the ballot
box, as the primary means of
effecting their

30:29.961 --> 30:31.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
social agenda."

30:31.797 --> 30:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a prominent and contentious
case, Judge
Gorsuch sided with Hobby Lobby
stores, which

30:37.202 --> 30:43.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
objected to a requirement under
the Affordable
Care Act that it provide
contraception coverage.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That decision was later upheld
by the Supreme
Court.

30:46.678 --> 30:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's also written on the
needs of low-income
litigants and prisoners, calling
for more

30:51.216 --> 30:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affordable legal services and
better representation
in death penalty cases.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gorsuch was personally close to
Justice Scalia.

30:59.825 --> 31:05.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a speech last year at Case
Western Reserve,
he spoke of being on the ski
slope when he

31:05.464 --> 31:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
learned of Scalia's death.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: I immediately lost
what breath
I had left.

31:09.668 --> 31:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not embarrassed to admit
that I couldn't
see the rest of the way down the
mountain

31:14.573 --> 31:15.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through the tears.

31:15.941 --> 31:18.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He added this of
their shared
judicial philosophy.

31:18.276 --> 31:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: As Justice Scalia
put it -- and
it rings true to me -- if you're
going to

31:22.147 --> 31:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a good and faithful judge,
you have to
resign yourself to the fact that
you're not

31:25.650 --> 31:28.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
always going to like the
conclusions you reach.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you like them all the time,
you're probably
doing something wrong.

31:32.557 --> 31:37.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Neil Gorsuch is a
family man, a
conservative from Colorado.

31:37.929 --> 31:41.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Conservatives and
business
groups like what they see.

31:41.333 --> 31:45.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Why did he make it
harder to hold
Wall Street accountable or for
women to get

31:45.170 --> 31:46.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
birth control?

31:47.005 --> 31:50.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But liberals see
a different
picture, one in which Gorsuch
could fall on

31:50.342 --> 31:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the court's far right end of the
spectrum.

31:53.111 --> 31:54.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA, Constitutional
Accountability
Center: You know, it really
doesn't matter

31:54.446 --> 31:59.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether he's a genial person or
a great guy
to go skiing with.

31:59.050 --> 32:00.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm sure all of those things are
true.

32:00.952 --> 32:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what really matters is his
record and
whether he can be the
independent justice

32:05.724 --> 32:09.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we really need on the
Supreme Court to
provide a check against
potential overreach

32:09.628 --> 32:11.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the elective branches.

32:11.463 --> 32:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Elizabeth Wydra,
head of the
Constitutional Accountability
Center, a public

32:15.734 --> 32:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interest law and advocacy group,
says Donald
Trump set out a clear litmus
test, including

32:21.673 --> 32:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a willingness to overturn Roe v.
Wade.

32:24.843 --> 32:28.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One can only assume, she told
me, Gorsuch
met the test.

32:28.046 --> 32:32.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: Certainly, we
want our justices
to look to the text and history
of the Constitution,

32:32.984 --> 32:37.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but what I'm concerned about is
whether he
looks to the text and history of
the whole

32:37.255 --> 32:42.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Constitution, including
amendments that made
our Constitution more equal,
ensuring that

32:42.861 --> 32:46.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people of all colors, men and
women are treated
equally as citizens.

32:46.998 --> 32:51.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It almost sounds
as though
anybody that Trump would put
forward, because

32:51.570 --> 32:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he was very clear about what he
wanted, right?

32:53.205 --> 32:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: I think this is
where the
hearing becomes very important.

32:56.474 --> 33:02.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a big burden placed on
Neil Gorsuch
to come before the Senate
Judiciary Committee

33:02.547 --> 33:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and show that, despite the
process by which
he was picked, replete with
litmus tests and

33:08.220 --> 33:12.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high rhetoric from Donald Trump,
Neil Gorsuch
has the burden to show the
Senate Judiciary

33:12.891 --> 33:17.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee that he will be this
fair, independent
judge who will follow the law
where it leads.

33:17.562 --> 33:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Neil Gorsuch has
spent recent
weeks meeting with senators on
both sides

33:21.733 --> 33:27.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the aisle and preparing for
those hearings,
a very public debate now under
way.

33:27.973 --> 33:30.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Washington, I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the
"PBS NewsHour."

33:30.609 --> 33:35.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we continue
our look at
the potential next Supreme Court
justice,

33:35.780 --> 33:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neil Gorsuch, and the opening
day of his confirmation
hearings with "NewsHour" regular
Marcia Coyle

33:41.186 --> 33:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of "The National Law Journal."

33:43.221 --> 33:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tom Goldstein, he's founder of
SCOTUSblog.com.

33:47.392 --> 33:52.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pam Karlan, she's a professor of
law at Stanford
University who worked in the
Justice Department

33:52.364 --> 33:57.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the Obama administration,
and Paul
Clement, a former solicitor
general under

33:57.335 --> 33:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President George W. Bush.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all of you to the
"NewsHour."

34:01.339 --> 34:04.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marcia, I'm going to start with
you.

34:04.342 --> 34:06.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Overall takeaway from today's
session?

34:06.111 --> 34:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Well, the first day usually is
not all that

34:09.748 --> 34:11.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
substantive.

34:11.816 --> 34:15.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The hearing played out the way
it has traditionally.

34:15.387 --> 34:19.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The senators -- each senator has
an opening
statement.

34:19.257 --> 34:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there is an introduction of
the nominee,
and the nominee's opening
statement.

34:24.029 --> 34:25.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That did happen.

34:25.830 --> 34:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we gather from the
first day is,
we see where the concerns are on
both sides,

34:33.338 --> 34:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the questioning may lead,
what kind
of difficulties the nominee may
have in answering

34:40.578 --> 34:42.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some of the questions.

34:42.414 --> 34:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Republican said today, we
saw a lot
of emphasis on Judge Gorsuch's
qualifications.

34:49.387 --> 34:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, we saw
specific concerns
about opinions he has written in
areas, certain

34:56.461 --> 35:04.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
areas such as workers'
protection, whether
he would give deference to
agencies' rules.

35:05.003 --> 35:08.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's really a laying out of
what's to
come.

35:08.506 --> 35:10.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Paul Clement,
what was your
main takeaway today?

35:10.942 --> 35:14.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL CLEMENT, Former U.S.
Solicitor General:
Well, I thought probably the
single most interesting

35:14.045 --> 35:17.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of the hearing was Judge
Gorsuch's own
statement.

35:17.115 --> 35:23.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what the American
public saw was
somebody who's very poised, very
experienced

35:23.221 --> 35:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- he's been a federal court of
appeals judge
for over 10 years -- and I think
somebody

35:28.426 --> 35:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by kind of any conventional
standard is qualified
to be on the Supreme Court of
the United States.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so I think that will
probably give us
an indication.

35:37.936 --> 35:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will obviously see a lot more
of Judge
Gorsuch in tomorrow's hearings
answering questions

35:43.475 --> 35:46.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the back and forth, but that
was really
the highlight for me.

35:46.211 --> 35:50.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Pam Karlan,
again, we
only heard just a moment or so
from Judge

35:50.982 --> 35:54.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gorsuch himself today, but what
was your main
takeaway in terms of what we now
know?

35:54.452 --> 35:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM KARLAN, Stanford Law School:
Well, from
Judge Gorsuch himself, he made
this point

35:58.857 --> 36:05.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and you saw it in the clip --
that in 97
percent of his cases below, the
decision is

36:05.563 --> 36:06.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unanimous.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's totally different from
what happens
on the Supreme Court.

36:09.501 --> 36:14.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The job of a judge and the job
of a justice
are very different, because
justices are resolving

36:14.873 --> 36:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the constitutional questions
that divide us
most.

36:17.475 --> 36:21.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think you got a sense from
the senators
that the senators, too,
recognize that there

36:21.479 --> 36:24.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are two very different
constitutional visions
at stake here.

36:24.082 --> 36:30.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and I
wanted to ask you
about that, Paul -- Tom
Goldstein, because

36:30.422 --> 36:32.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it struck me, he said, that's
how we do it
in the West.

36:33.024 --> 36:39.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said 97 percent of his -- of
the cases
he decided on were unanimous.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even more were decided by -- he
was in the
majority.

36:42.734 --> 36:45.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does that tell us something
about him or not?

36:45.103 --> 36:47.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TOM GOLDSTEIN, Founder,
SCOTUSblog.com: It
probably doesn't tell us as much
about the

36:47.572 --> 36:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outcomes in the cases, in the
cases where
there was a division.

36:50.008 --> 36:53.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you get to the Supreme
Court, the stakes
are harder and the -- higher,
and the questions

36:53.945 --> 36:55.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are harder.

36:55.713 --> 36:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think that there is any
suggestion
that you would really see Neil
Gorsuch kind

36:59.584 --> 37:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of assuming the mantle of the
center of justice
on the Supreme Court.

37:03.254 --> 37:06.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rather, he's going to fit the
mold of the
person that he's replacing,
Justice Scalia.

37:06.991 --> 37:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In all likelihood, he's going to
be a solidly
conservative judge.

37:09.527 --> 37:14.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what did you
hear today,
Marcia, in terms of lines that
you expect

37:14.265 --> 37:18.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democrats -- questioning,
criticism that
you expect the Democrats to...

37:18.470 --> 37:22.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Judy, I think
every confirmation
hearing, at least ones that I
have covered,

37:22.774 --> 37:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has something unique about it
that drives
the questioning.

37:27.579 --> 37:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the Democratic side today
and what
I think will drive a lot of the
questioning

37:33.384 --> 37:37.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is something that Senator
Klobuchar said that
sort of stayed with me.

37:37.789 --> 37:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said, basically, we can't
evaluate your
credentials in a legal cocoon.

37:44.529 --> 37:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have to be evaluated in the
context of
the era that we live in.

37:49.000 --> 37:54.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for her and her colleagues,
that context
is pretty much what they believe
the Trump

37:54.139 --> 37:56.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
administration has created.

37:56.341 --> 38:07.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She talked about the president's
criticisms
of judges, the obstacles to
voting, just a

38:07.352 --> 38:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole range of things that she
feels he has
to be measured against in terms
of his independence.

38:14.926 --> 38:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think we're going to see a
lot of questioning
that follows along those lines.

38:22.467 --> 38:28.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the sort of unfortunate
things, I think,
of what the Senate did on the
Garland nomination

38:28.840 --> 38:34.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was that it pushed the Supreme
Court into
a very bitter election campaign.

38:34.212 --> 38:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that resulted in both
candidates having
litmus tests for their judicial
nominees.

38:40.418 --> 38:42.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

38:42.187 --> 38:44.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: And the fact that
President
Trump said that he would appoint
someone who,

38:44.789 --> 38:50.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, would overturn Roe
v. Wade really
creates a problem for Judge
Gorsuch when he

38:50.662 --> 38:53.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gets questioned about that, to
prove his independence.

38:53.231 --> 38:57.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Paul
Clement, how do you
think that will affect his
approach to this

38:57.569 --> 38:59.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
process for the next two days?

38:59.504 --> 39:04.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL CLEMENT: Well, I think what
I would anticipate
is, he is going to be very
careful about not

39:04.175 --> 39:08.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compromising his ability to sit
on cases if
he gets confirmed.

39:08.279 --> 39:13.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't think there is going
to be a dramatically
different sort of willingness to
answer questions

39:13.851 --> 39:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
compared to prior nominations.

39:16.354 --> 39:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that may be dissatisfying
for some members
of the committee, to be sure.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I think it's important.

39:22.093 --> 39:25.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't want somebody getting
confirmed,
but then having to recuse
themselves on all

39:25.730 --> 39:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manner of cases because they
essentially have
gotten into the nitty-gritty of
how they would

39:30.001 --> 39:31.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decide cases.

39:31.102 --> 39:33.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't anticipate you will
see any of
that.

39:33.304 --> 39:37.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of the focus is
going to be
-- you heard some of this in the
senatorial

39:37.942 --> 39:43.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statements today -- big guy vs.
little guy
cases, religious liberty,
because this Hobby

39:43.081 --> 39:47.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lobby case on the court of
appeals was one
of his more prominent cases.

39:47.051 --> 39:51.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in a way, it almost speaks
volumes the
cases that they're not talking
about.

39:51.089 --> 39:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He really did manage in 10 years
not to decide
cases in other hot-button areas.

39:57.328 --> 40:01.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's probably
going to be a
little bit frustrating for some
of the senators

40:01.366 --> 40:04.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are going to want to really
dig in and
engage on the substance.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And pick up on
that, Pam Karlan.

40:06.971 --> 40:14.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where can Democrats go in
talking, in questioning
Judge Gorsuch that will elicit
some feel,

40:14.912 --> 40:21.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some information about how he's
going to judge,
how he will rule as a Supreme
Court justice

40:21.085 --> 40:22.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if he's confirmed?

40:22.854 --> 40:26.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM KARLAN: Well, I think one of
the places
they can go is to talk about
cases that have

40:26.491 --> 40:31.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already been decided in areas of
law that
are quite fixed and ask him what
he thinks

40:32.030 --> 40:36.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the way justices -- prior
justices went
about thinking about those
cases.

40:36.801 --> 40:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will give you one example,
which was, when
the Supreme Court decided Brown
against Board

40:40.872 --> 40:46.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Education, the case where the
court held
that de jure segregation in
public schools

40:46.311 --> 40:50.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was unconstitutional, they
decided two things
that day that I think the
senators really

40:50.782 --> 40:52.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should press him on.

40:52.717 --> 40:56.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is, they decided that
applied to the federal
government as well through the
Fifth Amendment.

40:56.421 --> 41:01.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can't read the Fifth
Amendment, which
was enacted in 1791, to suggest
that those

41:01.526 --> 41:04.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who enacted it thought
that it prohibited
race discrimination.

41:05.029 --> 41:09.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how do we get the right
result there if
you're a strict originalist?

41:09.300 --> 41:11.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The same thing with regard to
the 14th Amendment.

41:12.003 --> 41:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Chief Justice's Warren's
opinion for the
court said, in trying to decide
whether segregation

41:16.307 --> 41:21.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in public schools is
unconstitutional, we
can't turn the clock back to
1868.

41:21.746 --> 41:24.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does Judge Gorsuch think that's
wrong?

41:24.082 --> 41:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Would he have signed on to an
opinion that
said that?

41:27.051 --> 41:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or would he have taken the view
that, for
example, Justice Scalia gave in
an interview

41:31.889 --> 41:35.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the "California Lawyer"
magazine, where
he said, you know, let's face
it, the 14th

41:35.727 --> 41:40.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amendment, the Equal Protection
Clause, really
has very little to say about
whether sex discrimination

41:40.798 --> 41:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is unconstitutional.

41:42.467 --> 41:45.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think he can be pressed on
cases that
aren't going to come before the
court.

41:45.837 --> 41:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, quite candidly, I think, if
he's anywhere
as skillful as the four
predecessor nominees,

41:51.509 --> 41:52.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he will play rope-a-dope.

41:52.944 --> 41:54.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you --
well, pick up
on that, Tom Goldstein.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM GOLDSTEIN: Well, there are
two kinds of
nomination hearings.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One is where the nominee knows
they have the
votes.

41:58.816 --> 42:00.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's one -- the other
where they don't.

42:00.885 --> 42:01.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Neil Gorsuch does.

42:01.886 --> 42:05.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Republicans have a majority
in the Senate.

42:05.323 --> 42:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no prospect that any
Republican will
vote against him.

42:07.825 --> 42:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, all he has to do is just do
no harm essentially.

42:10.995 --> 42:14.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I expect he will say
relatively little,
because that's the commonsense
things to do.

42:14.766 --> 42:18.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as Paul indicates, he has a
good reason
to not get into details, because
those issues

42:18.669 --> 42:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
might come in front of him.

42:20.405 --> 42:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one thing I do think we saw
today was
that there wasn't a hint by the
Democrats

42:23.708 --> 42:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they were going to attempt
to filibuster
the nomination and force the
administration

42:28.746 --> 42:34.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get to and the nomination to
get to 60
votes, or cause a change in the
Senate rules.

42:34.385 --> 42:38.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They just seem to -- the
Democrats don't seem
to have the energy and the
strategy to lay

42:38.089 --> 42:42.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down on the tracks over this
nominee, because
he seems to be within the
mainstream of what

42:42.293 --> 42:43.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you would expect from a
Republican president.

42:44.028 --> 42:46.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, just to
follow up on
that, how much pressure is there
on him to

42:46.764 --> 42:51.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come across as so acceptable to
the Democrats
that they don't resort to...

42:51.869 --> 42:53.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM GOLDSTEIN: I don't think
actually that
much.

42:53.871 --> 42:58.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He does come across as a very
commonsense
guy, relatively plainspoken,
very clear.

42:58.342 --> 43:03.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He hasn't decided hot-button
issues like abortion
and affirmative action in
extreme ways.

43:03.381 --> 43:09.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so all he has to do is just
not give Democrats
an excuse to caricature him as
an extremist

43:09.253 --> 43:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the right, and then he's
fine.

43:11.088 --> 43:13.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're going
to be following
it for the next two days.

43:13.958 --> 43:16.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're going to have all four
of you back.

43:16.260 --> 43:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Goldstein, Marcia Coyle, Pam
Karlan, Paul
Clement, we thank you.

43:20.064 --> 43:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we look forward to seeing
you back here
tomorrow.

43:21.599 --> 43:22.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TOM GOLDSTEIN: Thanks.

43:22.600 --> 43:23.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAM KARLAN: Thanks.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Thanks.

43:25.403 --> 43:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, tomorrow
morning, you
can turn to our Web site and our
social channels

43:28.172 --> 43:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

43:40.918 --> 43:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

43:55.233 --> 44:00.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: There's
word that
U.S. authorities will ban many
electronic

44:00.872 --> 44:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
devices on certain incoming
foreign flights.

44:04.275 --> 44:09.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News accounts tonight say the
Homeland Security
Department will announce the
move tomorrow.

44:09.247 --> 44:13.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's said to include about a
dozen foreign
air carriers flying out of
Africa and the

44:13.784 --> 44:15.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Middle East.

44:15.586 --> 44:21.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A suicide car bomb killed at
least 23 people
today and wounded nearly 50 more
in Baghdad.

44:21.859 --> 44:26.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police and hospital officials
say that the
target was a busy commercial
district in a

44:26.364 --> 44:28.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mostly Shiite neighborhood.

44:28.165 --> 44:32.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Islamic State group has
staged a number
of attacks in Baghdad, even as
it's losing

44:32.937 --> 44:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ground to a government offensive
to retake
the city of Mosul.

44:37.575 --> 44:42.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The violence erupted as Iraq's
prime minister,
Haider al-Abadi, was visiting
President Trump

44:42.747 --> 44:44.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the White House.

44:44.482 --> 44:49.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president praised Abadi, but
said the
U.S. pullout from Iraq left a
vacuum for ISIS

44:50.021 --> 44:51.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
militants to fill.

44:51.589 --> 44:53.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Your soldiers are fighting hard.

44:53.891 --> 44:57.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know Mosul is moving along.

44:57.862 --> 45:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Mosul was ours until we
left.

45:02.466 --> 45:06.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, perhaps we shouldn't have
gone in, and,
certainly, we shouldn't have
left.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We should never, ever have left.

45:08.973 --> 45:14.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later this week,
Mr. Trump
will host a meeting of leaders
from 68 nations

45:14.378 --> 45:17.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to discuss strategy against
ISIS.

45:17.515 --> 45:23.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, government forces
recaptured parts
of Damascus a day after a
surprise rebel incursion

45:23.487 --> 45:24.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the capital city.

45:24.956 --> 45:29.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rebel blitz marked the
biggest infiltration
of Damascus since 2012.

45:29.594 --> 45:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Syrian air force carried out
airstrikes
today on besieged areas.

45:34.298 --> 45:39.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Activists reported dozens
killed, and said
the fighting was continuing in
some places.

A new shakeup has hit the
ride-sharing company
Uber.

45:43.941 --> 45:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff Jones has resigned as
president after
six months on the job.

45:48.312 --> 45:53.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, he said his
beliefs are -- quote
-- "inconsistent with what I saw
and experienced

45:53.918 --> 45:55.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at Uber."

45:55.286 --> 45:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company faces allegations
that it ignores
sexual harassment.

45:58.856 --> 46:05.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also acknowledged using
software to disguise
its activities in cities around
the world.

Billionaire and philanthropist
David Rockefeller
died today.

46:09.433 --> 46:14.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the last surviving

D. Rockefeller, who built the
Standard Oil

46:16.874 --> 46:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Rockefeller served as
president of Chase
Manhattan Bank for 20 years and
was a major

benefactor of the arts and
conservation.

46:23.314 --> 46:25.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was 101 years old.

Wall Street started this week
with a lackluster
showing.

46:29.020 --> 46:32.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost eight

The Nasdaq rose half-a-point,
and the S&amp;P

46:38.963 --> 46:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's a new happiest place
on earth.

46:41.999 --> 46:43.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's Norway.

46:43.534 --> 46:48.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It bested Denmark for the top
spot in this
year's World Happiness Report.

46:48.939 --> 46:52.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The survey was co-authored by
economists in
the U.S. and Canada.

46:52.510 --> 46:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It takes into account life
expectancy, freedom,
wealth and other factors.

46:57.014 --> 47:03.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. slipped a spot to 14th
overall among
155 countries.

47:03.621 --> 47:10.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Central African Republic
ranked last.

47:10.161 --> 47:23.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now: A new art exhibit explores
contemporary
life in the American West, as
seen through

47:23.340 --> 47:27.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the eyes of Latino artists and
their immigrant
experience.

47:27.344 --> 47:29.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is back with the
story from
Denver.

47:29.747 --> 47:35.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At the Denver Art
Museum recently,
an emotional moment for artist
Ramiro Gomez

47:35.953 --> 47:36.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and his parents.

47:36.954 --> 47:38.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm very proud of him.

47:38.789 --> 47:43.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He'd brought them
here to see
his newest work, called Lupita,
an installation

47:43.461 --> 47:46.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that pays homage to a janitor
who worked at
these galleries.

47:46.831 --> 47:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was particularly poignant.

47:49.633 --> 47:54.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gomez's parents themselves are
laborers, his
mother a janitor, his father a
truck driver.

47:54.739 --> 47:57.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMIRO GOMEZ, Artist: I wouldn't
be here without
their labor.

47:57.108 --> 47:59.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wouldn't be here without their
sacrifice.

47:59.510 --> 48:04.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Today, Gomez is
an up-and-coming
artist in Los Angeles featured
in galleries

48:04.415 --> 48:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and exhibitions for work that
captures a life
of work by immigrants and
others, not typically

48:10.154 --> 48:11.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the subject of art.

48:12.022 --> 48:15.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMIRO GOMEZ: It's important for
me to highlight
these people that are not going
to be recorded

48:15.993 --> 48:17.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our history.

48:17.795 --> 48:21.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In Denver, Gomez
was one of
13 young Mexican-American
artists chosen for

48:21.866 --> 48:28.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an exhibition called Mi Tierra,
their assignment,
to create a new work that
explores the idea

48:28.038 --> 48:31.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of home and place in the
American West.

48:31.175 --> 48:38.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were smaller paintings and
large installations,
videos about the land before
Europeans settled

48:38.249 --> 48:42.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, and a garden that looked
like a giant
pinata.

48:42.753 --> 48:46.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of the artists tackled the
politically
charged topic of immigration.

48:46.357 --> 48:50.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This piece contained an actual
panel of the
U.S.-Mexico border fence.

48:50.995 --> 48:56.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMIRO GOMEZ: For me, place
becomes a very
difficult word to focus on, just
because place

48:56.700 --> 48:58.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is never permanent.

48:58.702 --> 48:59.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're constantly moving.

49:00.004 --> 49:01.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's constantly shifting.

49:01.472 --> 49:05.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm an American-born child to
Mexican immigrants.

49:05.376 --> 49:07.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I'm at once Mexican and
American.

49:07.812 --> 49:09.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm in between.

49:09.647 --> 49:15.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That in-between space, that
in-between place
that I occupy is something that
is constantly

49:15.186 --> 49:16.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changing within myself.

49:16.987 --> 49:23.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dmitri
Obergfell's installation
reflects an internal identity
struggle.

49:23.594 --> 49:28.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was raised in Colorado by his
American
mother and was estranged from
his Mexican

49:28.399 --> 49:30.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
father until recently.

49:30.968 --> 49:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the museum, he recreated a
market typical
of many Latino neighborhoods in
Denver, one

49:36.974 --> 49:42.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that sells T-shirts, sculptures
of narco-saints
and praying hands with manicured
nails.

49:43.013 --> 49:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI OBERGFELL, Artist: The
reason I wanted
to explore this sort of theme in
this way

49:47.451 --> 49:52.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using, like, this market is
because I have
kind of always existed on the
perimeter of

49:52.756 --> 49:54.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Latino culture.

49:54.091 --> 49:55.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You feel
complicated when it
comes to identity?

49:56.026 --> 50:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DMITRI OBERGFELL: I think that
it would be
maybe in bad taste for me to
take this opportunity

50:01.999 --> 50:05.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and come into this exhibition
and say, OK,
I'm fully Latino now.

50:05.669 --> 50:10.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, for me, it was just about
exploring
and having this sort of
cathartic process

50:10.507 --> 50:13.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to work through these
complicated identity
ideas.

50:13.344 --> 50:18.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jaime Carrejo is
a professor
at Rocky Mountain College of Art
and a fourth-generation

50:18.949 --> 50:23.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American who grew up in the
border city of
El Paso, Texas.

50:23.454 --> 50:29.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He created his own border wall
with video
images of Mexico projected on
one side and

50:29.293 --> 50:31.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the U.S. on the other.

50:31.161 --> 50:32.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAIME CARREJO, Professor, Rocky
Mountain College
of Art: I'm really interested in
the construction

50:32.930 --> 50:39.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of divisiveness and how we use
that to make
people part of a group or
exclude them.

50:39.203 --> 50:47.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In making art, you can create
complex discussions
about complex issues, because
things don't

50:47.211 --> 50:48.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
exist in dualities.

50:48.746 --> 50:50.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's
interesting, because
there is a duality here, right?

50:50.714 --> 50:52.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's one country, and there's
another.

50:52.483 --> 50:55.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAIME CARREJO: You have the
dualities, but
the wall itself, because of the
reflective

50:55.419 --> 50:57.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
materials, they end up
collapsing on each
other.

50:57.788 --> 51:02.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There would be moments where the
image of
Mexico will be transcribed on
the image of

51:02.593 --> 51:03.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

51:03.627 --> 51:05.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have this whole different
landscape.

51:05.296 --> 51:10.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you end up with this complex
layering
and mix of an image, which I
think is the

51:10.768 --> 51:13.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
perfect metaphor of what it
means to be a
U.S. citizen of the United
States.

51:13.771 --> 51:20.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Landscape and two
worlds colliding
was also the focus for Daniela
Edburg, who's

51:20.277 --> 51:23.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lived her life back and forth in
both countries.

51:23.047 --> 51:29.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her piece, titled Uprooted,
featured a large
crocheted root and plant system
that weaves

51:29.787 --> 51:33.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
together photographs of
immigrants and images
from the Western terrain.

51:33.357 --> 51:36.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIELA EDBURG, Artist: I have
always had
this thing of being, like, of
two places.

51:37.027 --> 51:37.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Literally.

51:38.028 --> 51:39.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, that's how you grew up.

51:39.229 --> 51:41.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIELA EDBURG: Yes.

51:41.165 --> 51:46.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's how I grew up, you know,
with two languages,
two points of reference
culturally that are

51:46.236 --> 51:49.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
similar, but not the same.

51:49.440 --> 51:55.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my adulthood, I have found it
very comforting
to find connections between the
places through

51:55.746 --> 51:57.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the landscape.

51:57.581 --> 52:01.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How much are you
watching the
headlines and reading the news
in this context?

52:01.452 --> 52:05.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIELA EDBURG: Oh, well, of
course I'm watching
what's going on.

52:05.756 --> 52:10.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I -- and of course it
informs my work.

52:10.327 --> 52:15.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I am also talking about
stepping back
and looking at the bigger
picture.

52:15.733 --> 52:20.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The exhibition Mi
Tierra shows
through October.

52:20.371 --> 52:27.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the Denver Art Museum, I'm
Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS NewsHour."

52:28.012 --> 52:36.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: It's the first day of
spring, and that

52:36.620 --> 52:41.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
means more hours of sunlight
each day, and,
for some people, more sneezes.

52:41.525 --> 52:44.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why does just looking at the sun
trigger our
noses?

52:44.828 --> 52:49.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We explore this strange
phenomenon on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:49.233 --> 52:53.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, finally, a correction to
Friday night's
program.

52:53.570 --> 52:57.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In a report about carbon
emissions, we had
a missing word in the copy.

52:58.008 --> 53:02.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We reported that emissions fell
in the U.S.
and China in 2016.

53:02.613 --> 53:07.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we should have said that
that drop is
thanks to greater use of
renewable energy

53:07.251 --> 53:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and nuclear and gas power.

53:10.087 --> 53:15.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour" regrets the
error, and we thank
our alert audience members for
flagging it.

53:15.793 --> 53:17.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:17.161 --> 53:18.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:18.228 --> 53:20.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

53:20.631 --> 53:25.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Don't forget, you can tune in to
watch day
two of the Gorsuch confirmation
hearings.

53:25.502 --> 53:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's on our Web site and
social media platforms.

53:28.305 --> 53:31.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's starting tomorrow, 9:30
Eastern time.

53:31.642 --> 53:42.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
