kind of like the underdog of the
plant world,

00:42.743 --> 00:46.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the sense that people tend to
not really

02:07.661 --> 02:12.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

well, we strongly disapprove, we
really disagree,
we find those comments
disgusting, but we're

03:05.452 --> 03:06.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still endorsing him...

wave of damage, as floodwaters
began surging

03:57.003 --> 03:58.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

Tuesday night as they were
observing Ashura,

04:57.297 --> 05:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of the holiest days for Shia
Muslims.

05:00.133 --> 05:06.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

approach, a new option,
a new framework, a new program.

06:30.690 --> 06:36.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't tell you that it's going
to -- we're
going to be able to come out of
this meeting

06:36.663 --> 06:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certain that a cessation of
hostilities can
be had.

06:39.199 --> 06:44.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

07:02.289 --> 07:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It follows revelations that bank

07:07.360 --> 07:12.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, stocks were
mixed after minutes

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I talk with
Donald Trump's campaign manager,
with a top

07:33.186 --> 07:38.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton supporter, and with the
vice presidential
nominee of the Libertarian
Party; the national

07:38.892 --> 07:45.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversation on the sexual abuse
and harassment
women face; and how studying
moss led Portland,

07:45.999 --> 07:59.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oregon, to discover high levels
of air pollution.

07:59.913 --> 08:03.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return now to the race for
the White House,
and we begin with Donald Trump's
campaign

08:03.883 --> 08:06.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
manager, Kellyanne Conway.

Donald Trump hasn't been leading
nationally
since the end of July.

08:21.501 --> 08:28.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have state polls showing
where he's losing
support even in states that are
reliably Republican.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where do you see this race right
now?

KELLYANNE CONWAY, Trump Campaign
Manager:
So, the race right now is one
where we are

08:33.780 --> 08:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to try to start making up
the gap, Judy,
in terms of paid advertising.

08:38.184 --> 08:42.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been out-spent 7-1, 10-1
in some places
and even more.

08:42.455 --> 08:48.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we now have -- we have
budgeted for a
significant ad buy, particularly
in the 10

08:48.194 --> 08:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or 11 states where we see this
race headed.

08:50.764 --> 08:55.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be a variety of
states that President
Obama carried twice.

08:55.201 --> 09:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're trying to pierce that
Democratic blue
wall, which is a very real
concern for any

09:00.073 --> 09:02.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican presidential
candidate.

09:02.041 --> 09:06.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's also a matter of
candidate investment,
where Governor Pence and Mr.
Trump are spending

09:06.646 --> 09:07.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their days.

09:07.981 --> 09:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will also be focused on the
10 or 11
swing states.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then, finally, it's the nuts
and bolts.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's the brass tacks.

09:15.522 --> 09:20.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's always been, but just at a
fever pitch
now, working with the RNC to
beef up and build

09:20.693 --> 09:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out our ground game, our data
operation, our
field staff.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been a fairly impressive
collaboration.

09:27.267 --> 09:31.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we're just -- we're
moving people
around, some of our talented
folks in states

09:31.404 --> 09:35.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we look like we will win or
that Mrs.
Clinton will win, and we're
deploying people

09:35.909 --> 09:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into those 10 or 11 states.

09:37.777 --> 09:42.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, The Wall
Street Journal
reporting today that, in effect,
your campaign

09:42.415 --> 09:49.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has given up on getting voters
beyond the
base of the Republican Party,
that you're

09:49.088 --> 09:55.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focusing on that base, on
getting them out
and on depressing voters who are
committed

09:55.595 --> 09:56.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Hillary Clinton.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that the strategy you have
decided on?

09:59.532 --> 10:02.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: No, that would
actually
not be a winning strategy.

10:02.569 --> 10:06.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Of course, each of the
candidates has to excite
their base.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump's done a much
better job
of that.

10:08.975 --> 10:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He owns the enthusiasm, the
momentum, the
big crowds that you see every
day, Judy, at

10:12.946 --> 10:16.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these rallies, at these forums.

10:16.049 --> 10:20.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then he also is trying to
get those independents.

10:20.453 --> 10:26.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the goal for us is to
increase the number
of Republicans who are
supporting Mr. Trump.

10:26.326 --> 10:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the NBC News/Wall Street
Journal poll,
he's up at about 85 percent.

10:30.830 --> 10:31.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So is Mrs. Clinton.

10:31.831 --> 10:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Get that over 90 percent.

10:33.733 --> 10:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Get more of those independents,
of course,
women, millennials, some of
those harder-to-reach

10:38.004 --> 10:39.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
audiences.

10:39.806 --> 10:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But also we do see -- we do see
that Hillary
Clinton's having a hard time
enthusing her

10:44.077 --> 10:45.812 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
base.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has a very popular president
and first
lady out, the Obamas out there,
there trying

10:48.014 --> 10:52.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to campaign for her, but so far
their popularity
has not been transferable to
her.

10:52.418 --> 10:56.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You read all these articles
about the difficulty
her campaign is having enthusing
some of the

10:56.756 --> 10:58.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Obama coalition for her.

10:58.124 --> 11:00.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But don't you
also have a problem
with your base?

11:00.293 --> 11:04.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You now have a number of
prominent Republicans
who are saying they're not going
to support

11:04.364 --> 11:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump both in Congress
and among the
governors.

11:09.002 --> 11:12.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Isn't this a serious drag now on
the campaign?

11:12.272 --> 11:16.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: We have to
take the case
directly to the voters,
including in the states,

11:16.442 --> 11:18.211 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Judy.

11:18.244 --> 11:22.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would take note that, just
today, you
have a number of them, senators,
saying, well,

11:22.849 --> 11:26.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
OK, I changed my mind, I
actually am going
to vote for him, because what
happened in

11:26.586 --> 11:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the case of some of them, I
guess Joe Heck
in Nevada, Deb Fischer in
Nebraska, I saw

11:31.925 --> 11:36.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Thune in North Dakota, the
fourth highest
ranking senator for the
Republican Party majority

11:36.663 --> 11:43.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington, they all said,
well, yes, we're
going to support him, somewhat
side -- taking

11:43.836 --> 11:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a side -- a step backward from
what they had
said over the weekend.

11:47.507 --> 11:50.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think what happens is, they
hear from
some of their voters saying,
look, we want

11:50.743 --> 11:55.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you to support the presidential
nominee, and
we want you to run as a ticket.

11:55.081 --> 11:59.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So -- but, look, Donald Trump
just has to
take his case directly to the
voters, including

11:59.319 --> 12:03.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in states where the elected
officials say
that they're not going to
endorse him.

12:03.790 --> 12:07.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what is --
what we know
has turned off not only
Republican elected

12:07.760 --> 12:14.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials, but traditionally
Republican voters,
is that video/audiotape with
"Access Hollywood,"

12:14.834 --> 12:20.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where we heard Donald Trump
speaking of grabbing
a woman sexually.

12:20.773 --> 12:25.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard him speaking about
trying to have
sex with a married woman, about,
because you

12:25.745 --> 12:27.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are a celebrity, you can get
away with it.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You, Kellyanne Conway, have
children yourself.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Were you offended by that?

12:32.785 --> 12:34.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Yes.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wouldn't matter if I have
children or not.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It actually doesn't matter if
I'm a woman
or not.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Of course I was offended.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I agree with Donald Trump and
Melania Trump
and Mike Pence on this.

12:42.996 --> 12:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The comments are offensive and
reprehensible.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody had been asked to defend
them, and
nobody should.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm glad that Donald Trump
apologized.

12:51.504 --> 12:55.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was with him when it was
revealed that
this tape existed.

12:55.541 --> 13:03.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I saw immediately a man who
you saw publicly
apologizing, asking for
forgiveness, and then

13:03.416 --> 13:10.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also saying that he will resolve
to go forward
and continue to fight this
election on the

13:10.256 --> 13:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issues that he's been fighting
all along.

13:12.558 --> 13:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't -- he doesn't agree
with President
Obama and Hillary Clinton that
ISIS is in

13:17.096 --> 13:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retreat and they're the J.V.
team and our
-- quote -- "determined
enemies."

13:20.433 --> 13:24.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He doesn't agree with handing
over three or
four Supreme Court justice
nominations to

13:24.937 --> 13:29.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton or the domestic
economy, where
she has promised to raise taxes
and increase

13:29.275 --> 13:31.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
regulations.

13:31.144 --> 13:34.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He doesn't agree with her
position on Obamacare,
which has not helped millions of
Americans

13:34.847 --> 13:36.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it was intended to help.

13:36.649 --> 13:40.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, these
stories, though,
continue to come, The Washington
Post reporting

13:40.219 --> 13:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today about Donald Trump doing
an interview
with Howard Stern in 2005
talking about walking

13:45.024 --> 13:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in on the contestants at a Miss
USA Pageant
where they weren't dressed.

13:50.763 --> 13:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said, "I can do that
because I own
the pageant."

13:53.533 --> 13:59.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another story about -- today
about -- in the
late 1990s, walking in on
contestants at a

13:59.205 --> 14:01.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Miss Teen USA Pageant.

14:01.641 --> 14:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much more of this do you
think is there
out there?

14:05.078 --> 14:06.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: I don't know.

14:06.813 --> 14:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do know that, to be fair,
because I
just never -- frankly, you just
don't see

14:11.184 --> 14:13.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the equal coverage,
respectfully.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do know what Hillary Clinton
was doing all
those decades also.

14:16.823 --> 14:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she's been lying then and
she is lying
now.

14:19.325 --> 14:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the idea that we're not
going to talk
about what she was doing in the
1990s, including

14:24.163 --> 14:29.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
naming and shaming these women
in her husband's
lives, the way she treated women
all then,

14:29.869 --> 14:34.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the way she lied about
Whitewater, the way
she lied about being under
sniper fire in

14:34.741 --> 14:39.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bosnia, the way she lied to the
Benghazi families,
I mean, she has a real veracity
problem, Judy.

14:39.879 --> 14:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that voters believe
honesty and
trustworthiness is also a
qualification for

14:47.186 --> 14:49.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

14:49.088 --> 14:51.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many voters don't think she
is qualified
or she is fit, based on her
record as secretary

14:51.791 --> 14:55.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of state, based on her
unremarkable record
as a United States senator, and
based on her

14:55.161 --> 14:56.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
casual relationship with the
truth.

14:56.963 --> 15:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's important for
us to talk
about both candidates and their
vulnerabilities.

15:01.501 --> 15:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just simply don't see it from
a sheer content
analysis day by day.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quick last
question.

15:07.039 --> 15:11.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A voter at a Mike Pence rally
yesterday said,
"If Hillary Clinton wins this
election, we

15:11.644 --> 15:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
need to have a revolution."

15:12.845 --> 15:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, "No, that's wrong, we
don't."

15:16.849 --> 15:18.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does Donald Trump see that?

15:18.384 --> 15:20.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Well, I agree
with Governor
Pence.

15:20.653 --> 15:25.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm so glad that he had the
presence of
mind to say that, meaning,
sometimes, you're

15:25.291 --> 15:27.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a rally, you don't really
hear what people
say completely.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm so glad Governor Pence
immediately told
her no.

15:30.029 --> 15:31.764 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I echo that.

15:31.798 --> 15:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will tell you that Donald
Trump has
said time and again that he
wants to win,

15:35.301 --> 15:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wants to be the president of
the United
States to enact all this change
and disrupt

15:38.871 --> 15:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington, Judy, but if he
doesn't win, he
will support Hillary Clinton as
the president.

15:42.909 --> 15:43.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We all will.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We love this country.

15:45.411 --> 15:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our love for the country and
its people
transcends partisan politics.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's very clear.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I will tell you, over the
next four weeks
or so, less now, we will be
fighting, leaving

15:54.620 --> 15:57.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it all on the field, to win this
election.

15:57.456 --> 16:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Hillary Clinton prevails,
then we will
respect that and we will work
with her as

16:01.160 --> 16:02.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
president of the United States.

16:02.929 --> 16:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kellyanne Conway,
who is the
campaign manager for Donald
Trump, we thank

16:06.899 --> 16:07.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you very much.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY: Thank you,
Judy.

16:09.535 --> 16:12.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
to a supporter
of Secretary Clinton.

16:13.005 --> 16:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Guy Cecil is the co-chair and
chief strategist
at Priorities USA.

16:17.510 --> 16:20.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a Democratic political
action committee,
or a super PAC.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Guy Cecil, thank you for being
with us.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUY CECIL, PRIORITIES USA
ACTION: Thanks for
having me.

16:23.382 --> 16:26.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Kellyanne
Conway says there
is a clear path for Donald Trump
to win this

16:26.085 --> 16:27.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

16:27.887 --> 16:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going after the, she
said, 10 or 11
states that Barack Obama won,
states that

16:31.858 --> 16:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they think they can peel away
from the Democrats.

16:33.926 --> 16:34.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Do you see that?

16:34.927 --> 16:36.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GUY CECIL: I don't.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think it's incredibly
difficult, for a couple
of reasons.

16:38.831 --> 16:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number one, when you take a look
at the battleground
states, they are states that are
rich in diversity,

16:43.936 --> 16:47.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
high percentages of
African-Americans, of
young people, of Hispanics.

16:47.607 --> 16:51.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's going to be very
difficult for Donald
Trump to make a case to those
voters.

16:51.143 --> 16:56.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's also true that, in
battleground states
like Virginia and Colorado and
North Carolina,

16:56.849 --> 17:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a higher percentage than the
national average
are white college-educated
voters.

17:01.087 --> 17:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the first time in 40
years, a Democrat
is actually leading among those
voters in

17:06.292 --> 17:07.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the polls.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so there are quite a few
paths for Hillary
to become the nominee.

17:10.496 --> 17:15.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She starts out with an Electoral
College advantage,
and the reality is, there is a
very narrow

17:15.534 --> 17:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
path, almost impossible path for
Donald Trump
to be successful.

17:18.037 --> 17:22.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She did make the
point that
there is a lack of enthusiasm,
though, on

17:22.208 --> 17:25.177 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Democratic side for Hillary
Clinton.

17:25.211 --> 17:29.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't see voters as excited
as they were
for Barack Obama.

17:29.815 --> 17:34.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, I was in Georgia two
weekends ago,
in North Carolina this week.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't see -- you certainly
do see support
for Hillary Clinton.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some of it is not as
enthusiastic.

17:40.526 --> 17:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you deal with that?

17:41.594 --> 17:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GUY CECIL: I do think some of
that is changing.

17:43.362 --> 17:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Hillary was at a rally
in Ohio just
this week where 18,000 people
showed up.

17:47.733 --> 17:52.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, more concretely, when you
take a look
at states where there are
absentee ballots

17:52.571 --> 17:57.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or early voting or voter
registration still
going on, you actually see the
results of

17:57.543 --> 17:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
increased enthusiasm among
Democrats.

17:59.712 --> 18:04.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, there's been a
significant increase
among African-Americans pulling
an absentee

18:04.150 --> 18:05.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ballot request in North
Carolina.

18:05.952 --> 18:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time in history,
there are more
registered Democrats in Colorado
than there

18:10.489 --> 18:12.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are Republicans.

18:12.391 --> 18:17.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're seeing in Ohio today
lines in early
vote locations that are in
typically Democratic

18:17.163 --> 18:18.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
areas.

18:18.998 --> 18:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I know that there was a
hangover from
both primaries, but, as we get
closer to the

18:21.701 --> 18:25.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election and our voters are
starting to tune
in, you're seeing the enthusiasm
gap drop

18:26.005 --> 18:27.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between the two campaigns.

18:27.707 --> 18:31.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Guy Cecil, is
there a danger,
though, at this point of
overconfidence?

18:31.544 --> 18:35.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're reading today that Hillary
Clinton,
that her campaign is putting
resources or

18:35.581 --> 18:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
planning to put resources into
traditionally
red states like Georgia, like
Utah.

18:42.054 --> 18:47.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that a sign -- could that be
too much confidence
about how this election is
going?

18:47.626 --> 18:49.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GUY CECIL: No.

18:49.428 --> 18:52.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Look, if you look at the
operations that are
actually on the ground in the
battleground

18:52.665 --> 18:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
states, the Clinton campaign has
it covered.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't mean there is not
more work to
do.

18:57.069 --> 19:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there was a New York Times
story just
this morning that said that
Republican polls

19:01.674 --> 19:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually show Hillary Clinton
leading today
in Georgia.

19:04.910 --> 19:07.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I expect we will see polls show
her leading
in Arizona.

19:07.480 --> 19:12.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, from my perspective, we
should be
expanding the map as
significantly as possible.

19:12.184 --> 19:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think that's in marked
contrast to
where the Republicans are
currently playing.

19:16.655 --> 19:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are defending a lot of
territory they
absolutely must win, states like
Utah, for

19:21.527 --> 19:22.928 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
example.

19:22.962 --> 19:23.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You don't think
there is a
danger of overconfidence?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GUY CECIL: No.

19:25.798 --> 19:29.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Democrats typically
operate in one
condition, and that is abject
panic about

19:29.635 --> 19:31.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the election.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I suspect, even though we're
having a
pretty good week, that it will
continue that

19:34.006 --> 19:35.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way through the next four.

19:35.775 --> 19:39.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about
something else,
Guy Cecil, that Kellyanne Conway
brought up?

19:39.345 --> 19:44.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, when I asked her
about the tape
involving, the audiotape, the
"Access Hollywood"

19:44.450 --> 19:48.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- involving Donald Trump, she
brought up
what she described and what many
describe

19:48.220 --> 19:53.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a lack of honest on the part
of Hillary
Clinton, about -- she talked
about naming

19:53.259 --> 19:58.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and shaming women when it comes
to Bill Clinton's
infidelities back in the 1990s
and since,

19:58.631 --> 19:59.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about Whitewater.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She brought up a number of
things.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much of a liability is that
for Hillary
Clinton?

20:03.903 --> 20:07.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, the polls show
trustworthiness continues
to be an issue for her.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GUY CECIL: Sure.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, first of all, I think you
can look at
the past as prologue.

20:12.311 --> 20:15.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of these same attacks were
tried against
Bill Clinton.

20:15.548 --> 20:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And 1998 was the only year that
a second-term
president didn't actually lose
seats in Congress.

20:21.921 --> 20:22.888 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

20:22.922 --> 20:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Because these attacks don't
work.

20:24.723 --> 20:28.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea that you would
attack a woman
for the mistakes of her husband
and that the

20:28.561 --> 20:33.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
messenger of that attack would
be Donald Trump,
who has spent the last
year-and-a-half lying

20:33.199 --> 20:36.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the American people, I think
it's just
not a realistic argument.

20:36.702 --> 20:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump is certainly not the
right messenger
to carry that argument to the
American people.

20:41.340 --> 20:46.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, meantime,
we have what
appears to be a daily or
every-other-day leaking

20:46.645 --> 20:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from -- a publication of e-mails
from WikiLeaks
from the Clinton campaign, from
-- and the

20:54.420 --> 20:59.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most recent ones, John Podesta,
the campaign
chairman.

20:59.558 --> 21:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw some of the language
today had to do
with a Clinton campaign staffer
communicating

21:04.897 --> 21:10.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with people at the Department of
Justice about
the e-mail -- Hillary Clinton's
e-mail problem

21:10.035 --> 21:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while she was secretary of
state, language
about Catholics, evangelical
Christians.

21:14.406 --> 21:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isn't this a constant drag on
the campaign's
ability to get its story out?

21:20.146 --> 21:23.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUY CECIL: Well, I think it's
important to
take one step back on this
point, which is

21:23.516 --> 21:28.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that you have a foreign
government that is
trying to interfere with our
elections, number

21:28.187 --> 21:30.089 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number two, the campaign, nor
the press has
actually validated that these
particular e-mails

21:33.225 --> 21:34.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are entirely true.

21:34.860 --> 21:38.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think it's important to
look at this
with some degree of caution.

21:38.330 --> 21:43.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, even if you were to say
that they
were all true, the conversations
over e-mail

21:43.435 --> 21:48.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between campaign staffers pales
in comparison
to what we have seen revealed
about Donald

21:48.474 --> 21:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump just over the course of
the last two
weeks.

21:50.576 --> 21:55.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton rolled out this
week a plan
that would increase credits for
child care,

21:55.915 --> 22:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would allow poor people to
access child
care so they can get out of
their condition

22:01.520 --> 22:03.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and find jobs.

22:03.355 --> 22:09.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, Donald Trump
is talking
about Bill Clinton, talking
about Paul Ryan,

22:09.328 --> 22:11.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about things that the
American people
don't care about.

22:11.497 --> 22:16.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, ultimately, I believe Donald
Trump will
never allow this election to be
anything other

22:16.302 --> 22:18.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than a referendum on Donald
Trump.

22:18.137 --> 22:23.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Guy Cecil, the
chief strategist
at Priorities USA, thank you for
being here.

22:23.609 --> 22:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUY CECIL: Thanks for having me.

22:25.544 --> 22:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Appreciate it.

22:27.379 --> 22:31.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And two -- we know two former
governors make
up another ticket, the
Libertarian ticket,

22:31.717 --> 22:36.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this year's election, Gary
Johnson of New
Mexico, and his running mate,
Bill Weld of

22:36.322 --> 22:38.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Massachusetts.

22:38.090 --> 22:41.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with Governor Weld a
short time ago,
and began by asking if he sees a
realistic

22:41.760 --> 22:43.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
path to the presidency for their
ticket.

22:43.662 --> 22:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL WELD, Libertarian Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Well, the only way we could run
the table

22:46.365 --> 22:52.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is if we somehow become catnip
for the national
news media in the everyday saga
of reporting

22:52.838 --> 22:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the presidential election and
our role
in that.

22:56.375 --> 23:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're doing everything we
can to get our
name recognition up from 35
percent to 60

23:02.181 --> 23:03.716 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

23:03.749 --> 23:07.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We think, if that happens, our
ballot position
might go up to 20, 25 percent.

23:07.119 --> 23:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at that point, we would be
very dangerous,
because we would be the ticket
with the momentum.

23:12.291 --> 23:17.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a long putt, but we are
honor-bound
to undertake that.

23:17.363 --> 23:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a fascinating election all
around.

23:19.031 --> 23:20.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That, it is.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you're acknowledging it's a
long shot.

23:22.001 --> 23:22.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BILL WELD: Sure.

23:23.002 --> 23:24.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

23:24.803 --> 23:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you said,
Governor Weld,
last week to The Boston Globe
that you are

23:26.639 --> 23:32.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be focusing exclusively
for the rest
of this campaign on criticizing
Donald Trump,

23:32.544 --> 23:35.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making sure voters know what
Donald Trump
stands for.

23:35.748 --> 23:40.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That sounds like you're
campaigning to make
sure he doesn't get elected more
than you

23:40.185 --> 23:42.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are to make sure Gary Johnson
gets...

23:42.388 --> 23:47.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL WELD: I'm not sure I used
the word exclusively,
but I said that he would have my
full attention.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.894 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And he does.

23:48.927 --> 23:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now, after the events of the
last few
days with the tape involving
women coming

23:54.099 --> 24:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, that kind of focuses a lot
of people's
attention on that aspect of Mr.
Trump's character,

24:00.339 --> 24:02.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
if you will.

24:02.074 --> 24:06.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it suggests to us that, if
we want to
go hunting where the ducks are,
the softer

24:06.478 --> 24:12.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes may be the Republican
votes that, to
this point, have been adhering
to Mr. Trump.

24:12.217 --> 24:18.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact of the matter is,
Mr. Trump has
set his sights absolutely
against everything

24:19.024 --> 24:21.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the Republican Party
historically has stood
for.

24:21.060 --> 24:25.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it sounds
like, in reading
what you have been saying last
week and before

24:25.798 --> 24:31.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, that, push comes to shove,
Hillary Clinton
is much more acceptable to you,
if there can't

24:31.870 --> 24:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a Libertarian in the White
House, than
Donald Trump.

24:34.373 --> 24:37.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL WELD: Yes, I have been
trying not to
answer that question, because
you don't want

24:37.276 --> 24:39.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be seem to be folding your
tent.

24:39.044 --> 24:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Gary and I are in this to do
everything
we can, including win it if
fortune could

24:44.116 --> 24:45.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- should favor us.

24:45.951 --> 24:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, no, I have made no bones
about the fact
from the get-go that I think
there is a big

24:49.788 --> 24:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difference between Donald Trump
and Hillary
Clinton.

24:53.058 --> 24:54.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Never said otherwise.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you have said
that she's
the most experienced person
maybe to ever

24:57.463 --> 24:59.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seek the presidency.

24:59.198 --> 25:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL WELD: Well, I said that I'm
not sure
there's anybody more qualified
-- and I should

25:03.035 --> 25:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have said on paper -- than Mrs.
Clinton.

25:05.070 --> 25:09.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think I went on to say I would
still vote
for Gary Johnson because of the
decisions

25:09.942 --> 25:15.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would make in areas like the
budget, fiscal
policy and military policy.

25:15.114 --> 25:20.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, she's certainly
qualified, after
eight years of Senate and four
years as secretary

25:20.986 --> 25:22.788 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of state.

25:22.821 --> 25:26.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To suggest that she's not
well-qualified by
position and background to be
president of

25:26.158 --> 25:28.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the United States is to
misstate.

25:28.527 --> 25:33.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking of
qualification,
your running mate has gotten a
lot of attention

25:33.599 --> 25:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the last few weeks with
some statements,
misstatements about foreign
policy, leading

25:39.538 --> 25:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the experts to observe that
either he wasn't
prepared or just not
knowledgeable about foreign

25:45.644 --> 25:46.578 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

25:46.612 --> 25:48.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did you talk to him after these
incidents?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BILL WELD: Oh, sure.

25:50.315 --> 25:54.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Gary feels terrible
about making the
fluffs, because he feels he's
let people down.

25:54.453 --> 25:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I know for a fact that, when
he didn't
copy on the word Aleppo, it's
because he wasn't

25:59.892 --> 26:01.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aware that it was even a place
name.

26:01.493 --> 26:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He thought Mike Barnicle was
asking him about
some acronym.

26:04.363 --> 26:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, at the end of the
day, prior
to that incident, he had been
very knowledgeably

26:10.469 --> 26:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversing about Syria policy
and pretty much
nailed it, I thought, too many
rebel groups.

26:15.374 --> 26:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, watch out, or you are
going to have
unintended consequences.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to do a cease-fire with
the Russians.

26:20.779 --> 26:22.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then that's exactly what
happened.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, it blew up
because of the
bombings.

26:24.049 --> 26:27.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Boston Globe
also reported
last week, Governor Weld, that
you talked

26:27.686 --> 26:32.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about wanting to be in a
position to rebuild
your former home, the Republican
Party, after

26:32.724 --> 26:34.660 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this election.

26:34.693 --> 26:37.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL WELD: I think it would be
very interesting
to be a part of the dialogue,
with my Libertarian

26:37.996 --> 26:42.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hat on, as to what's going to
happen after
the Republican Party splits in
two.

26:42.534 --> 26:46.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there is going to be a
schism there
either in this cycle or before
the next cycle,

26:46.305 --> 26:49.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just as what happened to the
Whig Party in
the 19th century.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what do you
make of what's
going on?

26:51.343 --> 26:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, right now, the speaker
of the House
of Representatives, a
Republican, Paul Ryan,

26:56.081 --> 26:58.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is saying he won't campaign for
Donald Trump.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILL WELD: Well, that shouldn't
be a surprise.

27:00.052 --> 27:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, after the -- after the
last election
of 2012, Reince Priebus and Paul
Ryan and

27:05.524 --> 27:10.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all the party elders got
together and said,
OK, next time, we have got to
focus on the

27:10.062 --> 27:15.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
message of free trade, outreach
to the Hispanic
community, much more inclusion
of women, much

27:15.667 --> 27:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more attention to communities of
color and
communities of every other
ethnicity.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much of that has Donald
Trump done?

27:22.140 --> 27:23.108 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nothing.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's done 180 degrees the
opposite.

27:24.943 --> 27:28.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what do you
think happens
to the Republican Party if
Donald Trump...

27:28.514 --> 27:30.249 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

27:30.282 --> 27:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL WELD: I think the Trump
wing goes the
way of the Know-Nothing Party of
the 1850s,

27:33.552 --> 27:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which, like the Trump wing, was
founded on
anti-immigrant fervor or
prejudice and conspiracy

27:40.125 --> 27:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
theories and violent rallies.

27:41.627 --> 27:46.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It looks like a carbon copy of
the old Know-Nothing
Party.

27:46.131 --> 27:49.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what happened -- the
interesting question
is, what happens to the rest of
the party?

27:49.968 --> 27:55.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can it kind of come to its
senses and rally
and elect Abraham Lincoln three
years later,

27:55.274 --> 27:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is what happened when the
Whigs split
up?

27:57.509 --> 28:01.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whatever happens
on Election
Day, do you see this country
coming together

28:01.280 --> 28:03.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after this election?

28:03.181 --> 28:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL WELD: It is going to be
tough, particularly
with Mr. Trump threatening to --
threatening

28:06.618 --> 28:08.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mrs. Clinton with jail.

28:08.387 --> 28:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think she's enough of
a big person
so that she certainly would make
an effort

28:13.191 --> 28:15.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to have the country come
together.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have no doubt of that.

28:17.629 --> 28:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It might be a little bit harder
to say you
should go on bended knee to the
Donald.

28:22.134 --> 28:24.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't see that happening.

28:24.069 --> 28:28.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But just last
question, you're
all out for the Libertarian
ticket until Election

28:28.707 --> 28:29.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day?

28:29.708 --> 28:30.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BILL WELD: Yes, I am.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I will have comments on
this and that.

28:32.444 --> 28:33.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We may even rent a hall.

28:33.812 --> 28:37.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's going to be a very
interesting four
weeks.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think we will have an
impact.

28:39.084 --> 28:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my hope is, we will have an
impact on
those Republican voters and be
able to peel

28:43.722 --> 28:46.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them away from Mr. Trump.

28:46.058 --> 28:50.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former Governor
Bill Weld of
Massachusetts, the vice
presidential nominee

28:50.529 --> 28:52.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Libertarian Party, we
thank you.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BILL WELD: Thanks, Judy.

28:54.433 --> 29:00.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online, take a
detailed look
at the trend lines shaping up in
the swing

29:00.038 --> 29:03.342 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

29:03.375 --> 29:13.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

29:13.151 --> 29:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost a week after its release,
the leaked
tape of Donald Trump boasting of
sexually

29:17.923 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harassing and assaulting women
continues to
raise issues that go well beyond
presidential

29:23.929 --> 29:24.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
politics.

29:24.930 --> 29:26.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has that story.

29:26.064 --> 29:27.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BILLY BUSH, "Access Hollywood":
Yes.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The Donald has scored!

29:28.500 --> 29:30.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Whoa, my man!

29:30.268 --> 29:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The impact of this
2005 tape of
Donald Trump and NBC personality
Billy Bush

29:36.408 --> 29:39.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has gone far beyond politics.

29:39.277 --> 29:43.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's sparked a national
discussion over misogyny
and sexual assault.

29:43.815 --> 29:50.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I better use some Tic Tacs, just
in case I

29:51.023 --> 29:53.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
start kissing her.

29:53.592 --> 29:54.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I'm automatically
attracted to beautiful
-- I just start kissing them.

29:54.593 --> 29:55.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's like a magnet.

29:55.594 --> 29:56.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I just kiss.

29:56.595 --> 29:57.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't even wait.

29:57.596 --> 29:58.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, when you're a star they let
you do it.

29:58.597 --> 29:59.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can do anything.

29:59.598 --> 30:00.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILLY BUSH: Whatever you want.

30:00.766 --> 30:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Grab them by the
(EXPLETIVE
DELETED).

30:01.600 --> 30:02.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

30:02.601 --> 30:04.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I can do anything.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: While Trump
apologized for the
remarks during Sunday night's
debate, he also

30:06.471 --> 30:08.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tried to dismiss them.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Certainly, I'm not
proud of
it.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this is locker room talk.

30:12.044 --> 30:16.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He also raised
decades-old accusations
against his opponent's husband,
former President

30:16.848 --> 30:17.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bill Clinton.

30:17.983 --> 30:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Mine are words,
and his was
action.

30:20.085 --> 30:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His was what he's done to women.

30:21.920 --> 30:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hours before, the
Republican nominee
appeared with women who have
accused Bill

30:25.757 --> 30:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton of sexual misconduct.

30:28.427 --> 30:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
None of those accusations, it
should be said,
have ever resulted in any
criminal charges.

30:33.632 --> 30:38.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This all comes amid a heightened
sensitivity
about sexual assault and
violence.

30:38.570 --> 30:43.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's the pending trial of
comedian Bill
Cosby on sexual assault charges
in Pennsylvania

30:43.742 --> 30:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and other similar allegations
against him.

30:46.611 --> 30:51.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was the furor over the
six-month
jail sentence handed earlier
this year to

30:51.216 --> 30:56.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Brock Turner, a Stanford
University swimmer
who was convicted of sexually
assaulting an

30:56.521 --> 30:58.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unconscious woman.

30:58.590 --> 31:02.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some Trump supporters have
suggested that
the reaction to the Trump tape
is overblown.

31:02.461 --> 31:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT BAIO, Actor: And ladies
out there, this
is what guys talk about when
you're not around.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, if you're offended by it,
grow up.

31:11.503 --> 31:15.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But the tape prompted
an avalanche
of reaction on social media.

31:15.874 --> 31:20.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Author Kelly Oxford shared her
own sexual
assault experience, and
encouraged others

31:20.679 --> 31:21.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do the same.

31:21.747 --> 31:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her callout swiftly went viral.

31:24.516 --> 31:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 30 million people have
either left
a response or visited her
Twitter page since

31:29.287 --> 31:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Friday night, a nationwide
catharsis of painful
experiences.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now for more on this, Kelly
Oxford joins
us now from Burbank, California,
along with

31:39.898 --> 31:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anita Hill, who accused Supreme
Court Justice
Clarence Thomas of sexual
harassment during

31:44.803 --> 31:46.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his confirmation hearings.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hill is now a law professor at
Brandeis University.

31:48.940 --> 31:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here in the studio, Mike
Wise, senior
writer for ESPN's "The
Undefeated."

31:53.845 --> 31:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kelly, let me start with you.

31:56.148 --> 32:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I look through your Twitter
feed, you have
now got the hashtag #NotOkay for
people telling

32:03.488 --> 32:05.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their stories.

32:05.323 --> 32:10.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really is quite amazing to
see the volume
and kinds of experiences people
are talking

32:10.362 --> 32:11.463 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

32:11.496 --> 32:13.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What has struck you about this
response?

32:13.598 --> 32:16.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KELLY OXFORD, Author,
"Everything Is Perfect
When You're a Liar": You know,
people have

32:16.535 --> 32:19.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
desperate need to discuss this
topic.

32:19.971 --> 32:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I created the hashtag
#NotOkay because
I knew the volume of people
coming in would

32:25.544 --> 32:28.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be extremely large.

32:28.280 --> 32:33.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm not shocked by how many
people are
coming forward.

32:33.685 --> 32:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a lot of women discuss
this with each
other.

32:37.823 --> 32:42.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of women have sexual
assault and rape
in their families, their
grandmothers, their

32:42.194 --> 32:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mothers, their aunts, their
sisters.

32:44.462 --> 32:50.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Internet is a place
where everybody
has a voice and everybody can
contribute.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's happening.

32:52.337 --> 32:53.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's happening right now.

32:53.738 --> 32:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been five days and women
are continuing
to send me stories.

32:58.143 --> 33:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What do you think
this says about
our culture, that there is so
much response

33:03.782 --> 33:04.850 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to this?

33:04.883 --> 33:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLY OXFORD: It says that women
are being
abused.

33:08.386 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's such an overwhelmingly huge
problem that
we ignore it, as we often do
when things are

33:16.261 --> 33:18.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this large.

33:18.129 --> 33:23.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Professor Hill, it's
been 25 years
now since you gave your
testimony in the Russell

33:23.935 --> 33:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Caucus Room up on Capitol Hill
in the Senate.

33:26.638 --> 33:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you listen to Kelly talk
about the response
she's gotten, what strikes you?

33:33.511 --> 33:34.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your response?

33:34.479 --> 33:36.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you thinking?

33:36.281 --> 33:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANITA HILL, Brandeis University:
Well, the
first thing I thought was that,
25 years ago,

33:40.819 --> 33:46.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people actually said that they
had no idea
that sexual harassment was a
problem.

33:46.591 --> 33:56.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm also -- but I'm struck
that Ms. Oxford
says that she understands and
knows about

33:56.034 --> 34:01.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this problem, you know, of
sexual assault,
because when the wave of
students started

34:02.007 --> 34:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protesting the problem on
college campuses,
people, detractors accused them
of inflating

34:10.482 --> 34:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the numbers of assaults that
women experience.

34:15.053 --> 34:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the great service of
this hashtag
is to get these stories out, so
that we can

34:22.494 --> 34:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debunk this idea that this is an
infrequent
problem, and that it's not, in
fact, quite

34:30.368 --> 34:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
severe and quite pervasive.

34:32.203 --> 34:37.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Professor, you
say, 25 years
ago, people -- it really did
spark some of

34:37.909 --> 34:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first discussions about
sexual harassment
in the workplace and in other
places.

34:43.515 --> 34:49.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The kind of response that Ms.
Oxford is getting,
how does that compare to the
kind of response

34:49.054 --> 34:50.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you were getting?

34:50.522 --> 34:57.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANITA HILL: Well, we didn't have
social media
25 years ago.

34:57.128 --> 35:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so most of what I got were
letters.

35:01.366 --> 35:04.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I got a lot of letters, and I
still get them.

35:04.402 --> 35:12.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the problems and the
behaviors range from
verbal sexual harassment to
physical assaults,

35:12.544 --> 35:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether it's in the workplace or
on the streets
or in schools.

35:15.981 --> 35:19.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So this is really a social
problem.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It can appear in any arena.

35:21.786 --> 35:28.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the response also is
different in
terms of people saying, be much
more skeptical.

35:28.860 --> 35:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people may not know the
extent of
sexual assault, but I think,
after this discussion

35:35.734 --> 35:41.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is over, I hope that at least
people will
not deny that it happens at all.

35:41.506 --> 35:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also hope that, when we
start talking
about these issues, that we can
start from

35:47.912 --> 35:55.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a premise that women are valued
as much as
the men who accost and assault
them.

35:55.453 --> 35:57.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that has not always been the
premise.

35:57.522 --> 36:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mike, it's being
dismissed -- or
Donald Trump and his supporters
are just saying

36:03.361 --> 36:04.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is locker room talk.

36:04.396 --> 36:05.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIKE WISE, ESPN: Yes.

36:05.397 --> 36:06.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: You're a
sportswriter.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been in locker rooms, a
lot of locker
rooms, over the years.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MIKE WISE: Yes.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Is this locker room
talk?

36:11.970 --> 36:16.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE WISE: Well, none of the
ball players
I know, maybe other than Bill
Bradley, were

36:16.307 --> 36:17.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
actually running for office.

36:17.575 --> 36:20.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we might expect more of our
leaders.

36:20.612 --> 36:24.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think locker room talk is
an awful excuse
in some ways.

36:24.482 --> 36:30.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saying it's just locker room
talk are like
the people that commit crimes
and say, he's

36:30.588 --> 36:32.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
only human.

36:32.557 --> 36:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, that means you have a
larger neural
cortex than most animals that
operate on instincts.

36:36.928 --> 36:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think we need to get
out of this
locker room talk culture.

36:40.465 --> 36:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it's as pervasive
as it used
to be.

36:42.901 --> 36:51.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, still, I have heard some of
the filth,
misogyny, racism, crude jokes
that went beyond

36:51.109 --> 36:52.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dirty.

36:52.911 --> 36:58.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, until we address
that problem,
that it's just locker room talk,
well, no,

36:58.416 --> 37:00.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's where you worship arrested
development.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're still a boy.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's all get into the 21st
century and become
men.

37:05.990 --> 37:07.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Kelly Oxford, what
about that?

37:07.759 --> 37:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a danger in dismissing
it as locker
room talk, as saying that there
are places

37:12.730 --> 37:13.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where this is acceptable?

37:13.965 --> 37:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KELLY OXFORD: Yes.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No, it's not acceptable
anywhere.

37:17.602 --> 37:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Women have only had the vote for
less than
100 years.

37:22.407 --> 37:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before that, we were wives and
essentially
kind of property.

37:27.579 --> 37:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We grew up, and our parents
wanted us to get
married, so somebody else could
look after

37:31.082 --> 37:32.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in the last few decades,
it's changed.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can now have families without
men.

37:37.622 --> 37:44.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, unfortunately, the
dialogue, the old
boys club, the locker room talk,
has mysteriously

37:44.963 --> 37:46.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not changed at all.

37:46.664 --> 37:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Professor Hill,
what's your take
on that?

37:48.600 --> 37:54.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANITA HILL: Well, and I would
just say -- well,
I would just say to this idea
that it's just

37:54.506 --> 37:59.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
locker room talk, I think that's
just another
one of those lame excuses that
are given.

37:59.377 --> 38:05.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, you could say,
oh, it was
just a joke, or, you know, can't
you take

38:05.550 --> 38:10.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a joke, or it really wasn't that
hard, it
wasn't all that bad.

38:10.255 --> 38:18.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's just a way of
diminishing the value
of women and excusing illegal
behavior.

38:18.096 --> 38:27.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I don't know that anyone
actually takes
that seriously, but I do hear
over and over

38:27.172 --> 38:32.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people saying, well, it was just
this or it's
just that, as though it's the
woman's fault

38:32.677 --> 38:36.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for complaining about being
sexually assaulted.

38:36.648 --> 38:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, again, what we
have to go
back and think about is, from
whose perspective

38:41.452 --> 38:44.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are we going to move forward on
this?

38:44.355 --> 38:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are we going to continue to use
language like
this to protect abusers?

38:49.861 --> 38:57.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we going to continue to give
them slaps
on the wrist, when we know that
they have

38:57.435 --> 38:59.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
committed these acts?

38:59.237 --> 39:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or are we actually going to
value women in
the way we say we do and punish
people when

39:06.978 --> 39:12.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they participate in what is
severe and pervasive
and an extensive problem?

39:12.984 --> 39:19.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE WISE: Professor Hill hits
it right on
the head, John, that if we don't
get into

39:19.190 --> 39:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a culture of examining how this
is wrong,
when you go to a debate a few
days later,

39:26.130 --> 39:30.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you show up on the stage and
your first
response is, it's just words, I
think that's

39:30.868 --> 39:32.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very dangerous.

39:32.737 --> 39:37.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, while there are a
lot of people
out -- I don't -- I would never
mitigate anybody

39:37.842 --> 39:43.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who commits sexual assault, but
I would say
that those people will be found
out eventually.

39:43.214 --> 39:47.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some ways, I'm really more
worried about
the enabling culture we have
that it's so

39:47.986 --> 39:53.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
permissive to say these things
and to say,
oh, we're too politically
correct today.

39:53.825 --> 39:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And until we get into a mind-set
of, no, that's
wrong and the friends around you
that are

39:59.664 --> 40:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supposed to tell you what you
need to hear,
other than what you want to
hear, tell you

40:03.101 --> 40:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's wrong, we're going to still
have this
kind of culture.

40:06.170 --> 40:08.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANITA HILL: This is a pivotal
moment, though.

40:08.106 --> 40:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question is, how much
farther along
are we going to move?

40:12.310 --> 40:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many women are harassed, one in
three between
the ages of 18 and 34, by one
poll.

40:18.650 --> 40:28.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need to figure out if, in
fact, we
are going to enable them to come
forward with

40:28.259 --> 40:34.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their complaints, as opposed to
enabling harassers
and abusers to continue their
behavior.

40:34.832 --> 40:38.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Where do you want to
see this discussion
go, Professor Hill?

40:38.036 --> 40:40.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You say it's a pivotal point.

40:40.371 --> 40:41.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It started a discussion.

40:41.839 --> 40:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where should it go from here?

40:43.708 --> 40:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANITA HILL: Well, it should go
really in spelling
out of, what is it like to
experience these

40:53.151 --> 40:54.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems?

40:54.919 --> 41:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why Ms. Oxford's
Twitter feed is
so important, because it's
getting it out

41:00.425 --> 41:01.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

41:01.426 --> 41:02.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's getting the stories out.

41:02.427 --> 41:05.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was really important 25
years ago.

41:05.296 --> 41:10.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it has also then become
embedded in our
policies and procedures in
workplaces.

41:11.002 --> 41:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most women who are harassed
don't come forward,
they don't complain because
they're skeptical

41:15.373 --> 41:21.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the process, or they don't
think anything
is going to come of it if they
are found to

41:21.245 --> 41:23.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been harassed.

41:23.081 --> 41:29.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so -- and we know from some
very public
cases that sexual assault isn't
always punished

41:29.387 --> 41:32.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even by the courts in the way
that they should
be.

41:32.323 --> 41:38.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have got to figure out,
how are we
going to embed women's
experiences in the

41:38.596 --> 41:45.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
processes, so that they trust
the processes,
that there are fair
investigations that get

41:45.069 --> 41:51.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the truth, and then there is
appropriate
punishment when abuse occurs?

41:51.109 --> 41:58.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE WISE: One of the things --
and I show
-- I want to show gratitude to
both women,

41:58.816 --> 42:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professor Hill and Kelly, that
25 years ago,
Professor Hill didn't have the
same support

42:06.090 --> 42:08.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
system that we do through social
media and
whatnot.

42:08.960 --> 42:13.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she -- it almost became like
a pick a
side.

42:13.064 --> 42:16.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're either on a prospective
justice's side
or you're either on Ms. Hill's
side.

42:16.634 --> 42:19.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was ridiculous in some
ways.

42:19.871 --> 42:25.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the disturbing things
about today is,
people like Kelly, they put
themselves out

42:25.209 --> 42:26.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

42:27.011 --> 42:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of times, they will
get revictimized
through some nasty tweets,
somebody being

42:31.315 --> 42:34.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
snarky or somebody just being
vile and foul.

42:34.352 --> 42:38.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it takes a tremendous
amount of courage
today, even though the support
system is bigger.

42:38.923 --> 42:40.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Mike Wise...

42:40.124 --> 42:41.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLY OXFORD: I actually...

42:41.125 --> 42:42.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: I'm sorry.

42:42.126 --> 42:43.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go ahead.

42:43.961 --> 42:45.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLY OXFORD: I actually -- I
actually think,
you know, if social media and
the Internet

42:45.797 --> 42:50.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been around when Ms. Hill
went through
what she went through, I think
she would have

42:50.902 --> 42:52.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had a lot of support.

42:52.870 --> 42:57.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that the fact that she
even got handwritten
letters and still gets letters
today is proof

42:57.375 --> 42:58.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of that.

42:58.743 --> 43:01.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would have been so easy for
her to get
a message from a woman.

43:01.679 --> 43:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It takes two second online to
show your support.

43:06.317 --> 43:11.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, honestly, the amount of
backlash that
I have received for this has
been minimal.

43:11.489 --> 43:20.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been almost all support,
almost all
women and some men telling their
stories of

43:20.565 --> 43:24.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how rampant this abuse is in our
society.

43:24.969 --> 43:28.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANITA HILL: I would also say
that I did get
lots of support.

43:28.372 --> 43:31.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I did hear from women almost
immediately.

43:31.242 --> 43:33.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was hard to get in touch
with me.

43:33.911 --> 43:42.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still have letters from
Western Union, which
I don't even know if Western
Union is in the

43:42.954 --> 43:44.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
business of sending messages
anymore.

43:44.355 --> 43:45.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:45.356 --> 43:47.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANITA HILL: But I have faxes.

43:47.425 --> 43:49.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People made an effort.

43:49.293 --> 43:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I still know that it takes a
lot of courage
to come forward and tell your
story, because

43:56.100 --> 43:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you really don't know what the
response is
going to be.

43:59.470 --> 44:02.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Anita Hill, Kelly
Oxford, Mike
Wise, I'm afraid we're going to
have to leave

44:02.707 --> 44:04.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it there.

44:04.475 --> 44:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We could talk about this much
longer, but
thank you all very much for
joining us.

44:07.512 --> 44:09.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MIKE WISE: Sure.

44:09.280 --> 44:13.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On our Web site,
columnist
Wendy Thomas Russell tries to
answer what

44:13.417 --> 44:19.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many parents have been thinking:
How do I
explain this embattled and
sometimes R-rated

44:19.056 --> 44:20.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
election to children?

44:20.758 --> 44:30.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Go to PBS.org/NewsHour to find
her advice.

44:30.801 --> 44:38.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Go to PBS.org/NewsHour to find
her advice.

44:38.342 --> 44:43.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Finally tonight, special
correspondent Cat
Wise looks at how an
insignificant-seeming

44:43.080 --> 44:49.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bit of vegetation helped
scientists in Portland,
Oregon, discover air quality
problems in certain

44:49.420 --> 44:51.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
areas of that city earlier this
year.

44:51.322 --> 44:56.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is part of our weekly series
covering the
Leading Edge of science and
technology.

44:56.127 --> 45:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Portland, Oregon, is a
city that
prides itself on its food
trucks, bike-friendly

45:02.567 --> 45:05.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
streets, and being very focused
on the environment.

45:05.436 --> 45:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, many people here were
shocked when it
was discovered earlier this year
that certain

45:09.473 --> 45:13.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
neighborhoods had high levels of
heavy toxic
metals.

45:13.277 --> 45:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That discovery was largely due
to this woman
and her love of moss.

45:16.981 --> 45:20.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH JOVAN, U.S. Forest
Service: Well, moss
is kind of like the underdog of
the plant

45:20.685 --> 45:25.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world, in the sense that people
tend to not
really know what it is.

45:25.156 --> 45:30.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Sarah Jovan is a
research ecologist
with the U.S. Forest Service.

45:30.328 --> 45:34.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She and a small number of other
scientists
have been studying moss and
lichens in forests

45:34.498 --> 45:37.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for years to learn more about
air quality.

45:37.268 --> 45:41.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's because moss and lichens
are essentially
little sponges that absorb
everything in the

45:41.572 --> 45:44.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
air around them, including
pollutants.

45:44.141 --> 45:48.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But moss had never been studied
extensively
in an urban environment.

45:48.646 --> 45:52.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, several years ago, Jovan and
a colleague
decided they'd do just that in
Portland.

45:52.783 --> 45:56.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they chose a type of moss
that can be
found nearly everywhere in the
city.

45:56.554 --> 45:58.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's called orthotrichum.

45:58.222 --> 46:01.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH JOVAN: And what's
interesting is, it
doesn't seem to mind pollution
at all.

46:01.993 --> 46:06.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's like the Twinkie of the
moss world, because
it seems really indestructible.

46:06.764 --> 46:11.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Jovan's team took
samples from 346
sites around Portland.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They even climbed some trees.

46:13.804 --> 46:17.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The samples were brought back to
a Portland
State University lab, where they
were processed

46:17.375 --> 46:21.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cleaned of debris, and then
they were
sent off for a detailed chemical
analysis.

46:22.013 --> 46:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The results that came back were
startling.

46:25.449 --> 46:29.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Moss from two neighborhoods
contained high
levels of cadmium, a metal which
can cause

46:29.987 --> 46:34.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a host of health problems,
including kidney
damage and lung cancer, if
inhaled over a

46:34.525 --> 46:36.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long time.

46:36.394 --> 46:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The cadmium hot spots, seen in
dark orange
on this Forest Service map, were
right around

46:41.065 --> 46:44.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two artisan glass manufacturing
companies.

46:44.201 --> 46:47.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one location also had very
high levels
of arsenic.

46:47.171 --> 46:50.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cadmium, arsenic, and other
metals are commonly
used in glassmaking.

46:50.708 --> 46:55.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH JOVAN: We knew we'd find
some hot spots
of pollution, but we were
actually shocked.

46:55.513 --> 47:02.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We found that the largest hot
spot was associated
with an industry that actually
isn't regulated

47:02.753 --> 47:04.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for arsenic and cadmium.

47:04.789 --> 47:09.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we said, oh, my gosh, you
know, that's
an area where there are schools,
there's a

47:09.894 --> 47:11.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
day care, there's neighborhoods.

47:11.796 --> 47:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: But she still had some
big unanswered
questions.

47:15.566 --> 47:19.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Did the air in those
neighborhoods also contain
high levels of metals?

47:19.870 --> 47:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Was the moss acting like an
early warning
system?

47:22.506 --> 47:26.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Jovan and her Forest Service
colleagues
shared their results with the
state agency

47:26.944 --> 47:31.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
actually responsible for
monitoring Oregon's
air, the Department of
Environmental Quality.

47:31.115 --> 47:34.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH ARMITAGE, Oregon Senior
Air Quality
Planner: To really know what
people are breathing,

47:34.318 --> 47:39.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need to take these pieces of
equipment
out and run air through the
filter, and then

47:39.156 --> 47:40.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bring it back and analyze it.

47:40.725 --> 47:44.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Sarah Armitage is a
senior air quality
planner for the state.

47:44.695 --> 47:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She showed us some of the
sophisticated air
monitors that the agency
deployed around the

47:48.899 --> 47:54.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
glass companies after they were
given the
moss study results.

47:54.805 --> 47:59.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Samples taken from those
monitors, which were
processed in this state lab,
eventually confirmed

47:59.577 --> 48:01.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the air was indeed tainted.

48:01.645 --> 48:06.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some areas, cadmium levels
were nearly
50 times above state health
benchmarks, and

48:06.584 --> 48:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arsenic were more than 150 times
over.

48:09.820 --> 48:13.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state had known for a number
of years
that there were elevated levels
of certain

48:13.424 --> 48:18.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
metals in Portland's air, but
they were never
able to pinpoint the sources.

48:18.195 --> 48:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prior to the moss study, there
was just one
permanent air monitor in
Portland and air

48:22.199 --> 48:26.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pollution was tracked on a
regional scale,
not neighborhood by
neighborhood.

48:26.637 --> 48:27.605 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

48:27.638 --> 48:28.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARAH ARMITAGE: Cost.

48:28.939 --> 48:30.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's really the reason.

48:30.374 --> 48:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are expensive to operate
and to purchase
and to do the analysis.

48:35.780 --> 48:38.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
An average site is about
$150,000 per year.

48:38.916 --> 48:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when we have the moss data,
at least for
metals, it screens a broad area,
and we can

48:44.555 --> 48:50.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
zero in on a location where we
know, if we
put a monitor, we're going to
find some metals.

48:50.895 --> 48:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: But, costs aside, more
air monitors
simply weren't required.

48:56.233 --> 49:00.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under the federal Clean Air Act,
six common
pollutants that cause smog and
health problems

49:00.404 --> 49:06.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have strict, enforceable
emissions standards;
187 other pollutants, called air
toxics, are

49:06.310 --> 49:09.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also regulated, but they aren't
monitored
to the same degree.

49:09.446 --> 49:13.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Oregon, like many states,
hasn't been
closely tracking industrial
sources of cadmium

49:13.751 --> 49:16.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and other air toxics or the
health impacts.

49:16.053 --> 49:19.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: New concerns about high
levels of toxins
in Portland neighborhoods.

49:20.024 --> 49:23.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: When the story broke,
there was
a big public outcry.

49:23.761 --> 49:26.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Government officials held
meetings with concerned
residents.

49:26.463 --> 49:31.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the head of the state
environmental agency
resigned in March, soon after
the moss results

49:31.101 --> 49:34.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were made public, though he
cited health concerns
as the reason.

49:35.005 --> 49:39.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the glass companies, which
voluntarily
suspended the use of the metals
after the

49:39.543 --> 49:43.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
results came out, and have been
working with
the state since to comply with
temporary rules,

49:43.914 --> 49:46.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were not breaking the law, says
air quality
official Armitage.

49:46.884 --> 49:51.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH ARMITAGE: As far as DEQ
was concerned,
and also the facility was
concerned, they

49:51.555 --> 49:52.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were in compliance.

49:52.857 --> 49:54.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We take responsibility for the
federal standards.

49:55.025 --> 49:57.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We put them in facilities'
permits.

49:57.127 --> 50:02.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What wasn't regulated was the
furnaces that
melted the glass.

50:02.132 --> 50:05.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's where the emissions
were coming
from.

50:05.436 --> 50:08.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY PEVETO, Neighbors for Clean
Air: This
idea that there's this whole
classification

50:08.405 --> 50:12.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of air pollution that has not
been well addressed
by the federal government has
been a really

50:12.676 --> 50:14.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hidden secret really across this
country.

50:14.912 --> 50:19.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Mary Peveto is the
co-founder of
a local advocacy group which has
been fighting

50:19.383 --> 50:21.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for cleaner air more than a
decade.

50:21.585 --> 50:25.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY PEVETO: As I have said, at
the beginning,
there was no credible evidence
to demonstrate

50:25.756 --> 50:28.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether or not this company was
emitting anything
that was a problem.

50:28.359 --> 50:32.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: She gathered recently
with a group
of concerned residents who live
near a metal

50:32.263 --> 50:37.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
manufacturing facility where the
moss samples
picked up elevated levels of
nickel.

50:37.601 --> 50:41.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state now has air monitors
deployed around
that company too.

50:41.205 --> 50:43.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Peveto says it's about time.

50:43.741 --> 50:48.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY PEVETO: All of us have been
really traumatized
that our state would knowingly
allow these

50:48.646 --> 50:53.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toxics to continue to be in our
environments,
when we know that actions could
have been

50:53.751 --> 50:55.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taken to reduce them.

50:55.586 --> 51:00.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are the kinds of things
that contribute
to our health and disease in
ways that you

51:00.090 --> 51:01.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
often don't recognize.

51:01.659 --> 51:06.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: In fact, public health
concerns
have led to some significant
changes.

51:06.764 --> 51:11.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When an air monitor outside a
day care near
one of the glass companies
detected a lead

51:11.101 --> 51:16.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spike in May, Oregon's governor
issued an
unprecedented temporary
cease-and-desist order.

51:16.674 --> 51:21.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, state health officials
say voluntary
lead and cadmium testing in the
community

51:21.211 --> 51:24.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has not revealed an immediate
widespread public
health threat.

51:24.882 --> 51:26.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the long-term impacts are
still being
studied.

51:26.850 --> 51:28.652 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

51:28.686 --> 51:30.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATRINA HEDBERG, Oregon State
Health Officer:
It's always extremely difficult
to associate

51:30.621 --> 51:35.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one long-term health outcome
like cancer with
a very specific exposure.

51:35.592 --> 51:38.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAT WISE: Dr. Katrina Hedberg is
Oregon's
state health officer.

51:38.896 --> 51:43.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I met up with her near the day
care where
the elevated lead levels were
caught.

51:43.734 --> 51:47.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says one of the big lessons
from the moss
study is that better monitoring
is needed,

51:47.738 --> 51:52.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that the public health
community can gauge
the actual risks from air
pollution.

51:52.176 --> 51:53.944 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

51:53.978 --> 51:56.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATRINA HEDBERG: I would say
that, when there
are more data, understanding
what people are

51:56.080 --> 52:01.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exposed to in various areas is
useful, because
that then helps us to determine
what the level

52:01.952 --> 52:02.987 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of risk is.

52:03.020 --> 52:05.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need data in the environment.

52:05.089 --> 52:07.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Otherwise, it's only
theoretical.

52:07.057 --> 52:11.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Oregon is currently
revising regulations
for glass manufacturers, and a
major overhaul

52:11.161 --> 52:15.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of permitting regulations for
all companies
which emit air toxics is also
under way, with

52:15.833 --> 52:19.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more input from health officials
and the public.

52:19.269 --> 52:25.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For her part, scientist Sarah
Jovan is continuing
to monitor moss samples in the
impacted neighborhoods,

52:25.309 --> 52:30.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she says she's happy that
moss is finally
getting a little more respect
these days.

52:30.381 --> 52:34.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat
Wise in Portland,
Oregon.

52:34.451 --> 52:39.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Current testing
by the state
of Oregon finds levels of
airborne heavy metals

52:39.656 --> 52:45.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
detected by the moss have
dropped substantially
over the past year, since
measures were taken

52:45.162 --> 52:57.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to reduce their emission.

52:57.574 --> 52:59.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And a news update.

52:59.376 --> 53:03.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today: The New York Times
reported on
two women who allege Donald
Trump touched

53:03.480 --> 53:09.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them inappropriately in a manner
similar to
what he described in the 2005
"Access Hollywood"

53:09.753 --> 53:10.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
video.

53:10.754 --> 53:12.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:12.389 --> 53:13.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:13.557 --> 53:16.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

53:16.260 --> 53:26.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

53:26.303 --> 53:32.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
