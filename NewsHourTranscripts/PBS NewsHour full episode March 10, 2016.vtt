JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.608 --> 00:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Donald Trump wins big, and
Bernie Sanders

00:11.812 --> 00:16.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
scores an upset, as the
presidential candidates
look ahead to Ohio and Florida.

00:16.750 --> 00:21.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Wednesday: An
American student is killed in
Israel amid

00:21.755 --> 00:26.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a spike in violence, and Vice
President Biden,
in a meeting with Prime Minister
Netanyahu

00:26.493 --> 00:29.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Tel Aviv, sharply condemns
the violence.

00:29.296 --> 00:35.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a Texas
hospital that is
bucking the trend, as more rural
health care

00:35.235 --> 00:37.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
centers shut their doors.

00:37.104 --> 00:40.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MICHAEL WILLIAMS, Former
CEO, Hill Country
Memorial: We took the approach
that, if we

00:40.207 --> 00:44.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took patients and we treated
them better than
they'd ever been treated before,
then, in

00:44.978 --> 00:47.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the end of the day, they would
drive the bottom
line.

00:47.180 --> 00:55.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:55.088 --> 00:57.891 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.925 --> 01:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This was another
day-after
for the presidential hopefuls.
Tuesday's results

01:08.035 --> 01:13.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focused even more attention on
tonight's latest
Democratic debate. And
Republicans issued

01:13.674 --> 01:17.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
competing calls to join or
oppose the front-runner.

01:17.444 --> 01:20.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I want to thank the people of
Michigan.

01:20.914 --> 01:26.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fresh from
another night of
triumph, Donald Trump appealed
today for mainstream

01:26.620 --> 01:28.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republicans to unite behind him.

01:28.722 --> 01:33.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Instead of
fighting it, they
should embrace it. And if
everybody came together,

01:33.093 --> 01:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instead of spending all of this
money on these
ridiculous ads that frankly are
wrong, if

01:38.966 --> 01:45.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you -- and they're just false
ads. It's terrible.
If everybody came together,
nobody could beat

01:45.839 --> 01:48.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Republican Party. We would
walk into Washington.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
The momentum is with us.

01:49.977 --> 01:55.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Ted Cruz had
a decidedly
different take in Miami. He was
coming off

01:55.549 --> 02:02.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a win last night in Idaho's
Republican primary,
as well as second-place finishes
to Trump

02:02.856 --> 02:08.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Michigan, Mississippi and
Hawaii, all the
more reason, Cruz said, for
Republicans dead

02:08.762 --> 02:10.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
set against Trump to join him.

02:10.964 --> 02:14.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
There is only one campaign that
has demonstrated

02:14.568 --> 02:23.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it can beat Donald Trump over
and over and
over again, and we will beat
Donald Trump

02:23.577 --> 02:26.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over and over and over again.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:27.948 --> 02:32.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One former rival,
Carly Fiorina,
endorsed the Texas senator
today. And it was

02:32.452 --> 02:38.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
widely reported that Jeb Bush
will meet with
the remaining Republican
hopefuls except for

02:38.892 --> 02:40.660 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

02:40.694 --> 02:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's getting harder by the
day to stop
the New York billionaire. After
last night,

02:45.332 --> 02:52.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump now has 458 delegates in
his column.
He needs to win almost 55
percent of the delegates

02:52.806 --> 03:00.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yet to be awarded to get to
1,237, the number
need to lock up the nomination.
Cruz, his

03:00.514 --> 03:09.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closest rival, is at 359.
Trailing far behind
are Marco Rubio, at 151, and
John Kasich,

03:09.523 --> 03:11.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who has 54.

03:11.324 --> 03:16.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Ohio governor poured time
and resources
into neighboring Michigan, only
to come in

03:16.663 --> 03:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
third there. Today, he brought
his campaign
and defiantly positive message
to Illinois,

03:23.737 --> 03:25.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where he hopes to do well on
March 15.

03:25.605 --> 03:29.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
Because I didn't engage in
name-calling, you

03:29.776 --> 03:32.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thought my name was governor of
Ohio, OK?

03:32.446 --> 03:34.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:34.381 --> 03:36.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. JOHN KASICH: And then about
a month ago,
or I wouldn't even say -- maybe
about two-and-a-half

03:36.883 --> 03:45.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or three weeks ago, you actually
started to
see who I was a little bit, and
now in the

03:45.225 --> 03:47.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last couple weeks, a heck of a
lot more.

03:47.994 --> 03:54.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even so, The
Chicago Tribune
passed over Kasich today and
endorsed Rubio,

03:54.134 --> 03:59.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who hasn't gotten much of a
boost so far out
of other endorsements. He failed
to score

03:59.539 --> 04:05.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any delegates in Michigan or
Mississippi,
and is pressing toward March 15,
when his

04:05.278 --> 04:11.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home state of Florida votes.
Tonight, Rubio
will be making his case in Miami
at a town

04:11.151 --> 04:13.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hall hosted by MSNBC.

04:13.086 --> 04:19.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats, meanwhile, are
pondering the
importance of their own results
from Tuesday.

04:19.659 --> 04:25.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders tried today to
parlay his upset
win in Michigan into momentum
elsewhere.

04:25.365 --> 04:29.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
But, as the map moves forward,
and as we move,

04:29.269 --> 04:36.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, into the West,
California, Washington,
Arizona, Oregon, Wisconsin,
you're going to

04:36.510 --> 04:40.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see a lot of states where we
believe we have
an excellent chance to win.

04:40.413 --> 04:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even with the
Michigan loss,
Hillary Clinton extended her
delegate lead

04:45.519 --> 04:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over Sanders last night. She won
more than
80 percent of the vote in
Mississippi's primary.

04:51.358 --> 04:57.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And she again focused on
opponents in Republican
ranks, instead of those in her
own.

04:57.197 --> 05:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
We have our differences, which
you can see

05:00.600 --> 05:06.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we debate, but I will tell
you what.
Those differences pale in
comparison to what's

05:06.940 --> 05:09.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happening on the Republican
side.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:11.044 --> 05:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Every
time you think
it can't get any uglier, they
find a way.

05:17.184 --> 05:23.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The two Democrats
meet face-to-face
again tonight, this time in
Miami for a debate

05:23.623 --> 05:27.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hosted by the Spanish-language
network Univision.

05:27.227 --> 05:32.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will call on two reporters
who've been
covering the races closely after
the news

05:32.532 --> 05:34.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: U.S.
special forces have captured the
Islamic State's

05:37.470 --> 05:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chemical weapons chief in
Northern Iraq. The
Associated Press reports he was
taken in a

05:42.509 --> 05:48.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raid last month. The report also
says follow-up
airstrikes have hit Islamic
State chemical

05:48.315 --> 05:50.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
facilities in recent days.

05:50.317 --> 05:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in Somalia,
there is word
that U.S. and Somali forces
killed 10 Al-Shabaab

05:56.523 --> 06:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
militants in an overnight raid.
Somali intelligence
officials say the target was a
town controlled

06:02.195 --> 06:08.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the group west of Mogadishu.
This comes
three days after U.S. airstrikes
hit an Al-Shabaab

06:08.835 --> 06:14.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camp. The Pentagon said up to
150 fighters
were killed there, but the
militants disputed

06:14.708 --> 06:16.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that figure.

06:16.543 --> 06:20.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For the first time,
a Japanese
court has ordered a nuclear
reactor shut down

06:20.847 --> 06:26.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over safety concerns. Another
one already
down will have to stay offline.
The court

06:26.219 --> 06:32.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ruled the reactors nears Kyoto
have not been
adequately upgraded since the
Fukushima disaster.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the Japanese government
disputed the finding.

06:35.762 --> 06:41.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YOSHIHIDE SUGA, Japanese Chief
Cabinet Secretary
(through translator): An
independent regulatory

06:41.134 --> 06:45.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
committee, including
professionals and architects,
spent a lot of time to come up
with the decision

06:45.305 --> 06:49.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the reactors are up to top
world-level
standards. The government backs
that decision

06:49.943 --> 06:52.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and has not changed its stance
of restarting
the reactors.

06:52.379 --> 06:57.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Japan shut down all
of its nuclear
power plants after a tsunami
severely damaged

06:57.817 --> 07:03.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Fukushima plant five years
ago this week.
The government has now begun
slowly restarting

07:03.723 --> 07:05.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some of the plants.

07:05.525 --> 07:09.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tributes came in
from around
the music world today for George
Martin, the

07:09.896 --> 07:16.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legendary record producer of the
Beatles.
He gave the group their first
break in 1962,

07:16.269 --> 07:20.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and guided them through the
decade as they
revolutionized pop music.

07:21.007 --> 07:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beatles biographer Philip Norman
spoke to
Independent Television News
today.

07:25.245 --> 07:28.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PHILIP NORMAN, Beatles
Biographer: He was
a musician, as well as a
producer. He saw

07:28.415 --> 07:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the real talent in John Lennon
and Paul McCartney,
and he really devoted himself to
sort of making

07:33.987 --> 07:38.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it sound as good as it could. He
became a
celebrity producer, although he
didn't want

07:38.525 --> 07:39.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be a celebrity.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: George Martin was
90 years
old.

07:42.462 --> 07:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, a period
of official mourning began for
former first

07:46.900 --> 07:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lady Nancy Reagan, who died
Sunday at the
age of 94. Mrs. Reagan's casket
was brought

07:52.339 --> 07:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to her husband's presidential
library in Simi
Valley, California, where the
public viewing

07:57.711 --> 08:01.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
began. She will lie in repose
until the funeral,
set for Friday.

08:01.915 --> 08:06.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street
managed modest
gains today. The Dow Jones
industrial average

08:06.453 --> 08:14.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was up 36 points to close at
17000. The Nasdaq
rose 25 points, and the S&amp;P 500
added 10.

08:14.761 --> 08:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And score another
breakthrough
for artificial intelligence. A
computer program

08:20.266 --> 08:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
designed by Google has beaten
one of the world's
top players in Go, the ancient
Chinese board

08:26.639 --> 08:32.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
game. The computer relayed moves
to a human
stand-in as it squared off
against the 18-time

08:32.912 --> 08:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
world champion in South Korea.

08:35.181 --> 08:42.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Afterward, he praised the
program. The game
involves roughly 200 possible
moves per turn,

08:42.322 --> 08:45.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
compared to 20 in chess.

08:45.091 --> 08:49.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
beyond the
rhetoric, the facts about Trump
University;

08:49.429 --> 08:55.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rural hospital beats the odds
and keeps
its doors open; new turmoil in
the Middle

08:55.769 --> 09:02.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
East, and the White House
response, and much
more.

09:02.675 --> 09:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From Trump's
latest triumph,
to the surprise win for Sanders
in Michigan,

09:15.088 --> 09:19.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we explore the state of the race
for the White
House, as the focus heads to the
battleground

09:19.559 --> 09:22.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
states of Ohio and Florida.

09:22.362 --> 09:28.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining us again are Reid Wilson
of the Morning
Consult and Susan Page of USA
Today.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome you both back to
the program.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Reid, let me start with you.

09:32.205 --> 09:39.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Let's start with the
Republicans. Donald Trump
is blazing ahead, despite the
onslaught that

09:39.479 --> 09:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he faced last week, the Mitt
Romney news conference,
the money that the stop Trump
movement is

09:44.818 --> 09:46.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spending. How significant is
this?

09:46.619 --> 09:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON, Morning Consult:
And another
round of pundit saying he has
hit the wall

09:50.089 --> 09:54.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and is about to start his
decline. Instead,
last night, in a couple of
contests, in four

09:54.828 --> 09:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contests around the country,
Donald Trump
grew his delegate lead.

09:58.031 --> 10:03.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the real onslaught, the
real test he
faces comes next week in
Florida, where outside

10:03.870 --> 10:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups are spending millions of
dollars, multiple
millions of dollars attacking
him from all

10:09.809 --> 10:14.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sides. We will see whether or
not he can survive.
But, at the moment, he remains
the Republican

10:14.314 --> 10:18.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
front-runner. And for the rest
of the anti-Trump
Republican field, their best
shot at stopping

10:18.685 --> 10:23.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him remains in some kind of
contested convention
once we get to Cleveland in
July.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, how do you
size up where
Trump is right now?

10:25.692 --> 10:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
I think Trump could end up with
enough delegates,

10:29.395 --> 10:32.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the 1,237 he would need to hold
the nomination.

10:32.599 --> 10:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But -- and I think the only path
that his
opponents have now is to get --
to go to a

10:36.236 --> 10:40.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contested convention, which is a
long shot,
possible perhaps for the long
shot. I mean,

10:40.306 --> 10:44.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's remarkable. He is a guy who
has never
ran for office before. He had a
record size

10:44.177 --> 10:47.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
field of 17 competitors. And
he's now clearly
the front-runner.

10:47.814 --> 10:52.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has dominated the field from
the beginning
of the contest. And one big name
in Republican

10:52.485 --> 10:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politics after another has
fallen at his feet,
the latest being Marco Rubio.

10:56.556 --> 11:01.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reid, what did we
see in the
interviews with voters as they
were leaving

11:01.094 --> 11:05.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the polls yesterday in these
states that voted,
the so-called exit polls? What
did they say

11:05.965 --> 11:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Trump, that he should
either be happy
about or worried about as he
goes into these

11:11.304 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big states?

11:13.106 --> 11:16.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: The two things that
strike me
most from the Republican exit
polls is, one,

11:16.109 --> 11:21.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the amazing amount of support
Trump gets from
people who say they want a
candidate who tells

11:21.047 --> 11:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it like it is. Trump wins
something like three-quarters
of those voters across states,
not just Michigan

11:27.287 --> 11:31.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Mississippi, but beginning
in Iowa and
now all the way through until
where we are

11:31.424 --> 11:33.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second is that Trump has
this well of
supporters who have been with
him from the

11:36.462 --> 11:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very beginning. Susan mentioned
it, that he's
been ahead since the beginning.
And if you

11:40.967 --> 11:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at the exit polls, the
people who have
decided how they were going to
vote months

11:46.272 --> 11:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, weeks ago have all decided
for Trump.
The people who are just now
deciding are deciding

11:51.244 --> 11:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for some other candidate.

11:53.546 --> 11:57.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More and more, by the way, bad
news for Marco
Rubio, the people who are
deciding to vote

11:57.984 --> 12:00.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
late are deciding to vote for
Ted Cruz.

12:00.086 --> 12:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What else do you
see, Susan,
in the reasons people are
deciding to go Trump

12:03.957 --> 12:05.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or somebody else?

12:05.692 --> 12:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: These are people who
think the
country is headed in the wrong
direction,

12:07.527 --> 12:11.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the political leadership in
both parties
has failed to address it, and
they're ready

12:11.497 --> 12:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to shake things up.

12:13.399 --> 12:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's one reason I think
the attacks
on Trump that he's not
consistently conservative

12:18.137 --> 12:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or that he's lying about his
business record,
it just doesn't seem to have
much of an effect

12:23.076 --> 12:27.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with his voters. Last night, as
we have seen
before, his support was mostly
male -- more

12:27.380 --> 12:33.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
male than female, almost
entirely white, strongest
among working-class voters, but
the fact is,

12:33.186 --> 12:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he has very broad support.

12:34.921 --> 12:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He continues to win white
evangelicals over
Ted Cruz. And that is Ted Cruz's
base.

12:39.425 --> 12:43.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Reid, begin
to outline
for us what these candidates
face, the Republicans

12:43.696 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
face in Florida, in Ohio, in
Illinois and
the other states that vote on
Tuesday.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: So, they face some
pretty high
stakes, similar to what Ted Cruz
faced on

12:51.704 --> 12:57.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Super Tuesday, when his home
state of Texas
was the prize plum on the tree.

12:57.410 --> 13:01.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This time, we have got Marco
Rubio's home
state of Florida, John Kasich's
home state

13:01.247 --> 13:05.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Ohio. Both are
winner-take-all states,
which means that there are a big
chunk of

13:05.985 --> 13:12.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegates. No more of this 25
delegates for
Trump, 17 for Rubio, 17 for
Kasich. All 99

13:12.058 --> 13:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Florida's delegates will go
to a person
who gets a plurality there. All
of Ohio's

13:16.429 --> 13:19.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
delegates will go to the person
who gets a
plurality there.

13:19.232 --> 13:24.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The great news for Donald Trump
is that he's
leading in both states. He's
leading John

13:24.404 --> 13:28.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kasich in Ohio by a smaller
margin than he's
leading Marco Rubio in Florida,
but, as I

13:28.841 --> 13:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, he is facing millions of
dollars in
negative ads, a kind of
consistent attack

13:33.446 --> 13:35.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that he has not faced yet.

13:35.248 --> 13:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Susan, is
there something we know about
the electorate

13:38.351 --> 13:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in -- Republican electorate in
these states
that these candidates should be
watching out

13:41.754 --> 13:43.623 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for?

13:43.656 --> 13:44.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, they are.
There are candidates
-- there are states that will
know some of

13:44.924 --> 13:46.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these candidates well, which
ought to be good
news for them.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's in Florida in
particular. It's a
state where an endorsement by
Jeb Bush, which

13:50.930 --> 13:55.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably wouldn't matter much
nationally,
could matter. He's a popular
former governor

13:55.368 --> 13:57.036 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, let's
start now on the
Democrats. Bernie Sanders wasn't
supposed

13:59.906 --> 14:03.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win Michigan. He did. How big
a deal is
it?

14:03.576 --> 14:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: You know, this saved
Bernie Sanders,
because he was just on the verge
of being

14:08.147 --> 14:13.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
counted out as a credible
nominee and thought
of as only a protest candidate,
candidate

14:13.119 --> 14:14.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with a message.

14:14.887 --> 14:18.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's turned that around by
-- all the
polls showed him with a
double-digit deficit

14:18.424 --> 14:22.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Michigan. He managed to win
there, and
he managed to continue to -- he
turned out

14:22.395 --> 14:27.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of young people. He won
eight out of
10 voters under 30. That is a
huge advantage

14:27.967 --> 14:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for him and one that Hillary has
just been
unable to cut into. And he did
better among

14:32.038 --> 14:36.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
black voters than he's done
before, and in
fact was basically even with her
among black

14:36.042 --> 14:37.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voters under 40.

14:38.010 --> 14:41.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That could be important, too.
It's a bigger,
more diverse state than he's won
in before

14:42.014 --> 14:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and one that is not in his
neighborhood, and
that made this especially
important.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We noticed she
didn't do as
good among black voters in
Michigan as she

14:47.854 --> 14:50.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has done with African-American
voters in the
South.

14:50.590 --> 14:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reid, what else is there that
Hillary Clinton
should be worried after this
Michigan result?

14:54.660 --> 14:56.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REID WILSON: There are a couple
of things.

14:56.562 --> 15:01.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Clinton coalition at the
moment is Democratic
voters who want a candidate who
is electable

15:01.834 --> 15:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and experienced. The Sanders
coalition is
people who want a candidate who
shares my

15:06.405 --> 15:12.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
values and who cares about
people like me.
If you get to the general
election and the

15:12.612 --> 15:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
majority of Democrats or a
significant part
-- number of Democrats don't
believe that

15:17.016 --> 15:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is honest or
trustworthy,
that's going to be a big, big
problem down

15:20.820 --> 15:22.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the line for her.

15:22.722 --> 15:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this is -- the last
Democratic president
before President Obama was the
guy who felt

15:27.160 --> 15:32.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your pain, and now Hillary
Clinton, not Bill
Clinton, is having trouble
connecting with

15:32.165 --> 15:33.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Susan, we
talked about
what the Republicans face in
Ohio and Florida

15:35.868 --> 15:39.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so forth next Tuesday. What
about the
Democrats? What about Clinton
and Sanders?

15:39.338 --> 15:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Crucial as well,
because these
big states voting, they don't --
they're not

15:43.042 --> 15:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
winner-take-all states, because
Democratic
rules don't allow that.

15:46.212 --> 15:49.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But you talked about the
problems that Hillary
Clinton saw last night. And
let's talk about

15:49.649 --> 15:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the advantages she saw last
night. The momentum
was with Sanders. The math is
with Clinton.

15:56.222 --> 16:00.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though Clinton got defeated
in a state
she hoped to win, she ends up
with more delegates

16:00.193 --> 16:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last night than Sanders because
she won in
Mississippi by such a big
margin.

16:05.631 --> 16:10.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She got four times more
delegates from Mississippi
than Sanders got out of
Michigan. And that

16:10.403 --> 16:13.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was certainly something that her
campaign
manager, Robby Mook, was trying
to make with

16:13.940 --> 16:15.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reporters today.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is
something peculiar
to the Democratic -- it's
something the Democratic

16:18.778 --> 16:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party worked because they wanted
it to work
this way.

16:21.547 --> 16:25.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: They wanted
proportional representation.
Republicans are less devoted to
that idea.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Reid.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Hillary Clinton is
still on the
path still to the Democratic
nomination, but

16:30.823 --> 16:34.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the path is more of a marathon.
Had she won
both states last night, it would
have been

16:34.594 --> 16:36.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more of a 5K or a 10K.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, you were
saying it could
take even longer for her to seal
this than

16:38.764 --> 16:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Donald Trump.

16:40.666 --> 16:42.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And who would have
thought that
In this big Republican field,
that gets settled

16:42.468 --> 16:46.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
before this presumptive
front-runner who had
-- we thought was going to be
mostly token

16:46.739 --> 16:47.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opposition. It's amazing.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan Page, Reid
Wilson, thank
you both.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Thanks a lot.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thanks.

16:53.379 --> 16:56.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the campaign
trail, Donald
Trump often boasts of his
business credentials

16:56.749 --> 17:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be president, never more than
during a
victory speech last night in
Jupiter, Florida,

17:02.455 --> 17:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
held at one of his hotels.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I built a great, great company.
I have very

17:07.226 --> 17:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
low debt. I have assets like
this. This is
owned 100 percent by me with no
debt.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

17:15.201 --> 17:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You look at Doral,
where we
just had the major championship,
I mean, I

17:18.504 --> 17:23.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a lot of things in Florida,
partners
with related or numerous jobs on
the beach,

17:23.109 --> 17:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very successful, partners with
Gil and Michael
Dezer on the beach, massive
buildings.

17:27.914 --> 17:31.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody ever talks about this
stuff, and, you
know, many, many jobs in New
York, including

17:31.417 --> 17:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the city on the West Side from
72nd to 59th
Street, or on the Hudson River,
one of the

17:35.988 --> 17:38.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most successful projects ever
built in real
estate.

17:38.457 --> 17:43.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But one of Mr.
Trump's ventures
has come under especially harsh
scrutiny in

17:43.596 --> 17:44.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recent years.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang explores.

17:46.766 --> 17:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump University was
promoted as
a way for aspiring real estate
developers

17:50.703 --> 17:55.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to learn the business from top
instructors.
As many as 7,000 people signed
up, paying

17:55.675 --> 17:59.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an estimated $40 million in
fees.

17:59.111 --> 18:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The now-defunct for-profit
seminars are the
subject of three lawsuits, one
brought by

18:04.450 --> 18:09.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state of New York, and two
class-action
suits in California brought by
former students

18:09.622 --> 18:15.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who say they were defrauded,
because the high-priced
classes didn't deliver on the
promises.

18:15.561 --> 18:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigative reporter Michael
Isikoff has
been looking into this for Yahoo
News, and

18:19.365 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he joins us now from New York.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Michael, welcome.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL ISIKOFF, Yahoo News:
Good to be with
you, John.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Michael, we talk
about the promises
and what they lived up to.

18:26.672 --> 18:32.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They offered handpicked
instructors, handpicked
by Donald Trump, and access to
Trump secrets.

18:32.712 --> 18:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you talked to students who
took these
classes. What do they say
actually happened?

18:37.383 --> 18:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL ISIKOFF: Well, they say
they didn't'
get their money's worth.

18:42.221 --> 18:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, in the promotional
literature, there
was language from Trump about
how he would

18:49.128 --> 18:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teach them to make a living --
make a killing
-- I'm sorry -- in the real
estate market,

18:54.367 --> 19:00.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would teach his secrets to
them, they would
learn from the best of the best.

19:00.373 --> 19:06.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Trump University turned
out to be
was a series of ballroom
seminars where people

19:06.212 --> 19:12.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got sort of basics from these
instructors,
and then they were encouraged to
put more

19:12.551 --> 19:19.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money down, to max out their
credit cards
to the tune of $35,000, to pay
for mentoring

19:20.026 --> 19:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from these handpicked experts of
Donald Trump.

19:23.729 --> 19:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many of those who have filed
complaints
with the Better Business Bureau,
with the

19:27.933 --> 19:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state of New York, with other
attorneys generals
say they got very little for
that. The handpicked

19:33.939 --> 19:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experts seemed to know very
little about thee
real estate business, gave them
bum advice,

19:39.445 --> 19:43.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in many cases seemed to fade
away and
they were unable to even get in
touch with

19:43.883 --> 19:45.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

19:45.484 --> 19:50.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you had a lot of angry
consumers out there
who have brought these lawsuits.

19:50.623 --> 19:54.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Were you able to talk
to any students
who were satisfied? Donald
Trump, of course,

19:54.794 --> 19:58.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that there were course
evaluations. People
said they were very satisfied.
His attorneys

19:59.031 --> 20:02.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say the same thing. Were you
able to talk
to any students who said that?

20:02.368 --> 20:08.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL ISIKOFF: I didn't
personally talk
to students who fit into that
category.

20:08.340 --> 20:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The evaluation forms basically
were based
-- came off the seminars, which
were just

20:15.915 --> 20:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a couple of hours and sort of
routine forms
that were handed out at the
time. The real

20:21.120 --> 20:28.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complaints came afterwards from
those who
went through the process of this
mentoring,

20:28.961 --> 20:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's where they say they
didn't get
their money's worth.

20:32.331 --> 20:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I'm sure we will hear in
the upcoming
trial -- and it is important to
note that

20:37.670 --> 20:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a trial scheduled for
this year on
this matter -- from people who
will testify

20:44.009 --> 20:48.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that they did have good
experiences with Trump
University.

20:48.147 --> 20:55.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Trump's lawyers have tried
to make that
point in a number of motions in
these cases,

20:55.621 --> 21:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the -- those motions for
summary judgment
to have these suits thrown out
have so far

21:01.760 --> 21:03.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being unsuccessful.

21:03.629 --> 21:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On the campaign
trail, Marco Rubio
and Ted Cruz are trying to make
this a campaign

21:07.600 --> 21:12.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue, a political issue, but
the trial or
the court cases is moving
forward. What's

21:12.872 --> 21:14.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the status of that case?

21:14.807 --> 21:21.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL ISIKOFF: Yes. Well,
actually, I happened
to stumble across the filings
just a couple

21:21.247 --> 21:24.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of weeks ago that kind of put
this in play.

21:24.350 --> 21:28.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These lawsuits have been going
on for several
years now. They were originally
filed back

21:28.387 --> 21:35.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2010. And I -- after the --
Trump's lawyers
lost their motion on summary
judgment, there

21:35.761 --> 21:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suddenly popped up just a couple
of weeks
ago references to, first, a
deposition that

21:41.267 --> 21:48.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump had been -- given in a
case just last
December, and then also
references to pretrial

21:48.974 --> 21:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conference, getting ready for
trial, witness
lists exchanged.

21:53.145 --> 22:02.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on those witness lists,
Donald Trump stands
front and center. The last
pretrial conference

22:02.388 --> 22:09.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is May 6, and then the
expectations are that
the case will move to trial in
August, which,

22:09.461 --> 22:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
curiously enough, is just a few
weeks after
the Republican Convention.

22:13.032 --> 22:16.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And he's fighting the
judge in
this case, is he not?

22:16.502 --> 22:18.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ISIKOFF: Yes.

22:18.304 --> 22:23.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, as I mentioned before,
he's lost -- his
lawyers have lost their attempts
to have the

22:23.175 --> 22:28.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases thrown out. And Donald
Trump in one
of his recent interviews and in
a campaign

22:28.314 --> 22:32.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appearance said, this is because
the judge
is biased against him.

22:32.952 --> 22:39.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why does he believe the judge is
biased against
him? Because the judge, Gonzalo
Curiel, the

22:39.892 --> 22:44.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal judge, been on the bench
a number
of years, is Hispanic, and Trump
believes

22:44.430 --> 22:49.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of his stance about
building a wall
in Mexico, this has caused the
judge to be

22:49.802 --> 22:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
biased against him in the Trump
University
lawsuit. And he indicated he may
file a motion

22:55.007 --> 22:56.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have the judge recused.

22:56.742 --> 23:04.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know that having a judge
recused based
on his or her ethnicity is going
to carry

23:04.516 --> 23:06.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
muster, though.

23:06.285 --> 23:08.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, Michael, I'm
sure this is
not going to be the last we talk
about this

23:08.220 --> 23:09.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or hear about this.

23:09.421 --> 23:10.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Isikoff, thanks for
joining us.

23:10.723 --> 23:14.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL ISIKOFF: Thank you.

23:14.159 --> 23:27.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last week, we
brought you a
story about the many rural
communities in

23:27.773 --> 23:31.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country affected by a recent
wave of hospital
closures.

23:31.877 --> 23:37.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, special correspondent
Sarah Varney
takes us to Fredericksburg,
Texas, population

23:37.716 --> 23:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10,000, where a hospital is
bucking that trend.
Its turnaround is seen as a
model for other

23:43.956 --> 23:47.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rural hospitals struggling to
keep their doors
open.

23:47.426 --> 23:52.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This story was produced in
collaboration with
our partner Kaiser Health News.

23:52.197 --> 23:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRAD KOTT, Fredericksburg,
Texas: This is
the picture we really love.

23:54.833 --> 23:59.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Brad and Sheryl
Kott didn't
think much of it seven years
ago, when their

23:59.538 --> 24:04.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
13-year-old son, Quinn, a
friendly, energetic
athlete complained he wasn't
feeling well.

24:04.443 --> 24:08.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But soon after, Quinn collapsed
on the bathroom
floor, and his speech was
garbled.

24:08.881 --> 24:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD KOTT: We loaded him in the
back of our
pickup in the second seat, and
we start heading

24:14.386 --> 24:19.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to town to the emergency room
right away.
And on the way, my wife said, I
think he's

24:19.858 --> 24:21.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had a stroke.

24:21.727 --> 24:24.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: After the family
arrived at
Hill Country Memorial Hospital
in Fredericksburg,

24:24.763 --> 24:30.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Kotts say Quinn's medical
care went terribly
wrong. They waited in the E.R.
for hours.

24:30.069 --> 24:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Kotts say the nurses and
E.R. doctor
were unattentive and callous, at
one point

24:34.540 --> 24:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deciding to send Quinn home. His
mother refused.

24:36.975 --> 24:42.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYL KOTT, Fredericksburg,
Texas: I met
the doctor coming down the hall,
and I said,

24:42.281 --> 24:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something is wrong with Quinn.
And he shushed
me, because he didn't want
anybody else to

24:48.087 --> 24:55.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear me. And I said, no, don't
you tell me
to shush. You're the doctor. I'm
the mom.

24:55.928 --> 24:59.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's something wrong with my
son, and I
need to know what's wrong with
my son, and

24:59.631 --> 25:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we are not taking him home.

25:01.467 --> 25:06.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: It wasn't until
the next morning
that a pediatrician finally
examined Quinn.

25:06.505 --> 25:11.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was rushed to a hospital in
San Antonio
and died soon after. He had had
a massive

25:11.710 --> 25:13.379 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stroke.

25:13.412 --> 25:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Dr. Michael Williams, then
Hill Country
Memorial's CEO, Quinn's death in
2009 was

25:17.883 --> 25:19.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a crucible moment.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MICHAEL WILLIAMS, Former
CEO, Hill Country
Memorial: We had a clear
opportunity to do

25:21.520 --> 25:25.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either do what most hospitals
do, and what
we had done previously, which
was get our

25:25.657 --> 25:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attorneys involved, be prepared
for a lawsuit,
take on a defensive mode, try to
really guard

25:32.998 --> 25:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ourselves, or we could take a
different approach
and work directly, reach out to
the family

25:38.404 --> 25:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and ask them to partner with us
in really
transforming the hospital.

25:43.242 --> 25:47.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: In truth, says Dr.
Williams,
who is now president of the
University of

25:47.346 --> 25:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Texas Health Science
Center in Fort
Worth, the hospital's problems
went well beyond

25:52.050 --> 25:53.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the E.R.

25:53.952 --> 25:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MICHAEL WILLIAMS: The
hospital was in
the red on an annual basis. The
patient satisfaction

25:58.924 --> 26:05.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was very low. The employee
satisfaction was
very low. And across the board,
what we heard

26:05.697 --> 26:11.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from people was that this used
to be the community's
hospital, and now people are
leaving the community

26:11.403 --> 26:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to go get their care elsewhere.

26:13.372 --> 26:17.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The troubled
hospital in Fredericksburg
was caught up in larger forces.
Since 2010,

26:17.876 --> 26:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 50 rural hospitals
have closed across
the country and hundreds more
are at risk.

26:23.649 --> 26:28.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rural populations have declined.
And in many
places, those that remain are
largely elderly

26:28.220 --> 26:33.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or uninsured. At the same time,
congressional
budget agreements and the
Affordable Care

26:33.058 --> 26:38.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Act receded Medicare
reimbursement and subsidies
for the uninsured, revenue
losses that many

26:38.864 --> 26:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rural hospitals have been unable
to withstand.

26:41.633 --> 26:47.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deep in the Texas Hill Country,
the hospital
in Fredericksburg was poised to
face a similar

26:47.306 --> 26:57.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fate. Despite the area's live
music scene
and strong tourist economy, the
hospital was

26:57.316 --> 27:01.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the town's largest employer, and
cherished
for much of its history.

27:01.453 --> 27:07.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it opened in 1971, 93
percent of the
county's households contributed
money, and

27:07.326 --> 27:12.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands of people lined up to
have a first
look. Years later, as the
hospital faced the

27:12.865 --> 27:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis of Quinn Kott's death,
Dr. Williams
was determined to bring back
that spirit.

27:18.637 --> 27:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He studied the Toyota plant in
San Antonio,
and hired former Toyota employee
Jeff Darnaby

27:24.743 --> 27:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help bring the car company's
revered assembly
line principles to Hill Country
Memorial.

27:29.281 --> 27:32.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF DARNABY, Hill Country
Memorial: The Toyota
production system basically
allows you to

27:32.050 --> 27:37.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
identify waste, and remove that
waste from
your processes. Anything that
doesn't add

27:37.789 --> 27:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
value to the customer, to the
process is considered
waste.

27:42.561 --> 27:46.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Today, at Hill
Country Memorial,
each department candidly
displays specific

27:46.865 --> 27:52.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goals for everyone to see,
reduce E.R. wait
times, eliminate falls, and
improve customer

27:52.671 --> 27:54.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
satisfaction.

27:54.439 --> 27:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF DARNABY: This is based off
the top five
board that we brought here from
Toyota. We

27:58.944 --> 28:02.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't meet this goal yesterday.
Here's where
we're working on today, so I
know I need to

28:02.381 --> 28:04.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get in this role.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: And this isn't
something that's
just measured once a year or
every quarter.

28:06.985 --> 28:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are sort of real-time
feedback.

28:08.587 --> 28:12.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF DARNABY: Yes, it could be
down to daily
-- daily tracking and reporting.

28:12.991 --> 28:17.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: In addition to
Toyota, Dr. Williams
turned to a former executive
with Southwest

28:17.996 --> 28:23.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Airlines to remake the
hospital's values and
culture, and he hired a former
trainer from

28:23.168 --> 28:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ritz-Carlton, known for its
legendary customer
service, to change how patients
and families

28:28.273 --> 28:30.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were treated.

28:30.075 --> 28:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MICHAEL WILLIAMS: We took
the approach
that, if we took patients and we
treated them

28:33.512 --> 28:37.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better than they'd ever been
treated before,
then, in the end of the day,
they would drive

28:37.115 --> 28:38.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bottom line.

28:38.917 --> 28:42.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Seven years after
Quinn's death,
Hill Country Memorial now ranks
among the

28:42.387 --> 28:47.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
top 100 hospitals in the
country, and recently
won the nation's highest
presidential honor

28:47.793 --> 28:50.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for excellence through
innovation and leadership.

28:50.362 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sweeping changes can be seen
everywhere,
from smaller efforts like
reducing food waste

28:55.033 --> 28:56.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the kitchen...

28:56.368 --> 28:59.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I have problem. I have my
cholesterol,
high cholesterol.

28:59.504 --> 29:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: To helping local
workers like
Domingo Gallegos get healthier
with free nutrition

29:04.910 --> 29:10.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
counseling and access to the
hospital's wellness
center, and to more far-reaching
initiatives

29:10.716 --> 29:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
planned out in the hospital's
so-called war
room, where new ventures are
hatched to improve

29:15.554 --> 29:17.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care and grow the business.

29:17.422 --> 29:21.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: A lot of patients come to
class thinking
they're going to cut out this
much of my leg.

29:21.360 --> 29:25.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: To capitalize on
the abundance
of Medicare- insured retirees in
Texas Hill

29:25.530 --> 29:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Country, the hospital developed
a well-regarded
hip and knee replacement.

29:29.701 --> 29:33.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Total knee replacement
means they're
resurfacing both sides of the
knee.

29:33.538 --> 29:38.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: That program that
has attracted
patients like George Brannies.
At 72, Brannies

29:38.844 --> 29:45.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a fifth-generation Texan from
nearby Mason.
He's a rancher and chairman of
the local bank.

29:45.617 --> 29:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After a riding accident a few
years ago, Brannies
sought care from a renowned
surgeon in San

29:50.122 --> 29:55.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Antonio. When the hip surgery
failed, he decided
to try Hill Country Memorial.
Brannies says

29:55.661 --> 30:00.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his surgeon and nurses were so
exceptional
that he was back on his horse in
four weeks.

30:00.465 --> 30:05.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE BRANNIES, Patient: They
take such good
care of you. It's like doing
business at in

30:05.871 --> 30:11.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a small-town bank. They give you
their cell
numbers. They say, now, if you
have a problem,

30:11.843 --> 30:18.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you call us. Try this with one
of those big
city hospitals. Yes, it doesn't
happen..

30:18.650 --> 30:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The hospital now
performs some
400 hip and knee surgeries a
year, and markets

30:24.890 --> 30:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its nationally recognized
program well beyond
Texas Hill Country.

30:30.195 --> 30:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jayne Pope became CEO of Hill
Country Memorial
in 2013. She attributes much of
the hospital's

30:36.334 --> 30:42.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
success to its fervent and
never-ending focus
on improving patient care,
efforts, Pope says,

30:42.140 --> 30:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that don't need to cost a lot of
money.

30:44.042 --> 30:48.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAYNE POPE, CEO, Hill Country
Memorial: We
know, as a rural center, we
can't do everything.

30:48.547 --> 30:53.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we do is determine what
those core
competencies are, and we invest
in those skills,

30:53.719 --> 30:57.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that our patients have the
best of care.

30:57.055 --> 31:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But not every
rural hospital
can replicate Hill Country
Memorial's success.

31:01.393 --> 31:06.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Len Nichols, a health economist
at George
Mason University, says many
small towns simply

31:06.665 --> 31:08.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can't sustain an acute care
hospital.

31:08.967 --> 31:14.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEN NICHOLS, George Mason
University: We probably
have roughly 20 to 30 percent
more hospitals

31:14.206 --> 31:19.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beds than we actually need. And
so who's going
to lose in the long run? Well,
it's going

31:19.144 --> 31:24.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be those hospitals that are
the least efficient,
those who cannot deliver good
quality services

31:24.549 --> 31:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the lowest possible cost.

31:26.718 --> 31:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Instead, says
Nichols, the dozens
of rural hospitals that have
closed and hundreds

31:31.089 --> 31:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more at risk should consider
converting to
urgent care centers and
partnering with larger

31:35.961 --> 31:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regional hospitals. That would
allow rural
residents to be stabilized and
moved quickly

31:40.832 --> 31:44.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to hospitals where doctors often
have more
expertise.

31:44.703 --> 31:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brad and Sheryl Kott say the
changes at Hill
Country Memorial came too late
for their family.

31:49.107 --> 31:53.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're still haunted by the
treatment their
son Quinn received and the
hospital's ad campaign

31:53.712 --> 31:55.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that trumpets its care as
remarkable.

31:55.580 --> 32:00.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD KOTT: At first, it makes me
sick to my
stomach, because the hospital
wasn't remarkable

32:00.752 --> 32:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at all. And it just -- it tears
at you when
you see a billboard that says
that. However,

32:09.127 --> 32:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know that it has transformed
into -- into
that.

32:15.333 --> 32:24.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it makes me proud that
people in my community
took a bad situation, took our
tragedy and

32:24.075 --> 32:25.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
worked to turn it around.

32:25.977 --> 32:30.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: For the "PBS
NewsHour" and Kaiser
Health News, I'm Sarah Varney in
Fredericksburg,

32:30.048 --> 32:31.817 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Texas.

32:31.850 --> 32:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
the first
part of this series that
explores the struggles

32:35.620 --> 32:47.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hospitals in rural Georgia are
facing on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

32:47.933 --> 33:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Vice President Biden
met with
Israeli and Palestinian leaders
today amid

33:00.879 --> 33:03.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a deadly spike in attacks in
Israel.

33:03.215 --> 33:08.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, an American war
veteran and student,
Taylor Force, was killed in
Jaffa during a

33:08.787 --> 33:14.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
series of stabbings. Today,
after meeting
with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Biden

33:14.426 --> 33:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
condemned the attacks and the
apparent celebration
of the tactic by Palestinian
President Mahmoud

33:19.931 --> 33:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Abbas' political party.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: The kind of violence we
saw yesterday,

33:23.668 --> 33:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the failure to condemn it, the
rhetoric that
incites that violence, the
retribution that

33:28.640 --> 33:35.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it generates, has to stop. There
can't be
-- there cannot be unilateral
steps to undermine

33:35.447 --> 33:40.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trust that only takes us further
away -- further
and further away from an
outcome.

33:40.552 --> 33:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The vice president
also responded
to Iran's test launch of
ballistic missiles

33:45.457 --> 33:50.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capable of reaching Israel. The
Israeli government
has strongly opposed the
U.S.-brokered nuclear

33:50.695 --> 33:53.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deal reached with Iran last
summer.

33:53.531 --> 33:57.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Biden today said, if Iran were
to break the
deal -- quote -- "We will act."

33:57.669 --> 34:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Daniel Estrin
in Jerusalem,
who's covering the story for the
Associated

34:01.806 --> 34:03.541 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Press.

34:03.575 --> 34:07.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Daniel, we have seen months and
months of
these stabbing attacks,
especially horrific.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's behind them?

34:09.147 --> 34:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL ESTRIN, Associated Press:
That's a
good question.

34:11.216 --> 34:16.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Palestinians say that it's the
Israeli military
occupation of the Palestinian
territories,

34:16.621 --> 34:24.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a desperation, that there seems
to be no solution
and no end if sight, and no hope
for a future

34:24.529 --> 34:26.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for them.

34:26.364 --> 34:32.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israeli officials say that this
is a Palestinian
campaign of incitement and lies
fueled by

34:32.871 --> 34:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
social media. And you see a lot,
especially
today on Twitter. The Fatah
Party, the political

34:40.145 --> 34:49.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party of Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas,
posted a photo of a cartoon
basically extolling

34:49.921 --> 34:53.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the stabber that stabbed the
American student.

34:53.425 --> 34:59.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Was there any
concern that the
latest attacks were coordinated
to happen

34:59.064 --> 35:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at the same time as Vice
President Biden's
arrival?

35:01.900 --> 35:08.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL ESTRIN: There's no sense
of that here
in Israel. And Israeli defense
officials have

35:08.139 --> 35:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that this is just a part of
the months
of violence that we have seen
here almost

35:13.611 --> 35:15.413 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every day.

35:15.447 --> 35:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have watched
carefully here
in the U.S. the strained
relations often between

35:19.651 --> 35:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. administration and the
Israeli government.

35:24.422 --> 35:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does Vice President Biden's
strong words today
condemning the Palestinians for
failing to

35:30.362 --> 35:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
respond, does that go -- was
that designed,
or can we tell, to heal that
rift?

35:35.734 --> 35:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL ESTRIN: Well, it's
interesting.

35:38.336 --> 35:44.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joe Biden mentioned today on the
cameras that
he has had a very long
relationship with Prime

35:44.642 --> 35:51.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister Netanyahu, going back
decades. He
said he wasn't here in Israel
with a certain

35:51.449 --> 35:55.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan, a certain peace plan, but
he was here
to speak with his good friend
Netanyahu. His

35:56.021 --> 36:01.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationship is a lot better
with Netanyahu
than President Obama's
relationship is.

36:01.726 --> 36:07.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think the idea here is
that he is
trying to see if there's any
chance of any

36:07.532 --> 36:10.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opening on both sides to move
forward.

36:10.635 --> 36:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is that complicated
by this Iranian
missile test? Obviously, Israel
has no love

36:17.108 --> 36:23.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lost for Iran, and the U.S., to
Israel's point
of view, has accommodated them
too much.

36:23.648 --> 36:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did that -- does that make for
greater tension?

36:27.118 --> 36:34.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL ESTRIN: Yes, this is one
of the main
issues looming over the vice
president's visit

36:34.092 --> 36:40.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Israel, the Iranian deal and
specifically
what America is going to do for
Israel now.

36:40.765 --> 36:47.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And America promised Israel
after it brokered
the nuclear deal with Iran that
it would give

36:47.038 --> 36:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it some kind of compensation,
some kind of
boost in military aid. And now
there are negotiations

36:52.577 --> 37:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the two countries. The
U.S. is offering
a lower number than -- a lower
amount than

37:00.318 --> 37:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Israelis want. Currently,
America gives
Israel about $3 billion a year
in military

37:06.424 --> 37:08.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
aid.

37:08.226 --> 37:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aides to the prime minister,
Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, have
insinuated in recent

37:12.730 --> 37:18.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weeks that Netanyahu's attitude
is, thanks,
but no thanks, Obama
administration. We will

37:18.136 --> 37:20.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wait for the next
administration.

37:20.238 --> 37:26.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And according to Israeli media
today, the
vice president told Netanyahu,
take the deal.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're not going to get a better
one.

37:28.780 --> 37:34.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, the Israeli
government reaction
to the Iranian missile test has
been what?

37:34.052 --> 37:38.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL ESTRIN: Well, it took the
Israelis
a long time actually today
before they put

37:38.323 --> 37:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out a statement just this
evening here.

37:41.693 --> 37:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Israeli Foreign Ministry
said it was dangerous,
the testing of the ballistic
missiles in Iran.

37:48.700 --> 37:54.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said these missiles not
only can reach
Israel, but they have the
capability of carrying

37:54.439 --> 37:59.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a nuclear warhead. And Israel
said this is
just another sign that Iran is
not serious

37:59.244 --> 38:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about curbing its nuclear
program.

38:01.079 --> 38:05.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, finally, as a
backdrop to
all of this, there has been a
teachers strike,

38:05.183 --> 38:10.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Palestinian teachers strike,
and children
have not been in school for some
time. Does

38:10.054 --> 38:13.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that also add to the
complications that we're
seeing?

38:13.124 --> 38:14.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL ESTRIN: It's interesting.

38:14.959 --> 38:19.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These strikes that have been
happening over
the last month are some of the
biggest strikes

38:19.430 --> 38:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have seen in the West
Bank in years.
They're about teachers' wages,
but they're

38:25.637 --> 38:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than that. They're about
challenging
Abbas' rule and frustration
about Abbas' leadership.

38:34.879 --> 38:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's just a general malaise
and frustration
about where things are going in
the West Bank.

38:41.319 --> 38:46.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abbas, the president, is not
very popular
at all in the West Bank, and
this definitely

38:46.858 --> 38:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adds a lot of complications,
when Israel and
the U.S. are asking the
Palestinian leadership

38:53.565 --> 38:56.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to step up and to condemn
certain attacks.

38:56.868 --> 39:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The violence that we have seen
over the past
six months almost has a lot of
support on

39:02.373 --> 39:07.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Palestinian street,
according to polls
here. And so Abbas is really in
a tough spot.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's against violence, but it's
hard for him
to speak out against it.

39:10.848 --> 39:16.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Daniel Estrin in
Jerusalem for
the Associated Press, thank you
so much.

39:16.087 --> 39:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL ESTRIN: You're welcome.

39:22.293 --> 39:30.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will be back to
speak with
the former head of the American
Academy of

39:30.635 --> 39:35.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pediatrics about why doctors
should be screening
children for poverty.

39:35.240 --> 39:40.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take this moment to
hear from
your local PBS station. It's a
chance to offer

39:40.311 --> 39:44.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps keep
programs like
ours on the air.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

39:46.517 --> 40:00.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Finally, new
guidelines are out
today from the American Academy
of Pediatrics.

40:00.331 --> 40:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They recommend that, during
routine checkups,
physicians also screen children
for poverty.

40:02.967 --> 40:04.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that.

40:04.769 --> 40:07.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Census figures
show one
in five children in the country
lives in poverty,

40:07.538 --> 40:12.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which can contribute to higher
rates of asthma
and obesity, poor language
development, and

40:12.243 --> 40:13.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
increased infant mortality.

40:13.945 --> 40:19.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new guidelines encourage
doctors to ask
patients about basic needs, such
as food,

40:19.217 --> 40:23.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
heat and housing during
well-child visits,
and to help them connect with
community resources

40:23.688 --> 40:25.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that might be of help.

40:25.523 --> 40:30.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Renee Jenkins is a former
president of
the American Academy of
Pediatrics who currently

40:30.194 --> 40:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teaches at Howard University
Medical School,
and joins me now.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Jenkins, what does it mean
to screen for
poverty?

40:36.668 --> 40:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. RENEE JENKINS, Former
President, American
Academy of Pediatrics: So, there
are now tools

40:41.205 --> 40:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that help us in the office when
we do well-checks
to really ask parents about food
insecurity,

40:46.644 --> 40:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
housing insecurity, whether
their young children
are in childhood educational
situations, like

40:51.149 --> 40:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Head Start or Early Head Start,
because we
recognize that if we can
intervene early on,

40:57.121 --> 40:59.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very often, we can make a
difference.

40:59.757 --> 41:04.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, I know
people are very
comfortable sharing confidential
information

41:04.295 --> 41:10.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with their doctors, but how do
you start this
conversation, and do people open
up to you

41:10.234 --> 41:11.002 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about it?

41:11.035 --> 41:12.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. RENEE JENKINS: Right.

41:12.870 --> 41:20.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Generally, we start with
something very broad,
like, do you have any problem
making ends

41:20.278 --> 41:25.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meet, OK, and does this happen
often or does
it just happen sometimes?

41:25.450 --> 41:31.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then that opens up a
conversation about
what some of the issues might
be. And I think

41:31.756 --> 41:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are trying to -- what we're
recommending
is that we screen everyone. We
ask an very

41:37.061 --> 41:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
open-ended question like that
and then we
see where that takes us.

41:41.799 --> 41:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure some people are going
to be uncomfortable
to start to do that, but I think
once patients

41:47.772 --> 41:52.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand that, each time I
come, they're
going to ask me something like
that, because

41:52.243 --> 41:57.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a common problem. And as
you mentioned,
you know, one in five children
is living if

41:57.315 --> 41:59.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poverty.

41:59.083 --> 42:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it weren't for the safety
programs,
safety net programs that we
have, it would

42:04.822 --> 42:11.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be even more children. So we're
just trying
to connect parents to the safety
net programs.

42:11.162 --> 42:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how solid
are the links
between poverty and adverse
health outcomes?

42:16.734 --> 42:18.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does the research show?

42:18.503 --> 42:23.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. RENEE JENKINS: The research
shows that
there really are.

42:23.207 --> 42:30.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have known for quite a long
time about
the relationship, for example,
with asthma

42:30.314 --> 42:34.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and poor housing, OK? We have
also known about
nutrition and how, when you're
poor, you tend

42:34.652 --> 42:40.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to buy cheaper foods. Healthy
foods are pretty
expensive. And so in order to
make the food

42:40.892 --> 42:45.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last for the entire month, you
have got to
do that.

42:45.897 --> 42:51.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have always known that.
But there is
new information now about the
stressors that

42:51.803 --> 43:01.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children go through when they're
in poverty
and how these stressors do
handicap them in

43:01.746 --> 43:04.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terms of their developmental
milestones.

43:04.582 --> 43:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, you're
also talking
about longer-term issues.

43:10.087 --> 43:18.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the report, you talk about
gene expression,
brain function, language
development and possible

43:18.229 --> 43:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leads to psychiatric disorder.
All of that
comes from childhood poverty?

43:21.265 --> 43:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. RENEE JENKINS: Well, poverty
certainly
contributes to it.

43:25.870 --> 43:38.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when you take the big
picture and you
look at what's happening within
the neighborhood

43:39.016 --> 43:45.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that these poor children may
live in and those
kind of safe -- unsafe issues,
as well as

43:45.223 --> 43:53.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the stressor on parents,
parents, you know,
want to provide the best for
their children.

43:53.231 --> 43:57.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when they can't, that's
stressful for
them, also.

43:57.335 --> 44:05.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Very often, there are not the
same sort of
ways that we relax when you are
someone who

44:05.843 --> 44:14.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has resources. People who are
poor can't do
that. And so they don't have
ways to necessarily

44:14.051 --> 44:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relieve the stresses that are
associated with
their living conditions.

44:18.656 --> 44:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have got stressed parents,
and obviously,
it impact the child.

44:26.430 --> 44:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, what
you're describing
is a much greater role for a
pediatrician

44:31.235 --> 44:35.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to play now. It's almost like
they're doing
some of the things that a social
worker traditionally

44:35.806 --> 44:37.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does in connecting needs with
resources.

44:37.975 --> 44:48.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. RENEE JENKINS: That's true,
but I think
now there are -- there is more
availability.

44:48.019 --> 44:54.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. RENEE JENKINS: That's true,
but I think
now there are -- there is more
availability.

44:54.926 --> 45:00.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have the Internet, where

45:00.498 --> 45:05.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have the Internet, where

45:26.123 --> 45:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are lots of resources. We
have Web sites.
There are 800-phone numbers, and
so the recommendations

45:39.637 --> 45:46.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not to try to tackle all of
it. OK? What
