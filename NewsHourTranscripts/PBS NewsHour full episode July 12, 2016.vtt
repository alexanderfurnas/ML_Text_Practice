JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.839 --> 00:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:08.642 --> 00:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE W. BUSH, Former President
of the United
States: These slain officers
were the best

00:11.979 --> 00:13.780 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
among us.

00:13.814 --> 00:18.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Addressing a
divided nation,
former President George W. Bush
and President

00:18.285 --> 00:22.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama honor the five officers
who died in
last week's ambush in Dallas.

00:22.890 --> 00:26.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The deepest fault lines of our
democracy have

00:26.159 --> 00:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suddenly been exposed, perhaps
even widened.

00:30.097 --> 00:32.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday:

00:32.132 --> 00:37.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I have come here to make it as
clear as possible

00:37.671 --> 00:40.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as to why I am endorsing Hillary
Clinton.

00:40.307 --> 00:45.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Bernie Sanders
throws his support
behind the presumptive
Democratic nominee.

00:45.178 --> 00:51.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And continuing
our series The
End of AIDS, we go to the South,
America's

00:51.351 --> 00:56.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
epicenter of the outbreak, where
a hard-hit
population is facing significant
barriers

00:56.657 --> 00:58.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to care.

00:58.525 --> 01:00.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MELANIE THOMPSON, Fulton
County Task Force
on HIV/AIDS: Many of my friends
ask me, you

01:00.360 --> 01:04.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, why are you working in
Atlanta? Everybody
works internationally. And I
feel like we

01:04.298 --> 01:07.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a Third World epidemic, in
some ways,
here.

01:07.801 --> 01:15.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:15.776 --> 01:18.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:18.545 --> 01:28.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Attorney General
Loretta Lynch
urged Americans today to bridge
the divide

01:28.355 --> 01:31.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between police and the
communities they serve.

01:31.325 --> 01:36.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She spoke as the president
attended a service
in Dallas for five officers
killed by a sniper.

01:36.830 --> 01:42.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lynch testified at a House
hearing, and said
stopping violence must be a
rallying point

01:42.135 --> 01:44.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for both police and minority
groups.

01:44.404 --> 01:48.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: It is
my hope that, as we all look at
these tragic

01:48.308 --> 01:53.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incidents, that we will take the
opportunity
to draw closer to each other, to
have the

01:53.113 --> 02:00.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
difficult conversations about
race and policing
in this country, involving all
sides, involving

02:00.387 --> 02:02.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all issues and all points of
view.

02:02.956 --> 02:08.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Lynch also faced a
battery of
Republican questions about the
investigation

02:08.295 --> 02:13.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into Hillary Clinton's e-mail
use. She defended
the decision not to charge
Clinton, but refused

02:13.967 --> 02:15.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to discuss details of the
investigation.

02:15.969 --> 02:20.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton
finally got
the endorsement today that she's
been waiting

02:20.240 --> 02:25.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for from primary season rival
Bernie Sanders.
The Vermont senator appeared
with Clinton

02:25.612 --> 02:31.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New Hampshire and promised to
help defeat
Republican Donald Trump in
November. We will

02:31.151 --> 02:35.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear what each had to say, and
look at what
today's moves means for the
Democratic Party,

02:35.856 --> 02:37.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
later in the program.

02:37.624 --> 02:41.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In South Sudan, the
capital city
of Juba was quiet after a
cease-fire took

02:41.995 --> 02:48.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hold. At least 272 people had
been killed
in five days of fighting between
rival factions.

02:48.402 --> 02:53.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the United Nations
reported at
least 36,000 people are seeking
shelter at

02:53.907 --> 02:59.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. sites and other locations.
And embassies
and aid groups began evacuating
staffers.

02:59.946 --> 03:05.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At least 22
people were killed
in Southern Italy today when two
commuter

03:05.452 --> 03:11.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trains collided head on at high
speed. It
happened on a single track line
between two

03:11.792 --> 03:17.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
towns in the region of Puglia.
Rescue workers
searched through mangled
wreckage, looking

03:17.197 --> 03:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for survivors and dozens of
injured.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Italian prime minister
interrupted
a trip to Milan.

03:23.904 --> 03:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTEO RENZI, Italian Prime
Minister (through
translator): After this very
brief greeting

03:29.543 --> 03:33.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to you, I will go back straight
to Rome because
of the train crash. And I have
ordered an

03:33.547 --> 03:38.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immediate investigation into
what happened.
I think absolute clarity must be
made on this.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will not stop until we
understand what
happened.

03:40.687 --> 03:45.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Officials said
they won't be
sure of the final death toll
until a giant

03:45.325 --> 03:47.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crane can pull the wreckage
apart.

03:47.594 --> 03:52.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, House Republican
leaders confirmed there will not
be a vote

03:52.466 --> 03:57.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on gun control legislation until
after the
summer recess. Majority Leader
Kevin McCarthy

03:57.704 --> 04:01.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said it will wait until they
return in September.

04:01.508 --> 04:05.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party leaders have been unable
to round up
enough votes for their bill to
ban people

04:05.545 --> 04:08.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the terror watch list from
buying guns.

04:08.281 --> 04:12.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a big day on
Wall Street:
The Dow Jones industrial average
reached a

04:12.552 --> 04:21.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
record high, gaining 120 points
to close at
18347. The Nasdaq rose 34 points
and the S&amp;P

04:21.995 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
500 was up 15, adding to its
record close
yesterday.

04:26.266 --> 04:31.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Still to come on the
"NewsHour":
President Obama's call for
healing at a Dallas

04:31.671 --> 04:38.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police memorial; will Bernie
Sanders supporters
follow his lead?; China doubles
down on its

04:38.178 --> 04:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
claims in the South China Sea;
and much more.

04:44.818 --> 04:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dallas mourned
its dead today,
the police officers cut down by
a sniper.

04:57.164 --> 05:02.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The occasion was an interfaith
memorial service,
where President Obama offered
reassurance

05:02.903 --> 05:08.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a summons to build a better
country.

05:08.341 --> 05:14.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a moment to honor the
five officers
who died in Dallas and to speak
to a nation

05:14.214 --> 05:18.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on edge after days of bloodshed,
protest and
racial tension:

05:18.752 --> 05:21.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
It's as if the deepest fault
lines of our

05:21.821 --> 05:27.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
democracy have suddenly been
exposed, perhaps
even widened.

05:27.160 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And although we know that such
divisions are
not new, though they have surely
been worse

05:33.667 --> 05:41.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in even the recent past, that
offers us little
comfort.

05:41.241 --> 05:46.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Faced with this violence, we
wonder if the
divides of race in America can
ever be bridged.

05:46.046 --> 05:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand how Americans are
feeling. But,
Dallas, I'm here to say, we must
reject such

05:55.355 --> 06:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
despair. I'm here to insist that
we are not
as divided as we seem.

06:01.728 --> 06:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The ceremony took
place at
the Meyerson Symphony Center,
minutes from

06:06.399 --> 06:12.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the site of the sniper attack
that erupted
during a peaceful protest last
Thursday night.

06:12.706 --> 06:19.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five seats were left open,
holding American
flags and police caps, in
tribute to the slain

06:19.112 --> 06:20.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
policemen.

06:20.880 --> 06:26.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: And despite the
fact police
conduct was the subject of
protest, despite

06:26.219 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that there must have
been signs,
or slogans, or chants with which
they profoundly

06:32.525 --> 06:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disagreed, these men and this
department did
their jobs, like the
professionals that they

06:44.571 --> 06:46.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
were.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The sniper, Micah
Johnson,
told negotiators, during a
standoff, that

06:50.210 --> 06:56.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he wanted revenge for police
killings of black
men, including last week in
Baton Rouge and

06:56.549 --> 07:02.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
St. Paul. Those killings sparked
widespread
protests, and the president
today urged each

07:02.756 --> 07:04.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
side to understand the other.

07:04.624 --> 07:09.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: When all this
takes place more
than 50 years after the passage
of the Civil

07:09.596 --> 07:18.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rights Act, we cannot simply
turn away and
dismiss those in peaceful
protest as troublemakers

07:18.171 --> 07:19.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or paranoid.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.274 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

07:21.308 --> 07:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: We also know that
so much of
the tensions between police
departments and

07:28.615 --> 07:35.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minority communities that they
serve is because
we ask the police to do too
much, and we ask

07:35.622 --> 07:37.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
too little of ourselves.

07:37.490 --> 07:43.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protesters, you know it. You
know how dangerous
some of the communities where
these police

07:43.196 --> 07:52.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officers serve are. And you
pretend as if
there's no context. These
things, we know

07:52.672 --> 07:54.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be true.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president had
cut short
his trip to Europe to attend the
service.

07:58.011 --> 08:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was joined by the first lady
and Vice President
and Mrs. Biden, as well as
former President

08:04.184 --> 08:08.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
George W. Bush and his wife,
Laura, who make
their home in Dallas.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEORGE W. BUSH, Former President
of the United
States: Most of us imagine, if
the moment

08:10.523 --> 08:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called for, that we would risk
our lives to
protect a spouse or a child.
Those wearing

08:19.032 --> 08:25.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the uniform assume that risk for
the safety
of strangers.

08:25.205 --> 08:30.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They and their families share
the unspoken
knowledge that each new day can
bring new

08:30.710 --> 08:40.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dangers. But none of us were
prepared or could
be prepared for an ambush by
hatred and malice.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The shock of this evil still has
not faded.

08:43.957 --> 08:49.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hundreds of
others attended
the tribute as well, among them,
dozens of

08:49.396 --> 08:55.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law enforcement officers from
Galveston County,
Texas. A local judge paid for a
bus to bring

08:56.002 --> 08:59.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officers on the 300-mile
pre-dawn trip.

08:59.706 --> 09:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the end, the president
lamented he had
spoken to too many memorial
services during

09:05.078 --> 09:10.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his time in the White House, and
he appealed
to Americans to look deep into
their hearts.

09:10.450 --> 09:14.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: And if we cannot
talk about
these things, if we cannot talk
honestly and

09:14.754 --> 09:22.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
openly, not just in the comfort
of own circles,
but with those who look
different than us

09:23.029 --> 09:35.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or bring a different
perspective, then we
will never break this dangerous
cycle. In

09:35.508 --> 09:44.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the end, it's not about finding
policies that
work. It's about forging
consensus and fighting

09:44.217 --> 09:51.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cynicism and finding the will to
make change.

09:51.057 --> 09:57.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After the
service, the Obamas
met privately with officers
wounded in the

09:57.063 --> 10:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack, as well as the families
of those killed.
Funerals for the slain officers
begin tomorrow.

10:08.575 --> 10:18.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: After winning 13

10:24.824 --> 10:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Bernie Sanders formally
stepped aside
today, throwing his weight to
presumptive

10:29.496 --> 10:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic nominee Hillary
Clinton.

10:31.798 --> 10:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, both turned their focus to
Donald Trump.
It was everywhere, emblazoned on
the campaign

10:38.104 --> 10:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stage and all of the signs,
"Stronger Together,"
the Clinton campaign motto.

10:43.376 --> 10:50.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, it took on an
unmistakably altered
meaning, as Bernie Sanders and
Hillary Clinton

10:50.116 --> 10:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
joined forces for the first
time.

10:52.152 --> 10:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I have come here to make it as
clear as possible

10:58.157 --> 11:01.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as to why I am endorsing Hillary
Clinton.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

11:02.996 --> 11:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The announcement
came in Portsmouth,
New Hampshire, the state that
handed Sanders

11:06.499 --> 11:11.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his first Democratic primary
victory, and
set up the protracted battle for
the party's

11:11.938 --> 11:13.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nomination.

11:13.740 --> 11:18.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: It is no
secret that
Hillary Clinton and I disagree
on a number

11:18.077 --> 11:23.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of issues. At the Democratic
platform committee,
which ended Sunday night in
Orlando, there

11:23.850 --> 11:31.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was a significant coming
together between
the two campaigns, and we
produced, by far,

11:31.457 --> 11:36.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most progressive platform in
the history
of the Democratic Party.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

11:38.431 --> 11:42.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Sanders didn't get
all he wanted
in the proposed platform, but
now it does

11:42.168 --> 11:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
include a plank calling for
tougher regulations
on Wall Street, language
supporting a $15-an-hour

11:49.042 --> 11:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal minimum wage, and
stronger words on
climate change.

11:54.180 --> 11:59.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Sanders called Clinton
far and away
the best candidate in November.
Clinton, in

11:59.953 --> 12:01.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
turn, appealed to his
supporters.

12:01.921 --> 12:04.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm asking you to keep working
in the weeks,

12:04.657 --> 12:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months, and, yes, years ahead.
You will always
have a seat at the table when I
am in the

12:11.331 --> 12:13.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

12:13.199 --> 12:17.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The event also
allowed the former
rivals to form a united front
against a common

12:17.670 --> 12:21.040 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
foe, Republican
nominee-in-waiting Donald
Trump.

12:21.074 --> 12:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: While
Donald Trump is
busy insulting Mexicans, and
Muslims, and

12:27.246 --> 12:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women, and African-Americans and
our veterans,
Hillary Clinton understands that
our diversity

12:35.588 --> 12:38.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is one of our greatest
strengths.

12:38.524 --> 12:43.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Trump
and his cronies
are trying to pull the wool over
our eyes

12:43.129 --> 12:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and come back with the same
failed policies
that hurt us before.

12:47.100 --> 12:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In response, the
Trump campaign
fired off press release after
press release,

12:52.805 --> 12:58.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
many of them contrasting
Sanders' past statements
about Clinton with his
endorsement today.

12:58.811 --> 13:03.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One Trump attack took aim at
Clinton for the
former secretary of state's past
involvement

13:03.349 --> 13:09.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, a proposed
trade deal that Sanders strongly
opposes.

13:09.389 --> 13:15.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton repeated today that she
now opposes
the TPP as well. Still to come:
details on

13:15.928 --> 13:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders' role at the party's
upcoming convention
and in the fall campaign.

13:21.601 --> 13:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Will the Sanders supporters get
on board?

13:23.603 --> 13:28.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look at that road ahead for
Democrats with
Sanders supporter and former
Ohio State Senator

13:28.041 --> 13:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nina Turner and former six-term
Vermont governor
and presidential candidate
Howard Dean, a

13:33.680 --> 13:35.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton supporter.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Governor Dean, does an
endorsement like
that -- you have been here. You
have been

13:38.985 --> 13:44.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the campaign trail. You have
conceded before.
Does an endorsement like that
matter?

13:44.090 --> 13:47.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD DEAN, Former Presidential
Candidate:
It does matter. It's actually
harder for the

13:47.160 --> 13:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supporters to get on board than
it is the
candidate.

13:49.929 --> 13:53.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the candidate leads the way,
and this
is a big deal.

13:53.433 --> 13:59.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Nina Turner, a lot
of Sanders
supporters, maybe not in that
room, have been

13:59.305 --> 14:03.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying that Sanders sold out.
What are you
telling them?

14:03.076 --> 14:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA TURNER (D), Former Ohio
State Senator:
Well, Gwen, the senator has made
clear from

14:06.145 --> 14:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the beginning that he was going
to do everything
necessary he could to defeat Mr.
Trump.

14:11.050 --> 14:16.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And part of that promise that he
has made
begins today. And I do agree
with the governor.

14:16.289 --> 14:22.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is definitely hard for
supporters, and
probably harder than the
candidate. And, yes,

14:22.261 --> 14:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all over Twitter, all over my
direct messages,
texts, phone calls, there are
people who support

14:27.366 --> 14:29.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the senator who are very
disappointed.

14:29.469 --> 14:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has to be a grieving
process, some space
for Senator Sanders supporters
to kind of

14:34.373 --> 14:38.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
digest this, because his
supporters, people
like me and others, never wanted
this day

14:38.811 --> 14:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come. We have always wanted
Senator Sanders
to be that nominee. And, so,
yes, there is

14:42.982 --> 14:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of hurting going on out
there.

14:44.817 --> 14:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Howard Dean,
what happens?
How do you bring that hurting to
a point which

14:48.888 --> 14:51.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helps the actual presumptive
nominee?

14:51.124 --> 14:53.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD DEAN: Well, actually,
some of it has
already been done.

14:53.226 --> 14:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The platform -- really, Bernie
had a huge
influence on the platform. So,
from an issues

14:58.097 --> 15:02.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point of view, most of the
Sanders supporters
have gotten most of what they
want. That is

15:02.735 --> 15:04.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to help a lot.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second of all, Bernie is going
to do some
vigorous campaigning because
this platform

15:07.273 --> 15:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a platform that Bernie likes.
And so, over
time, I think these wounds do
heal. I think

15:14.480 --> 15:19.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not only did most of my
supporters support
John Kerry enthusiastically. A
lot of my staff

15:19.619 --> 15:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
went to work for John Kerry. And
it was tough.

15:22.188 --> 15:25.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a bitter primary, just as
this one
has been. But, look, you have
got to do what's

15:25.925 --> 15:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right for the country in the
end. And what's
right is Hillary Clinton and
what's wrong

15:30.062 --> 15:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the country is Donald Trump.

15:31.798 --> 15:36.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, Governor Dean,
let me ask
you this. Hillary Clinton in
2008 decided

15:36.035 --> 15:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to concede one week after Barack
Obama clinched
the nomination. This took a
little longer.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did Senator Sanders take too
long to endorse?

15:45.278 --> 15:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD DEAN: Absolutely not.
Everybody has
to do this at their own pace and
with their

15:48.981 --> 15:51.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
own supporters in mind.

15:51.551 --> 15:55.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Bernie -- because Bernie
had such
an influence on the platform, I
think that's

15:55.955 --> 16:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enormously helpful. He needed
that extra time.
The platform changed, more
concessions than

16:01.194 --> 16:04.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think most would have
expected. I think
that is going to help bring his
supporters

16:04.764 --> 16:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on board. And we need them.

16:06.432 --> 16:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Nina Turner, did the
platform
change enough for you, and does
it matter

16:10.603 --> 16:15.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what the Democratic platform is
if the words
are different coming out of the
candidate's

16:15.208 --> 16:16.976 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mouth?

16:17.009 --> 16:20.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA TURNER: Well, it certainly
changed. But
for Senator Sanders continuing
to push, we

16:20.479 --> 16:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't have the $15 minimum
wage for federal,
that being affirmed in the
platform, abolishing

16:26.219 --> 16:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the death penalty, moving
marijuana, for example,
off of the federal Schedule 1.

16:31.524 --> 16:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Senator Sanders and his
supporters have
a lot to be proud of. But in
terms of the

16:36.295 --> 16:41.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TPP, of course, we are
disappointed. Senator
Sanders -- and I was there in
Orlando. I was

16:41.500 --> 16:46.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the platform committee
members, and
we fought vigorously to get the
Democratic

16:46.105 --> 16:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party to say that they'd oppose
any vote on
the TPP in the lame-duck
session, but that

16:50.676 --> 16:51.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
didn't happen.

16:51.477 --> 16:51.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But let me ask
you...

16:52.011 --> 16:53.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:53.512 --> 16:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NINA TURNER: So, we still have
much more work
to do, Gwen. We really do.

16:55.281 --> 16:59.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it doesn't -- the senator
always said
that this wasn't about him, it's
about us.

16:59.285 --> 17:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there has to be folks out
there like
myself and others who will make
sure, to your

17:03.556 --> 17:08.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point, that that platform is not
just something
that's wonderful words on a
sheet of paper,

17:08.995 --> 17:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that if a Democrat wins, that
that platform
is executed through policy.

17:12.865 --> 17:16.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, as you point
out, yes, you
were on the platform committee.
And we heard

17:16.369 --> 17:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton say, with great
force, that
she opposes the TPP, the
Trans-Pacific Partnership

17:23.976 --> 17:25.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trade agreement.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why isn't that enough? Why
does it matter
whether it's in the platform?
Doesn't it matter

17:28.681 --> 17:30.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what the candidate says?

17:30.449 --> 17:32.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA TURNER: Well, it needs to
be in there
because that is something that
we affirm,

17:32.785 --> 17:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we affirm it very strongly.
And if both
candidates made it clear that
they oppose

17:37.857 --> 17:42.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, Senator Sanders had the
opportunity to
push the secretary further left
on that, then

17:42.695 --> 17:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it shouldn't have been any
problem with the
platform committee members of
both candidates

17:48.134 --> 17:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voting to make sure that the TPP
wasn't voted
on in the lame-duck.

17:51.304 --> 17:56.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But that didn't happen,
unfortunately. But,
Gwen, it gives us something more
to continue

17:56.175 --> 18:00.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fight for. Again, to Senator
Sanders supporters,
I want to say that this is not
the end, it

18:00.846 --> 18:06.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the beginning. And the
revolution, the
political revolution that he has
started must

18:06.052 --> 18:10.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continue, because we have to
hold people accountable
to the platform, because a lot
of people out

18:10.056 --> 18:14.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, Gwen, are concerned that
the platform
is just that, just pretty words
on a piece

18:14.060 --> 18:14.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of paper.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

18:16.228 --> 18:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD DEAN: Although, in
fairness, there
was a third problem, a third
party at the

18:18.064 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
table with the TPP, and that was
President
Obama.

18:20.733 --> 18:25.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it would have been
incredibly unusual
to have a very successful
president, which

18:25.204 --> 18:30.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama has been,
rebuked by the Democratic
Party platform. And I think that
was why the

18:30.576 --> 18:34.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TPP wasn't in the platform. It
would have
been seen as a rebuke to the
president of

18:34.347 --> 18:36.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States, who's done, I
think, a
great job.

18:36.882 --> 18:40.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NINA TURNER: He's done a
tremendous job, but
I don't necessarily consider --
I don't agree

18:40.953 --> 18:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the governor on that.

18:42.788 --> 18:45.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, the president has done
a great job,
but people in the same family
can disagree.

18:45.725 --> 18:46.125 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:46.158 --> 18:47.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, let me ask you about
disagreeing in
the family. You, Nina Turner,
have been on

18:49.462 --> 18:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the record calling for perhaps a
third party.
Is that off the table now?

18:54.567 --> 19:00.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NINA TURNER: Well, I think that
both parties
could certainly benefit from
having another

19:00.973 --> 19:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party challenge -- challenge us
to do better.

19:03.876 --> 19:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am a Democrat. I have been a
lifelong Democrat,
but I'm not just a Democrat to
be a Democrat.

19:08.381 --> 19:12.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am a Democrat because of the
principles
and the values that we uphold,
and if we are

19:12.284 --> 19:15.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the strongest party, then we
shouldn't fear
other competition.

19:15.821 --> 19:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Howard Dean, what,
in the end
-- you have known Bernie Sanders
for a long

19:20.960 --> 19:24.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time. You're from the same
state. You both
have run for president. And I'm
certain that

19:24.930 --> 19:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have been watching this all
very closely.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did he ultimately bring to
this campaign?

19:30.870 --> 19:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD DEAN: Bernie Sanders in
some ways was
more of a mover in this campaign
than anybody

19:37.743 --> 19:39.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

19:39.512 --> 19:43.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The core issue -- and we have
seen it all
over the world -- and the
British just had

19:43.883 --> 19:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a very unfortunate vote -- where
people left
behind by globalization are
lashing out. And

19:50.723 --> 19:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie crystallized that and
talked about
the issues that we have to fix
if globalization

19:56.395 --> 19:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to work and if our
country is going
to be strong.

19:59.098 --> 20:03.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to help the people who
have been left
behind. We have to have better
schools, better

20:03.135 --> 20:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
educational opportunities,
better inclusion,
better support of working people
who aren't

20:08.541 --> 20:14.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefiting from globalization,
better tax
rules that aid creation of jobs
than -- more

20:14.246 --> 20:18.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so than creating opportunities
to shift paper
around on Wall Street.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are the things that Bernie
brought to
the table, and those are in the
platform.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he's transformed the
Democratic Party
and I think he's done it in a
very positive

20:25.858 --> 20:27.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

20:27.626 --> 20:30.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Former Vermont
Governor Howard
Dean, former Ohio state Senator
Nina Turner,

20:30.830 --> 20:32.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you both very much.

20:32.898 --> 20:40.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NINA TURNER: Thank you, Gwen.

20:40.506 --> 20:46.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOWARD DEAN: Thank you.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

20:50.416 --> 20:56.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
AIDS in Atlanta,
where gay black men are among
those most affected;

20:56.989 --> 21:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the disconnect between what high
schoolers
are taught and what actually
happens in politics;

21:02.895 --> 21:06.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the family of a war
correspondent suing
the Syrian government.

21:06.866 --> 21:13.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: A judgment was
handed down today
by an international tribunal
that could have

21:13.172 --> 21:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
far-reaching effects in Asia. It
began as
a dispute between China and the
Philippines

21:18.911 --> 21:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over a huge expanse of the South
China Sea,
and China's assertion of control
there in

21:24.850 --> 21:26.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
waters claimed by many
countries.

21:26.752 --> 21:32.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The area is a major fishing,
trade and energy
production corridor. And, today,
the Permanent

21:32.791 --> 21:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Court of Arbitration in The
Hague ruled against
China.

21:36.462 --> 21:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this dispute, on the
case, and
its implications, I'm joined by
Bonnie Glaser

21:41.133 --> 21:44.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Center for Strategic and
International
Studies.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bonnie Glaser, welcome to the
"NewsHour."

21:46.705 --> 21:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remind us, first of all, what
was the dispute
that this international tribunal
was asked

21:51.510 --> 21:53.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to resolve?

21:53.512 --> 21:55.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER, Center for
Strategic and International
Studies: Well, the Philippines
brought this

21:55.648 --> 22:02.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case against China in January
2013, and there
are 15 requests that it made.

22:02.788 --> 22:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not about sovereignty
over territory,
because this tribunal is not
empowered to

22:07.693 --> 22:13.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rule on sovereignty issues
regarding territory,
but the Philippines was asking
other things.

22:13.632 --> 22:22.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was asking, for example, that
China's nine-dash-line
claim be ruled invalid and that
China be told

22:22.107 --> 22:28.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that it doesn't have any
historic rights that
can be applied to waters that
give it any

22:28.147 --> 22:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
special rights to have fishing
or energy exploitation
in waters that are in exclusive
economic zone

22:36.622 --> 22:38.424 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Philippines.

22:38.457 --> 22:45.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Philippines also asked that
the tribunal
rule on the status of eight of
the features.

22:45.064 --> 22:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the tribunal ruled on most
of those and
importantly found none of the
features are

22:51.437 --> 23:00.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
full islands. So, none of them
get a 200-nautical-mile
exclusive economic zone. They
just get a 12-nautical-mile

23:00.479 --> 23:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
territorial sea if they're a
rock, and some
of them are underwater, and they
get no maritime

23:05.584 --> 23:06.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entitlement whatsoever.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:08.454 --> 23:11.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me just
stop you
there. What was China arguing
was the basis

23:11.423 --> 23:13.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for its territorial claim, then?

23:13.826 --> 23:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER: Well, China has
argued, as
has five other claimants, that
they own many

23:20.232 --> 23:25.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the islands. Some of them,
like China and
Taiwan, claim all of the islands
in the South

23:25.337 --> 23:27.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
China Sea.

23:27.273 --> 23:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This particular set of islands
is in the Spratlys.
It's the southern part of the
South China

23:31.043 --> 23:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sea. And the Chinese rejected
this ruling
from the outset. They claimed
that the tribunal

23:36.482 --> 23:42.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't have jurisdiction on any
of these issues.
So, the Chinese refused to
participate in

23:42.688 --> 23:48.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the tribunal ruling. And they
have claimed
that it is not binding on China.

23:48.427 --> 23:53.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, according to the Convention
on the Law
of the Sea -- and China is a
state party -- it

23:53.198 --> 23:56.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is binding on both parties, the
Philippines
and China.

23:56.969 --> 24:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what does
it mean, then?
China, as you say, is rejecting
the ruling.

24:00.606 --> 24:04.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're saying it's an invalid
-- was invalid
for the court to even consider
this. What

24:04.810 --> 24:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does it mean, then? Is it
enforceable in any
way, this decision?

24:08.147 --> 24:14.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER: There is no
enforcement mechanism,
Judy, under the Convention on
the Law of the

24:14.286 --> 24:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sea. And so it's really left up
to the international
community to encourage China to
be a law-abiding

24:22.761 --> 24:28.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizen and for China to see
that it's in
its interest to not be an
outlaw.

24:28.467 --> 24:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China wants to, I believe, rise
peacefully.
It doesn't want to have
confrontation with

24:33.005 --> 24:39.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its neighbors. So I think this
is going to
create some thinking, maybe
rethinking in

24:39.545 --> 24:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China about its approach top its
neighbors,
I hope. But in the short run,
we're likely

24:44.516 --> 24:50.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see increased tensions, and I
think that
the Chinese might take some
steps to reassert

24:50.622 --> 24:55.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their claims, because Xi Jinping
will face
pressure domestically.

24:55.194 --> 25:02.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has lost face on this issue,
because this
award, as they call it, the
decision, was

25:02.434 --> 25:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost completely in favor of
the Philippines.
It was very one-sided.

25:07.039 --> 25:12.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you do see
China, perhaps,
rethinking its approach on this?
And, just

25:12.911 --> 25:18.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly, effect on the United
States, which
clearly has a lot at stake with
its allies

25:18.384 --> 25:20.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the Pacific?

25:20.185 --> 25:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER: Yes, well, the
United States
has made its interests quite
clear in the

25:23.422 --> 25:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pacific. It wants to have a
rules-based order
and wants to see China part of
that rules-based

25:29.194 --> 25:30.863 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

25:30.896 --> 25:34.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we will have to see going
forward whether
this becomes a source of renewed
tensions

25:34.233 --> 25:38.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the South China Sea between
China and its
neighbors and between the U.S.
and China,

25:39.004 --> 25:44.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or whether we can put this issue
on a diplomatic
track and find ways for
bilateral fishing

25:44.576 --> 25:50.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
agreements, joint energy
exploration and other
ways, solve these disputes, and
find ways

25:50.449 --> 25:51.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to cooperate.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of
questions coming out
of this ruling.

25:53.819 --> 25:58.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bonnie Glaser with CSIS, the
Center for Strategic
and International Studies, we
thank you.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BONNIE GLASER: Thank you.

26:02.227 --> 26:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tonight, we continue
our series
The end of AIDS.

26:12.738 --> 26:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, we looked at San
Francisco and
at one of the nation's most
ambitious plans

26:17.142 --> 26:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to curtail AIDS. Tonight, we
turn to a city
where the struggle is much more
difficult.

26:21.980 --> 26:27.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Atlanta, Georgia, and much of
the Southeast
is, by some measures, the
epicenter of America's

26:27.252 --> 26:29.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AIDS crisis.

26:29.054 --> 26:32.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as correspondent William
Brangham and
producer Jason Kane report, the
barriers to

26:32.825 --> 26:35.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stemming the epidemic there are
enormous.

26:35.894 --> 26:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This report was supported by the
Pulitzer
Center on Crisis Reporting.

26:40.499 --> 26:46.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The alarm
bells rarely stop
in the inpatient and isolation
wards at Grady

26:46.271 --> 26:48.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Memorial Hospital.

26:48.607 --> 26:54.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in Atlanta, just down the
street from
the CDC, in 2016, in the age of
lifesaving

26:54.580 --> 26:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
antiretroviral drugs, hundreds
of people are
still dying every year from
AIDS.

26:59.618 --> 27:03.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CARLOS DEL RIO, Emory Center
for AIDS
Research: The epidemic of HIV in
America is

27:03.522 --> 27:08.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forgotten, but not gone. People
have forgotten
it exists. I think I have a
better chance

27:08.060 --> 27:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of winning the lottery than I
have of ending
AIDS in where we are today,
right?

27:11.997 --> 27:16.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
Southeastern U.S. is
the epicenter of America's
epidemic. These

27:16.368 --> 27:21.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states make up 44 percent of
people living
with HIV, and they make up half
of all new

27:22.007 --> 27:23.775 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HIV diagnoses.

27:23.809 --> 27:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CARLOS DEL RIO: It's almost
like the South
is a different country. It
really is about

27:27.746 --> 27:33.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poverty, the social determinants
of health,
racism. It's really a bunch of
different things.

27:33.418 --> 27:37.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Carlos Del Rio
is one of
Atlanta's leading HIV doctors.
He co-directs

27:37.389 --> 27:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Emory Center for AIDS
Research, and sees
patients at Grady.

27:41.026 --> 27:46.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Often, he says, patients have no
idea of their
HIV status until it's nearly too
late.

27:46.265 --> 27:50.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CARLOS DEL RIO: Half those
people we diagnose
here already have AIDS. In other
words, they

27:50.068 --> 27:52.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been infected for five,
six, 10 years.

27:52.604 --> 27:56.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Russell Martin
was one of
them. Black gay men are one of
the hardest-hit

27:56.975 --> 27:59.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
populations here in the
Southeast.

27:59.177 --> 28:03.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Martin thought he was perfectly
healthy, until
one day he came down with a
fever.

28:03.115 --> 28:08.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUSSELL MARTIN, AIDS Patient:
I'm just thinking
it was a cold. I have asthma, so
I'm prone

28:08.554 --> 28:11.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to having pneumonia, so I'm
like, OK, maybe
it's just pneumonia.

28:12.024 --> 28:16.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: By the time he
checked into
Grady, he was so sick that
doctors induced

28:16.562 --> 28:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a near-coma in a desperate
attempt to save
him. He woke up to learn that he
had HIV,

28:21.934 --> 28:25.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it had progressed to AIDS, and
that he had
nearly died.

28:25.704 --> 28:29.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not that Martin didn't know
about HIV
or wasn't being careful. In
fact, he once

28:29.775 --> 28:32.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worked at an HIV clinic and got
tested regularly.

28:32.878 --> 28:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUSSELL MARTIN: I got routine
checks until
I got into a relationship. And
it was once

28:38.617 --> 28:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was in a relationship, I
didn't do it.

28:40.419 --> 28:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Because you
thought, "I'm
in a monogamous relationship, I
don't need

28:44.122 --> 28:45.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be tested."

28:45.390 --> 28:47.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUSSELL MARTIN: That's true.
That's what I
was thinking.

28:47.292 --> 28:51.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: While Martin
is currently
on treatment and doing well,
he's become further

28:51.363 --> 28:54.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
evidence for an alarming
projection.

28:54.066 --> 28:58.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to a recent analysis
that was done
by the CDC here in Atlanta, if
current trends

28:58.637 --> 29:05.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
persist, half of gay and
bisexual black men
will be diagnosed with HIV in
their lifetimes,

29:05.510 --> 29:07.346 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
half.

29:07.379 --> 29:09.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fulton County Commissioner Joan
Garner has
been helping lead the push to
change the course

29:09.848 --> 29:14.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the epidemic here in Atlanta.
She started
after hearing that few cities in
the country

29:14.586 --> 29:16.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have higher rates of HIV

29:16.421 --> 29:21.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN GARNER, Fulton County
Commissioner: The
information has been out there.
Research is

29:21.693 --> 29:28.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out there. Treatments --
treatment is out
there. And I was just floored
when I heard

29:28.700 --> 29:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, and I said, we have got to
do something
about this.

29:31.036 --> 29:33.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN EAVES, Fulton County
Chairman: We certainly
have some new leadership.

29:33.171 --> 29:37.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Two years ago,
Garner and
council Chair John Eaves
assembled the Fulton

29:37.476 --> 29:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
County Task Force on HIV/AIDS.
Fulton County
makes up the bulk of the city of
Atlanta.

29:42.714 --> 29:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: This really shouldn't be
a conversation
anymore. This is low-hanging
fruit. We swing

29:48.320 --> 29:50.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the gate literally from one end
to the other.

29:50.222 --> 29:53.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Like San
Francisco, which
we reported on earlier, they are
one of the

29:53.792 --> 29:59.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first local governments in the
U.S. to formalize
a plan for ending AIDS. The
exact budget and

29:59.264 --> 30:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
timeline of their work is yet to
be determined.

30:01.099 --> 30:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MELANIE THOMPSON, Fulton
County Task Force
on HIV/AIDS: There are a lot of
people who

30:03.035 --> 30:05.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are working on this, not
necessarily working
together.

30:05.704 --> 30:09.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Melanie
Thompson is
helping lead the task force. She
says it's

30:09.541 --> 30:13.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unbelievable to her that it's
taken this long
to get started.

30:13.111 --> 30:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MELANIE THOMPSON: It's
horrifying. I mean,
frankly, we have had a
smoldering epidemic

30:17.516 --> 30:25.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here for a long time. But when
you get a little
bit of political will, it goes a
long way,

30:25.724 --> 30:27.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that is something that we
have never had
here.

30:27.993 --> 30:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But the
challenges are daunting,
something the task force has
been hearing

30:31.396 --> 30:36.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about as they have traveled
across the county,
meeting with various groups,
from gay, bisexual

30:36.034 --> 30:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and transgender organizations to
those who
inject drugs.

30:40.472 --> 30:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's estimated there are 3,000
HIV-positive
people in the county who don't
know they're

30:45.077 --> 30:48.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
infected, meaning they could
unknowingly be
spreading the virus to others.

30:48.580 --> 30:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MELANIE THOMPSON: At a time
when San Francisco
is talking about getting to
zero, and New

30:53.318 --> 31:00.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York is talking about ending the
epidemic,
we still see increasing numbers
of new HIV

31:00.625 --> 31:03.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
diagnoses in some of our
population.

31:03.428 --> 31:09.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For those who
do know their
status, and want to start
treatment, just

31:09.534 --> 31:11.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
getting there can be arduous.

31:11.603 --> 31:16.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Claude Bowen's difficult commute
to the doctor
isn't uncommon in this sprawling
city. He

31:16.041 --> 31:18.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has no car and has to travel two
hours to
his appointments.

31:18.910 --> 31:24.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAUDE BOWEN, AIDS Patient: I
take one bus
to the train to another bus. If
I come down

31:24.950 --> 31:30.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, I take a bus, the train,
another train,
then a bus.

31:30.155 --> 31:31.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And that's
just one way?

31:31.623 --> 31:33.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLAUDE BOWEN: That's one way.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: If a bus or
train is late,
he will miss the next leg, and
often his appointment

31:36.895 --> 31:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be canceled entirely. For
these reasons
and many others, an estimated 40
percent to

31:41.666 --> 31:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 percent of people in Fulton
County drop
out of HIV care once they have
started. For

31:48.006 --> 31:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
others, even basic information
about treatment
can be a struggle.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRICK LANGFORD, AIDS Patient:
I'm going
for like this Bohemian-type
thing.

31:52.878 --> 31:56.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: When
22-year-old Derrick
Langford was diagnosed with HIV,
he had no

31:56.915 --> 32:00.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trouble opening up to friends
and family.

32:00.886 --> 32:05.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he couldn't figure out what
to do next
or where to go for medication or
follow-up

32:05.957 --> 32:07.626 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

32:07.659 --> 32:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRICK LANGFORD: So, it was
pretty much me
searching, looking, using Google
a lot to

32:11.830 --> 32:18.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find out where I needed to go.
And the stress
kind of made me very, very sick.

32:18.770 --> 32:23.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's often
these kinds of
barriers, not riskier behaviors,
that drive

32:23.041 --> 32:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these high rates of infection.
In fact, gay
black men don't engage in
higher-risk behaviors

32:27.946 --> 32:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compared to, say, white gay men.
Repeated
studies have proven that.

32:31.716 --> 32:36.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They often have fewer partners
and use condoms
more, says Wendy Armstrong.
She's medical

32:36.321 --> 32:41.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director of the Ponce De Leon
Center, Grady
Hospital's massive outpatient
clinic for Atlanta's

32:41.660 --> 32:43.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HIV-positive community.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. WENDY ARMSTRONG, Ponce De
Leon Center:
There's so much easy blame:
Those people shouldn't

32:46.431 --> 32:50.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be doing those things. And that
is not the
situation at all. It is that it
is such a

32:51.002 --> 32:55.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
prevalent disease in our
population for a
group of patients who don't have
easy access

32:55.974 --> 32:57.742 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to care.

32:57.776 --> 32:58.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL DRIFFIN, Fulton County
Task Force on
HIV/AIDS: People living with HIV
should be

32:58.677 --> 33:00.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at all levels of engagement.

33:01.012 --> 33:05.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Daniel Driffin
is a member
of the task force. He's
HIV-positive himself,

33:05.383 --> 33:11.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he says the Achilles' heel
of the fight
against HIV in the South is
stigma. He says

33:11.256 --> 33:12.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even he feels it.

33:12.991 --> 33:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL DRIFFIN: I thought I did
something
wrong, being that I'm now
HIV-positive, on

33:18.396 --> 33:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
top of being black, on top of
being gay, and
in the South.

33:22.133 --> 33:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: So this is the South, the
Bible Belt,
and so when it comes to HIV,
it's like we're

33:27.205 --> 33:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing something that's immoral
to what we
have been taught as children.

33:29.808 --> 33:33.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: While stigma
about being
gay has always been a problem in
much of the

33:33.044 --> 33:38.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
U.S., Driffin says it's
particularly an issue
in the black community. And he
says it's complicit

33:38.583 --> 33:40.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the rising rates of HIV
infection.

33:40.485 --> 33:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL DRIFFIN: We see what
happens when people
do tell that they're gay. We see
what happens

33:46.658 --> 33:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when people do say that they're
HIV-positive.
They're homeless the next
morning, or the

33:52.597 --> 33:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same day. You know, they're
being assaulted.

33:56.201 --> 33:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: A local man could be facing
federal hate
crimes charges.

33:59.471 --> 34:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He points to a
recent case
where a man walked into his
girlfriend's house,

34:03.808 --> 34:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discovered her son in bed with
another man,
and threw boiling water onto
them.

34:07.779 --> 34:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL DRIFFIN: He boiled a pot
of water on
the stove, took the pot of water
and poured

34:13.818 --> 34:17.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
it all over them. And,
literally, they were
in the hospital for four months.

34:17.856 --> 34:21.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Melanie
Thompson says, while
all these impediments are
finally being acknowledged

34:21.793 --> 34:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and talked about openly, the
region still
has major hurdles to overcome
them.

34:26.131 --> 34:30.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One example, among many,
funding. Georgia
was one of the states that
didn't expand Medicaid

34:30.869 --> 34:35.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under the Affordable Care Act,
so it's got
much less money to care for its
poor HIV-positive

34:35.640 --> 34:37.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
patients.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MELANIE THOMPSON: Many of my
friends ask
me, you know, why are you
working in Atlanta?

34:40.679 --> 34:46.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why don't you go work in Africa,
or Asia,
or whatever? Everybody works
internationally.

34:46.251 --> 34:53.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I feel like we have a Third
World epidemic,
in some ways, here, that's
difficult to address.

34:53.391 --> 34:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Three years
after nearly
dying of AIDS, Russell Martin is
a testament

34:58.463 --> 35:03.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the power of successful HIV
treatment,
and to what many hope Atlanta
will do more

35:03.468 --> 35:08.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of. He's now studying law and
looking towards
graduation. The virus is fully
suppressed

35:08.573 --> 35:12.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in his blood. He's trying daily
to get healthier
still.

35:12.811 --> 35:16.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Atlanta, Georgia.

York, the state

with more HIV-positive people
than any other
in the U.S.

JUDY WOODRUFF: It's always been
the case that
the political science taught in
textbooks

36:02.627 --> 36:06.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can be a far cry from politics
as practiced
in the real world.

36:06.731 --> 36:11.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But given how different and
unusual this year's
presidential election has been,
it's presented

36:11.736 --> 36:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a particular challenge in some
school settings,
trying to square the civics book
with the

36:17.842 --> 36:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2016 campaign as it's unfolded.

Special correspondent Lisa Stark
of Education
Week visits a high school in
Maryland just

36:25.617 --> 36:30.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two hours from the White House,
where teachers
are trying to help students
understand this

36:30.522 --> 36:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out-of-the-ordinary election.

36:32.757 --> 36:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making the
Grade.

36:35.427 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BRUCE FOX, Teacher: Good
morning.

36:37.262 --> 36:38.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENTS: Good morning.

36:38.997 --> 36:44.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FOX: Good morning. We're
going to start
with a warmup today. Number one,
what are

36:44.335 --> 36:47.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the three constitutional
requirements to be
president?

36:47.939 --> 36:53.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Bruce Fox's 12th
grade A.P. government
class has been following this
presidential

36:53.478 --> 36:58.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election as the field has
winnowed down and
the rhetoric has heated up.

36:58.783 --> 37:03.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FOX: And this year, you
can easily make
the argument that it's like that
on steroids.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Is it ever.

37:05.590 --> 37:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
She's a world-class liar. Just
look at her

37:08.493 --> 37:11.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
pathetic e-mail server
statements or her phony
landing.

37:11.863 --> 37:17.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Donald Trump's ideas aren't just
different.

37:17.302 --> 37:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are dangerously incoherent.

37:19.471 --> 37:24.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: From television to
Twitter, it's
been an unruly campaign.

37:24.576 --> 37:29.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Crooked Hillary
Clinton. We
can't let it happen.

37:29.380 --> 37:34.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: To help students cut
through the
noise, Bruce Fox is trying out
his own ballot.

37:34.719 --> 37:41.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FOX: We are going to look
at scandals,
lies and incivility in the 2016
presidential

37:41.092 --> 37:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election. You are going to
categorize each
incident and rate it.

37:45.196 --> 37:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that this year presents
extra challenges
because the political parties
traditionally

37:49.367 --> 37:57.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have had a platform that was
predictable and
well-known, and, this year,
things are a little

37:57.642 --> 37:59.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bit more all over the place.

37:59.477 --> 38:04.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Students are
examining controversial
issues involving Donald Trump
and Hillary

38:04.749 --> 38:06.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

38:06.484 --> 38:07.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FOX: The main thing is, I
would you
like to categorize this, is this
a lie, is

38:07.886 --> 38:10.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is a scandal, what is it,
and then finally
rate it.

38:10.655 --> 38:15.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wanted students to be thinking
about, well,
some of these things that we're
hearing about,

38:15.126 --> 38:19.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe they don't matter that
much, and others
are more important. Not -- just
because something's

38:19.497 --> 38:23.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the news doesn't necessarily
mean it's
a big deal, or it should really
influence

38:23.401 --> 38:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any kind of decisions when it
comes to voting.

38:26.171 --> 38:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: He speeches, Haiden
(ph) loves this
one. Clinton gave three speeches
at Goldman

38:32.210 --> 38:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sachs for $225,000 each. Clinton
has refused
to release the content of her
speeches.

38:37.849 --> 38:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: Think that's a scandal,
too?

38:38.550 --> 38:39.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN LYNCH, Student: It's a lie.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: A lie? OK?

38:40.752 --> 38:43.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN LYNCH: Yes, because she
won't, like,
admit to, like, what's going on.

38:43.888 --> 38:49.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I follow a lot of them on
Twitter. I don't
feel like it's a good source of
information,

38:49.327 --> 38:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but it is where a lot of
candidates can slip
up. Like Donald Trump, for
instance, he does

38:54.999 --> 38:59.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say a lot of not-so-smart things
on Twitter
that you wouldn't think someone
running for

38:59.504 --> 39:00.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president would say.

39:00.705 --> 39:02.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All right, Trump and women.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Here we go.

39:04.142 --> 39:10.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN LYNCH: Trump has often
offended many
women by retweeting an
unflattering picture

39:10.315 --> 39:12.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Heidi Cruz.

39:12.116 --> 39:17.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FOX: If a student is
getting a tweet
with some shocking thing, their
thought process

39:17.188 --> 39:23.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shouldn't be, oh, man, that
person is a jerk
and that's horrible. It should
be more than

39:23.895 --> 39:26.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that. It should be, is this
accurate?

39:26.564 --> 39:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you think she should release
the speeches?

39:28.566 --> 39:32.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN LYNCH: Definitely. If she
wants people
to stop saying that she's being
fake about

39:32.503 --> 39:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it, she should release them.

39:34.272 --> 39:38.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Civics education is
an age-old
subject, one of the founding
principles of

39:38.443 --> 39:44.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America's public schools.
Maryland is the
only state to require a U.S.
government exam

39:44.616 --> 39:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to graduate, although virtually
all states
require some civics education.

39:49.554 --> 39:54.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 10 other states, students
will need to
take the U.S. citizenship test.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA SPROUT, Teacher: That
freedom of expression
is guaranteed by our First
Amendment, which

39:58.029 --> 39:59.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
says?

39:59.797 --> 40:04.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: You can have whatever
religion you
want, or you don't have to have
a religion

40:04.502 --> 40:05.136 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at all.

40:05.169 --> 40:07.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JESSICA SPROUT: OK.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Jessica Sprout
teaches U.S. government
to ninth-graders, a topic she
says has an

40:09.440 --> 40:11.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
impact far beyond the classroom.

40:12.010 --> 40:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA SPROUT: You have got to
know how the
government works to be an
informed citizen

40:16.314 --> 40:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to be successful. That's the
only way
a democracy works, is if people
are involved.

40:20.885 --> 40:25.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: In recent years,
there have been
high-profile attempts to
strengthen the civics

40:25.390 --> 40:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
curriculum, including by former
Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
over concerns

40:30.995 --> 40:32.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the subject is getting short
shrift.

40:32.830 --> 40:36.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR, Former
Supreme Court
Justice: I wanted to teach young
people in

40:36.467 --> 40:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America how they can be part of
the governmental
structure and help decide what
problems to

40:43.708 --> 40:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tackle and how to solve them.

40:45.677 --> 40:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: A Tufts University
study found
young adults who recalled having
strong civics

40:50.348 --> 40:57.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
classes were more likely to
vote, and certainly
this year, interest in the
election is high.

40:57.422 --> 41:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA SPROUT: I was teaching
in the last
election cycle, and I honestly
don't remember

41:02.193 --> 41:08.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many discussions at all from
kids. This time
around, even the freshmen have
an opinion.

41:08.232 --> 41:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Bruce Fox wants his
students -- many
will be first-time voters -- to
be thoughtful

41:13.371 --> 41:18.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about their opinions. He's
hoping today's
lesson encourages them to think
about what

41:18.509 --> 41:23.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it means to be presidential. How
much do character
and judgment count?

41:23.581 --> 41:26.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FOX: Why don't we start
with each group?
And you will share what your big
takeaway

41:26.984 --> 41:28.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here was.

41:28.786 --> 41:33.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Donald Trump is just
full of lies
and Hillary Clinton just has
secrets. Neither

41:33.157 --> 41:35.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of them are actually fit.

41:35.126 --> 41:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE FOX: OK. If some of you
are undecided
voters, what are you going to be
looking to

41:40.064 --> 41:44.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these candidates to say or do
between now
and November?

41:44.469 --> 41:45.336 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Lauren?

41:45.370 --> 41:47.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: Act like civilized
adults.

41:47.805 --> 41:52.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: A lesson even the
candidates might
benefit from.

41:52.477 --> 41:54.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.

I'm Lisa Stark from Education

GWEN IFILL: Hundreds of
thousands of people
have died in Syria since the
conflict began

42:30.782 --> 42:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there nearly five-and-a-half
years ago.

42:33.384 --> 42:38.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Few who have lost loved ones
have any hope
of gaining justice for their
deaths. But the

42:38.222 --> 42:43.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family of Marie Colvin, an
American journalist
killed in Syria in 2012, with
French photographer

42:43.861 --> 42:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remi Ochlik, is suing the
government of Syria
in an American court.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Colvin family says they're
not seeking
retribution, but accountability.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham is back with
that story.

42:55.506 --> 43:00.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Marie Colvin
was considered
one of the bravest journalists
of her generation.

43:00.144 --> 43:04.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She covered war and armed
conflict across
the world, mostly for The Sunday
Times of

43:04.348 --> 43:06.150 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
London.

43:06.184 --> 43:11.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She lost an eye covering
conflict in Sri Lanka
in 2001. But in February of
2012, she would

43:11.989 --> 43:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lose her life covering the war
in Syria.

43:18.429 --> 43:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colvin was again on assignment
for The Times
of London when she was killed by
a rocket

43:21.966 --> 43:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fired by the Syrian government.
She was in
the city of Homs, an epicenter
of the uprising

43:26.737 --> 43:32.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad.
Her body was found in a
makeshift media center.

43:32.577 --> 43:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABU SHADI, Shop Owner (through
translator):
Homs is in a mess and chaos,
killing, stealing.

43:38.616 --> 43:44.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are dying. We closed our
shops. Every
day, two or three or four get
kidnapped. Shame

43:44.355 --> 43:47.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on them. We want to finish this.
This is not
a solution.

43:47.959 --> 43:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Despite the
indiscriminate
shelling of the city, Colvin's
younger sister,

43:52.763 --> 43:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cathleen, says that Marie's
death was no accident.

43:55.533 --> 43:58.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHLEEN COLVIN, Sister of Marie
Colvin: I
was absolutely sure from the
very beginning

43:58.603 --> 44:05.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she was targeted. The
timing of her last
report out of Homs was -- seemed
like too

44:05.510 --> 44:07.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much of a coincidence.

44:07.445 --> 44:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That last
report was a series
of phone interviews Colvin did
with American

44:10.481 --> 44:15.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and British TV networks. In
them, she described
the Assad government's attack on
civilians

44:15.486 --> 44:16.687 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Homs.

44:16.721 --> 44:18.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This one was with the U.K.'s
Channel 4 News.

44:18.856 --> 44:22.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIE COLVIN, Journalist: I am
at ground zero,
and I am seeing what's being
hit. Civilian

44:22.693 --> 44:27.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
buildings are being hit. In the
clinic today,
if you can even call it that --
it's an apartment,

44:27.798 --> 44:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has two operating tables, and a
dentist and
a doctor.

44:31.035 --> 44:39.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a tiny baby, well,
1-year-old, naked,
hit in the left chest. The
doctors just said,

44:39.977 --> 44:44.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we can't do anything. And we had
to watch
the baby's little tummy,
desperate for breath,

44:44.348 --> 44:45.850 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
die.

44:45.883 --> 44:49.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hours later,
the building
where she was working was hit.

44:49.153 --> 44:53.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cathleen Colvin believes the
Assad regime
intentionally targeted her
sister, and she

44:53.257 --> 44:57.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and her family has now filed a
wrongful death
suit against the Syrian
government in a federal

44:57.528 --> 45:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court in Washington, D.C. They
allege Marie
Colvin was assassinated as part
of a -- quote

45:03.100 --> 45:09.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "conspiracy by senior members
of the regime
of Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad to surveil,

45:09.507 --> 45:12.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
target and ultimately kill
civilian journalists."

45:12.243 --> 45:16.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The suit names President Assad's
brother,
as well as other top military
and intelligence

45:16.614 --> 45:18.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
commanders.

45:18.416 --> 45:21.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHLEEN COLVIN: It went right
and directly
up to Assad's office, to the
office of the

45:21.786 --> 45:26.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president. And his younger
brother was put
in charge of this apparatus that
was specifically

45:26.857 --> 45:33.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
directed to target foreign
journalists. And
the intention was to silence
them, so that

45:33.364 --> 45:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Assad regime could operate
with impunity.

45:35.700 --> 45:39.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But it's not
just top officials
that Colvin blames. She points
the finger

45:39.470 --> 45:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a local woman she says sealed
her sister's
fate.

45:42.607 --> 45:47.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHLEEN COLVIN: This female
informant, who
I picture lurking outside the
media center

45:47.445 --> 45:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the night before, and was able
to visually
confirm Marie's location.

45:51.582 --> 45:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There was a
Syrian citizen
that you believe was able to
inform the government,

45:58.322 --> 46:00.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the journalists are here?

46:00.157 --> 46:03.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHLEEN COLVIN: Yes. They had
already zeroed
in using her -- using the Skype
that she was

46:04.028 --> 46:10.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- that was what she was using
to report out.
And they had that signal
intercepted. And

46:10.668 --> 46:15.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so they had located the
position, and this
woman visually confirmed it.

46:15.473 --> 46:19.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Evidence for
these claims
was uncovered by the Center for
Justice and

46:19.176 --> 46:23.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Accountability, a nonprofit
human rights organization
based in San Francisco.

46:23.381 --> 46:27.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colvin says the proof of their
allegations
will come to light as the case
progresses.

46:27.518 --> 46:31.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colvin hopes the lawsuit will
bring a measure
of accountability to the Assad
regime for

46:31.455 --> 46:35.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what she says it did to her
sister and to
the people of Syria.

46:35.226 --> 46:38.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHLEEN COLVIN: All the pain
that my family
has experienced I know is
repeated every day

46:38.763 --> 46:40.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

46:40.498 --> 46:43.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Cathleen's oldest
daughter,
Marie's niece, is named as a
plaintiff in

46:43.567 --> 46:47.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the lawsuit. She and her
siblings were especially
devastated by the loss.

46:47.171 --> 46:53.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHLEEN COLVIN: They talked to
her all the
time from war zones. She called
us from Tahrir

46:53.110 --> 46:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Square holding the phone up and
saying, "You
have to hear this. There is an
uprising. The

46:59.016 --> 47:00.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
world is going to change."

47:00.885 --> 47:05.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marie is the most amazing and
unique person
I have ever known and I'm sure
ever will know.

47:05.890 --> 47:10.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I feel incredibly lucky to have
had such a
close relationship with her.

47:10.561 --> 47:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Colvin also
wants to recognize
the importance of journalists in
conflict

47:14.465 --> 47:16.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
zones.

47:16.233 --> 47:22.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHLEEN COLVIN: As Marie said,
tyrants like
Assad can just do whatever they
want with

47:22.173 --> 47:24.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impunity, with the world never
knowing the
truth.

47:24.875 --> 47:30.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's happening now in Syria.
It's one
of the most dangerous places to
report from.

47:30.347 --> 47:33.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's becoming more and more
difficult
to know what's really happening.
So, to a

47:33.384 --> 47:36.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certain extent, he's winning. He
has silenced
the press.

47:36.420 --> 47:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Marie
Colvin's sister
hopes that, through this
lawsuit, one journalist

47:40.758 --> 47:43.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who fell silent can be heard
once again.

47:43.494 --> 47:53.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

47:53.471 --> 48:00.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

48:00.611 --> 48:02.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

48:02.446 --> 48:07.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seventeen larger-than-life sea
creatures have
taken up residence in the
nation's capital

48:07.418 --> 48:08.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this summer.

48:08.719 --> 48:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
recently paid
them a visit.

48:11.722 --> 48:17.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Octavia the
octopus, Priscilla
the parrot fish, and Flash the
marlin, all

48:17.528 --> 48:23.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sculptures now on display at
Smithsonian's
National Zoo in Washington,
D.C., and all

48:23.601 --> 48:25.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made of trash pulled from the
Pacific Ocean.

48:26.003 --> 48:28.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA HASELTINE POZZI, Washed
Ashore: All
of this is garbage off the
beaches.

48:28.773 --> 48:33.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Angela Haseltine
Pozzi is the
lead artist and executive
director of Washed

48:33.477 --> 48:38.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ashore, a nonprofit seeking to
educate the
public on the plastics polluting
the word's

48:38.983 --> 48:40.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
oceans.

48:40.851 --> 48:45.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA HASELTINE POZZI: We
create sculptures
that can teach people about the
problem. And,

48:45.156 --> 48:50.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an artist, it is a real
challenge to use
everything that comes up off the
beach.

48:50.094 --> 48:55.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: In six years,
Haseltine Pozzi
and her team of volunteers have
created 66

48:55.633 --> 49:00.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sculptures from more than 38,000
pounds of
debris collected from a stretch
of Oregon's

49:00.805 --> 49:02.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coastline.

49:02.573 --> 49:07.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The countless bottle caps,
flip-flops and
beach toys are just a fraction
of the more

49:07.611 --> 49:15.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 315 billion pounds of
plastic estimated
to be in the world's oceans.
Such plastics

49:15.820 --> 49:21.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not only pose entanglement
threats to Marine
animals, but are often mistaken
for food.

49:21.158 --> 49:24.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I think it's a really
different way
to show the message, because, in
the art,

49:24.995 --> 49:28.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there were things that you would
never expected
to be washed on the ocean. There
was a million

49:28.499 --> 49:32.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lighters and all these different
things that
were really surprising to find.

49:32.336 --> 49:38.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I thought it was lovely,
really colorful,
and eye-catching. And it
actually makes you

49:38.209 --> 49:42.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think about the waste that's in
the sea and
just how much there is.

49:42.313 --> 49:47.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LUKE, Child: You can't put trash
in the ocean
because it will hurt animals.

49:47.718 --> 49:52.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: As scientists
debate how to
clean up the water, Haseltine
Pozzi hopes

49:52.790 --> 49:57.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her sculptures will inspire
visitors to curb
pollution in the first place.

49:57.895 --> 50:01.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," from the
National
Zoo, I'm Julia Griffin.

50:01.599 --> 50:05.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a great way
to learn about
what's in the ocean.

50:05.502 --> 50:07.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Absolutely.

50:07.304 --> 50:10.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" right now:
Heavy winter
rains have caused algae in some
parts of Florida

50:10.975 --> 50:16.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bloom, hurting tourism and
causing the
governor to declare a state of
emergency.

50:16.614 --> 50:20.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been such a large problem
that a NASA
satellite caught images of the
bloom from

50:20.818 --> 50:25.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
space. All that and more is on
our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:25.089 --> 50:27.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally
tonight...

50:27.958 --> 50:28.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:28.592 --> 50:31.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Keep talking.

50:31.262 --> 50:37.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
a behind-the-scenes
look at what it's like to work
and live in

50:37.601 --> 50:39.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
America's most famous residence.

50:39.870 --> 50:45.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the focus of a special
documentary
tonight on PBS called "The White
House: Inside

50:45.342 --> 50:50.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Story." It features unusual
access, as well
as interviews with President
Obama, first

50:50.281 --> 50:53.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lady Michelle Obama, and former
presidents
and first ladies.

50:53.550 --> 50:58.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's an excerpt about a part
of the White
House less seen, the living
quarters.

50:58.122 --> 51:05.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Between managing
affairs of state
and responding to the people's
concerns, the

51:05.195 --> 51:13.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president may have the most
demanding job
in the country, but you can't
beat the commute.

51:13.370 --> 51:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the West Wing, it's a short
trip down
the hall and upstairs to the
place they call

51:18.809 --> 51:27.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home, the official residence.
Here, they can
escape the spotlight and try to
live a normal

51:27.284 --> 51:28.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

51:28.986 --> 51:31.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN FORD BALES, Daughter of
Gerald Ford:
My parents actually brought some
of their

51:31.322 --> 51:36.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
furniture from Alexandria to the
White House.
My dad wanted his easy chair
that he had had

51:36.927 --> 51:45.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forever. He wanted it at the
White House.
There used to be a president's
bedroom and

51:45.169 --> 51:46.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a first lady's bedroom.

51:46.904 --> 51:51.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, my mother said, "We have
slept together
for 20-some-odd years, and we're
going to

51:51.942 --> 51:57.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continue." So they took the
president's bedroom
and made it into their private
den with their

51:57.915 --> 52:03.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
furniture that they were
comfortable with.
They said, "If we're going to do
this, we're

52:03.053 --> 52:06.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to do it so that we're
comfortable and
it feels like us."

52:06.623 --> 52:11.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSALYNN CARTER, Former First
Lady: After
a few weeks, it becomes home,
and you would

52:11.962 --> 52:17.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be going along and not thinking
every day
about, here I am and what am I
doing? Then

52:17.034 --> 52:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you look down, and here is
Abraham Lincoln's
place. And you get this
incredible feelings.

52:22.506 --> 52:26.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It gives me chills now even when
I think about
it.

52:26.143 --> 52:32.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARBARA BUSH, Former First Lady:
The upstairs
at the White House, which isn't
seen by everybody,

52:32.216 --> 52:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is filled with history. You feel
a lot of
history, and you hope you can
live up to it.

52:41.792 --> 52:48.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Every room has 100
stories. This is
where Jackson was. This is where
Lincoln was.

52:48.365 --> 52:51.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is where Teddy Roosevelt
