THE SENATE STALLS UNTIL MONDAY

02:32.667 --> 02:34.333
AFTERNOON INSTEAD OF WORKING

02:34.333 --> 02:36.733
TODAY, IT WOULD BE AN ACT OF

02:36.733 --> 02:38.433
BREATHTAKING ARROGANCE BY TH

02:38.433 --> 02:39.767
SENATE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP

02:58.133 --> 02:59.333
IMPENDING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

02:59.333 --> 03:03.600
>> IF HARRY REID CAUSES

03:03.600 --> 03:06.000
SHUTDOWN, THAT WOULD BE

03:06.000 --> 03:06.167
MISTAKE.

03:06.167 --> 03:08.100
BUT THAT IS HIS POSITION

03:08.100 --> 03:10.467
>> SO WHERE'S IT GO FROM HERE?

WE'RE JOINED FROM WASHINGTON B

WHILE WE'VE SEEN ALL THE TALK ON

03:16.167 --> 03:17.900
THE SUNDAY MORNING SHOWS, WHAT'S

03:17.900 --> 03:19.467
HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES, I

03:19.467 --> 03:19.733
ANYTHING

03:19.733 --> 03:21.200
>> THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT

03:21.200 --> 03:22.533
HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES.

03:22.533 --> 03:24.167
LEADERSHIP IN BOTH PARTIES ARE

03:24.167 --> 03:25.367
NOT REALLY HAVING CONVERSATION

03:25.367 --> 03:26.133
WITH THE WHITE HOUSE

03:26.133 --> 03:27.333
ALL WEEKEND THIS WAS MORE AN

03:27.333 --> 03:29.300
ISSUING OF STATEMENTS BACK AND

03:29.300 --> 03:29.567
FORTH.

03:29.567 --> 03:30.967
THE PRESIDENT HAD A VETO THREA

03:30.967 --> 03:32.600
OF WHAT THE HOUSE PASSED

03:32.600 --> 03:35.167
SATURDAY NIGHT VERY LATE IN TH

03:35.167 --> 03:35.333
EVENING.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.133
AND HARRY REID, THE SENATE

03:37.133 --> 03:39.233
MAJORITY LEADER, SAID THEY WOULD

03:39.233 --> 03:40.233
ABSOLUTELY NOT ACCEPT WHAT THE

03:40.233 --> 03:40.967
HOUSE PASSED

03:40.967 --> 03:42.233
SO EVERYBODY IS WAITING FOR TH

03:42.233 --> 03:43.533
SENATE TO RETURN TO WASHINGTON

03:43.533 --> 03:44.667
AND COME INTO SESSION ON MONDA

03:44.667 --> 03:45.900
AT 2:00.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.233
>> WHAT HAPPENS AT 2:00?

03:47.233 --> 03:48.300
FIRST, WITH THE SENATE AND THE

03:48.300 --> 03:51.533
THE HOUSE AND MAYBE THE WHIT

03:51.533 --> 03:51.800
HOUSE.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.400
>> WHAT HARRY REID WILL DO I

03:55.400 --> 03:57.133
NOT ACCEPT ANY CHANGES TO TH

03:57.133 --> 03:58.233
PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LAW.

03:58.233 --> 03:59.433
THERE WERE REALLY THREE THINGS

03:59.433 --> 04:02.233
THAT THE HOUSE DID ON SATURDAY

04:02.233 --> 04:02.267
NIGHT.

04:02.267 --> 04:03.667
THE SENATE WILL BE ABLE TO

04:03.667 --> 04:05.233
DISPATCH OF THOSE THROUGH

04:05.233 --> 04:07.400
COUPLE OF PROCEDURAL VOTES, EVEN

04:07.400 --> 04:07.967
THOUGH THERE'S REPUBLICA

04:07.967 --> 04:09.667
SUPPORT FOR A FEW AND HOUS

04:09.667 --> 04:11.433
REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING SOM

04:11.433 --> 04:12.567
SENATE DEMOCRATS MIGHT BE ABLE

04:12.567 --> 04:13.633
TO SUPPORT SOME OF THE CHANGES

04:13.633 --> 04:14.367
TO THE HEALTH CARE LAW

04:14.367 --> 04:15.667
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN

04:15.667 --> 04:17.800
SO THEN YOU END UP HAVING TH

04:17.800 --> 04:19.533
SENATE PASS A BILL THAT WOUL

04:19.533 --> 04:21.433
ALLOW THE TROOPS TO CONTINUE T

04:21.433 --> 04:23.467
GET PAYCHECKS IN THE EVENT OF

04:23.467 --> 04:24.467
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

04:24.467 --> 04:26.167
EVERYBODY SAYS THAT'S LIKELY T

04:26.167 --> 04:28.100
PASS TO PROTECT THE TROOPS, THEN

04:28.100 --> 04:29.433
YOU'LL HAVE THEM PROBABLY SEND

04:29.433 --> 04:30.633
YET ANOTHER BILL TO FUND THE

04:30.633 --> 04:32.567
GOVERNMENT BACK TO THE HOUSE

04:32.567 --> 04:33.567
MEANWHILE, THE CLOCK CONTINUES

04:33.567 --> 04:34.333
TO TICK.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.900
THERE WILL ONLY BE TEN HOURS

04:35.900 --> 04:37.433
LEFT UNTIL A SHUTDOWN WHEN THE

04:37.433 --> 04:39.467
SENATE COMES IN.

04:39.467 --> 04:41.733
>> SAY A SHUTDOWN HAPPENS.

04:41.733 --> 04:43.500
HOW DOES CONGRESS UNDO IT OR GET

04:43.500 --> 04:46.167
OVER IT AND CREATE SOME SORT O

04:46.167 --> 04:48.367
A STOPGAP MEASURE?

04:48.367 --> 04:50.233
>> WELL, THERE'S NOT A LOT THE

04:50.233 --> 04:50.867
CAN DO

04:50.867 --> 04:52.467
THEY COULD PASS A NEW BILL T

04:52.467 --> 04:53.867
FUND THE GOVERNMENT FOR A FE

04:53.867 --> 04:55.167
DAYS OR A WEEK

05:01.300 --> 05:02.833
HAVE POLICY ATTACHED TO IT, JUST

05:02.833 --> 05:04.200
A MATTER OF FUNDING TH

05:04.200 --> 05:05.400
GOVERNMENT TO KEEP IT GOING.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.233
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF INTEREST IN

05:07.233 --> 05:08.667
DOING THAT BECAUSE THERE'S S

05:08.667 --> 05:09.900
LITTLE TIME, SO THEY WANT TO

05:09.900 --> 05:11.367
WORK SOMETHING OUT

05:11.367 --> 05:12.400
AGAIN, IT'S A PRETTY SHORT-TER

05:12.400 --> 05:12.667
BILL

05:12.667 --> 05:15.233
RIGHT NOW, THE HOUSE PASSED

05:15.233 --> 05:16.933

05:28.967 --> 05:30.733
WE HAVE THAT OTHER DEADLINE IN

05:30.733 --> 05:32.667
MID-OCTOBER, THAT'S MUCH EARLIER

05:32.667 --> 05:33.800
THAN THESE NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER

05:33.800 --> 05:35.333
DEADLINES THESE GUYS ARE TALKING

05:35.333 --> 05:35.467
ABOUT.

05:35.467 --> 05:37.100
>> WHAT HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN

05:37.100 --> 05:38.267
BOEHNER REALLY WANTED HERE WAS

05:38.267 --> 05:40.267
TO USE THAT ARGUMENT, THE DEBT

WAS ABLE TO DO ON THE SENATE

05:52.900 --> 05:54.600
FLOOR AND GENERATE A LOT O

05:54.600 --> 05:58.100
NATIONAL ATTENTION, REALLY

05:58.100 --> 05:58.933
CAPITALIZE ON THE ANTIHEALTH

05:58.933 --> 06:01.467
CARE SENTIMENT IN THE NATION, SO

06:01.467 --> 06:02.500
THEY SAID THIS IS OUR MOMENT

06:02.500 --> 06:04.300
LET'S HAVE THIS FIGHT HERE

06:04.300 --> 06:05.567
THEY WANT TO POSSIBLY SHUT THE

06:05.567 --> 06:06.867

THAT DEBT CEILING ON OCTOBER

06:13.400 --> 06:13.833

06:13.833 --> 06:15.567
THEY ARE TRYING TO ATTACH OTHE

06:15.567 --> 06:16.300
THINGS TO IT

06:16.300 --> 06:17.900
THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE WON'

06:17.900 --> 06:18.467
NEGOTIATE THERE.

06:18.467 --> 06:19.967
THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING T

06:19.967 --> 06:21.400
SAY, WELL, YOU NEGOTIATED WITH

06:21.400 --> 06:22.533
US PREVIOUSLY ON THIS SAME

06:22.533 --> 06:22.867
ISSUE.

06:22.867 --> 06:24.733
>> IT COMES DOWN TO A COUPLE O

06:24.733 --> 06:26.633
CENTRAL CHARACTERS

WHERE DOES THIS LEAVE TH

06:28.200 --> 06:29.767
PRESIDENT AND ALSO JOHN BOEHNER?

06:29.767 --> 06:31.167
>> I THINK YOU'LL PROBABLY HEA

06:34.800 --> 06:36.200
HOUSE HAS DONE, GOING TO B

06:36.200 --> 06:37.467
SAYING THE SENATE IS THE ONE

06:37.467 --> 06:39.433
THAT PASSED THE BILL THAT HE

06:39.433 --> 06:40.900
SUPPORTS THAT JUST FUNDS THE

06:40.900 --> 06:42.433

BASIC SERVICES

CLEAN CONTINUING RESOLUTION TO

06:50.600 --> 06:51.833
FUND THE GOVERNMENT BEFORE HIS

DEMOCRATS WILL JOIN HIM IN

06:54.000 --> 06:55.433
SUPPORTING THIS AND AVOID

06:55.433 --> 06:57.000
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.667
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS T

07:01.100 --> 07:02.733
MONDAY, BUT IT IS LESS AND LES

07:02.733 --> 07:02.967
LIKELY

12:14.800 --> 12:17.233
OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION

12:17.233 --> 12:20.067

12:20.067 --> 12:21.367
INTO SORT OF RETAIL PSYCHOLOGY

12:21.367 --> 12:23.000
BUT ARE PEOPLE LIKELY TO SIGN UP

12:23.000 --> 12:24.933
AND PURCHASE SOMETHING SO FAR IN

12:24.933 --> 12:27.233
ADVANCE, BECAUSE THEY DON'

TECHNICALLY HAVE TO HAVE

12:34.433 --> 12:38.067

12:46.167 --> 12:48.133
NOT EXPECTING PEOPLE TO SIGN U

12:48.133 --> 12:49.267
UNTIL MAYBE DECEMBER OR MARC

12:49.267 --> 12:50.900
WHEN OPEN ENROLLMENT ENDS.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.633
>> SO THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

12:52.633 --> 12:54.500
GONE OUT AND MADE THESE SIMPLE

12:54.500 --> 12:55.767
EASY TO UNDERSTAND ANALOGIES

12:55.767 --> 12:58.967
IT'S LIKE COMPARING PRICES O

12:58.967 --> 13:01.000
KAYAK.COM OR EXPEDIA

13:01.000 --> 13:02.867
IS IT AS EASY TO COMPARE HEALT

13:02.867 --> 13:04.667
INSURANCE AND EXCHANGES AS IT IS

13:04.667 --> 13:06.233
TO PURCHASE A PLANE TICKET

>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK I

13:07.967 --> 13:08.367
WILL BE.

13:08.367 --> 13:10.133
AND I THINK THAT MAKES SENSE

13:10.133 --> 13:11.367
BUYING A HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY

13:11.367 --> 13:13.967
IS MORE COMPLEX IN A BIGGE

13:13.967 --> 13:15.700
FINANCIAL DECISION THAN BUYING A

13:15.700 --> 13:16.667
PLANE TICKET SOMEWHERE AND

13:16.667 --> 13:18.667
YOU'RE DEALING WITH COMPLE

13:18.667 --> 13:21.033
TERMS LIKE COPAYMENTS AN

13:21.033 --> 13:22.633
DEDUCTIBLES THAT THE PEOPLE

13:22.633 --> 13:24.200
TALK TO ON THE GROUNDS AND THE

13:24.200 --> 13:25.633
STATES THAT ARE SETTING THIS UP,

13:25.633 --> 13:26.600
THEY SOMETIMES WORRY WHEN WE

13:26.600 --> 13:27.900
COMPARE IT TO A PLANE TICKET

13:27.900 --> 13:29.367
THAT YOU'RE SETTING EXPECTATIONS

13:29.367 --> 13:30.167
TOO HIGH

13:30.167 --> 13:32.433
IT MIGHT TAKE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

13:32.433 --> 13:34.167
A FEW VISITS TO THE WEBSITE,

13:34.167 --> 13:36.333
THEY MIGHT NEED TO FIN

13:36.333 --> 13:37.167
IN-PERSON HELP

13:37.167 --> 13:38.933
THE EXPECTATION IS IT WILL B

13:38.933 --> 13:41.367
MORE COMPLEX THAN BUYING A PLANE

13:41.367 --> 13:41.500
TICKET

13:41.500 --> 13:44.833
>> AND WHAT'S BEHIND A RECEN

13:44.833 --> 13:46.733
SURGE IN CORPORATIONS USING TH

13:46.733 --> 13:48.900
ACA AS A TOOL TO REDUCE TH

13:48.900 --> 13:49.933
AMOUNT OF COVERAGE THEY AR

13:49.933 --> 13:51.200
PROVIDING THEIR EMPLOYEES?

13:51.200 --> 13:53.100
>> YOU DO SEE THIS A LITTLE BIT.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.800
I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S A SURG

13:55.800 --> 13:56.533
QUITE YET.

13:56.533 --> 13:59.133
BUT YOU SEE LIMITED STORIES,

13:59.133 --> 14:01.167
TRADER JOES, FOR EXAMPLE, TH

14:01.167 --> 14:02.800
GROCERY STORE, DECIDED ITS

14:02.800 --> 14:05.267
PART-TIME EMPLOYEES WILL N

14:05.267 --> 14:06.767
LONGER GET BENEFITS.

14:06.767 --> 14:08.467
THE CALCULUS ON THE PART O

14:08.467 --> 14:10.300
TRADER JOES AND OTHER COMPANIE

14:10.300 --> 14:12.967
IS THAT NOW PEOPLE CAN GET

14:12.967 --> 14:13.500
SUBSIDIZED INSURANCE FROM TH

14:13.500 --> 14:15.467
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND NO ON

14:15.467 --> 14:17.400
WILL BE DENIED COVERAGE FOR

14:17.400 --> 14:18.833
PREEXISTING CONDITION AND THAT

14:18.833 --> 14:19.733
MEANS THEY CAN SHIFT SOME OF

14:19.733 --> 14:21.600
THEIR COSTS TOWARDS THE FEDERA

14:21.600 --> 14:21.967
GOVERNMENT

14:21.967 --> 14:23.533
THERE'S, OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF

14:23.533 --> 14:25.467
FRUSTRATION WITH THE TRADER JOES

14:25.467 --> 14:26.733
EMPLOYEES, OTHER EMPLOYEES O

14:26.733 --> 14:28.000
COMPANIES THAT HAVE DONE THIS,

14:28.000 --> 14:29.867
BUT I DO THINK YOU'LL SEE MORE

14:29.867 --> 14:30.967
COMPANIES MOVING IN THIS

14:30.967 --> 14:32.000
DIRECTION NOW THAT THE

14:32.000 --> 14:34.733

HOME BECAUSE IT'S WHERE HE

16:25.267 --> 16:26.833
PARENTS BROUGHT HER WHEN SHE

16:26.833 --> 16:28.567
WASN'T EVEN 2 YEARS OLD, AND

MEXICO IS VERY FAR AWAY.

CULTURE.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.733
TO SUCCESS IS EDUCATION.

16:43.733 --> 16:45.800
SO AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, SHE WENT

16:45.800 --> 16:47.167

16:47.167 --> 16:50.500

17:02.600 --> 17:04.600
SHE COULDN'T GET FINANCIAL AID

ILLEGAL IN THIS COUNTRY?

18:27.833 --> 18:29.000
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING

18:29.000 --> 18:31.867

ASKING FOR PREFERENTIA

18:32.700 --> 18:32.967

18:32.967 --> 18:34.467
FOR AWHILE AFTER SHE DROPPED OUT

18:34.467 --> 18:36.167

18:56.567 --> 18:58.067
EMOTIONS, TUITION EQUITY
