JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.375 --> 00:14.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a big
win for environmentalists.
President Obama ends a
seven-year review by

00:14.581 --> 00:20.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
rejecting the 1,100-mile
extension of the Keystone oil
pipeline.

00:20.954 --> 00:26.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's Friday. Mark Shields
and David Brooks are here to
analyze the week's news.

00:26.393 --> 00:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, Pablo Picasso, known best
for his paintings, also had a
talent for sculpture, now being

00:32.266 --> 00:35.636 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
shown in a new
exhibit in New York.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE UMLAND, Museum of Modern
Art: Picasso, when he comes back
to making three-dimensional

00:38.739 --> 00:41.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
objects, does it in ways that
nobody has ever done before.

00:41.775 --> 00:48.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:48.715 --> 00:53.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.153 --> 01:03.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hiring surged in
the United States in October
after two lackluster months.

01:03.797 --> 01:08.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Labor Department reported
employers added 271,000 jobs.
That's the most for one month

01:08.936 --> 01:11.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since December.

01:11.872 --> 01:17.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This helped push the
unemployment rate down to 5
percent, the lowest it's been in
seven

01:17.210 --> 01:22.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years. At the same time, the
proportion of Americans in the
labor force was unchanged,

01:22.416 --> 01:28.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at around 62 percent. Today's
strong data left the door open
to a possible interest

01:28.188 --> 01:33.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rate hike when Federal Reserve
Bank policy-makers meet next
month.

01:33.527 --> 01:37.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street, stocks failed to
get much of a boost out of the
jobs report. The Dow

01:37.998 --> 01:45.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jones industrial average gained
just under 47 points to close at
17910. The Nasdaq rose

01:45.272 --> 01:50.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
19 points, and the S&amp;P 500 lost
a fraction of a point. For the
week, all three major

01:50.410 --> 01:55.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
indexes gained nearly
1 percent or more.

01:55.582 --> 02:01.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama rejected the
Keystone XL oil pipeline
proposal today, ending a
protracted

02:01.822 --> 02:07.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
debate and handing a big victory
to environmentalists. The
controversial pipeline would
have permitted

02:07.394 --> 02:13.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oil from Canada's tar sands to
flow to U.S. Gulf Coast
refineries. The president said

02:13.734 --> 02:19.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the project would have
undermined American efforts to
secure a global climate change

02:19.206 --> 02:24.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal. We will take a closer look
at the impact of his decision
right after the news summary.

02:24.945 --> 02:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Supreme Court agreed today
to hear a fourth case
challenging President Obama's
Affordable

02:30.650 --> 02:36.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Care Act. This time, the court
will decide whether
religious-affiliated
institutions

02:36.356 --> 02:42.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like universities and hospitals
should be free from playing any
role in providing employees

02:42.662 --> 02:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contraceptive coverage. The
president's health care overhaul
currently mandates that those

02:47.367 --> 02:52.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
institutions request
exemption from insurers.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House spokesman Josh
Earnest said that he was
confident they would win the
legal

02:54.708 --> 02:56.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
challenge.

02:56.376 --> 02:59.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: The policy that we
have in place appropriately

02:59.312 --> 03:08.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
balances the need for millions
of Americans to have access to
birth control while also

03:08.789 --> 03:14.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
protecting the right of
religious freedom that is
protected in our Constitution.

03:14.795 --> 03:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The high court
will hear arguments in March.

03:19.433 --> 03:24.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was word today the Obama
administration plans to open new
screening centers to increase

03:24.805 --> 03:30.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the number of Syrians taking
refuge in the U.S. Reuters,
citing unnamed officials,
reported

03:30.744 --> 03:36.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the outposts will be located in
Iraq and Lebanon. President
Obama had already vowed to admit

03:36.583 --> 03:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10,000 Syrian refugees into the
U.S. in 2016. It's not clear how
many more will now be taken

03:42.355 --> 03:45.392 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

03:45.392 --> 03:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Greek ferry workers called off
strikes today, clearing the way
for thousands of refugees

03:50.697 --> 03:55.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other migrants to continue
their journeys to the Greek
mainland. The first ships
arrived

03:55.769 --> 04:02.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a port near Athens this
morning. The strike, which began
Monday, stranded some 25,000
asylum

04:02.809 --> 04:08.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seekers in cramped conditions on
small Greek islands in the
Aegean Sea. The ferry workers

04:08.815 --> 04:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were protesting new austerity
measures under Greece's bailout.

04:14.788 --> 04:20.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rescue teams in Southeastern
Brazil today desperately
searched for survivors in a
remote

04:20.527 --> 04:27.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
village engulfed in mud after
dams from a nearby mining
complex burst. The iron ore

04:27.434 --> 04:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mine's president said the two
dams failed yesterday before
nightfall. Sludge flooded

04:33.673 --> 04:40.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a community downstream,
swallowing homes and cars in
thick mud. At least two people
died,

04:40.647 --> 04:45.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and dozens more are still
missing. Residents said no one
alerted them to the danger.

04:45.986 --> 04:51.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): It
was worse than a tsunami, what
happened to house. Everyone

04:51.691 --> 04:56.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was shouting. There was no alarm
to warn us that the dam had
broken. Those who managed

04:56.296 --> 05:01.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to save themselves ran or got on
a truck that drove by and asked
people to hop on. Everyone

05:01.635 --> 05:06.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was panicking. About 60 people
were riding on the truck, and
the rest were left behind.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's still not
clear what caused the ruptures,
but mine officials said that

05:10.343 --> 05:16.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seismic activity was reported in
the region shortly beforehand.

05:16.650 --> 05:22.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Politicians were out in force in
Myanmar today, the last day of
campaigning before the country,

05:22.622 --> 05:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
formerly known as Burma, holds
its first relatively free
elections in 25 years. Hundreds
gathered

05:29.496 --> 05:35.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for rallies as candidates and
their supporters distributed
fliers to potential voters.

05:35.769 --> 05:41.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, election officials
set up polling stations in
advance of Sunday's vote.
Opposition

05:41.608 --> 05:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
National League for Democracy
Party is expected to win the

05:45.812 --> 05:49.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
most votes over its
military-backed rival.

05:49.516 --> 05:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
President Obama says no to the
controversial Keystone

05:55.555 --> 06:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pipeline; flights canceled and
tourists stranded in Egypt, the
aftermath of the Russian plane

06:01.728 --> 06:18.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crash; Mark Shields and David
Brooks on this week's news, and
much more.

06:18.778 --> 06:22.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To many observers, President
Obama's decision on the Keystone
pipeline may have seemed like

06:22.449 --> 06:25.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a forgone conclusion.

06:25.919 --> 06:30.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But earlier during his term,
environmentalists were worried
that he would approve it.
Climate

06:30.757 --> 06:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change, however, has become a
central focus of the Obama
second term, and it was very

06:35.695 --> 06:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much on his mind today when he
announced the decision. It was a
decision seven years in

06:40.500 --> 06:42.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the making.

06:42.535 --> 06:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: After extensive
public outreach and consultation

06:46.673 --> 06:53.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with other cabinet agencies, the
State Department has decided the
Keystone XL pipeline wouldn't

06:53.947 --> 06:58.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
serve the national interest of
the United States. I agree with
that decision.

06:58.952 --> 07:04.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With that,
President Obama formally
rejected TransCanada's
application

07:04.791 --> 07:10.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to extend the controversial
pipeline. The massive network
would have connected oil sands

07:10.664 --> 07:16.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Alberta, Canada, to
refineries along the Gulf Coast,
adding to existing pipelines.

07:16.870 --> 07:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It would have carried 800,000
barrels of oil a day.

07:21.374 --> 07:27.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company, along with many
Republican lawmakers in the
U.S., argued the project would
create

07:27.414 --> 07:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thousands of jobs and lower gas
prices. But Mr. Obama disagreed,
pointing out gas prices

07:35.155 --> 07:40.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are already lower. More
importantly, he said, the
pipeline wasn't in line with his
administration's

07:40.527 --> 07:43.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
efforts to combat
climate change.

07:43.830 --> 07:48.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Today, we're
continuing to lead by example,
because, ultimately, if we're

07:48.902 --> 07:54.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to prevent large parts of
this Earth from becoming not
only inhospitable, but
uninhabitable,

07:54.040 --> 07:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our lifetimes, we're going to
have to keep some fossil fuels
in the ground, rather than

07:57.277 --> 07:59.813 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
burn them.

07:59.813 --> 08:03.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: TransCanada
quickly condemned the decision,
calling it -- quote --
"misplaced

08:03.683 --> 08:06.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
symbolism."

08:06.219 --> 08:12.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company's statement read:
"It is disappointing the
administration appears to have
said yes

08:12.325 --> 08:17.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to more oil imports from Iran
and Venezuela over oil from
Canada, the United States'
strongest

08:17.897 --> 08:21.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ally and trading partner."

08:21.701 --> 08:26.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even some Democrats in
Congress, from states the
pipeline would have passed
through,

08:26.306 --> 08:28.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
criticized the move.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Representative Henry
Cuellar of Texas:

08:30.643 --> 08:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D), Texas:
So, you're talking about jobs,
you're talking about energy

08:33.646 --> 08:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
independence. And, all of a
sudden, the State Department
flip-flops and goes to the other

08:39.152 --> 08:42.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
directions. Bottom line, it's a
job creator, and I see that on a
day-to-day basis in my

08:42.522 --> 08:46.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
district.

08:46.159 --> 08:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
had faced considerable pressure
from the left to act, while he
kept

08:53.032 --> 08:57.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his own opinion under wraps.

08:57.170 --> 09:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Environmental activists staged
large protests in front of the
White House and demanded he

09:01.207 --> 09:07.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reject the proposal. Today, they
called the decision a big win.

09:07.080 --> 09:14.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fate of the pipeline
could change after the 2016
elections if TransCanada
reapplies.

09:14.754 --> 09:18.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Several Republican presidential
candidates said today they would
reverse Mr. Obama's

09:18.224 --> 09:20.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decision.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, there have been and
remain big divides on this
decision and the impact it will
have

09:24.497 --> 09:27.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for years to come.

09:27.534 --> 09:32.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We sample some of that reaction
with Senator Ed Markey, a
Democrat from Massachusetts who

09:32.739 --> 09:37.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has opposed the pipeline, and
Representative Leonard Lance.
He's a Republican from New

09:37.177 --> 09:41.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jersey who sits on the House
Energy and Commerce Committee.
He was in favor of it.

09:41.681 --> 09:44.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, welcome
to the program.

09:44.184 --> 09:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me first get your reaction
to what the president said and
his explanation for it.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senator Markey, you first.

09:49.422 --> 09:55.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. EDWARD MARKEY (D),
Massachusetts: Well, it's the
right decision.

09:55.962 --> 10:04.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The dirtiest oil in the world is
the tar sand oil up in Canada.
This would have constructed

10:04.904 --> 10:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a pipeline like a straw through
the United States, with us
running all of the environmental

10:11.377 --> 10:17.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
risk, all the way down to Port
Arthur, Texas, which is a
tax-free export zone, and then

10:17.684 --> 10:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the oil would just leave the
United States. No guarantee that
it would be used for American

10:23.957 --> 10:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
purposes, even as we export
young men and women overseas to
protect ships bringing oil

10:31.531 --> 10:33.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the Middle East.

10:33.967 --> 10:42.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's a win on energy,
it's a win on climate, it's a
win on job creation, because

10:42.041 --> 10:47.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this now puts the focus back on
wind and solar and other
renewable energy resources. And

10:47.447 --> 10:54.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe it or not, that the
Canadians wouldn't even have to
have contributed to the oil
liability

10:54.988 --> 11:00.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tax fund in the event that there
was an oil spill within the
United States.

11:00.260 --> 11:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the president clearly made
the right decision and has much
more credibility as he heads

11:05.832 --> 11:10.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Paris to give the leadership
to the rest of the world to
reduce greenhouse gases.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Representative
Lance, how do you read this
decision?

11:12.939 --> 11:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. LEONARD LANCE (R), New
Jersey: I think this is
perception over reality.

11:17.243 --> 11:22.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the pipeline would be in
the national interest of the
United States. It would have

11:22.315 --> 11:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
created 42,000 jobs for building
the pipeline, some permanent
jobs, and I think this was

11:27.554 --> 11:32.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
based upon politics and not the
science and not on the merits.

11:32.091 --> 11:39.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sorry that the president
acted as he did today. A new
president elected in 2016

11:39.432 --> 11:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could change the decision
beginning in 2017, if the
company reapplies. Canada is our
strongest

11:46.306 --> 11:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and closest ally. And while
we're permitting the purchase of
Iranian oil across the globe,

11:52.445 --> 11:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're not doing the same for
our friend and ally Canada.

11:57.083 --> 12:02.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this was supported
overwhelmingly by the American
people and overwhelmingly in
Congress

12:02.422 --> 12:07.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a bipartisan way both in the
House of Representatives and the
United States Senate. I think
the

12:07.460 --> 12:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote in the House was 270 to
156, and in the United States
Senate something like 62 to

12:14.367 --> 12:20.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
36. I think it's unfortunate
that the president made his
decision today, seven years in
the

12:20.306 --> 12:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making, that should have been
made within a year, and I'm
sorry that the decision was

12:23.309 --> 12:25.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
made today.

12:25.178 --> 12:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you both about some of the
points you're making.

12:28.114 --> 12:31.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Markey, what about this
point that -- is this really a
decision that's going

12:31.985 --> 12:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have serious impact, when the
next president could come along
in just over a year and reverse

12:35.188 --> 12:38.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it and say yes to the pipeline?

12:38.291 --> 12:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. EDWARD MARKEY: I think
that, obviously, there is a
precedent which is being set.

12:44.564 --> 12:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a decision made by a
president after he has looked at
the extensive record of
environmental

12:52.372 --> 13:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
damage, as well as national
security, and whether or not it
does create energy independence,

13:00.346 --> 13:06.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which it wouldn't, because I
actually made the amendment on
the Senate floor in January

13:06.285 --> 13:10.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying that the oil has to
stay in the United States.

13:10.123 --> 13:15.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just about every Republican
voted no and defeated my effort
to keep the oil in the

13:15.294 --> 13:19.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States. So, any time you
hear them now talk about energy
independence, then ask

13:19.432 --> 13:24.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them why they voted against
keeping it in our country, while
the American Petroleum

13:24.871 --> 13:30.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Institute is simultaneously
trying to lift the ban on the
exportation of oil that is

13:30.043 --> 13:31.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drilled for in the
United States.

13:31.944 --> 13:31.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
let me ask...

13:31.944 --> 13:33.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:33.346 --> 13:36.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. EDWARD MARKEY: And we still
import -- we still import five
million barrels of oil a

13:36.983 --> 13:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day in our country, just pretty
much the largest in the world,
and yet this is a whole effort

13:42.622 --> 13:45.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to export oil out of our
country. It makes no sense
whatsoever.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask
Congressman Lance about that
point.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What about that?

13:48.961 --> 13:52.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. LEONARD LANCE: Some of the
oil would stay here. It would be
refined here and stay

13:52.765 --> 13:56.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here. Some of it would
undoubtedly go abroad.

13:56.569 --> 14:02.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But The Washington Post gave
four Pinocchios to the
president's remarks earlier in
the

14:02.408 --> 14:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year that it would just go
through this country and that
some of it wouldn't stay here.
Some

14:07.013 --> 14:10.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of it clearly would stay here.
And that was evidenced by the
decision of The Washington

14:10.583 --> 14:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Post to give the president four
Pinocchios on that matter.

14:14.454 --> 14:20.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Regardless of that, I think that
this is in the best interest of
the United States. And,

14:20.159 --> 14:25.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly, both the old Canadian
prime minister and the new
Canadian prime minister, Mr.
Trudeau,

14:25.765 --> 14:31.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support this. And I hope that a
new president in 2017 will take
a look at this again.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Congressman
Lance, let me just pick up on
that. There is also an

14:34.507 --> 14:39.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economic argument that's been
made that these oil companies
may decide, given the low price

14:39.746 --> 14:44.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of oil right now, that it may
not be worth their while to ship
this expensive tar sands

14:44.751 --> 14:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
oil through the pipeline.

14:46.786 --> 14:51.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, couldn't that make this
whole thing moot, this project?

14:51.357 --> 14:55.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. LEONARD LANCE: I would
imagine oil prices will rise
over time. I cannot imagine they

14:55.294 --> 15:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will stay where they are now.
This obviously is an economic
decision.

15:00.366 --> 15:07.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a pipeline, Judy, is safer
than transporting oil by rail,
and that really is the
alternative,

15:07.173 --> 15:12.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and the State Department
recognizes that this is safer
than the alternative through
rail

15:12.044 --> 15:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or truck, and that is another
reason why I think the pipeline
should be built.

15:16.149 --> 15:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator
Markey, let me come back to
something else. We're seeing

15:19.952 --> 15:25.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some analysis today that -- and
the president himself said this.
He said this is a largely

15:25.391 --> 15:29.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- or suggested this is largely
a symbolic move. He said this is
not going to be -- quote

15:29.695 --> 15:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "the express lane to climate
disaster that some people
argue."

15:35.601 --> 15:39.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the argument is made that
one oil infrastructure projects
is really not going to affect
climate

15:39.939 --> 15:42.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
change that much.

15:42.542 --> 15:48.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. EDWARD MARKEY: Well, on the
other hand, you cannot preach
temperance from a bar stool.

15:48.581 --> 15:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if the United States is
going to be in Paris, that's
what the president will be doing

15:54.020 --> 15:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in representing our country, you
can't be telling the rest of the
world to be reducing

15:58.591 --> 16:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your greenhouse gases while
simultaneously saying that we're
going to allow for a pipeline

16:05.665 --> 16:12.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to be built with big
environmental issues, carrying
the dirtiest oil in the world,
and

16:12.839 --> 16:18.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do so credibly as we tell
other countries that they should
reduce their consumption

16:18.778 --> 16:23.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of fossil fuels, they should
reduce their greenhouse gases.

16:23.249 --> 16:28.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I think that it's not
insignificant. In fact, I think
it's very important, in
combination

16:28.087 --> 16:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the president's clean power
rules to reduce greenhouse gases
from the utilities,

16:32.892 --> 16:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which the Republicans oppose, to
continue to keep the fuel
economy standards heading

16:38.197 --> 16:44.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
towards 54.5 miles per gallon by
the year 2025, which the
Republicans pledge to take

16:44.070 --> 16:48.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
off the books, and to keep the
tax breaks for wind and solar on
the books, which the

16:48.407 --> 16:53.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans are pledging
to take off the books.

16:53.179 --> 16:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of a totality of a
story that the United States can
now bring with great credibility

16:57.316 --> 17:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Paris that makes it possible
for us to say that, China and
India and other countries,

17:01.487 --> 17:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you must now do your part.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 10 seconds
left, Congressman Lance. Do you
want to respond?

17:07.593 --> 17:12.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. LEONARD LANCE: Yes, I don't
think either China or India will
be impressed by this.

17:12.498 --> 17:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this will make no
difference at all in Paris, and
I hope that a new president

17:16.302 --> 17:19.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
revisits this in 2017.

17:19.438 --> 17:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Leonard Lance, Senator Ed
Markey, we thank you both.

17:24.710 --> 17:31.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. EDWARD MARKEY: Thank
you. Appreciate it.

17:31.550 --> 17:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REP. LEONARD LANCE: Thank you.

17:38.090 --> 17:45.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia suspended
all flights to Egypt today, and
the U.S. stepped up security

17:45.498 --> 17:50.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
efforts, as the search continues
for answers to what brought down
that Russian plane. The

17:50.770 --> 17:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
passenger jet crashed over the
Sinai Peninsula last Saturday,
killing all 224 people on board.

17:57.443 --> 18:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner has the story.

18:00.079 --> 18:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It was chaos at
the Sharm el-Sheikh Airport
today. Britain's ambassador

18:04.850 --> 18:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Egypt tried to reassure
anxious travelers, to little
avail.

18:08.454 --> 18:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: So, what's the problem?
You're stuttering now. We want
to go home.

18:13.693 --> 18:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: About 20,000
British tourists have been
stuck, as flight schedules
remain

18:18.497 --> 18:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in flux. Today was the first
time flights were available back
to Britain. Now about

18:23.469 --> 18:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
30,000 Russian tourists are
joining the chaos, after Russian
President Vladimir Putin, in

18:28.341 --> 18:32.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a turnaround, stopped
all flights to Egypt.

18:32.078 --> 18:35.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia's security chief made the
recommendation this morning.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER BORTNIKOV, Director,
Federal Security Service
(through translator): I think it
will

18:37.550 --> 18:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be reasonable to suspend all
Russian flights until we
determine the real causes of
what

18:41.687 --> 18:45.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
happened. We must reach
completely objective and
validated conclusions. That's
important

18:45.091 --> 18:48.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for both the investigation
and informing people.

18:48.461 --> 18:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Some wreckage
from the plane crash site has
been taken to Moscow for
explosives

18:53.299 --> 18:57.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
testing. Yesterday, British
Prime Minister David Cameron
said it was more likely than

18:57.970 --> 19:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not that a bomb brought the
plane down. And the Islamic
State group claimed
responsibility.

19:03.943 --> 19:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were also reports that
chatter intercepted from
suspected militants pointed to
that conclusion

19:07.646 --> 19:10.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

19:10.449 --> 19:15.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, in Washington, White
House spokesman Josh Earnest
wasn't ready to make any
declarations.

19:15.254 --> 19:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: The United States
still has not made our own

19:19.692 --> 19:26.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
determination about the cause of
the incident. And while we can't
rule anything in or out,

19:26.399 --> 19:31.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we have to consider the
possibility of potential
terrorist involvement here.

19:31.670 --> 19:36.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Today, however,
the Homeland Security Department
announced new precautions

19:36.475 --> 19:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for U.S.-bound flights from the
region, including stepped-up
baggage and cargo screening.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Margaret
joins me now for more.

19:44.650 --> 19:47.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Margaret, thank you
for that report.

19:47.386 --> 19:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what explains the shift in
Russia's thinking? First, Putin
is saying, no, we don't want

19:52.491 --> 19:56.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to believe that this was an act
of terror, but now they're
suspending flights.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, Judy,
Putin is one of the two leaders
involved here who has the

19:59.665 --> 20:04.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most to lose economically and
-- but mostly politically.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One Russian said to me today,
this isn't just a human
question, a security question,
but

20:07.973 --> 20:11.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a deeply political one.

20:11.177 --> 20:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he's in a dilemma, or he has
felt in a dilemma, because here
he is with this adventure

20:16.449 --> 20:21.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into Syria, and in fact he was
asked on Russian TV just within
the last two weeks, does this

20:21.053 --> 20:24.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
put us at risk? He
said absolutely not.

20:24.390 --> 20:29.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if it does turn out it's a
greater risk, that's a problem.
Then, people close to the

20:29.929 --> 20:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kremlin told me also that, if
that's the conclusion, he wants
to be ready with a plan, sort of

20:36.402 --> 20:41.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like George W. Bush after 9/11.
So, the Ministry of Defense is
working on a lot of contingency

20:41.340 --> 20:43.843 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plans.

20:43.843 --> 20:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm told that there's a huge
movement of Russian assault
ships moving into the Eastern

20:48.848 --> 20:54.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mediterranean. That said, the
Russians have investigators on
the ground. The people they

20:54.854 --> 21:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sent are from the FSB, which is
essentially the KGB successor.
They must have seen something

21:00.860 --> 21:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that overnight made them to
recommend to Putin that, you
have got to protect Russian
citizens.

21:06.398 --> 21:09.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as somebody said to me, if
he didn't and he didn't say
anything and there were

21:09.935 --> 21:12.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another attack, there would
really be hell to pay.

21:12.838 --> 21:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Margaret, you
have also got this discrepancy
with the Egyptians not

21:18.410 --> 21:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanting to believe that there
was a bomb, that there was
terror involved, but you have

21:21.947 --> 21:24.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got European countries saying
something different, saying they
have reason to think there may

21:24.984 --> 21:25.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
well have been.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

21:27.553 --> 21:31.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, there were reports
from France today -- they're
unsourced -- that the French

21:31.023 --> 21:34.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigators -- the only
investigators on the ground,
Judy, are the Russians, the
Egyptians

21:34.160 --> 21:37.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the French. Like,
the U.S. is not there.

21:37.596 --> 21:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So -- but the French have come
to that conclusion, but that's
sourced reports. So, for
President

21:43.903 --> 21:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
El-Sisi, there is so much at
stake. First of all, what a blow
to their last remaining

21:48.507 --> 21:52.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tourism industry. I mean, Sharm
el-Sheikh was really it at this
point.

21:52.311 --> 21:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, secondly, he won election
after taking power in what many
consider a coup saying,

21:57.049 --> 22:00.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I am the general. I can
protect us from terrorism.

22:00.619 --> 22:04.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, terrorism has
increased. He keeps saying and
asserting, we have control

22:04.990 --> 22:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over Sinai. Well, they don't.
Jihadist groups are much more
active there than they were.

22:08.661 --> 22:12.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And one of them declared
leadership to the Islamic State.

22:12.131 --> 22:18.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they're really in a bind.
They insist -- and I talked to
an Egyptian, someone close to

22:18.304 --> 22:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government today, who said
it really isn't definitive
information, but, you know,
also,

22:25.844 --> 22:31.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will pay a huge political
price. Yet, I'm told there is a
recognition on the part of

22:31.717 --> 22:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that government that, if they
wait too long, and the whole
rest of the world has come to

22:34.119 --> 22:36.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a conclusion, they will look
like they're hiding something.

22:36.789 --> 22:41.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, meantime,
you also have daylight between
what the Brits are saying

22:41.427 --> 22:43.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- the British are saying and
what the U.S. -- the British are
saying, well, we think

22:43.996 --> 22:45.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is likely reason to
believe it was a bomb.

22:45.531 --> 22:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Right.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. is
saying, no, we're not ready to
make that declaration.

22:49.802 --> 22:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: To me, Judy,
that was in a way the most
fascinating sort of conundrum,

22:55.074 --> 23:00.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because I'm told the U.S. and
the British are looking at the
exact same set of intelligence.

23:00.579 --> 23:08.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It clearly points to it a bomb,
but the British -- Prime
Minister Cameron, I'm told, felt

23:08.487 --> 23:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under -- you know, they had to
move quickly to save or protect
British citizens. They

23:13.359 --> 23:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have got 20,000 there, as we
have reported frequently. The
U.S. has essentially none.

23:17.463 --> 23:23.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have direct flights to
Sharm el-Sheikh. The U.S. has
none -- and that Cameron felt,

23:23.402 --> 23:28.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if he's going to suspend all
flights both directions, he had
to have -- do it with some

23:28.440 --> 23:32.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transparency, and that that was
what led them to say what they
said.

23:32.778 --> 23:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, a U.S. official told
me just minutes ago that it did
come as a surprise to Washington

23:38.817 --> 23:43.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yesterday when he did this, but
that there wasn't tension over
this. And the U.S. just

23:43.789 --> 23:49.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
feels that it's got no
investigators on the ground. It
and the Brits are looking more

23:49.595 --> 23:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at overhead intelligence,
signals intelligence, as we
reported, and that they don't --
the

23:55.401 --> 23:58.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. feels it doesn't need to
jump the gun. It doesn't need to
assert that it's got these

23:58.737 --> 24:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigators on the ground,
and, frankly, undercut Egypt
completely, that they're just

24:03.676 --> 24:07.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to wait and let
it ripen a little more.

24:07.746 --> 24:11.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, really, 15 minutes ago, I
was told, somebody said to me,
"From what I have seen, we still

24:11.483 --> 24:14.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can't be entirely sure."

24:14.486 --> 24:17.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Margaret Warner,
following the story of the plane
crash very closely,

24:17.089 --> 24:18.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we thank you.

24:18.057 --> 24:18.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: A
pleasure, Judy, as always.

24:18.791 --> 24:33.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:33.105 --> 24:38.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Pablo Picasso in 3-D; and the
man behind an on-stage comedy

24:38.477 --> 24:41.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about racism.

24:41.080 --> 24:47.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, a White House
decision finally on the Keystone
pipeline, a rough week for

24:47.453 --> 24:52.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some Republican candidates, and
wins for conservatives on
Election Day.

24:52.524 --> 24:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, we turn to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks. That's
syndicated columnist Mark

24:55.694 --> 24:58.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shields and New York Times
columnist David Brooks.

24:58.130 --> 24:58.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Gentlemen, welcome.

24:58.564 --> 24:59.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy.

24:59.865 --> 25:02.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's
great to have you here.

25:02.201 --> 25:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that Keystone pipeline
decision, David, the president
finally -- seven years later,

25:06.038 --> 25:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we now know he's against it.

25:09.074 --> 25:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. Well, first
of all, it could be mythical.
With oil prices so low,

25:12.378 --> 25:15.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they might never build it
anyway. So, it really doesn't
matter at some level.

25:15.514 --> 25:20.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But pretending it matters, I do
think it's an
anti-environmental, anti-science
move.

25:20.786 --> 25:23.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His State Department and many
other experts decided, if the
oil is going to come out of

25:23.489 --> 25:27.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the sands, it's a lot cleaner to
have it go through the pipeline
than to put on trains

25:27.226 --> 25:30.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or trucks and send it over to
China through ships that way.

25:30.662 --> 25:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, so, if the oil comes out of
the sands, which it's going to
do if it makes economic

25:34.566 --> 25:37.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sense, we might as well do it in
the cleanest way possible. So,
to me, this is just a political

25:37.970 --> 25:40.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
decision to placate some people
who he's offended with some of
his other decisions.

25:40.272 --> 25:42.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Political
decision, Mark?

25:42.908 --> 25:44.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't think
anyone could accuse the
president of being impulsive. It
was seven

25:44.943 --> 25:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years, five exhaustive studies.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:49.014 --> 25:53.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And I think it
became a symbol for both sides,
bigger than it was really.

25:53.886 --> 25:57.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it was going to be
an environmental disaster. And I
don't think, with gasoline

25:57.890 --> 26:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$2 a gallon cheaper than it was
the day that Barack Obama was
nominated, the urgency had

26:03.295 --> 26:05.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
abated.

26:05.230 --> 26:10.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's
quickly turn, because there's so
much news to ask you both about.

26:10.269 --> 26:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jobs reports, David, some really
good numbers today. More jobs
than what had been forecast.

26:16.742 --> 26:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unemployment rate is down, I
guess, as low as it's been in
seven years, and not only

26:22.114 --> 26:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- but there is still this worry
about the so-called
participation rate. How do you
read

26:24.183 --> 26:25.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, so far,
obviously, it's great.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if this maintains, it's
great for Hillary Clinton or the
Democratic nominee. The
political

26:31.824 --> 26:36.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effects are kind of simple and
obvious. The labor force
participation rate is the
worrying

26:36.562 --> 26:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one, because it didn't change.
And so all these people are out
of the job market. Are

26:40.866 --> 26:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they people who could get back
in if there were jobs out there,
or are they people who

26:44.169 --> 26:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been so far out, that
they really can't get back in?

26:47.239 --> 26:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there was this troubling
study that came out earlier in
the week that middle-aged white

26:51.643 --> 26:58.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life expectancy is dropping,
which is astounding. And it's
dropping because of liver
diseases,

26:58.183 --> 27:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suicide. It's dropping because
of social dysfunction. And those
are presumably a lot of people
who

27:01.854 --> 27:04.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are out of the labor force.

27:04.756 --> 27:08.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, if it keeps going, we
will be able to see if some of
these people can get back

27:08.360 --> 27:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in and have productive lives,
have busy lives, have fulfilling
lives. But if they're
permanently

27:12.231 --> 27:14.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
out no matter what the
unemployment rate is, then we
have got a gigantic problem.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was
a disturbing report.

27:16.869 --> 27:22.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, your
discussion this week with Dante
and the professor from Princeton

27:22.107 --> 27:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really hit on the fact that so
many of these people, it's not
just liver disease and smoking

27:27.279 --> 27:31.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and drinking. It's jobs and
lives that have been changed.

27:31.917 --> 27:36.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's the cost of the
deindustrialization of America.
These people, the high school
graduates

27:36.355 --> 27:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who had great lives, good jobs
and could raise a family and
live comfortably, and all of

27:41.527 --> 27:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a sudden that's gone. And behind
it is a low-paying job, many
times not even that.

27:49.835 --> 27:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The numbers today, just think of
this, Judy. When Barack -- when
Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney

27:58.710 --> 28:04.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were nominated, the unemployment
rate in the country was 8.2
percent. That's just, what,

28:04.783 --> 28:09.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three years ago. OK? And at that
time, they pledged to get
unemployment in their first

28:09.621 --> 28:13.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
term under 6 percent.

28:13.191 --> 28:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, it's 5 percent. There
were more private sector jobs
created in the past month than

28:20.132 --> 28:26.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there were in eight years of
George W. Bush. So, it's good
news. We're still waiting for

28:26.538 --> 28:30.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the wages to kick up,
but it is good news.

28:30.309 --> 28:34.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I share with David the concern
about the participation in the
labor force, but this is good
news,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and it's good news
for the country.

28:36.949 --> 28:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I ask because
people are -- just seem to have
that never-ending debate, is

28:40.586 --> 28:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the glass half-full or is the
glass half-empty? And these
numbers seem to raise that
question

28:43.522 --> 28:43.822 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

28:43.822 --> 28:45.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

28:45.657 --> 28:50.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there were fears that if you
look at the normal rhythm of a
recovery, we're so deep

28:50.462 --> 28:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into this recovery time-wise
that you could think, well,
maybe it's time for another
recession.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was some fear of that. But
we don't seem close to being in
another recession.

28:57.402 --> 29:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is excellent news. The Fed
is now likely to raise rates.

29:01.239 --> 29:04.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's good news. And it's
just plain old good news. We
might as well lie back and

29:04.376 --> 29:04.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enjoy it.

29:04.977 --> 29:05.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Accept it.

29:05.844 --> 29:07.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:07.746 --> 29:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
several things to ask you about
with regard to the campaigns.

29:11.350 --> 29:19.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some interesting reporting this
week, Mark, about the campaigns
both of Marco Rubio and

29:19.858 --> 29:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what he's said or not said about
his own personal financial past,
and then today and in the

29:26.131 --> 29:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last few days a lot of reporting
about -- around Ben Carson and
what he said in a book, which

29:31.236 --> 29:36.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I happen to have right here,
that came out 25 years ago,
where he made different claims

29:36.341 --> 29:40.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about whether he was accepted at
West Point, offered a
scholarship, whether he applied

29:40.712 --> 29:44.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and got a scholarship, and then
another one about whether he
knifed -- tried to knife

29:44.816 --> 29:48.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a friend or a family member.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does all this, at this point in
the campaign, add up to
something? What are we to make
of

29:51.390 --> 29:53.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all this?

29:53.525 --> 29:56.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, the choice
of president, Judy, is the most
personal vote that any American

29:56.895 --> 29:59.231 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
casts.

29:59.231 --> 30:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We got an information overload
about these people. And it
really is in the final analysis

30:04.302 --> 30:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a choice on character and how
comfortable we are with the
person. So, the higher the

30:09.141 --> 30:12.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
office, the more important the
candidate, and you fly at a
higher visibility when you're

30:12.644 --> 30:17.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
running for president.
You get more exposure.

30:17.282 --> 30:21.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Your credentials are
scrutinized. Your record is
scrutinized. And the failures of
our presidents

30:21.820 --> 30:24.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the past half-century have
not been failures of intellect
or education. They have been

30:24.956 --> 30:28.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
failures of personality
or character.

30:28.560 --> 30:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, Ben Carson presents a
rather remarkable exception.
Most candidates get in trouble

30:34.766 --> 30:39.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by embellishing their record,
that is, by saying -- they were
a junior varsity, that

30:39.771 --> 30:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were actually all state in
football, or that I was at the
top of my class, when

30:42.974 --> 30:46.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it took me five years to
get through high school.

30:46.244 --> 30:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ben Carson wants to present
himself as a thug, a hoodlum, a
really bad -- just...

30:49.681 --> 30:50.215 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

30:50.215 --> 30:52.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When he was 14.

30:52.984 --> 30:57.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: When he was 14.
And -- but nobody else will
support him.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They remember him -- and he
talks about putting a knife and
running into the belt. He would

31:00.826 --> 31:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have inflicted great bodily
harm. I just find that rather
bizarre.

31:05.063 --> 31:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Has there ever
been a Christian memoir where
the Christian says, well, when

31:10.102 --> 31:12.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was a sinner, I was a really
very serious sinner. And so they
are all bragging about

31:12.771 --> 31:16.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how bad they were and
then they were redeemed.

31:16.141 --> 31:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's not atypical. I'm
wondering, will it hurt him? I
play this little mental game

31:21.480 --> 31:28.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with myself. Imagine a candidate
I really admired. I heard he
exaggerated his West Point

31:28.987 --> 31:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible admissions. Would I
say, oh, I really admire that
guy, but he told a fib about his

31:33.425 --> 31:36.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
early youth, I think I won't
support him anymore? I don't
think I would do that.

31:36.928 --> 31:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If there were six fibs, maybe.

31:37.729 --> 31:38.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

31:38.163 --> 31:39.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

31:39.998 --> 31:42.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But if it's this
one or this two, it's hard for
me to imagine an actual

31:42.901 --> 31:48.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voter who really likes Ben
Carson walking away because of
this.

31:48.306 --> 31:55.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Memoirists, every memoir has
some exaggerations and some
melodrama, and we're all
sinners,

31:55.046 --> 31:58.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so I don't think this rises to
the level where it's going to
hurt him, at least so far.

31:58.650 --> 32:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, both Ben
Carson and Marco Rubio are
saying these are questions the
press

32:02.521 --> 32:06.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just is wasting their time
asking, that they're way off the
point. Are these legitimate
questions?

32:06.825 --> 32:08.493 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

32:08.493 --> 32:13.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, yes, they're
legitimate questions, because
the president is an enormously

32:13.765 --> 32:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important office that touches
the lives of everybody in this
country.

32:17.269 --> 32:22.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what kind of a person, the
candor, the character, the
constancy, the reliability

32:22.207 --> 32:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- Ben Carson's problem is, he
wrote this about himself. This
isn't what somebody else

32:29.414 --> 32:35.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alleged about him. So, I think
-- and we don't have a lot about
Ben Carson we know. He hasn't

32:35.020 --> 32:39.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been in office for 12, 14, 15
years, say, oh, well, this was
just a little -- I think

32:39.758 --> 32:42.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Marco Rubio is different.

32:42.427 --> 32:45.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marco Rubio, this has been
kicking around on Marco Rubio,
the charge about using the

32:45.964 --> 32:50.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charge card of the Florida state
party when he was speaker of the
House in Tallahassee,

32:50.402 --> 32:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for five or six year years. He
should be ready to take care of
it. He should be ready to

32:54.940 --> 32:59.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rebut it and he should do it
forthrightly. It's kind of, I'm
going to come up with the

32:59.544 --> 33:01.746 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
information. I'm
going to find it.

33:01.746 --> 33:06.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a little bit like the way
Jeb Bush handled the question of
his brother going into Iraq

33:06.685 --> 33:10.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
without there being any weapons
of mass destruction. Would you
do it? It took him a week to do

33:10.288 --> 33:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. He changed his answers
four or five times.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just think this is one where
Marco Rubio should be ready to
step up because he knew

33:15.927 --> 33:17.863 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it was coming.

33:17.863 --> 33:21.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. It's
obviously unconsciously very
difficult for him.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder if he could get away
with just saying, I made a
mistake, and I want to
apologize.

33:22.234 --> 33:22.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a mistake.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

33:24.102 --> 33:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It would be
interesting to see if that would
work.

33:26.671 --> 33:30.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Rubio allegations come in
two categories. The one is about
the student loans and the

33:30.809 --> 33:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
buying the boat. And those, I
think, are fine, because they
just show he's a normal guy.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had some economic struggles.
He had some young kids, so he
cashed in their retirement

33:36.948 --> 33:39.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
account.

33:39.651 --> 33:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The credit card is the tougher
one. And some -- partly, he's
blamed a travel agent and

33:45.190 --> 33:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stuff like that. But he should
just come out, I would say, and
say, listen, we have made

33:47.792 --> 33:51.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mistakes in life.
This was one of mine.

33:51.296 --> 33:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be a gutsy thing to do.
But it would be candid. And we
saw this Chris Christie

33:55.567 --> 34:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
video this week about addiction.
We found it so moving. And I
would encourage all the

34:01.072 --> 34:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidates, be more personal.
just be more personal. Don't be
a machine. Don't let the

34:04.910 --> 34:06.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consultants control everything.

34:06.478 --> 34:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly, you
mentioned Jeb Bush this week.

34:10.148 --> 34:13.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, I was able to -- we
were able to air the interview I
did with Jon Meacham,

34:13.385 --> 34:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the author who's written a book,
really comprehensive biography
of President Bush 41, George
H.W.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.191 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bush.

34:20.191 --> 34:25.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The news coming out of that,
Mark, was the criticism that the
first President Bush makes

34:25.730 --> 34:30.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his son's secretary of -- his
vice president and his secretary
of defense, Donald Rumsfeld

34:30.568 --> 34:32.304 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Dick Cheney.

34:32.304 --> 34:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this week, you had the
younger Bush commenting, saying,
"I stand by what I did."

34:38.009 --> 34:42.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it put -- it was interesting
how it put Jeb Bush a little bit
on the spot again about

34:42.347 --> 34:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Iraq War. Is this the kind
of thing that is a problem for
Jeb Bush? Does this go anywhere?

34:45.850 --> 34:46.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you make of this?

34:46.818 --> 34:49.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: It's a
problem for Jeb Bush.

34:49.421 --> 34:52.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeb Bush is trying to get back
on stride. He's trying to get
over a bad debate, trying

34:52.958 --> 34:58.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get the bad campaign back on,
wants to show himself connecting
with voters. And so

34:58.396 --> 35:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is the question? He sits
down for the interviews and they
ask, what do you think

35:01.833 --> 35:07.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about your father criticizing
your brother's secretary of
defense, saying that -- very

35:07.072 --> 35:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unflattering things about
Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld?

35:11.109 --> 35:16.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It has always mystified
everybody who knew the first
President Bush why W. ever chose

35:16.715 --> 35:20.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Don Rumsfeld, who had actually
knifed Bush 41, his father...

35:20.518 --> 35:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: His father, yes.

35:23.288 --> 35:29.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: ... and really was
-- and then, of course,
administered the coup in his
rebuttal

35:29.294 --> 35:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the book by saying, well,
he's obviously getting up in
years and he's too old,
something

35:34.566 --> 35:38.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Jon Meacham put to -- I
thought to rest in his interview
with you, that he was very

35:38.803 --> 35:40.939 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
much alert and
involved and engaged.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's
exactly what he said.

35:42.173 --> 35:45.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is this the kind of thing
the matters today, David?

35:45.443 --> 35:48.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it will hurt
-- it will be a distraction for
Bush. But Bush is at

35:48.513 --> 35:52.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
4 percent. He has got
bigger -- bigger problems.

35:52.884 --> 35:58.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the things the elder Bush
said, the younger Bush, W. Bush,
believed by 2005. This was

35:58.256 --> 36:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a conventional view. I think
these interviews were done in
'08 and '10.

36:00.158 --> 36:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

36:01.559 --> 36:04.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so George W.
Bush had come to these views
about Cheney and Rumsfeld at

36:04.195 --> 36:06.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the same time.

36:06.564 --> 36:10.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the -- there are many
things that interest me about
what Meacham has come up with.
One

36:10.168 --> 36:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that the elder Bush didn't
talk that much about the war to
the younger -- to the president,

36:15.073 --> 36:19.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very reticent, very withdrawn,
second, that their Iraq policies
were not that different,

36:19.711 --> 36:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where we had always imagined the
big differences between the two.

36:23.048 --> 36:26.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, there is a lot of
interesting stuff in there. I'm
struck by Bush family reticence.

36:26.885 --> 36:29.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we see it hurting
Jeb these days.

36:29.354 --> 36:35.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I always thought
that the piece signed in The
Wall Street Journal by Jim Baker

36:35.126 --> 36:35.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and...

36:35.560 --> 36:36.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Scowcroft.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: ... and
Brent Scowcroft...

36:38.196 --> 36:39.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Brent Scowcroft.

36:39.831 --> 36:45.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: ... his national
security adviser and his closest
political adviser, warning

36:45.503 --> 36:50.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the invasion by the
United States of Iraq, was the
memo to Bush 41 to Bush 43,

36:50.942 --> 36:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which he chose to ignore.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when Bob Woodward asked him
if he talked to his father, he
said, "I speak to my divine

36:55.814 --> 36:57.248 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
father."

36:57.248 --> 36:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right, the
higher father. He said higher
father.

36:57.715 --> 36:58.383 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

36:58.383 --> 36:58.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: The higher
father. Higher father.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

37:00.185 --> 37:01.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, thus
putting him in his place.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

37:04.289 --> 37:06.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We didn't get around to those
elections this week. We will
talk about it next Friday.

37:06.958 --> 37:07.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Promise?

37:07.826 --> 37:09.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, I
promise, I promise.

37:09.627 --> 37:11.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mark Shields, David
Brooks, thank you both.

37:11.262 --> 37:13.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Thank you, Judy.

Next: Pablo Picasso was one of
the world's most famous
painters. But a new exhibit at

37:51.903 --> 37:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Museum of Modern Art in New
York examines his contributions
to another medium, sculpture.

37:57.642 --> 37:59.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

37:59.878 --> 38:05.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A court jester in
bronze, an early experiment in
three dimensions by Pablo

38:05.383 --> 38:10.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Picasso. As Picasso Sculpture,
the huge and much-lauded
exhibition at New York's Museum

38:10.188 --> 38:14.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Modern Art shows,
experiment is the right word.

38:14.392 --> 38:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it never stopped. Ann Temkin
is one of the show's curators.

38:18.396 --> 38:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN TEMKIN, Museum of Modern
Art: It certainly had to do with
a spark of inspiration, either

38:23.168 --> 38:28.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technically or some kind of
puzzle that came to his mind.

38:28.439 --> 38:33.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Picasso was the
preeminent artist of the 20th
century, but this side

38:33.044 --> 38:37.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of him remains far less known
than his painting. He formally
trained as a painter, and kept

38:37.282 --> 38:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at that throughout his life.

38:40.785 --> 38:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Upstairs in the museum, one can
see many famous examples,
including the groundbreaking
cubist

38:44.822 --> 38:49.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
masterwork from 1907 Les
Demoiselles d'Avignon.

38:49.093 --> 38:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Sculpture exhibition, over
140 works gathered from
institutions around the world,
shows

38:55.900 --> 39:01.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Picasso breaking ground in this
medium as well, but more
playfully, in spurts, as he

39:01.005 --> 39:03.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
became curious about
space and material.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.778 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Co-curator Anne Umland:

39:06.778 --> 39:09.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE UMLAND, Museum of Modern
Art: Now, stepping over this
threshold, we have just
time-traveled

39:09.981 --> 39:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three years. And in those three
years, Picasso, when he comes
back to making three-dimensional

39:15.386 --> 39:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
objects, does it in ways that
nobody has ever done before.

39:18.990 --> 39:24.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A guitar made of
paper, string, cardboard. A
violin made of painted sheet

39:24.829 --> 39:30.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
metal and wire. Picasso changed
the history of art through his
choice of everyday subjects,

39:30.802 --> 39:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his use of materials, his mixing
of genres, as with the six small
absinthe glasses brought

39:36.975 --> 39:42.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
together in this exhibition for
the first time since they were
in Picasso's studio,

39:42.480 --> 39:48.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colorfully painted bronze, a
real spoon all twisted together
into a new kind of sculpture.

39:48.019 --> 39:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE UMLAND: Up until now,
pretty much, sculpture has to do
with recognizable bodies of
people,

39:53.992 --> 39:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they are modeled or cast.
They're very solid. And instead
of that, Picasso decides

39:59.063 --> 40:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is going to make a sculpture
of something small and domestic
and that you hold in your

40:05.103 --> 40:09.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hand. He sets out to overturn
just about every sort of rule or
given or way of thinking about

40:09.707 --> 40:12.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
material that you
can come up with.

40:12.277 --> 40:17.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: After every phase
of experimentation, represented
here by individual rooms,
Picasso

40:17.982 --> 40:22.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would leave aside sculpture for
several years, before picking it
up again, always with something

40:22.887 --> 40:27.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new, these figures from the late
1920s, for example, and then a
group of more monumental

40:27.825 --> 40:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heads in the early 1930s.

40:31.696 --> 40:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unlike his paintings, Picasso
rarely exhibited his sculptures.
Instead, he lived with them.

40:36.801 --> 40:41.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE UMLAND: He's not coming out
of a sculpture tradition in
Western art. He's looking at

40:41.506 --> 40:46.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African or oceanic objects that
have a ritual function and that
have a soul or an anima.

40:46.411 --> 40:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you think
he thought of them that way?

40:48.279 --> 40:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNE UMLAND: I think he thought
of his sculptures as personages.

40:51.349 --> 40:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Personages,
which means what?

40:53.618 --> 40:56.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNE UMLAND: Which would mean,
to me, things that have a life.

40:56.421 --> 41:00.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This giant
head of a woman is from 1932.

41:00.058 --> 41:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE UMLAND: I think it's
amazing how she's both
monumental and goofy at the same
time.

41:06.064 --> 41:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. You say
goofy, which I'm not -- I'm sure
is a technical term in -- art

41:08.266 --> 41:09.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
curators.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANNE UMLAND: Yes, very
highly technical.

41:11.402 --> 41:17.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But it is sort of
introducing the goofy to a
tradition that is more about...

41:17.175 --> 41:18.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANNE UMLAND: Solemnity
and admiration.

41:18.109 --> 41:20.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

41:20.011 --> 41:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE UMLAND: No, I think the way
that he manages to make things
that, yes, I will stick with

41:25.149 --> 41:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my word choice of goofy or
cartoony or the way the features
are exaggerated, that maybe

41:30.321 --> 41:36.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's back to part of what he's
doing to animate something that
otherwise is very solid

41:36.127 --> 41:38.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and inanimate.

41:38.730 --> 41:44.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Picasso remained
in German-occupied Paris through
the war years, using materials

41:44.535 --> 41:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at hand, including for this
bull's head, an old bicycle seat
and handlebars cast in bronze.

41:50.575 --> 41:56.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN TEMKIN: And what's amazing
is, with the casting, you still
read the metal of the handlebars

41:56.848 --> 42:02.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the leather of the seat
extremely clearly. And I think
what Picasso loved about the
joke

42:02.019 --> 42:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the fact that the bronze
casting of these ordinary
everyday objects sort of turns
them

42:10.395 --> 42:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a work of art, but not
completely. You're still aware
of that original bicycle
identity.

42:15.566 --> 42:19.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
RACHEL HARRISON, Artist:
Anything goes. And you can feel
that in his work.

42:19.370 --> 42:23.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rachel Harrison
is a prominent contemporary
artist whose work, like
Picasso's,

42:23.508 --> 42:28.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crosses genres. She sees a sense
of play, but also the horror of
war.

42:28.746 --> 42:33.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RACHEL HARRISON: I look at those
bodies, and I see limbs that
have come apart and come

42:33.684 --> 42:38.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back together, and I see things
that are more gruesome than
beautiful.

42:38.589 --> 42:45.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the materials appear playful,
it's because it wasn't his first
medium and he had a comfort

42:45.062 --> 42:50.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in oil and oil paint. And so
when he comes to these other
materials, like metal or
plaster,

42:50.768 --> 42:53.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's just a kind of freedom
that he has to experiment, and
there's less at stake,

42:53.504 --> 42:56.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because he wasn't exhibiting
them in the same way.

42:56.040 --> 43:01.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The playfulness
continued into his later years.
And the exhibition ends with

43:01.446 --> 43:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a group of models Picasso worked
on in the 1960s, when he was in
his 80s. In some cases,

43:07.752 --> 43:11.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they became monumental public
sculptures, including his last
and largest in Chicago's

43:11.856 --> 43:15.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Richard J. Daley Center.

43:15.226 --> 43:21.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANN TEMKIN: He had dreamed of
making monumentally scaled work.
And with these enlargements,

43:21.332 --> 43:28.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there's just an entirely
different physical and
psychological relationship to
them.

43:28.940 --> 43:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One question this
exhibition has raised for some
art critics, was Picasso

43:31.843 --> 43:34.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a better sculptor than painter?

43:34.879 --> 43:37.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE UMLAND: I don't think we
have to choose. I think we come
down on the side of Picasso

43:37.348 --> 43:38.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the artist.

43:38.683 --> 43:43.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Not, in the
end, a bad side to choose.

43:43.020 --> 43:50.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the Museum of Modern Art in
New York, I'm Jeffrey Brown for
the "PBS NewsHour."

43:50.561 --> 44:04.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, tonight,
as part of the Friday night arts
lineup, PBS and OnStage

44:04.008 --> 44:08.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in America present a stage
comedy about racism that throws
political correctness out the

44:08.513 --> 44:10.882 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
window.

44:10.882 --> 44:15.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan recently sat
down with the play's author,
Greg Kalleres.

44:15.119 --> 44:18.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tonight on
PBS, a performance that takes a
look at racism through the lens

44:18.923 --> 44:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of marketing and commercialism.

44:22.727 --> 44:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Honky" is a satirical comedy
about five people attempting to
navigate the dicey waters of

44:28.966 --> 44:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race, rhetoric and basketball
shoes. A performance of the play
was taped at the San Diego
Repertory

44:32.336 --> 44:33.304 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Theatre.

44:33.304 --> 44:35.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the author, Greg
Kalleres, joins me know.

44:35.806 --> 44:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, thank you for joining me.

44:37.041 --> 44:39.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
First of all, why this play?

44:39.710 --> 44:41.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG KALLERES, Playwright,
"Honky": Well, I worked in
advertising. I kind of stumbled

44:41.812 --> 44:43.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into advertising.

44:43.681 --> 44:50.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think I was shocked mainly by
how white the industry was in
general, and because so

44:50.087 --> 44:57.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much of the stuff that we're
marketing is to non-white
demographics, it was interesting

44:57.228 --> 44:59.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see how many people were
forced to speak comfortably
about something that they were

44:59.363 --> 45:00.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
clearly not comfortable.

45:00.631 --> 45:01.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Would you wear these?

45:01.832 --> 45:03.034 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Sure.

45:03.034 --> 45:05.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: I mean, what do you mean?

45:05.469 --> 45:08.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: See, I think it
looks like a circus shoe.

45:08.172 --> 45:10.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: You don't like it.

45:10.741 --> 45:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: I can't think of a pair
of pants that would go with
them.

45:13.077 --> 45:17.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: For me, like, the
language is the most important
thing, so hearing people

45:17.081 --> 45:21.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tiptoe around words and the
things they can say and can't
say and should and shouldn't

45:21.052 --> 45:25.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say when that guy is in
the room is fascinating.

45:25.456 --> 45:29.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: For the last 15 years,
Sky has been selling to your
people and only your people.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:31.996 --> 45:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Is it cool if I talk like
this? I'm not making you
uncomfortable. My people, your

45:36.601 --> 45:42.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people. I grew up in Chicago.
The point is, these are facts.

45:42.239 --> 45:46.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There is a
black man struggling with the
tension of selling basketball
shoes

45:46.777 --> 45:52.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to young urban demographics.
There's a white guy who has
problems with the words that he

45:52.249 --> 45:55.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
used and what sort of
consequences they could have
had.

45:55.753 --> 45:59.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's so many people dealing
with guilt of their racial
identity in America today

45:59.857 --> 46:02.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on so many different levels.

46:02.526 --> 46:07.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GREG KALLERES: These two
characters specifically, Thomas
is the black shoe designer. And
he

46:07.365 --> 46:14.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grew up in a really rich white
neighborhood. And I think he has
a lot of conflict around

46:14.038 --> 46:19.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, because there is so much
around the idea of being black
enough.

46:19.243 --> 46:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He designs shoes for a shoe
company that is primarily
targeting young black males, and

46:27.685 --> 46:33.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's very proud of that. But he
also has this other side of him
that he feels is white.

46:33.290 --> 46:36.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: I knew it would take a
toll. Growing up around all
those rich white people takes

46:36.627 --> 46:38.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a toll. It takes a toll.

46:38.429 --> 46:40.097 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTRESS: OK.

46:40.097 --> 46:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: I knew, eventually, I
would be getting bent over by
Clay Aiken, Coldplay, "Downton

46:42.566 --> 46:43.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Abbey."

46:43.300 --> 46:45.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:45.269 --> 46:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: I would wake up in a cold
sweat needing to buy some $600
Nottingham wall sconce from

46:51.776 --> 46:53.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pottery Barn.

46:53.944 --> 46:57.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTRESS: You said that sconce
gave your place a nice classic
feel.

46:57.381 --> 47:01.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: You're damn right it's a
nice classic feel. And it's an
elegant way to disguise

47:01.919 --> 47:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the lack of furniture in that
part of the room, but you're
missing the point.

47:02.987 --> 47:03.554 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:03.554 --> 47:05.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: And that is?

47:05.022 --> 47:08.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: This is not what
black people talk about.

47:08.559 --> 47:13.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: And there's
peter, who is the copywriter.
And this is I guess what I
relate

47:13.230 --> 47:17.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the most, because I was this
copywriter writing for brands
that were targeting urban

47:17.835 --> 47:20.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
demographics.

47:20.438 --> 47:24.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you're targeting a
certain demographic and you're
not that demographic, I thought

47:24.508 --> 47:27.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that was an interesting
in for the play.

47:27.545 --> 47:34.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: Why don't you tell me
why you came to see me today?

47:34.085 --> 47:42.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: A kid was murdered for a
pair of shoes, and I think it's
because of the commercial

47:42.426 --> 47:44.595 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I wrote.

47:44.595 --> 47:50.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: Sky shoes, you
wrote that ad? S'up now?

47:50.601 --> 47:52.470 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
ACTOR: Not too
much. How are you?

47:52.470 --> 47:54.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:54.238 --> 47:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's also
this idea that there is no more
derogatory a term for white

47:59.744 --> 48:05.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people than racist. It just
triggers all kinds of responses.

48:05.015 --> 48:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: I couldn't think
of a word that insults white
people the way that the

48:11.222 --> 48:15.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
N-word or other slurs insult
people of color. And there
really isn't one, which is why
the

48:15.760 --> 48:19.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
play is called "Honky," because
it's such a benign, comical
term.

48:19.330 --> 48:21.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If that's
the worst you can do.

48:21.265 --> 48:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: If that's the
worst you can do, is honky. I
mean, I haven't heard that

48:23.768 --> 48:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
used with sincerity since, like,
a Clint Eastwood-Dirty Harry
movie, I think.

48:28.706 --> 48:33.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The idea of being a racist, I
think, for white people is about
the closest you get to making

48:33.010 --> 48:36.881 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
them scared, or
offended, or upset.

48:36.881 --> 48:38.983 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
ACTOR: I run an
urban shoe company.

48:38.983 --> 48:41.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Urban?

48:41.652 --> 48:47.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: It's a euphemism for
African-American. The point is,
I spend a lot of times with

48:47.258 --> 48:50.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African-Americans. I know the
African-American culture and
sell to the African-American a

48:50.928 --> 48:52.663 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
product.

48:52.663 --> 48:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: You don't have to say
African-American every time, Mr.
Tallison. You can simply use...

48:56.567 --> 48:57.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Urban.

48:57.568 --> 48:59.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: I was going
to say a pronoun.

48:59.103 --> 49:01.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Oh.

49:01.005 --> 49:04.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: I sell basketball
shoes to them.

49:04.175 --> 49:06.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Well, now the
pronoun is offensive.

49:06.510 --> 49:07.745 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:07.745 --> 49:12.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: My overall point is,
I don't think I'm a racist.

49:12.783 --> 49:14.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Of course you don't.
That's precisely why you are
one. Do you understand?

49:14.952 --> 49:16.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: No.

49:16.887 --> 49:21.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: They will often
lose sleep over the fact that,
I'm not racist. I didn't

49:21.325 --> 49:24.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say anything racist. Did I say
something racist? No, no, no.
I'm not racist. I said -- what

49:24.595 --> 49:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said was -- and there's a lot
of back-stepping, and digging
more graves for themselves as

49:29.834 --> 49:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they continue to constantly, you
know, obviously attempt,
well-meaningly, to say the right

49:36.941 --> 49:38.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thing, and often failing.

49:38.442 --> 49:40.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: I'm getting married soon.

49:40.811 --> 49:41.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTRESS: Congratulations.

49:41.779 --> 49:45.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Thank you.
She's very white.

49:45.616 --> 49:49.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:49.386 --> 49:55.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: I don't know why I just
said that. I don't mean white as
in the distinction between

49:55.392 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the colors white and black. I
just mean she's very, you know,
white.

49:59.997 --> 50:02.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:02.032 --> 50:05.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: This is sounding bad. The
truth is, I'm totally
colorblind.

50:05.502 --> 50:07.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:07.738 --> 50:12.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: And I don't mean that
figuratively either. I mean I
don't see color. You should

50:12.476 --> 50:14.178 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
see my socks,
totally integrated.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:16.080 --> 50:21.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: I think the humor
in the play comes from the
attempt to never be called

50:21.118 --> 50:25.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one, and all the efforts we make
for people never to say, you're
a racist, or think you're

50:25.856 --> 50:27.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a racist.

50:27.791 --> 50:32.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of other
threads that you pull on in this
is that -- the commercialization

50:32.463 --> 50:38.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of racial identity in America.
You use a product, a basketball
shoe specifically. There is this

50:38.402 --> 50:43.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tension on what keeps something
real, what makes something sold
out, when does that crossover

50:43.173 --> 50:44.575 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happen.

50:44.575 --> 50:47.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GREG KALLERES: Cultural
appropriation has been going on
forever.

50:47.077 --> 50:48.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's part of
what America is about. Right?

50:48.545 --> 50:50.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: Absolutely.

50:50.314 --> 50:52.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We take
everything from everyone and
make something new out of it.

50:52.650 --> 50:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: Yes, because it's
authentic. And then we sort of
de-authenticate it.

50:57.288 --> 50:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Homogenize it.

50:58.656 --> 51:01.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GREG KALLERES: Exactly,
and it becomes a cliche.

51:01.025 --> 51:03.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: They're mine?

51:03.193 --> 51:05.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Yours? Didn't you
hear what I just said?

51:05.729 --> 51:08.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Give them to me.

51:08.132 --> 51:18.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: No, no, no, no. This is
good. Let's think about this.
What is yours? What does

51:18.108 --> 51:25.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the black man, Thomas Hodge,
have when all the dust is
settled? Your history? Culture?

51:25.816 --> 51:32.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No. Bought and sold years
ago, just like ours.

51:32.589 --> 51:36.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: It's something to
think about when you watch
commercials or to watch
anything.

51:36.994 --> 51:39.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How -- where do they come from?
Where do these ideas come from?

51:39.029 --> 51:40.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But you made
the awkward very digestible.

51:40.164 --> 51:42.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: Hopefully. At
least it's somewhat funny.

51:42.232 --> 51:44.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Greg Kalleres, thanks so much
for joining us.

51:44.034 --> 51:45.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREG KALLERES: Hey, thank you
so much. This was great.

51:45.769 --> 51:48.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: "Honky" is a
project of OnStage in America,
and airs tonight on most

51:48.939 --> 51:52.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PBS stations.

51:52.609 --> 51:59.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on the
"NewsHour" online: A Syrian
filmmaker captured beautiful
scenes

51:59.116 --> 52:04.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his hometown just weeks
before war erupted. Today, that
footage has become a love letter

52:04.989 --> 52:09.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to his country, and is part of a
short film called "In Damascus."
You can watch that on

52:09.059 --> 52:11.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our home page.

52:11.261 --> 52:18.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And meet a man who's celebrating
his 161st birthday today, that
is, his alter ego, John

52:18.669 --> 52:24.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Philip Sousa's birthday. For the
