WHEN RUSSIAN TROOPED INVADED

01:39.467 --> 01:40.233
ITS VALUE.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.633
THE RUSSIAN STOCK MARKET HAS

01:42.633 --> 01:43.867
DIMINISHED BY 20%.

01:43.867 --> 01:45.267
THAT'S JUST BASED ON THE

01:45.267 --> 01:46.333
SANCTIONS UP TO THIS POINT

01:46.333 --> 01:48.300
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE CLEAR

01:48.300 --> 01:51.667
DEPENDING ON RUSSIAN BEHAVIOR,

01:51.667 --> 01:53.000
ENERGY, MINING COULD BE ON THE

02:06.500 --> 02:08.100
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING, WHAT ARE

02:08.100 --> 02:09.533
YOU SEEING RIGHT NOW

02:09.533 --> 02:12.433
>> EARLIER TODAY, I WAS IN A

02:12.433 --> 02:14.200
TOWN WHICH IS ABOUT AN HOUR AN

02:14.200 --> 02:15.633
A HALF DRIVE AWAY FROM HERE,

02:15.633 --> 02:18.067
WHICH HAS BEEN OCCUPIED AS O

02:18.067 --> 02:21.867
YESTERDAY BY A GROUP OF ARME

02:21.867 --> 02:22.200
GUNMEN

02:22.200 --> 02:23.233
WHAT WAS RATHER INTERESTIN

02:23.233 --> 02:25.700
ABOUT WHAT WE SAW TODAY, A

02:25.700 --> 02:27.233
OPPOSED TO YESTERDAY, WAS WHAT

02:27.233 --> 02:29.267
WE SAW YESTERDAY WAS GROUPS OF

02:29.267 --> 02:32.367
MEN IN CAMOUFLAGE, CLEARLY WEL

02:32.367 --> 02:35.700
TRAINED AND WELL PREPARED,

02:35.700 --> 02:37.800
TOWARD THEIR SEIZURE OF TH

02:37.800 --> 02:39.467
POLICE STATION, AND LATER IN THE

02:39.467 --> 02:41.133
DAY, THE SECURITY FORCES, BU

02:41.133 --> 02:43.167
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE SINCE THEN

02:43.167 --> 02:46.733
BEEN REPLACED BY CLEARLY WHA

02:46.733 --> 02:48.167
ARE SOMETIMES JOKINGLY REFERRE

02:48.167 --> 02:49.633
TO CONCERNED LOCALS.

02:49.633 --> 02:50.267
LOCAL PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM WIT

02:50.267 --> 02:52.867
GUNS

02:52.867 --> 02:55.233
THIS HAS BEEN A PATTERN WE HAV

02:55.233 --> 02:57.633
SEEN IN EASTERN UKRAINE OVER THE

02:57.633 --> 03:00.700
LAST WEEK, LET'S SAY THE FUTUR

03:00.700 --> 03:03.667
OF THE GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AN

03:03.667 --> 03:05.900
THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE

03:05.900 --> 03:08.167
OCCUPATION BY LOCAL PROTESTERS

03:08.167 --> 03:09.667
>> WHEN YOU TALK TO THE LOCA

03:09.667 --> 03:11.100
PEOPLE OUT THERE, WHAT'S THE

03:11.100 --> 03:11.500
MOOD

03:11.500 --> 03:13.833
ARE THEY -- DO THEY THINK THAT A

03:13.833 --> 03:15.833
SHOWDOWN IS IMMINENT

03:15.833 --> 03:17.900
DO THEY THINK THEY WILL BE

03:17.900 --> 03:18.733
ANNEXED BY RUSSIA?

03:18.733 --> 03:21.300
>> WELL, I MEAN, MANY OF THE

03:21.300 --> 03:22.567
LOCALS WHO ATTEMPT TO GATHER

03:22.567 --> 03:24.467
AROUND THE ACTUAL SEIZED

03:24.467 --> 03:26.200
BUILDINGS THEMSELVES ARE

03:26.200 --> 03:27.867
ACTUALLY VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT

03:27.867 --> 03:31.033
THE NATION OF AUTONOMY FIRST AND

03:31.033 --> 03:34.167
THEN PRESUMABLY ANNEXATION B

03:34.167 --> 03:36.267
RUSSIA IN THE FUTURE

03:36.267 --> 03:37.733
IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO ASSUM

03:37.733 --> 03:40.567
THAT THAT REFLECTS ACTUALLY TH

03:40.567 --> 03:41.867
GENERAL OPINION IN THIS PART O

03:41.867 --> 03:43.533
THE COUNTRY.

03:43.533 --> 03:45.233
IN FACT, POLLING SUGGESTS THAT

03:45.233 --> 03:47.067
THE PROSPECT OF ANNEXATION B

03:47.067 --> 03:48.767
RUSSIA IS IN FACT NOT ONE THAT

03:48.767 --> 03:50.667
MOST PEOPLE WOULD WELCOME.

03:50.667 --> 03:54.367
BUT THE MOOD IS, I WOULD SAY

03:54.367 --> 03:56.500
EXTREMELY TENSE.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.700
GERMANS IN PARTICULAR, WESTERN

03:59.700 --> 04:01.567
AND UKRAINIAN GERMANS COMING

04:01.567 --> 04:03.933
FROM THE BASE, CONSISTEN

04:03.933 --> 04:06.167
AGGRESSION, NOT ONLY FROM TH

04:06.167 --> 04:07.400
ARMED MEN WHO HAVE SEIZED TH

04:07.400 --> 04:09.667
GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS, BUT ALSO

04:09.667 --> 04:11.367
FROM A LOT OF THE LOCA

04:11.367 --> 04:12.433
POPULATION WHO CONSIDER TH

04:12.433 --> 04:16.100
WESTERN MEDIA TO IN SOME WAY B

04:16.100 --> 04:19.100
COMPLICIT WITH WHAT THEY DEEM TO

04:19.100 --> 04:21.333
BE THE BROAD WESTERN COMMUNITY'S

04:21.333 --> 04:23.167
ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE UKRAINE

04:23.167 --> 04:25.767
THIS IS THE OUTCOME ESSENTIALL

04:25.767 --> 04:29.367
OF VERY SUSTAINED RUSSIAN STAT

04:29.367 --> 04:31.100
TELEVISION COVERAGE OF THE

04:31.100 --> 04:32.100
EVENT.

04:32.100 --> 04:33.367
UKRAINE HAS BASICALLY PAINTE

04:33.367 --> 04:34.800
THE POLITICAL PROCESS IN UKRAINE

04:34.800 --> 04:36.800
AS THE OUTCOME OF WHAT THE

04:36.800 --> 04:39.500
WOULD DESCRIBE AS WESTER

04:39.500 --> 04:39.767
MEDDLING

04:39.767 --> 04:42.633
>> AND WHAT ABOUT THE PROSPECT

04:42.633 --> 04:44.933
THERE MIGHT BE LARGE-SCALE

04:44.933 --> 04:46.667
ANTI-TERRORISM ACTIONS TAKEN B

04:46.667 --> 04:46.800
UKRAINE?

04:46.800 --> 04:50.400
>> WELL, WHAT THIS POINTS TO

04:50.400 --> 04:53.433
ESSENTIALLY IS THE FACT THAT THE

04:53.433 --> 04:55.200
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T -- SEEMS TO

04:55.200 --> 04:56.900
HAVE LOST CONTROL OF PARTS O

04:56.900 --> 04:58.600
THE EAST TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY

04:58.600 --> 05:00.667
DON'T APPEAR TO REALLY HAV

05:00.667 --> 05:03.267
CONTROL OVER THE POLICE IN ANY

05:03.267 --> 05:04.700
MEANINGFUL FASHION, AND AS A

05:04.700 --> 05:06.967
RESULT, IT WOULD SEEM TODAY THAT

05:06.967 --> 05:08.800
THEY HAVE HAD TO RESORT TO

05:08.800 --> 05:12.233
DEPLOYING THE ARMY TO REGAIN

05:12.233 --> 05:15.333
CONTROL OVER THIS SPART OF THE

05:15.333 --> 05:15.500
COUNTRY.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.900
THIS OBVIOUSLY TAKES THE WHOLE

05:17.900 --> 05:20.667
SITUATION FROM ONE OF SIMPLY A

05:20.667 --> 05:23.000
LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUE, WHICH

05:23.000 --> 05:25.500
THEY HAVE REALLY PROVEN VERY

05:25.500 --> 05:28.000
SHORT OF THE TASK OF ACTUALL

05:28.000 --> 05:31.100
COPING WITH, TO POTENTIALLY

05:31.100 --> 05:32.600
MILITARY OFFENSIVE, AND THAT

05:32.600 --> 05:34.167
SEEMS LIKE A VERY SERIOUS AN

05:34.167 --> 05:35.233
WORRYING STEP INDEED

05:35.233 --> 05:37.267
>> ALL RIGHT, PETER LEONARD OF

06:36.900 --> 06:39.533
PRICES ARE LIKELY TO STAY HIGH

06:39.533 --> 06:40.967

NEIGHBORHOOD IS A GRIM REMINDE

08:30.167 --> 08:31.733
OF THE TOLL DRUG ADDICTION

08:31.733 --> 08:32.167
TAKES.

08:32.167 --> 08:34.600
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, EMACIATED

08:34.600 --> 08:36.133
ADDICTS WALK THE STREETS

08:36.133 --> 08:37.167
POLICE GENERALLY DON'T SEE THE

08:37.167 --> 08:38.833
POINT OF LOCKING THEM UP

08:38.833 --> 08:40.933
DRUGS ARE EXCHANGED OPENLY I

08:40.933 --> 08:41.867
BROAD DAYLIGHT

08:41.867 --> 08:43.700
WOMEN ON THE STREET PROSTITUTE

08:43.700 --> 08:43.967
THEMSELVES

08:43.967 --> 08:45.533
OVER THE COURSE OF A FEW

08:45.533 --> 08:46.900
CONCENTRATED BLOCKS, YOU'LL SE

08:46.900 --> 08:48.767
PEOPLE SMOKING CRACK ON TH

08:48.767 --> 08:50.300
SIDEWALKS OR INJECTING

08:50.300 --> 08:51.833
THEMSELVES IN AN ALLEY WIT

08:51.833 --> 08:53.167
HEROIN OR COCAINE.

08:53.167 --> 08:54.400
NOT SURPRISINGLY, THIS

08:54.400 --> 08:56.767
NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN VISITED BY

08:56.767 --> 08:57.167
ANOTHER PLAGUE

08:57.167 --> 09:00.167
BACK IN THE 1990s, THIS WAS TH

09:00.167 --> 09:01.633
EPICENTER FOR ONE OF THE FASTEST

09:01.633 --> 09:03.967
GROWING AIDS EPIDEMICS IN TH

09:03.967 --> 09:04.300
WORLD.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.133
>> VANCOUVER EXPERIENCES WHA

09:06.133 --> 09:08.500
HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE MOST

09:08.500 --> 09:13.400
EXPLOSIVE EPIDEMIC OF THE AIDS

09:13.400 --> 09:16.200
VIRUS SINCE SUBSAHARAN AFRICA.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.267
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

09:17.267 --> 09:19.167
IT'S HAPPENING, SUPPORTERS SAY

09:19.167 --> 09:21.933
BY GIVING FREE HIV MEDICATION TO

09:21.933 --> 09:23.367
ADDICTS WHO SHARE NEEDLES.

09:23.367 --> 09:25.067
THEY'RE ALSO STEERING ADDICTS TO

09:25.067 --> 09:26.300
THIS CONTROVERSIAL FACILIT

09:26.300 --> 09:28.000
WHERE MEDICAL STAFF MIGH

09:28.000 --> 09:28.933
ACTUALLY HELP THEM INJEC

09:28.933 --> 09:32.867
ILLEGAL DRUGS.

09:32.867 --> 09:35.000
THE STRATEGY BEING DEPLOYED IN

09:35.000 --> 09:36.767
BRITISH COLUMBIA IS BEIN

09:36.767 --> 09:38.700
STUDIED CLOSELY BY THE U.S., B

09:38.700 --> 09:41.533
CHINA, AND BY EUROPE FOR HOW

09:41.533 --> 09:43.667
IT'S SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT A

09:43.667 --> 09:45.867
EPIDEMIC IN A VERY HARD TO REACH

09:45.867 --> 09:46.233
POPULATION

09:46.233 --> 09:47.267
SO HOW DOES IT WORK?

09:47.267 --> 09:48.500
SOMETIMES IT STARTS WITH PEOPL

09:48.500 --> 09:51.500
LIKE TRACY, POUNDING THE

09:51.500 --> 09:52.067
PAVEMENT

09:52.067 --> 09:53.767
SHE'S A REGISTERED NURSE, ONE OF

09:53.767 --> 09:55.933
A SMALL ARMY OF NURSES WORKING

09:55.933 --> 09:56.433
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:56.433 --> 09:58.467
>> I THOUGHT NURSES ALWAYS WOR

09:58.467 --> 10:00.300
WHITE SHOES, WHAT'S THE DEAL

10:00.300 --> 10:02.100
>> YOU DON'T WEAR WHITE SHOES ON

10:02.100 --> 10:03.433
THE DOWNTOWN EAST SIDE, THAT'S

10:03.433 --> 10:03.933
FOR SURE

10:03.933 --> 10:05.933
>> WITH HER MADICAL KIT STRAPPED

10:05.933 --> 10:07.267
TO HER BACK, SHE'S OFF TO SE

10:07.267 --> 10:10.367
ONE OF THE DOZEN OR SO

10:10.367 --> 10:11.567
HIV-POSITIVE PATIENTS SHE CARE

10:11.567 --> 10:12.467
FOR WHEREVER THEY ARE.

10:12.467 --> 10:14.033
>> IF I HAVE TO COME IN TH

10:14.033 --> 10:15.633
ALLEY TO FIND YOU, NO PROBLEM.

10:15.633 --> 10:16.033
IF I HAVE TO COME TO YOUR HOME

10:16.033 --> 10:20.933
NO PROBLEM

10:20.933 --> 10:22.433
>> DE SOUZA IS WORKING WIT

10:22.433 --> 10:24.033
COLIN TODAY, WHO SHE'S KNOWN FOR

10:24.033 --> 10:24.767
SEVERAL YEARS.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.767
HE LIKELY CONTRACTED HIV THROUGH

10:27.767 --> 10:29.300
SHARING A NEEDLE, AND EVEN

10:29.300 --> 10:31.100
THOUGH HE'S STILL USING, HE'

10:31.100 --> 10:33.867
SEEN DE SOUZA OR OTHER NURSE

10:33.867 --> 10:36.033
EVERY FEW WEEKS AND HE

10:36.033 --> 10:40.200
DILIGENTLY TAKES HIV RETROACTIVE

10:40.200 --> 10:41.033
DRUGS ON HIS OWN

10:41.033 --> 10:42.500
>> IT'S A FALLACY JUST BECAUSE

10:42.500 --> 10:44.100
PEOPLE ARE USING DRUGS O

10:44.100 --> 10:45.200
SELLING SEX, THEY DON'T CARE

10:45.200 --> 10:45.800
ABOUT THEIR HEALTH

10:45.800 --> 10:47.200
I THINK THEY CARE VERY MUCH.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.800
I THINK BECAUSE OF THEIR MENTA

10:48.800 --> 10:50.567
HEALTH AND ADDICTION ISSUES, I

10:50.567 --> 10:51.533
MIGHT BE TOUGHER

10:51.533 --> 10:54.833
>> THIS EARLY AND CONSISTENT HIV

10:54.833 --> 10:56.667
TREATMENT IS A CENTRAL PILLAR OF

10:56.667 --> 10:58.100
BRITISH COLUMBIA'S STRATEGY AN

10:58.100 --> 11:00.700
ONE THAT BEGAN WITH IMPORTAN

11:00.700 --> 11:01.933
DISCOVERIES BY THIS MAN'S TEAM

11:01.933 --> 11:03.933
>> I SAY, OH, MY GOD

11:03.933 --> 11:04.567
THIS IS HUGE

11:04.567 --> 11:06.167
THIS ACTUALLY CAN TURN I

11:06.167 --> 11:09.367
AROUND

11:09.367 --> 11:11.467
>> DR. JULIO IS ONE OF THE

11:11.467 --> 11:13.767
WORLD'S EXPERTS ON TREATING HIV.

11:13.767 --> 11:16.300
BORN IN ARGENTINA, HE'S NOW

11:16.300 --> 11:18.767
CANADIAN, HE HELPED FOUND TH

11:18.767 --> 11:20.200
BRITISH COLUMBIA CENTER FO

11:20.200 --> 11:21.933
SLENLS IN HIV/AIDS

11:21.933 --> 11:24.133
BACK IN THE MID-1990s, HIS TEA

11:24.133 --> 11:26.167
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST T

11:26.167 --> 11:27.967
DEMONSTRATE WHAT WAS THEN

11:27.967 --> 11:30.667
CONTESTED IDEA THAT AGGRESSIVELY

11:30.667 --> 11:32.300
TREATING HIV IN INDIVIDUALS NO

11:32.300 --> 11:34.100
ONLY HELPED THEM BUT CAN PREVENT

11:34.100 --> 11:35.700
THE SPREAD ACROSS AN ENTIR

11:35.700 --> 11:35.833
COMMUNITY.

11:35.833 --> 11:36.633
HERE'S HOW

11:36.633 --> 11:38.433
IT'S WELL KNOWN THAT PEOPLE WITH

11:38.433 --> 11:40.367
UNTREATED HIV ARE FULL OF TH

11:40.367 --> 11:42.000
VIRUS, AND IF THEY SHARE A

11:42.000 --> 11:43.233
NEEDLE WITH OTHERS, THEY'R

11:43.233 --> 11:44.933
LIKELY INFECT THEM AND SPREA

11:44.933 --> 11:46.700
THE DISEASE, BUT TREATING THOS

11:46.700 --> 11:49.133
ORIGINAL PATIENTS WITH HIV

11:49.133 --> 11:50.900
MEDICINE DRAMATICALLY SUPPRESSES

11:50.900 --> 11:53.033
THE AMOUNT OF VIRUS IN THEIR

11:53.033 --> 11:55.200
BLOOD, WHICH RESEARCH HAS SHOW

11:55.200 --> 11:56.433
MAKES TRANSMISSION TO OTHERS

11:56.433 --> 11:57.500
MUCH LESS LIKELY

11:57.500 --> 11:59.767
ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR, IT'

11:59.767 --> 12:01.500
OVER 90% LESS LIKELY

12:01.500 --> 12:03.267
>> IN FACT, THE SINGLE MOS

12:03.267 --> 12:05.633
POWERFUL PREDICTOR OF YOU AS A

12:05.633 --> 12:07.667
INJECTION DRUG USER TO CONTRAC

12:07.667 --> 12:09.300
HIV WAS THE AMOUNT OF VIRUS THAT

12:09.300 --> 12:11.333
WAS IN THE COMMUNITY

12:11.333 --> 12:13.167
WHICH UPON BRINGING TREATMENT TO

12:13.167 --> 12:15.300
THAT COMMUNITY, CAME DOWN AND SO

12:15.300 --> 12:17.933
THE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS CAM

12:17.933 --> 12:18.200
DOWN

12:18.200 --> 12:19.933
IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S NOT THE

12:19.933 --> 12:23.233
NEEDLE, STUPID, IT'S THE VIRUS

12:23.233 --> 12:25.733
>> THESE FINDINGS TRIGGERED AN

12:25.733 --> 12:27.133
EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN TO

12:27.133 --> 12:28.467
TEST AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBL

12:28.467 --> 12:30.367
AND GET ANYONE WHO TESTE

12:30.367 --> 12:31.800
POSITIVE ONTO THE MEDS A

12:31.800 --> 12:32.867
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

12:32.867 --> 12:35.500
THIS OVERALL STRATEGY IS NOW

12:35.500 --> 12:36.833
CALLED TREATMENT AS PREVENTION

12:36.833 --> 12:38.467
>> WE'LL GET THE RESULTS RIGHT

12:38.467 --> 12:38.800
AWAY

12:38.800 --> 12:40.933
>> BUT PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES

12:40.933 --> 12:43.400
IN BRITISH COLUMBIA DIDN'T STO

12:43.400 --> 12:43.567
THERE.

12:43.567 --> 12:44.767
THE DOCTOR ALONG WITH MANY

12:44.767 --> 12:45.867
OTHERS PUSHED FOR THE CREATION

12:45.867 --> 12:47.700
OF THIS FACILITY WHICH IS CALLED

12:47.700 --> 12:47.967
INSIGHT.

12:47.967 --> 12:50.367
>> SO INSIGHT IS A VERY UNIQUE

12:50.367 --> 12:50.800
FACILITY

12:50.800 --> 12:52.800
IT'S THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IN

12:52.800 --> 12:53.833
NORTH AMERICA.

12:53.833 --> 12:56.200
>> DR. THOMAS KERR IS AN AID

12:56.200 --> 12:57.633
RESEARCHER WHO WORKS AT TH

12:57.633 --> 12:59.300
DOCTOR'S CENTER AND HAS DONE

12:59.300 --> 13:01.267
SEVERAL PUBLISHED STUDIES OF

13:01.267 --> 13:01.400
INSIGHT.

13:01.400 --> 13:06.667
>> IT'S A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WHO

13:06.667 --> 13:07.900
INJECT ILLICIT DRUGS SUCH AS

13:07.900 --> 13:11.300
HEROIN AND COCAINE CAN COME AN

13:11.300 --> 13:12.500
INJECT UNDER THE SUPERVISION O

13:12.500 --> 13:13.300
A NURSE.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.967
>> EVERY MORNING, A GROUP OF

13:15.967 --> 13:17.867
ADDICTS FILE IN, THE FIRST O

13:17.867 --> 13:20.033
700 WHO COME EVERY DAY TO SHOO

13:20.033 --> 13:20.400
UP

13:20.400 --> 13:22.600
ALL THEPHERNALIA IS LAID

13:22.600 --> 13:23.267
OUT.

13:23.267 --> 13:28.500
ADDICTS TAKE A SEAT AS ONE OF

13:28.500 --> 13:29.533
DOZEN DIFFERENT BOOTHS TO DO

13:29.533 --> 13:30.800
WHATEVER DRUGS THEY HAVE BEE

13:30.800 --> 13:32.400
ABLE TO BUY ILLEGALLY ON THE

13:32.400 --> 13:32.700
STREET

13:32.700 --> 13:35.233
INSIGHT OPENED IN 2003

13:35.233 --> 13:37.900
IT HAD TO BE GRANTED A SPECIAL

13:37.900 --> 13:38.833
EXCEPTION BY THE LIBERAL

13:38.833 --> 13:40.300
GOVERNMENT OF CANADA TO ALLO

13:40.300 --> 13:42.300
THE USE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS IN

13:42.300 --> 13:43.067
FACILITY THAT IS PARTLY FUNDED

13:43.067 --> 13:45.500
BY TAXPAYERS

13:45.500 --> 13:47.133
>> ON THIS MORNING, A WOMA

13:47.133 --> 13:50.600
NAMED JODY ALLOWED US TO FIL

13:50.600 --> 13:52.233
HER AS SH INJECTED

13:52.233 --> 13:53.867
SHE SAID SHE'S BEEN AN ADDICT ON

13:53.867 --> 13:55.267
THE STREET FOR MORE THAN A

13:55.267 --> 13:55.533
DECADE

13:55.533 --> 13:58.200
SHE'S BEEN SHOOTING UP FOR S

13:58.200 --> 13:59.967
LONG THAT MANY OF HER VEINS AR

13:59.967 --> 14:01.167
COLLAPSED OR COVERED IN SCAR

14:01.167 --> 14:03.567
AND THIS MORNING, AFTER REPEATED

14:03.567 --> 14:04.433
TRIES, SHE CAN'T FIND ONE THAT

14:04.433 --> 14:06.833
WILL WORK.

14:06.833 --> 14:08.167
SO ONE OF THE INSIGHT NURSES

14:08.167 --> 14:12.700
COMES OVER TO HELP HER

14:12.700 --> 14:14.400
>> IT'S ITTY-BITTY

14:14.400 --> 14:15.333
>> I KNOW.

14:15.333 --> 14:17.567
>> EVER SINCE IT OPENED, CRITICS

14:17.567 --> 14:19.233
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SHUT THI

14:19.233 --> 14:21.233
FACILITY DOWN, BUT NOW

14:21.233 --> 14:22.067
CONSERVATIVE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT

14:22.067 --> 14:24.300
SAYS INSIGHT ENABLES DRUG USE,

14:24.300 --> 14:25.433
NOT PREVENTS IT.

14:25.433 --> 14:26.900
IT'S TRIED TO CLOSE THIS

14:26.900 --> 14:28.667
FACILITY AND PREVENT OTHERS FROM

14:28.667 --> 14:30.433
OPENING IN CANADA.

14:30.433 --> 14:34.100
IN 2005, THE CANADIAN PRIM

14:34.100 --> 14:35.367
MINISTER STEPHEN HARPER SAID W

14:35.367 --> 14:37.000
AS A GOVERNMENT WILL NOT USE

14:37.000 --> 14:38.733
TAXPAYER MONEY TO FUND DRUG USE.

14:38.733 --> 14:39.300
THAT'S NOT THE STRATEGY WE WIL

14:39.300 --> 14:42.867
PER SUE.

14:42.867 --> 14:44.667
BUT IN 2011, THE SUPREME COURT

14:44.667 --> 14:47.533
OF CANADA RULED INSIGHT CAN STAY

14:47.533 --> 14:48.133
OPEN

14:48.133 --> 14:49.367
INSIGHT SUPPORTERS ARGUE THA

14:49.367 --> 14:51.700
NOT ONLY DOES THE FACILITY CUT

14:51.700 --> 14:53.700
DRUG OVERDOSE DEATHS, REDUCE

14:53.700 --> 14:55.467
DISORDER IN THE AREA, AND GE

14:55.467 --> 14:57.500
MORE ADDICTS INTO TREATMEN

14:57.500 --> 14:58.767
PROGRAMS, BUT THEY ARGUE, IT'S

14:58.767 --> 14:59.267
CRUCIAL IN THE CAMPAIGN AGAINS

14:59.267 --> 15:02.067
HIV.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.367
ADDICTS WHO COME HERE CAN GE

15:03.367 --> 15:04.867
TESTED FOR THE DISEASE AND

15:04.867 --> 15:05.933
REFERRED FOR TREATMENT I

15:05.933 --> 15:07.133
THEY'RE POSITIVE

15:07.133 --> 15:09.333
THEY'RE NOT SHARING INFECTED

15:09.333 --> 15:11.600
NEEDLES, AND THEY'RE IN REGULA

15:11.600 --> 15:12.400
CONTACT WITH NURSES AND MEDICA

15:12.400 --> 15:13.967
STAFF WHO WANT TO HELP THEM.

15:13.967 --> 15:14.767
>> ANY LUCK?

15:14.767 --> 15:16.833
>> YEAH.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.967
>> IF THIS FACILITY WASN'T

15:18.967 --> 15:20.467
THERE, THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE

15:20.467 --> 15:22.400
INJECTING IN ALLEYWAYS, RUNNIN

15:22.400 --> 15:24.300
FROM THE POLICE, AND WOULD

15:24.300 --> 15:25.733
CONTINUE TO BE DISCONNECTED FROM

15:25.733 --> 15:27.200
THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

15:27.200 --> 15:29.300
BUT WE'VE NOW FOUND A MECHANIS

15:29.300 --> 15:30.600
TO CONNECT WITH THESE PEOPLE AND

15:30.600 --> 15:31.767
PROVIDE THEM WITH MUCH NEEDE

15:31.767 --> 15:33.233
CARE

15:33.233 --> 15:34.867
>> YOUR CRITICS WOULD ARGU

15:34.867 --> 15:37.900
HAVING SOMEONE ON SIGHT WHO CA

15:37.900 --> 15:39.933
HELP SOMEONE, EVEN A NURSE WHO

15:39.933 --> 15:41.333
COULD HELP SOMEONE FIND A VEIN

15:41.333 --> 15:43.200
THAT IS PARTLY CONDONING AND

15:43.200 --> 15:45.000
MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.233
WHAT IS YOUR ARGUMENT AGAINS

15:46.233 --> 15:46.500
THAT

15:46.500 --> 15:49.800
>> YOU KNOW, I USED TO THINK THE

15:49.800 --> 15:51.500
SAME WAY AS YOU JUST DESCRIBED

15:51.500 --> 15:53.867
THAT ALL OF THIS WAS ENABLING.

15:53.867 --> 15:55.533
YOU MEAN THAT I'M GOING TO ASK

15:55.533 --> 15:57.667
MY JUNIOR STAFF, MY RESIDENTS,

15:57.667 --> 16:00.600
TO ACTUALLY WITNESS SOMEBODY

16:00.600 --> 16:02.133
INJECTING?

16:02.133 --> 16:03.500
GEEZ, I'M OUT OF MY MIND

16:03.500 --> 16:04.633
WELL, THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS

16:04.633 --> 16:05.733
IS NOT ABOUT DOING THE RIGHT

16:05.733 --> 16:08.467
THING OR THE WRONG THING

16:08.467 --> 16:10.367
THE ADDICTED PERSON IS

16:10.367 --> 16:10.467
INJECTING.

16:10.467 --> 16:12.433
>> THEY'RE GOING TO DO I

16:12.433 --> 16:12.567
REGARDLESS

16:12.567 --> 16:14.267
>> THIS IS HAPPENING

16:14.267 --> 16:15.867
THIS IS HAPPENING IN EVERY

16:15.867 --> 16:16.933
SINGLE CITY IN AMERICA

16:16.933 --> 16:18.200
SO BY PRETENDING THAT THIS I

16:18.200 --> 16:19.967
NOT HAPPENING, THEN YOU'RE

16:19.967 --> 16:21.867
TAKING THE SAME APPROACH THA

16:21.867 --> 16:23.367
THE PRIME MINISTER OF MY COUNTRY

16:23.367 --> 16:25.567
IS SAYING, SAYING THIS SHALL NOT

16:25.567 --> 16:26.000
HAPPEN

16:26.000 --> 16:26.900
AND SO WHAT?

16:26.900 --> 16:28.433
IT'S STILL HAPPENING, AND HE

16:28.433 --> 16:30.267
WANTS TO CRIMINALIZE IT, AND

16:30.267 --> 16:32.700
HE'S MAKING IT SO IT DOESN'T

16:32.700 --> 16:32.967
WORK

16:32.967 --> 16:35.867
>> THE DATA SHOWS THEIR STRATEGY

16:35.867 --> 16:38.367
HAS BEEN WORKING BY DRAMATICALLY

16:38.367 --> 16:39.333
INCREASING THE PEOPLE TREATE

16:39.333 --> 16:42.200
FOR HIV IN BRITISH COLUMBIA.

16:42.200 --> 16:46.533
THE NUMBER OF NEW CASES OF HIV

16:46.533 --> 16:47.533
HAS BEEN DECREASING, CUT BY MORE

16:47.533 --> 16:48.333
THAN HALF.

16:48.333 --> 16:49.833
EVEN AS THEY'RE LOOKING MORE FOR

16:49.833 --> 16:51.533
THE DISEASE, THEY'RE FINDING

16:51.533 --> 16:52.300
LESS OF IT

16:52.300 --> 16:53.867
THE DOCTOR SAYS NOT ONLY ARE

16:53.867 --> 16:58.800
THEY HELPING PEOPLE, BUT THEY'RE

16:58.800 --> 16:59.200
SPENDING MONEY

16:59.200 --> 16:59.900
FOR EVERY PERSON WHO DOESN'T

16:59.900 --> 17:01.400
CONTRACT HIV, THE GOVERNMENT

17:01.400 --> 17:02.800
SAVES AN ESTIMATED QUARTER OF

17:02.800 --> 17:04.167
MILLION DOLLARS IT DOESN'T HAV

17:04.167 --> 17:06.500
TO SPEND TREATING THAT PERSON.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.600
>> INVESTING MORE ON THE

17:08.600 --> 17:09.800
STRATEGY IS COST SAVING.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.267
NOT JUST COST EFFECTIVE.

17:11.267 --> 17:12.667
IT'S COST AVERTED.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.233
>> SO YOU'RE ARGUING IF YO

17:14.233 --> 17:16.733
SPEND MORE MONEY ON TREATING

17:16.733 --> 17:19.600
ACTIVE HIV CASES, IN THE END

17:19.600 --> 17:21.767
YOU WILL SAVE MORE MONEY BECAUSE

17:21.767 --> 17:23.167
YOU'RE NOT ADDING NEW PATIENTS

17:23.167 --> 17:25.433
TO THE POOL OF INFECTED PEOPLE

17:25.433 --> 17:26.500
>> I'M NOT ARGUING

17:26.500 --> 17:27.467
I'M TELLING YOU.

17:27.467 --> 17:28.867
THIS IS THE WAY IT IS.

17:28.867 --> 17:31.700
I DON'T MEAN TO BE TOO

17:31.700 --> 17:33.467
PROVOCATIVE ABOUT IT, BUT TH

17:33.467 --> 17:34.233
DATA IS IN

17:34.233 --> 17:36.833
YOU KNOW, WE HAVE RANDOMIZED

17:36.833 --> 17:38.067
CLINICAL TRIALS THAT NOW SHO

17:38.067 --> 17:42.467
THAT TREATING STOPS -- VIRTUALLY

17:42.467 --> 17:43.667
STOPS TRANSMISSION

17:43.667 --> 17:44.767
WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED

17:44.767 --> 17:45.533
IT'S OBVIOUS

17:45.533 --> 17:48.300
>> BRITISH COLUMBIA'S SUCCES

SMALL FRAGMENT MADE PUBLIC TWO

18:33.167 --> 18:36.333
YEARS AGO IS FROM ANCIENT TIMES,

18:36.333 --> 18:38.500
NOT A FORGERY, BUT ITS CONTENT

18:38.500 --> 18:40.233
CONTINUE TO PROVOKE CONTROVERS

18:40.233 --> 18:42.000
BECAUSE IT QUOTES JESUS MAKING

REFERENCE TO, QUOTE, MY WIFE

FOR MORE ON THAT, WE'RE JOINED

18:48.933 --> 18:51.967
BY MICHAEL, A PROFESSOR OF

18:51.967 --> 18:53.333
THEOLOGY AND AUTHOR OF THE BOO

18:53.333 --> 18:55.633
"THE SON OF GOD IN THE ROMAN

18:55.633 --> 18:55.767
WORLD.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.733
SO FIRST OF ALL, WHAT IS THE

18:58.733 --> 18:58.933
SCIENTIFIC FINDING CONFIRM AND

18:58.933 --> 18:59.867
WHY DOES IT MATTER

18:59.867 --> 19:01.067
>> RIGHT, WHEN THIS CAME T

19:01.067 --> 19:02.633
LIGHT ABOUT A YEAR AND A HAL

19:02.633 --> 19:05.467
AGO, THERE WAS A LOT OF UPROAR

19:05.467 --> 19:08.633
ABOUT WHY WASN'T THIS TESTED

19:08.633 --> 19:11.933
HOW DO WE KNOW THIS ISN'T

19:11.933 --> 19:12.333
FORGERY?

19:12.333 --> 19:15.467
TYPICALLY, THEY'RE TESTED BY THE

19:15.467 --> 19:16.700
STUDY OF HANDWRITING

19:16.700 --> 19:18.300
BUT BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH A

19:18.300 --> 19:20.267
BOMBSHELL IN THE PHRASE, M

19:20.267 --> 19:22.000
WIFE, AND THEY COMMISSIONED THIS

19:22.000 --> 19:24.033
TO BE SENT OUT FOR TESTING

19:24.033 --> 19:25.333
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC

19:25.333 --> 19:27.700
TESTING IS IT CANNOT

19:27.700 --> 19:28.367
AUTHENTICATE SOMETHING AS MUCH

19:28.367 --> 19:30.000
AS IT CAN PROVE IT'S NOT FAKE.

19:30.000 --> 19:30.800
WHAT I'M SAYING --

19:30.800 --> 19:32.067
>> THERE'S A DIFFERENCE?

19:32.067 --> 19:33.133
>> AS A FAKE, THERE'S

19:33.133 --> 19:33.733
DIFFERENCE

19:33.733 --> 19:36.267
THE TESTING DID NOT FALSIF

19:36.267 --> 19:37.667
ANYTHING, SO THAT KIND OF TILT

19:37.667 --> 19:41.567
THE SCALE A LITTLE BIT BAC

19:41.567 --> 19:44.467
TOWARDS AUTHENTICITY, BUT TH

19:44.467 --> 19:46.467
SCHOLARS WHO STUDY CHRISTIANIT

19:46.467 --> 19:48.767
ARE IN THIS MIDDLE GROUND OF

19:48.767 --> 19:49.800
MYSTERIOUSNESS ABOUT THE TEXT.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.467
THAT BEING SAID, SOME OF THE

19:51.467 --> 19:54.200
CRITICS ON THE FORGERY SID

19:54.200 --> 19:55.433
ARGUE THAT THERE IS BAD GRAMMAR,

19:55.433 --> 19:59.033
THAT THERE IS -- THERE ARE OTHER

19:59.033 --> 20:00.267
INDICATORS, BAD PENMANSHIP, THAT

20:00.267 --> 20:03.767
KIND OF STUFF, BUT PEPROLOGISTS,

20:03.767 --> 20:08.367
NERDS LIKE US WHO STUDY ANCIEN

20:08.367 --> 20:10.200
PUPIERY, WE SEE BAD HANDWRITIN

20:10.200 --> 20:11.033
ALL THE TIME

20:11.033 --> 20:12.933
THE APOSTLE PAUL IN THE NE

20:12.933 --> 20:15.000
TESTAMENT TALKS ABOUT HIS BA

20:15.000 --> 20:15.233
HANDWRITING.

20:15.233 --> 20:16.800
IT'S A SKILL THAT'S ACQUIRED AND

20:16.800 --> 20:18.300
WE MIGHT THINK OF TYPING IN TH

20:18.300 --> 20:19.067
MODERN WORLD, RIGHT?

20:19.067 --> 20:19.533
>> RIGHT

20:19.533 --> 20:21.467
>> IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE SMAR

20:21.467 --> 20:22.533
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

20:22.533 --> 20:25.033
>> TO A NON-CHRISTIAN SCHOLAR,

20:25.033 --> 20:26.933
WHAT ARE THE RELIGIOUS

20:26.933 --> 20:28.300
RAMIFICATIONS IF JESUS DID HAV

20:28.300 --> 20:29.167
A WIFE

20:29.167 --> 20:30.500
WHY DOES THAT MATTER SO MUCH

20:30.500 --> 20:32.667
>> RIGHT, SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE

20:32.667 --> 20:37.233
IS PROBABLY IN SEVENTH OR EIGHTH

20:37.233 --> 20:39.533
CENTURY PUPIEEROUS, WHICH IF

20:39.533 --> 20:42.100
AUTHENTIC, PRESERVES AN EARLIE

20:42.100 --> 20:43.533
TEXT WHICH REALLY DOESN'T TELL

20:43.533 --> 20:44.733
US ANYTHING ABOUT THE FIRS

20:44.733 --> 20:44.933
CENTURY.

20:44.933 --> 20:46.333
WE HAVE LAYERS OF HISTORY.

20:46.333 --> 20:48.233
I WOULD SAY MOST SCHOLARS DON'

20:48.233 --> 20:49.700
THINK JESUS WAS MARRIED AND

20:49.700 --> 20:51.667
DON'T THINK THAT'S A PIOUS

20:51.667 --> 20:52.233
ANSWER

20:52.233 --> 20:53.967
IT'S ABOUT HISTORICA

20:53.967 --> 20:56.267
PLAUSIBILITY THAT HE WAS A

20:56.267 --> 20:57.700
ITINERANT TEACHER.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.367
HE SAYS VERY CONTROVERSY THING

20:59.367 --> 21:01.000
CRITICAL OF BIOLOGICAL AND

21:01.000 --> 21:02.200
DOMESTIC FAMILY LIFE

21:02.200 --> 21:04.400
ALREADY THERE IN THE SCRIPTURES,

21:04.400 --> 21:07.467
AND I THINK THAT MOST SCHOLARS

21:07.467 --> 21:09.167
AND MOST CHRISTIANS WILL SAY

21:09.167 --> 21:11.000
WELL, WE DON'T THINK JESUS WAS

21:11.000 --> 21:12.800
MARRIED AND WE THINK THIS IS A

21:12.800 --> 21:14.533
LATER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ROLES

21:14.533 --> 21:20.333
OF WOMEN DUSIPALS AND SEX AN

21:20.333 --> 21:21.833
FAMILY LIFE, BUT THAT IS

21:21.833 --> 21:22.800
INTERESTING FOR A DIFFEREN

21:22.800 --> 21:24.600
REASON TO MOST SCHOLARS IN WHICH

21:24.600 --> 21:28.067
WE WOULD SAY THIS PAPYRUS GIVE

21:28.067 --> 21:30.433
US ANOTHER WINDOW INTO WHAT WERE

21:30.433 --> 21:32.467
LIVE DEBATES IN EARL

21:32.467 --> 21:34.133
CHRISTIANITY, SUCH AS IS

21:34.133 --> 21:35.200
PROCREATION A VEHICLE FO

21:35.200 --> 21:37.667
HOLINESS OR IS VOLUNTARY

21:37.667 --> 21:39.700
CELIBACY A VEHICLE FOR HOLYNESS,

21:39.700 --> 21:42.033
AND A SECOND DEBATE, IS TH

21:42.033 --> 21:47.500
WORTHINESS OF WOMEN AS

21:47.500 --> 21:49.167
DISCIPLES, ESPECIALLY TWO OF THE

21:49.167 --> 21:50.533
FIGURES DISCUSSED.

21:50.533 --> 21:51.533
>> MICHAEL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:51.533 --> 21:57.800
>> THANK YOU

21:57.800 --> 21:59.133
>> THIS IS PBS NEWS HOUR WEEKEND

21:59.133 --> 22:04.600
SUNDAY

22:04.600 --> 22:05.933

FLIGHT BETWEEN CHICAGO AND

22:10.233 --> 22:12.433

22:12.433 --> 22:14.433
3.5 TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE

22:14.433 --> 22:16.267
THAT'S ABOUT WHAT A MEDIUM SIZED

22:16.267 --> 22:17.633
CAR IN THE UNITED STATES BURNS

22:17.633 --> 22:19.033
FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR

22:19.033 --> 22:22.067
THIS WEEK, A COUPLE OF SWISS

22:22.067 --> 22:23.367
AVIATORS ANNOUNCED ANOTHER STE

22:23.367 --> 22:25.733
TO REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT

22:25.733 --> 22:26.533
OF FLYING.

22:26.533 --> 22:29.333

22:35.033 --> 22:39.367
HARDLY HAS DETERRED THESE TW

22:39.367 --> 22:39.467
MEN.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.500
THIS IS A HUGE SOLAR POWERED

22:41.500 --> 22:43.567
PLANE THAT HAS A WING SPAN WIDER

22:43.567 --> 22:47.633
THAN A 747'S, AS BIG AS IT IS,

22:47.633 --> 22:49.200
THE BIG AIRCRAFT IS NO HEAVIER

22:49.200 --> 22:51.100
THAN A LARGE CAR, AND IT CARRIES

22:51.100 --> 22:52.733

SOLAR CELLS.

22:56.900 --> 23:01.100
THE DESIGNERS AND PILOTS HAV

23:01.100 --> 23:02.867
MADE SEVERAL LONG TRIPS ON A

THEY SAY THE NEW PLANE IS EVEN

23:10.867 --> 23:10.933
BETTER

23:10.933 --> 23:14.200

23:22.833 --> 23:24.867

MEAN THE PLANE'S THOUSANDS O

23:50.267 --> 23:51.433
LIKE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
