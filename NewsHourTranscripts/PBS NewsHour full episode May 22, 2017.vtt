JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.372 --> 00:06.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.208 --> 00:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I have heard it's one of the
toughest deals

00:09.843 --> 00:11.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of all.

00:11.511 --> 00:15.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Israel,
President Trump
insists peace in the Middle East
requires

00:15.782 --> 00:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resolving the longstanding
conflict with the
Palestinians.

00:19.386 --> 00:24.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, we break down the upcoming
battle over
federal government spending.

00:24.657 --> 00:28.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What's on the Trump
administration's chopping
block?

00:28.094 --> 00:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And preserving the heart of a
very old city.

00:31.564 --> 00:36.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown takes us to
Tunisia, a country
with a newly democratic
government working

00:36.770 --> 00:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to embrace the richness of its
culture.

00:38.972 --> 00:45.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEILA BEN GACEM, Tunisia: Civil
society is
very active today investing,
investing time,

00:45.578 --> 00:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money, energy, advocacy to
restore such beautiful
spaces and bring back the magic
to the Medina.

00:52.685 --> 01:00.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:00.827 --> 01:03.696 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.730 --> 01:12.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is spending
tonight in Israel, after a day
of talking

01:12.839 --> 01:15.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up peace prospects in the
region.

01:15.442 --> 01:19.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all part of his first
overseas trip since
taking office.

01:19.312 --> 01:23.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We begin our coverage with a
report from John
Yang.

01:23.116 --> 01:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amid the pomp of
President Trump's
arrival ceremony in Israel was
an issue of

01:29.589 --> 01:35.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
policy that's confounded
presidents for generations,
the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.

01:35.395 --> 01:39.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Now we must work together to
build a future

01:39.432 --> 01:43.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where the nations of the region
are at peace.

01:43.236 --> 01:51.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have before us a rare
opportunity to bring
security and stability and peace
to this region.

01:51.111 --> 01:55.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister:
Israel's hand is extended to
peace in peace

01:55.348 --> 01:57.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to all our neighbors, including
the Palestinians.

01:58.017 --> 02:09.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The peace we seek is a genuine
and durable
one, in which the Jewish state
is recognized,

02:09.462 --> 02:15.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security remains in Israel's
hands, and the
conflict ends once and for all.

02:15.668 --> 02:20.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The warmth between
the two men
was evident, as was the Israeli
prime minister's

02:20.273 --> 02:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pleasure in both the change of
U.S. presidents
and a new direction on Iran.

02:25.512 --> 02:32.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: I want you
to know how
much we appreciate the change in
American

02:32.485 --> 02:34.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
policy on Iran.

02:34.220 --> 02:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want you to know how much we
appreciate
your bold decision to act
against the use

02:38.992 --> 02:42.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of chemical weapons in Syria.

02:42.595 --> 02:48.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I want to tell you also how
much we appreciate
the reassertion of American
leadership in

02:48.201 --> 02:50.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Middle East.

02:50.170 --> 02:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In an unscripted
moment, the president
seemed to give the first
official confirmation

02:54.641 --> 02:59.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the highly classified
intelligence he
gave Russian officials came from
the Israelis.

02:59.212 --> 03:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I never mentioned
the word or
the name Israel, never mentioned
it during

03:06.019 --> 03:07.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that conversation.

03:07.887 --> 03:12.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Jerusalem's Old
City, Mr. Trump
visited two of the holiest sites
of Christianity

03:12.759 --> 03:18.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Judaism: the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre,
believed by many Christians to
be the site

03:18.831 --> 03:25.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Jesus' tomb, and the Western
Wall, believed
by Jews to be part of Herod's
Second Temple.

03:25.538 --> 03:29.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump began his trip with a
much-anticipated
visit to Saudi Arabia.

03:29.776 --> 03:34.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There, he appealed to Sunni Arab
leaders to
unite to against extremist
movements like

03:34.247 --> 03:40.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS and al-Qaida and other
militant groups
backed by Shiite Iran.

03:40.119 --> 03:44.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The centerpiece was a speech the
White House
billed as an address to the
Muslim world.

03:44.357 --> 03:51.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: A better future is
only possible
if your nations drive out the
terrorists and

03:51.664 --> 03:54.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
extremists.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Drive them out.

03:57.604 --> 04:02.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Drive them out of your places of
worship.

04:02.108 --> 04:05.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Drive them out of your
communities.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Drive them out of your holy
land.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And drive them out of this
earth.

04:11.050 --> 04:16.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It represented a big
shift in tone
and temper from the campaign,
when he condemned

04:16.789 --> 04:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Islam for hating America.

04:18.725 --> 04:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: This is not a
battle between
different faiths, different
sects or different

04:25.265 --> 04:27.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
civilizations.

04:27.033 --> 04:35.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is a battle between
barbaric criminals
who seek to obliterate human
life and decent

04:35.141 --> 04:44.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, all in the name of
religion, people
that want to protect it life and
want to protect

04:44.784 --> 04:47.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their religion.

04:47.053 --> 04:50.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a battle between good
and evil.

04:50.223 --> 04:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump also joined
the leaders
of Egypt and Saudi Arabia to
open a center

04:55.128 --> 04:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aimed at combating online
militant ideology
and messaging.

04:59.699 --> 05:04.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's Saudi visit
coincided with
the reelection of Hassan Rouhani
as president

05:04.704 --> 05:08.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Iran, which was the target of
much of Mr.
Trump's rhetoric.

05:08.741 --> 05:13.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Rouhani contrasted the
heavy Iranian
voter turnout with the lack of
elections in

05:13.913 --> 05:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump's host kingdom.

05:15.715 --> 05:18.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian
President (through
translator): He has gone to a
country where

05:18.351 --> 05:21.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the word election has no
meaning for
them.

05:21.254 --> 05:23.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have never seen a ballot
box.

05:23.256 --> 05:26.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hope that the day will come
that Saudi Arabia
will adopt this path.

05:26.993 --> 05:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Like the Israelis,
the Saudis also
welcome the shift in the U.S.
approach to

05:31.564 --> 05:37.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran that the change in leaders
brings, one
reason for the opulent Saudi
welcome for Mr.

05:37.570 --> 05:42.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump, which included a
traditional sword
dance to underscore the
friendship Saudi King

05:42.408 --> 05:45.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Salman extended to the
president.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

05:47.947 --> 05:53.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I spoke a little
earlier with
Tamara Keith of NPR, who is in
Jerusalem.

05:53.386 --> 05:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I started by asking if
President Trump
got as impressive a welcome in
Israel as he

05:58.424 --> 05:59.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
received in Saudi Arabia.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Absolutely.

06:01.794 --> 06:05.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was another big red carpet
at the airport
just like there was in Saudi
Arabia.

06:05.998 --> 06:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was a marching band.

06:07.867 --> 06:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, tonight, there were
fireworks over
the Old City, though it's not
clear that those

06:13.573 --> 06:17.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were really for President Trump,
but probably
for Jerusalem Day.

06:17.343 --> 06:23.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tam, I want
to ask you
about the president's surprising
comments

06:23.182 --> 06:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he was with Prime Minister
Netanyahu
earlier today, and he spoke
about his disclosure

06:29.489 --> 06:33.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of classified information with
Russian officials.

06:33.059 --> 06:38.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: So, this was one
of the times
when reporters come into the
room -- it's

06:38.831 --> 06:40.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
basically a photo-op.

06:40.700 --> 06:45.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they made some brief
remarks, and then
a reporter from Bloomberg
shouted out a question,

06:45.605 --> 06:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asking Prime Minister Netanyahu
if he was
concerned about sharing
intelligence with

06:50.209 --> 06:51.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

06:51.210 --> 06:54.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, both leaders were eager to
respond.

06:54.247 --> 06:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Trump said, well,
I never said
anything about Israel when I
gave information

06:59.752 --> 07:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Russians, which is an
interesting point
to make, because although
there's been reporting

07:05.291 --> 07:10.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it was Israel, none of the
reporting
ever said that President Trump
had revealed

07:10.296 --> 07:14.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Russian foreign minister
that it was
Israel's information that he was
revealing.

07:14.934 --> 07:20.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, he was
essentially confirming
it with his own remarks.

07:20.239 --> 07:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tam, I want to ask you about --
go back to
the Saudi Arabia portion of this
trip, because

07:26.512 --> 07:31.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was clear that the president
was going
out of his way to avoid using a
term that

07:31.784 --> 07:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we heard frequently from him on
the campaign
trail, radical Islamic
terrorism.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you know about that?

07:38.891 --> 07:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: On the campaign
trail, he frequently
criticized Hillary Clinton and
President Obama

07:43.296 --> 07:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for not saying those words.

07:45.097 --> 07:48.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He would, say the words radical
Islamic terrorism.

07:48.668 --> 07:55.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in this speech, he carefully
avoided saying
those words, though he kind of
stumbled right

07:55.241 --> 07:59.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around that section of the
speech and departed
from the prepared remarks.

07:59.812 --> 08:07.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, an aide said he's an
exhausted guy,
and attributed it to that, and
not any sort

08:07.487 --> 08:12.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of purposeful going off-script.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He certainly seemed to be toning
down the
language.

08:15.194 --> 08:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wasn't as directly critical
of Saudi Arabia
as he had been during the
campaign either,

08:19.999 --> 08:26.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
though an aide, a senior
administration official
insisted that, no, he wasn't
actually toning

08:26.572 --> 08:27.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
things down.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was actually being tougher.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it certainly seemed
toned-down.

08:31.511 --> 08:38.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tam,
finally, it was -- in
that regard, it was also clear
to those who

08:38.551 --> 08:42.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were listening that he didn't
bring up human
rights in Saudi Arabia.

08:42.455 --> 08:46.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, he didn't
bring it up certainly
in a big way.

08:46.926 --> 08:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was one short sentence
that mentioned
the oppression of women and
Christians and

08:54.901 --> 08:55.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
others.

08:55.902 --> 08:58.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it wasn't a centerpiece of
the speech.

08:58.371 --> 09:02.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was barely a paragraph, sort
of a sentence.

09:02.975 --> 09:06.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were other phrases in
the speech
that made it clear that they're
not emphasizing

09:06.946 --> 09:12.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
human rights, saying that he
wasn't there
to lecture countries, and that
he was looking

09:12.218 --> 09:15.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for partners, not perfection.

09:15.221 --> 09:19.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many people took that as a
signal that
he was sending to the leaders in
the room

09:19.058 --> 09:24.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he wants to work with them
to counter
ISIS and he's willing, at least
on some level,

09:24.096 --> 09:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to not put human rights in their
face.

09:26.799 --> 09:34.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the administration says is
that he's
approaching this quietly and
strongly and

09:34.106 --> 09:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that by sort of easing into it,
he might able
to be -- have a bigger impact.

09:38.578 --> 09:43.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara Keith
reporting from
Israel, the second leg of
President Trump's

09:43.916 --> 09:44.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trip abroad.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Glad to be with
you.

09:46.752 --> 09:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will have
more on the
president's trip right after the
news summary.

09:51.657 --> 09:55.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
President Trump's
former national security
adviser, Michael

09:55.461 --> 10:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flynn, invoked his right against
self-incrimination,
and refused to give documents to
the Senate

10:00.800 --> 10:02.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Intelligence Committee.

10:02.368 --> 10:07.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It involves potential ties
between the Trump
campaign and Russian officials.

10:07.206 --> 10:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Flynn's lawyers cited a --
quote -- "escalating
public frenzy" and they said
that any testimony

10:14.280 --> 10:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he provides could be used
against him.

10:17.049 --> 10:22.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's reported that two other
former Trump
associates, Paul Manafort and
Roger Stone,

10:22.755 --> 10:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have turned over documents to
the committee.

10:25.124 --> 10:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Democrat Elijah
Cummings, on the
House Oversight Committee, says
that government

10:30.196 --> 10:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
documents suggest that Flynn
misled Pentagon
investigators about his income
from Russian

10:36.902 --> 10:38.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sources.

10:38.504 --> 10:43.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea says it's ready to
start mass-producing
new medium-range missiles.

10:43.275 --> 10:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State media today called it an
answer to the
Trump administration.

10:47.146 --> 10:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Sunday, the North test-fired
a missile
capable of reaching Japan and
major U.S. military

10:53.252 --> 10:54.987 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bases there.

10:55.021 --> 11:00.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Security Council
condemned the launch
as -- quote -- "highly
destabilizing."

11:00.493 --> 11:06.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran's newly reelected President
Hassan Rouhani
is calling for better relations
with the United

11:06.332 --> 11:07.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

11:07.733 --> 11:11.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he says first the Trump
administration
has to get its bearings.

11:11.137 --> 11:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spoke in Tehran, three days
after he easily
defeated a conservative
challenger backed

11:16.609 --> 11:18.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by hard-liners.

11:18.411 --> 11:22.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian
President (through
translator): Iran and America,
over the last

11:23.015 --> 11:27.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost 40 years, have traveled a
curvy road
together.

11:27.053 --> 11:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are waiting for the U.S.
government to
become stable intellectually.

11:30.256 --> 11:33.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope it can settle down so
that we can more
accurately pass judgments on
their leaders

11:33.592 --> 11:35.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Washington.

11:35.327 --> 11:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also today,
Iranian reports
said that reformist supporters
of Rouhani

11:39.165 --> 11:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
swept all the local offices in
Tehran and
did well in other cities as
well.

11:45.337 --> 11:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the U.S.
Supreme Court
has struck down two North
Carolina congressional

11:49.542 --> 11:52.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
districts over racial
gerrymandering.

11:52.378 --> 11:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ruling upheld a lower court
finding that
Republican state lawmakers
lumped black voters

11:58.317 --> 12:01.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into the districts to weaken
their clout elsewhere.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The districts have already been
redrawn.

12:04.824 --> 12:10.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state legislature in Texas
is nearing
approval of a transgender
bathroom bill similar

12:10.396 --> 12:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to North Carolina's measure that
sparked national
outrage.

12:14.100 --> 12:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Texas bill limits children
in public and
charter schools to bathrooms
that correspond

12:19.939 --> 12:22.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with their official gender at
birth.

12:22.408 --> 12:27.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In last night's debate,
Statehouse members
argued over whether the bill
amounts to discrimination.

12:27.046 --> 12:30.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS PADDIE (R), Texas State
Representative:
There is absolutely no intent,
and I would

12:30.249 --> 12:34.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
argue nothing in this language,
that discriminates
against anyone.

12:34.754 --> 12:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it makes sure that
there are reasonable
accommodations for all children.

12:39.258 --> 12:44.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SENFRONIA THOMPSON (D), Texas
State Representative:
Bathrooms, white, colored.

12:44.096 --> 12:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was living through that era of
not only
America, but Texas history as
well.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bathrooms divided us then, and
it divides
us now.

12:55.841 --> 13:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The bill cleared
the Statehouse
today and went to the Senate for
final approval.

13:01.580 --> 13:07.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the Texas legislature
also voted

groups refuse to place adopted

13:21.300 --> 13:23.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and staff dating back decades.

St. Paul's School in Concord
today released
results of an independent
investigation.

13:29.041 --> 13:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It comes amid reports of similar
scandals
at several other private
boarding schools

13:33.679 --> 13:36.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
across New England and the
Northeast.

13:36.682 --> 13:43.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In economic news, Ford Motor
Company replaced
Mark Fields as CEO after just
two years, amid

13:43.155 --> 13:45.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doubts about the automaker's
direction.

13:45.958 --> 13:51.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The new CEO is Jim Hackett, a
former office
furniture executive.

13:51.096 --> 13:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained 90 points to
close near 20895.

13:56.268 --> 14:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose almost 50, and
the S&amp;P 500
added 12.

14:02.875 --> 14:09.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after 150 years almost, the
Ringling Bros.
Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus held its
final show

14:09.415 --> 14:11.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last night.

14:11.217 --> 14:15.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Greatest Show on Earth faced
declining
attendance and high operating
costs, as well

14:15.521 --> 14:17.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as protests from animal rights
groups.

14:17.990 --> 14:24.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last show on Sunday, held
just outside
New York City, received a
standing ovation.

14:24.063 --> 14:30.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Performers hugged, as the
ringmaster sang
"Auld Lang Syne."

14:30.169 --> 14:35.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
President
Trump abroad attempting to reset
relations

14:35.207 --> 14:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Middle East; how Medicaid
cuts could
trickle down to students with
disabilities;

14:41.714 --> 14:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's Politics Monday, a look at
the storm
left at home while the president
is overseas;

14:46.752 --> 14:58.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

14:58.631 --> 15:03.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
During the presidential
campaign, candidate
Trump said he'd strengthen
relations with

15:03.402 --> 15:09.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Middle Eastern countries and do
a better job
fighting what he called radical
Islamic terrorism.

15:09.074 --> 15:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, with the president in Saudi
Arabia this
weekend and meeting with Arab
leaders, we

15:13.913 --> 15:18.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought we'd ask, what kind of
change in U.S.
policy is the president making?

15:18.617 --> 15:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For that, we turn to Daniel
Benjamin.

15:20.452 --> 15:25.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was ambassador at large and
coordinator
for counterterrorism at the U.S.
State Department

15:25.524 --> 15:27.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during the Obama administration.

15:27.526 --> 15:29.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's now at Dartmouth College.

15:29.862 --> 15:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elliott Abrams, he served in the
Reagan and
George W. Bush administrations.

15:33.999 --> 15:37.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now a senior fellow at the
Council on
Foreign Relations.

15:37.503 --> 15:42.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Robin Wright, she is a
fellow at the U.S.
Institute of Peace, as well as a
contributing

15:42.508 --> 15:45.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
writer for "The New Yorker"
magazine.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you
back to the
program.

15:47.212 --> 15:51.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have been talking about
-- a little
bit, Elliott Abrams, about the
president's

15:51.250 --> 15:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shifting language in how he
talks about terrorism,
extremism.

15:55.454 --> 16:00.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I want to ask the three
of you is,
how much of a shift in policy is
what Donald

16:00.826 --> 16:06.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- President Trump is saying in
his -- particularly
in that speech in Saudi Arabia?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much of a shift in policy
would that be?

16:08.834 --> 16:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLIOTT ABRAMS, Council on
Foreign Relations:
There is a shift, I would say,
from the Obama

16:11.570 --> 16:19.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy, which was much more open
to friendship
or a better relationship with
Iran and wasn't

16:19.144 --> 16:23.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
casting Iran as a central
problem in the Middle
East.

16:23.248 --> 16:28.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Saudi Arabia, the president
said very much
Iran is the problem.

16:28.253 --> 16:32.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The king of Saudi Arabia then
said the same
thing, Iran is the problem.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, of course, we're hearing it
from Prime
Minister Netanyahu.

16:35.861 --> 16:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This isn't a change, I would
say, from Bush
policy, actually, but it is a
change from

16:41.734 --> 16:45.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama policy, which was centered
on improving
the relationship with Iran.

16:45.604 --> 16:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Daniel Benjamin,
how do you
see what the president had to
say?

16:49.541 --> 16:52.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN, Former State
Department Coordinator
for Counterterrorism: Well, I
agree with Elliott

16:52.711 --> 16:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the tilt towards the Sunni
Arabs.

16:56.548 --> 17:02.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's gone all in, in terms of
standing with
them and with the Israelis
against Iran.

17:02.721 --> 17:05.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that brings with it some
challenges.

17:05.724 --> 17:14.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's also noteworthy
that he pushed
the Saudis and others to do more
against terrorism

17:14.133 --> 17:19.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves, but it was quite
interesting that
the way that he described
terrorism, it was

17:19.438 --> 17:21.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really kind of flat.

17:21.373 --> 17:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was in very good vs. evil
terms, but no
larger discussion of what the
drivers of terrorism

17:27.513 --> 17:33.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are, no discussion about bad
governance, about
economic stagnation, about any
repression.

17:33.919 --> 17:40.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as a result, it leaves the
impression
that this is going to be purely
about military

17:40.793 --> 17:45.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
law enforcement, and not
anything else, which
is really at odds with the
policy we had,

17:45.197 --> 17:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which was that you can't shoot
your way out
of this.

17:47.332 --> 17:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Robin Wright,
you're nodding
your head.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBIN WRIGHT, Senior Fellow,
U.S. Institute
of Peace: Absolutely.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this is -- this differs
in significant
ways.

17:52.604 --> 17:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, it walks away from
the kind
of nation-building of George
Bush or the democracy

17:56.909 --> 17:58.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
promotion of Barack Obama.

17:58.911 --> 18:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It takes a very one-dimensional
approach to
extremism, which is
militaristic, kill them

18:03.315 --> 18:05.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all, drive them back.

18:05.117 --> 18:10.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is -- doesn't factor in the
kind of economic
grievances, the political sense
among many

18:10.289 --> 18:13.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the region that their
governments don't
represent them.

18:13.158 --> 18:17.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump is basically
siding with the
autocratic regimes in the region
which have

18:17.563 --> 18:23.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been the most repressive, and
which have not
devoted much time or energy to
some of the

18:23.368 --> 18:26.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
broad solutions of the 21st
century.

18:26.038 --> 18:29.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so this is a huge departure
from the past.

18:29.074 --> 18:34.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that it opens up the
United States
to some vulnerability in the
same way.

18:34.746 --> 18:39.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're once again looking for
stability, rather
than the kinds of regimes that
reflect our

18:39.785 --> 18:41.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own values.

18:41.353 --> 18:45.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this an
approach, Elliott
Abrams, that is likely to work?

18:45.090 --> 18:50.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These regimes have had plenty of
opportunities
to come together against
terrorism, against

18:50.462 --> 18:52.364 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
extremism.

18:52.397 --> 18:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Is this new appeal from
President Trump likely
to bring results?

18:55.234 --> 19:00.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLIOTT ABRAMS: Well, there can
be better
cooperation, let's say, on
terrorist financing.

19:00.539 --> 19:03.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There can be better cooperation
on the military
and police side.

19:03.408 --> 19:05.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I think Robin is right.

19:05.477 --> 19:09.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If terrorists were coming down
from outer
space, then the military
approach would be

19:10.015 --> 19:11.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fine.

19:11.517 --> 19:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they're coming from the very
countries
whose leaders he was addressing.

19:14.052 --> 19:19.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he didn't discuss at all,
why is that
and what can be done about it in
your countries?

19:19.124 --> 19:24.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, given that,
Dan Benjamin,
are we -- are these countries
just basically

19:25.030 --> 19:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
left to ignore the president?

19:27.933 --> 19:33.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, has the expectation been
raised for
them to do something now or not?

19:33.172 --> 19:37.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: Well, he has
suggested that.

19:37.643 --> 19:43.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the reasons that the Gulf
Arabs are
so excited about Donald Trump is
that he has

19:43.148 --> 19:46.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
signaled that he's giving them a
complete
pass on human rights issues.

19:46.451 --> 19:48.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we could well see more
repression.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the long term, that doesn't
mean less
terrorism.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That may mean more terrorism.

19:53.725 --> 19:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's really just saying, you
know, do
what you need to and be there
for us when

19:58.830 --> 20:00.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we ask.

20:00.666 --> 20:05.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's also a problem because,
over the last
five or six years, they have
paid a lot more

20:05.971 --> 20:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attention to their sectarian
rivalry with
Iran than they have to Sunni
extremism.

20:10.509 --> 20:17.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking of
that, Robin,
that's come up in all of this
discussion.

20:17.416 --> 20:23.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does it make sense in the long
run for the
president to pit basically Sunni
against the

20:23.455 --> 20:24.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Iran regime?

20:24.456 --> 20:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBIN WRIGHT: This is the great
danger.

20:26.458 --> 20:31.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United States is often
faulted with fostering
this sectarian divide between
Sunnis and Shiites

20:31.830 --> 20:35.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by its intervention in Iraq in
2003.

20:35.367 --> 20:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now the administration is
taking a very
definitive stand on the side of
the Sunnis

20:41.873 --> 20:44.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against predominantly Shiite
Iran.

20:44.743 --> 20:48.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this, I think, is going to
deepen tensions,
rather than try to defuse them.

20:48.880 --> 20:53.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the great danger is that you
see not only
tensions within societies that
don't feel

20:53.819 --> 20:56.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they're represented, but a
deepening
regional conflict.

20:56.955 --> 21:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After all, the Saudi-Iran
rivalry plays out
in every major conflict in the
Middle East,

21:03.795 --> 21:06.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Syria, in Iraq, in Yemen.

21:06.298 --> 21:09.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're not going to find
solution to any
of these crises unless there's a
much more

21:10.002 --> 21:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
collaborative effort that brings
in all the
major powers in the region.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so that's one of the
challenges.

21:16.942 --> 21:22.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He talks a game about finding
peace and about
stabilizing the region, fighting
extremism,

21:22.981 --> 21:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but how do you do that when
you're actually
adding fuel to the flames?

21:27.452 --> 21:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about,
Elliott?

21:29.288 --> 21:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELLIOTT ABRAMS: Well, there, I
would say I
disagree, because I think the
problem, seen

21:32.391 --> 21:35.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Israeli point of view,
seen from
the Sunni Arab point of view,
seen from the

21:35.861 --> 21:42.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president's point of view, is a
remarkable
effort by Iran in Iraq, in
Syria, in Lebanon,

21:42.901 --> 21:46.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Yemen, in Bahrain, to create
trouble.

21:46.338 --> 21:51.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they are really a
problem for all
of those countries and for us.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a country that is still
saying death
to America.

21:53.545 --> 21:56.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the president's focus on
that is reasonable.

21:56.381 --> 21:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Daniel
Benjamin, pick
up on that.

21:59.117 --> 22:06.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is the meat on the bones
that needs to
come now for something to grow
out of this

22:06.058 --> 22:10.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that advances the cause, the
anti-extremist
cause?

22:10.162 --> 22:16.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BENJAMIN: Well, I'm
skeptical we're
going to get there, because one
of the things

22:16.268 --> 22:21.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that President Trump apparently
didn't do
while he was in Saudi Arabia was
talk to the

22:21.206 --> 22:27.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudis about the activities that
they carry
on that actually promote
extremism, specific

22:27.346 --> 22:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with their missionary activities
around the
world to provide mosques,
itinerant preachers,

22:32.150 --> 22:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
curricular materials and the
like, which have
really stoked the rise of a more
hard-edge

22:37.823 --> 22:39.491 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Islam.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think we're going to
see anything
from this administration on that
score.

22:42.561 --> 22:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing is, on the
sectarianism,
if it just gets worse, it's
going to undermine

22:48.834 --> 22:50.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regional stability.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it could threaten the
nuclear accord in
the region.

22:53.338 --> 22:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that ultimately would be bad
news for
everyone.

22:55.874 --> 23:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We even haven't
mentioned the
elections in Iran, Robin, but
Iran has just

23:01.179 --> 23:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reelected the more moderate
candidate, Mr.
Rouhani.

23:06.184 --> 23:09.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, the president
is painting
Iran as the enemy.

23:09.688 --> 23:14.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBIN WRIGHT: And he's painting
that picture
in a country that doesn't hold
democratic

23:14.326 --> 23:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
elections, where women can't
even drive, much
less participate or run for
office.

23:18.964 --> 23:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Iran has had a female vice
president.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The contrast is very stark.

23:23.769 --> 23:27.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no question that Iran is
a big problem
for many in the international
community, its

23:27.105 --> 23:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support of extremism, its
missile development
program, its abuse of civil
rights.

23:31.843 --> 23:33.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think anyone disputes
that.

23:33.578 --> 23:35.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But there is a deep contrast.

23:35.981 --> 23:41.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And remember that Saudi Arabia
is a country
that developed or promoted the
Wahhabi ideology

23:41.420 --> 23:50.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was the bed of the place
that gave us
the ideology of al-Qaida and
ISIS, and so

23:50.429 --> 23:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we need to kind of be
rational or reasonable
when we talk about who are the
good guys and

23:55.934 --> 23:56.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bad guys.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of them share the blame.

23:58.303 --> 24:00.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there's so
much here.

24:00.539 --> 24:03.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to continue to look
at what the
president had to say.

24:03.742 --> 24:07.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you, all three, Robin
Wright, Daniel
Benjamin, Elliott Abrams.

24:07.579 --> 24:08.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

24:08.580 --> 24:09.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBIN WRIGHT: Thank you.

24:09.881 --> 24:17.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELLIOTT ABRAMS: You're welcome.

24:17.189 --> 24:23.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's move to the
president's
domestic agenda now.

24:23.962 --> 24:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Later tonight, his
administration will release
his first full budget plan,
which lays out

24:28.834 --> 24:31.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his priorities for spending and
taxes.

24:31.870 --> 24:36.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress will have the final
say, but this
lays down an important marker
for the coming

24:36.708 --> 24:38.643 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

24:38.677 --> 24:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Early reporting suggests Mr.
Trump's proposal
will feature some big changes,
including substantial

24:42.981 --> 24:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spending cuts and a shift in
priorities overall.

24:46.384 --> 24:51.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins has been
reporting for us,
and she is here now to give us a
preview.

24:51.256 --> 24:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Lisa, what's different about
this budget
and what is different about the
way they're

24:54.426 --> 24:56.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
approaching it?

24:56.228 --> 24:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is a very
dramatic proposal
the president is making to
Congress.

24:58.830 --> 25:04.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would significantly increase
military spending
and significantly decrease most
spending in

25:04.202 --> 25:05.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other domestic agencies.

25:05.837 --> 25:10.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, as part of this, he is
trying to change
the way people look at
budgeting.

25:10.442 --> 25:13.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sources, congressional sources
are giving
me all this information.

25:13.078 --> 25:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say he's trying to say,
don't just look
who is the recipient of a
program.

25:17.616 --> 25:22.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look at those who are funding
it, taxpayers,
and ask, do taxpayers think this
is worth

25:22.120 --> 25:23.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

25:23.121 --> 25:24.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's a sign of cuts to come.

25:24.823 --> 25:28.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're hearing
big changes
to Medicaid, health care for the
poor.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do we know about that?

25:29.995 --> 25:32.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: These
congressional sources
say the president will propose
additional

25:32.864 --> 25:37.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cuts to Medicaid on top of what
is already
in the House Republican bill.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have talked about that
extensively.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of shifts in that
bill, but
essentially it would likely
mean, according

25:43.475 --> 25:47.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Congressional Budget
Office, millions
fewer Americans on Medicaid.

25:48.013 --> 25:51.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president plan would have
additional decreases
to that.

25:51.483 --> 25:55.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
Lisa, we're hearing
about several other changes to
the so-called

25:55.921 --> 25:57.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
social safety net.

25:57.322 --> 25:58.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

25:58.590 --> 26:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are you
hearing about
that and why?

26:00.191 --> 26:03.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A couple of big
programs
to watch, the Earned Income Tax
Credit.

26:03.161 --> 26:07.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, congressional sources say
the president
feels that there should be more
responsibility,

26:07.165 --> 26:12.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
accountability in these
programs, and he's
going to require that everyone
in that program

26:12.037 --> 26:13.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have a Social Security number.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who does that affect?

26:15.140 --> 26:16.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Undocumented immigrants.

26:16.441 --> 26:19.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It could also affect their
children, some
critics point out.

26:19.477 --> 26:23.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One other program, Judy, SNAP,
lots of times
referred to as food stamps.

26:23.348 --> 26:28.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president is going to
propose that states
share more in that cost.

26:28.353 --> 26:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That would be a big difference.

26:30.121 --> 26:33.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one key to all of this, it's
a dramatic
proposal, but Congress ends up
deciding all

26:33.692 --> 26:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of these funding debates.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when I talk to some
Republicans in Congress
on Friday, they were ready for
this dramatic

26:38.630 --> 26:39.831 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
proposal.

26:39.864 --> 26:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said a lot of these
cuts will not
pass there.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Lisa
Desjardins,
again, this comes out tonight.

26:45.637 --> 26:47.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will be able to talk much
more about it
tomorrow.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you so much.

26:49.374 --> 26:55.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as we just heard, Medicaid
cuts are a
key part of the president's
proposed budget.

26:55.213 --> 27:00.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump's budget assumes that
cuts already
in the House Republican health
care bill will

27:00.518 --> 27:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eventually become law and take
effect.

27:03.321 --> 27:05.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been looking at the
potential impact
of the bill.

27:06.024 --> 27:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, tonight, we focus on what
it could mean
for schools, and particularly
special education.

27:11.663 --> 27:13.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William Brangham has our
conversation.

27:13.632 --> 27:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Special
education just wasn't
part of the debate over the
House GOP's health

27:17.469 --> 27:19.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care bill.

27:19.270 --> 27:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But special education is hugely
reliant on
Medicaid , and that bill could
trigger major

27:23.174 --> 27:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cuts to Medicaid, up to $880
billion over
10 years.

27:27.579 --> 27:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what would this mean for the
millions
of public school kids who
receive special

27:31.449 --> 27:33.184 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ed services?

27:33.218 --> 27:37.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm joined now by Sasha
Pudelski, who is with
the School Superintendents
Association.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

27:38.657 --> 27:39.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA PUDELSKI, The School
Superintendents
Association: Thanks.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So happy to be here.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, I was
really surprised
by this.

27:41.993 --> 27:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't appreciate fully how
reliant special
ed service are on Medicaid.

27:46.097 --> 27:49.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you give us a sense of how
crucial they
are to those budgets?

27:49.567 --> 27:50.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SASHA PUDELSKI: Absolutely.

27:50.702 --> 27:53.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, special education funding
has always been
low.

27:53.938 --> 27:58.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have never met our federal
commitment to
school districts to fund special
education.

27:58.610 --> 28:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And about 30 years ago, the
federal government
decided that they would allow to
start to

28:03.148 --> 28:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bill Medicaid for some of the
therapies in
particular that are very costly
to provide

28:08.319 --> 28:10.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
special education students.

28:10.121 --> 28:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so school districts have
been reliant
on Medicaid to supplement some
of the special

28:13.692 --> 28:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
education funding they receive
for a very
long time.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's standard practice in many
districts.

28:18.063 --> 28:19.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, they spend
this money.

28:19.497 --> 28:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then they go to the
government say, hey,
we did this.

28:21.866 --> 28:22.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We provided these services.

28:22.867 --> 28:23.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Please reimburse us.

28:23.902 --> 28:25.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SASHA PUDELSKI: Exactly.

28:25.770 --> 28:28.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's not a one-for-one
match, by any means,
but it's a substantial amount
they receive

28:28.106 --> 28:29.874 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

28:29.908 --> 28:32.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Generally
speaking, who
are the kids that we're talking
about here,

28:32.043 --> 28:34.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and what kinds of services are
we talking
about?

28:34.112 --> 28:38.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA PUDELSKI: It's virtually
every special
education child, because the
things that Medicaid

28:38.550 --> 28:44.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can cover run from therapies
like mental health
therapy, speech therapy,
physical therapy,

28:44.355 --> 28:48.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to equipment that they may need,
hearing aids.

28:48.426 --> 28:54.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may run from wheelchairs to
school buses,
actually, that provide
specialized transportation

28:54.365 --> 28:55.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for kids.

28:55.633 --> 28:58.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the services are vast,
despite the levels
of funding.

28:58.036 --> 29:00.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, we don't
know right
now.

29:00.338 --> 29:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The House GOP bill has to go
through the Senate.

29:02.507 --> 29:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's obviously going to get
changed quite
a bit.

29:04.275 --> 29:08.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But let's assume that there are
still major
cuts to Medicaid in whatever
comes out of

29:08.613 --> 29:10.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Congress.

29:10.215 --> 29:12.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the main concern for the
school districts?

29:12.050 --> 29:16.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA PUDELSKI: The main concern
is, by this
major federal disinvestment in
Medicaid, we're

29:16.654 --> 29:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to have states having to
pick up the
tab.

29:20.358 --> 29:25.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if school districts are
competing with
hospitals and clinics and other
providers

29:25.830 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for scarce dollars, I don't see
how a governor
or state Medicaid director or
state legislature

29:30.935 --> 29:35.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to decide schools need
this money,
not a hospital, not a doctor.

29:35.640 --> 29:41.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
Republicans would argue,
we have federal deficits that
are going to

29:41.079 --> 29:45.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be massive in the future, and we
have to address
some of these programs like
Medicaid, and

29:45.717 --> 29:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that these are cuts that are
just fiscally
smart.

29:48.486 --> 29:50.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, how do you respond to
that?

29:50.421 --> 29:53.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA PUDELSKI: It's not kids
that are breaking
the Medicaid bank, if the bank
is even being

29:53.925 --> 29:55.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
broken, which I contend it's
not.

29:55.794 --> 30:02.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But when you look at who
benefits from Medicaid,
46 percent of Medicaid
beneficiaries are kids.

30:02.200 --> 30:06.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one out of every five
dollars spent on
Medicaid is spent on children.

30:06.538 --> 30:10.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's a really efficient way
of spending
dollars on children's health
care in this

30:10.875 --> 30:12.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

30:12.677 --> 30:15.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's say
these cuts do
come down, and school districts
have to find

30:15.513 --> 30:17.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some way to compensate.

30:17.115 --> 30:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is your sense, from talking
to school
administrators around the
country?

30:19.584 --> 30:20.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How are they going to make up
the shortfall?

30:20.919 --> 30:23.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SASHA PUDELSKI: So, the
situation is rather
bleak.

30:23.321 --> 30:29.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We surveyed 1,000 school leaders
earlier this
year to ask them exactly that
question.

30:29.160 --> 30:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they told us that they
believe services
for kids will be recused.

30:33.331 --> 30:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some cases, professionals
will be laid
off who work with those kids,
like the school

30:37.368 --> 30:41.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nurse, for example, whose salary
may be subsidized
substantially by Medicaid.

30:41.673 --> 30:46.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They indicated they may have to
raise taxes
in order to compensate for this
loss.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some districts can do that,
and others
just can't.

30:48.947 --> 30:52.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's going to be a major
financial hit,
not just on the special
education budget,

30:52.817 --> 30:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but on the general education
budget, because
the general education budget
will have to

30:57.021 --> 30:59.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
subsidize the loss of funding in
special education.

30:59.858 --> 31:03.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, what
you're talking
about is really cuts that are
really not just

31:03.862 --> 31:08.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for this one dedicated
population, but for
potentially every student in a
public school

31:08.233 --> 31:09.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
district.

31:09.234 --> 31:10.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SASHA PUDELSKI: Absolutely.

31:10.935 --> 31:12.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you go to a school nurse's
office, they
don't ask, are you
Medicaid-eligible?

31:12.670 --> 31:16.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They take your temperature and
find out whether
you need to go home.

31:16.674 --> 31:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is someone who benefits
every child,
just like a mental health
practitioner in

31:20.879 --> 31:22.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the school.

31:22.747 --> 31:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we no longer can afford
their services
because they're subsidized via
Medicaid, every

31:26.217 --> 31:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
child in that building will be
hurt.

31:28.753 --> 31:32.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Sasha Pudelski
of the School Superintendents
Association,

31:32.824 --> 31:35.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you so much.

31:35.260 --> 31:43.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SASHA PUDELSKI: Thank you.

31:43.835 --> 31:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

31:48.907 --> 31:54.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Tunisians revive
their capital's old city center
dating back

31:54.178 --> 32:01.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the seventh century; and a
retiree nearing
100 years old finds a sweet way
to make a

32:01.586 --> 32:03.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
difference.

32:03.454 --> 32:07.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, for more on the
president's overseas
trip and the troubles he's
facing back here

32:07.592 --> 32:09.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at home, it's time for Politics
Monday.

32:09.994 --> 32:16.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, I'm joined by Stu
Rothenberg, senior
editor at Inside Elections, and
Susan Page,

32:16.067 --> 32:18.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington bureau chief for USA
Today.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And welcome both of you back to
the program.

32:20.705 --> 32:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I was going to begin by
asking you about
the trip and how much that
overshadows what's

32:25.843 --> 32:30.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on here at home, but just
in the last
few moments, we have seen that
The Washington

32:30.515 --> 32:35.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Post is reporting, Susan, that
the president
-- this has literally just come
out moments

32:35.954 --> 32:43.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago -- asked intelligence
chiefs, two of them,
to push back against any story,
any allegation

32:43.127 --> 32:44.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of FBI collusion.

32:44.963 --> 32:50.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He asked both Dan Coats, who is
the director
of national intelligence, and
Admiral Michael

32:50.702 --> 32:53.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rogers, who is the director of
the National
Security Agency.

32:54.005 --> 32:57.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington Post story says
that both of
them refused to comply.

32:57.108 --> 32:59.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They both said it was
inappropriate.

32:59.644 --> 33:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are not commenting on this
story, but
The Washington Post is running
it as a headline.

33:03.781 --> 33:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
And this, of course, is entirely
consistent

33:06.150 --> 33:11.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we have heard the president
ask James
Comey to do as FBI director, to
try to help

33:11.456 --> 33:14.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him with this kind of P.R.
problems with this
Russia investigation.

33:14.826 --> 33:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's consistent with that and is
one more
example of how you can be on a
foreign trip,

33:18.863 --> 33:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can be giving big speeches,
but you cannot
escape the cloud that is over
your presidency

33:23.167 --> 33:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when it comes to this disclosure
after disclosure
on this Russia investigation.

33:27.672 --> 33:31.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is going to be the
case, I think,
for the foreseeable future for
this president.

33:31.075 --> 33:34.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean, we are
starting to
get the sense, Stu, that no
matter how much

33:34.278 --> 33:39.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we begin to talk about other
things, the budget,
which we did report on earlier
in the program

33:39.350 --> 33:43.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight, and of course the
president's trip,
that this Russia investigation
and how the

33:43.721 --> 33:47.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president and the White House
handled it is
just the story that keeps on
unfolding.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Inside
Elections: Right.

33:49.427 --> 33:52.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Republicans complain that
the national
media is spending too much time
on this subject

33:52.864 --> 33:58.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we should be talking about
other issues,
but this is the focus of
attention for a reason.

33:58.336 --> 34:03.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're talking about the
president of the United
States and his aides'
appropriate behavior,

34:03.541 --> 34:05.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inappropriate behavior, illegal
behavior.

34:05.176 --> 34:06.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We don't know.

34:06.611 --> 34:08.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this is a giant story.

34:08.479 --> 34:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And saying, well, there are
other issues,
yes, and we should cover them.

34:11.716 --> 34:13.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this is certainly the story,
the story
du jour.

34:13.584 --> 34:17.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean -- excuse
me -- even
on the trip, Susan, the
president today confirmed

34:17.688 --> 34:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he was with Prime Minister
Netanyahu
in Israel that he, in essence,
said, I didn't

34:23.694 --> 34:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say the word Israeli when I
talked about intelligence
that I shared with Russian
officials.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He in a way is keeping some of
this alive.

34:30.768 --> 34:34.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: This is one more
self-inflicted
wound on the part of President
Trump, because

34:34.605 --> 34:36.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he wasn't even asked this
question.

34:36.107 --> 34:41.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a question posed by an
American reporter
to Benjamin Netanyahu.

34:41.879 --> 34:46.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president, President
Trump, jumps
in to say, this is a bad story,
I never said

34:46.818 --> 34:48.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the word Israel.

34:48.486 --> 34:51.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, first of all, the stories
at the time
did not say he used the word
Israel.

34:51.122 --> 34:54.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just said that he disclosed
highly confidential
intelligence issues.

34:55.026 --> 34:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secondly, this confirms -- in
effect, confirms
that Israel was the source of
this intelligence,

35:00.031 --> 35:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something U.S. officials have
refused to do
on the record.

35:02.533 --> 35:08.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It does a third thing, puts a
spotlight right
back on the story on a day when
you had a

35:08.473 --> 35:11.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rather emotional and successful
visit to Israel.

35:11.809 --> 35:13.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now that's been really
overshadowed.

35:13.578 --> 35:17.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: You know,
these kind of
trips have been used by previous
presidents

35:17.081 --> 35:19.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to -- so that they go
internationally.

35:19.050 --> 35:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the area that the
president has most
authority in, foreign policy,
national security.

35:23.721 --> 35:28.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Presidents look presidential
when they're
meeting leaders of other
countries.

35:28.092 --> 35:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I noted that Richard Nixon took
a 10-day,
seven-country trip in June of
1974, and then

35:35.099 --> 35:37.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he came back to Washington, went
back on another
trip to...

35:37.802 --> 35:38.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is two
months before.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: ... to the
Soviet Union.

35:40.104 --> 35:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, the Judiciary Committee was
-- House
Judiciary was meeting.

35:43.207 --> 35:50.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when he came back was three
weeks later,
and he was impeached.

35:50.047 --> 35:52.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This president cannot get out of
his own way.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that too strong a thing to
say?

35:54.952 --> 35:58.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He continues to bring back the
focus on himself.

35:58.089 --> 36:01.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a trip is a good idea and
presidents need
to do that.

36:01.425 --> 36:05.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's not going to make
Americans forget
about the underlying problem he
has.

36:05.363 --> 36:11.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, do we know
yet how much
this is going to affect the
president's substantive

36:11.169 --> 36:12.603 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
agenda?

36:12.637 --> 36:15.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were talking earlier with
Lisa Desjardins
about the budget proposal.

36:15.606 --> 36:17.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to hear more about
that tonight.

36:17.375 --> 36:21.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We know the president,
Republicans on the
Hill very much want to pass a
health care

36:21.512 --> 36:22.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reform law.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How is all this affecting that?

36:25.049 --> 36:26.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: It does two things
that are damaging.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One, it distracts attention.

36:28.719 --> 36:31.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you're paying attention to
this, not to
the details of the health care
bill or what

36:31.622 --> 36:33.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might be included in a tax cut
package.

36:33.891 --> 36:37.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another thing is, it starts to
chip away at
the president's approval rating.

36:37.795 --> 36:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is important because
members of Congress
keep a close look at the
president's approval

36:42.733 --> 36:46.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rating to figure out how much
they should
fear him, how much attention do
they have

36:46.804 --> 36:49.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to pay to him, how much
political clout does
he have.

36:49.140 --> 36:52.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's approval rating
today in the
Gallup poll, which does a daily
rolling three-day

36:52.743 --> 36:59.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
average, was 37 percent, which
is a dismal
approval rating for a president.

36:59.083 --> 37:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's just a bit lower than
it's been.

37:01.085 --> 37:02.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was about 40.

37:02.086 --> 37:03.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It had been about 40 for a long
time.

37:03.955 --> 37:05.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's beginning to get just a
little bit lower.

37:05.756 --> 37:10.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, even among his core
supporters, many of
whom are sticking with him, he's
seeing some

37:10.094 --> 37:11.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attrition.

37:11.095 --> 37:12.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

37:12.930 --> 37:18.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stu, you have spent a lifetime
studying members
of Congress and how they think
about how to

37:18.302 --> 37:21.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote and what they are going to
do and their
reelection prospects.

37:21.806 --> 37:23.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the calculus for the
Republicans right
now?

37:23.941 --> 37:26.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: If you tell
me who is going
to win the Montana special
election later

37:26.811 --> 37:30.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this week, and then the Georgia
special election
next month, I will have a better
idea of what

37:30.514 --> 37:31.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the impact is.

37:31.515 --> 37:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think Susan is exactly
right.

37:33.484 --> 37:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, there are Republicans and
conservatives
in safe districts that are going
to stick

37:37.388 --> 37:41.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the president and are
sticking with him,
just as some Republicans stuck
to Richard

37:41.259 --> 37:43.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nixon right to the very end.

37:43.127 --> 37:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those Republicans in swing
districts,
those who worry about Republican
turnout,

37:47.298 --> 37:50.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic turnout in districts
or states
that can flip, they are nervous.

37:50.868 --> 37:52.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They will get more nervous.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is not really a
distraction.

37:54.872 --> 37:56.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's kind of defining this
presidency now.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is it going
to take, though?

37:59.777 --> 38:00.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is it a drip, drip, drip...

38:00.778 --> 38:01.912 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

38:01.946 --> 38:04.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: No, I think
it may simply
be time.

38:04.415 --> 38:06.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's funny.

38:06.150 --> 38:09.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People in the national media
talk -- look
at every poll as if one is going
to show a

38:09.120 --> 38:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dramatic turn in public opinion.

38:10.988 --> 38:13.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has only been in
office now
four months.

38:13.190 --> 38:14.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He hasn't been in long.

38:15.026 --> 38:18.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you give this another four
months, eight
months, and some of his
supporters may start

38:18.763 --> 38:20.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to take the criticism more
seriously.

38:20.831 --> 38:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, it's easy for them to
say, I voted
for him.

38:22.633 --> 38:23.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's trying.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the national media's fault.

38:25.403 --> 38:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, four months from now, or
six months from
now, I think things might be
different.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Stu is right,
Susan.

38:29.740 --> 38:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The loyal Trump supporters,
people from districts
where people -- and there was
another story.

38:34.045 --> 38:40.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I read another story just
yesterday about
this in Kentucky, several
communities in Kentucky,

38:40.484 --> 38:48.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where Donald Trump received high
poll numbers,
I mean, high vote totals, back
in November.

38:48.959 --> 38:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is still very popular.

38:50.728 --> 38:54.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And, of course, the
idea that
he's being embattled by the
national news

38:54.365 --> 38:57.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media or among Democrats, that
doesn't really
hurt President Trump.

38:57.768 --> 39:01.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what could hurt President
Trump is if
he doesn't deliver on the
promises he made

39:01.405 --> 39:03.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to these voters.

39:03.207 --> 39:06.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that would include bringing
back manufacturing
jobs, making their lives better,
bringing

39:06.610 --> 39:08.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
down the cost of health care.

39:08.446 --> 39:11.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are the things on which
President Trump
is going to be measured by his
supporters.

39:11.949 --> 39:16.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that he's got this
cloud of scandal
over him makes it harder for him
to deliver

39:16.153 --> 39:17.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to them on those issues.

39:17.621 --> 39:19.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Politics Monday.

39:19.824 --> 39:23.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Susan Page, Stu Rothenberg,
great to have
you both.

39:23.494 --> 39:28.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thanks.

39:28.933 --> 39:36.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Thanks, Judy.

39:36.207 --> 39:44.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to a
story about history
and culture in Tunisia, the
birthplace of

39:44.548 --> 39:46.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Arab spring.

39:46.250 --> 39:51.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Its democracy is new and
fragile, and its
economy has been hurt by
terrorist acts that

39:51.255 --> 39:53.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have scared away tourists.

39:53.157 --> 39:58.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But among the signs of hope, a
rise in citizen
efforts to take part in the
nation's political

39:58.829 --> 40:00.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and cultural life.

40:00.598 --> 40:01.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our story.

40:01.699 --> 40:05.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of his ongoing series
Culture at
Risk.

40:05.136 --> 40:12.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Medina of
Tunis, the old
center of the city, dating back
to the seventh

40:12.109 --> 40:19.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
century, its narrow walkways,
vibrant colors,
and grand architecture evoke a
rich past.

40:19.683 --> 40:25.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now nestled within a sprawling
modern city,
the Medina remains a home to
some 100,000

40:25.723 --> 40:33.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
residents, 15,000 homes, 700
monuments, and
abundant commerce within its
sprawling souks,

40:33.164 --> 40:34.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or markets.

40:34.899 --> 40:38.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For hundreds of years, places
like this were
the heart of life in the Arab
world.

40:38.669 --> 40:48.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question today is how to
preserve something
of that old character, even as
the society

40:48.913 --> 40:52.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
around them changes.

40:52.550 --> 40:57.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Architect Zoubeir Mouhli grew up
here in the
Medina, and now heads an
organization to preserve

40:57.455 --> 40:59.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZOUBEIR MOUHLI, Association for
the Preservation
of the Medina (through
translator): When I

41:01.125 --> 41:04.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a student, I dreamed of
working in the
Medina because I knew there were
so many hidden

41:04.361 --> 41:06.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things people didn't know about
that are incredibly
valuable.

41:06.831 --> 41:12.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For him, this
place represents
a way of life, an alternative to
the modern

41:12.169 --> 41:13.437 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
city.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ZOUBEIR MOUHLI (through
translator): There
is no soul there.

41:15.639 --> 41:19.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everything is done for the cars,
not for the
people, not for the pedestrians,
not for the

41:19.710 --> 41:23.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who want to see each
other, to talk
to each other, to go and have a
coffee together.

41:23.781 --> 41:25.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All this is so important to me.

41:25.549 --> 41:30.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dramatic change
came to the
Medina starting in the 1950s, as
the era of

41:30.354 --> 41:32.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
French rule ended.

41:32.189 --> 41:36.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Many laborers from the
countryside moved in
seeking work, while elites and
those with

41:36.861 --> 41:41.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
means left for the new suburbs,
which continue
to develop today.

41:41.398 --> 41:44.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Medina was ignored, and
slowly decayed.

41:44.401 --> 41:49.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ZOUBEIR MOUHLI (through
translator): The Medina
was considered an archaic space
that was contrary

41:49.840 --> 41:54.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the country's modernization,
and even the
cause of our underdevelopment
and the reason

41:54.378 --> 41:56.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the French protectorate.

41:56.113 --> 42:01.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: By the time the
Medina was
added to a U.N. list of places
of special

42:01.151 --> 42:08.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cultural importance in 1979,
more than half
its buildings were in disrepair
or ruins.

42:08.225 --> 42:11.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But changes in the country are
also changing
the Medina.

42:11.562 --> 42:18.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In late 2010, a Tunisian fruit
vendor set
himself ablaze, setting off a
chain of protests

42:18.536 --> 42:23.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that overturned the country's
dictator, Abidine
Ben Ali, and spread across the
region as the

42:23.641 --> 42:25.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Arab Spring.

42:25.876 --> 42:30.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tunisia has been the only
country thus far
to successfully transition out
of protests

42:30.614 --> 42:32.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into a democracy.

42:32.950 --> 42:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among much else, that unleashed
new civic
pride and an interest in
preserving the country's

42:38.255 --> 42:42.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
culture, one influenced by
Roman, Ottoman,
Arabic and European traditions.

42:42.826 --> 42:45.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEILA BEN GACEM, Tunisia: This
house was on
sale in 2006.

42:45.696 --> 42:48.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I bought it from a family that
lived here
for 300 years.

42:49.033 --> 42:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Three hundred?

42:50.034 --> 42:51.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEILA BEN GACEM: Yes.

42:51.902 --> 42:55.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Leila Ben
Gacem, that meant
rehabilitating an old home to
turn it into

42:55.773 --> 43:02.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a boutique hotel, a project that
required
working with local artisans,
tile specialists,

43:02.413 --> 43:07.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woodworkers, gypsum carvers, who
understood
the materials and artistic
styles.

43:07.418 --> 43:11.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEILA BEN GACEM: These stones
could be recycled
from the destroyed site of
Carthage.

43:11.655 --> 43:15.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean the
ancient archaeological
site of Carthage, yes, not far
from us.

43:15.559 --> 43:16.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEILA BEN GACEM: Yes.

43:16.560 --> 43:19.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The tiles could have came with
the Andalusians.

43:20.030 --> 43:21.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, in Spain.

43:21.865 --> 43:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEILA BEN GACEM: In Spain.

43:22.866 --> 43:25.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The arches could have came from
the Ottomans.

43:25.135 --> 43:28.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it's the blend that makes
Tunisia today.

43:28.138 --> 43:30.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It was difficult
work.

43:30.174 --> 43:34.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The house had to be entirely
retrofitted with
modern plumbing and electricity.

43:34.979 --> 43:36.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Not a good place for a car.

43:36.447 --> 43:40.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEILA BEN GACEM: No, that's why
taxi drivers
hate to drive in here.

43:40.150 --> 43:45.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And the area
faces all kinds
of challenges, including
maintaining enough

43:45.155 --> 43:49.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
infrastructure to hold onto old
businesses
and attract new investment.

43:49.693 --> 43:55.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEILA BEN GACEM: Since the birth
of the Medina
in the seventh century, eighth
century, there

43:55.299 --> 43:59.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always been an ecosystem of
traders, of artisans,
of businesses.

43:59.703 --> 44:03.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So the trading sectors change
with time.

44:03.207 --> 44:09.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think to convert the
Medina into a cultural
artistic destination, that needs
a whole new

44:09.446 --> 44:11.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ecosystem to be developed now.

44:11.682 --> 44:14.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ben Gacem's doing
her part.

44:14.685 --> 44:19.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's already working on a
second guest house
and has opened a workspace
nearby to help

44:19.590 --> 44:24.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
transfer some of the skills
being lost.

44:24.361 --> 44:30.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Saturday mornings, there's a
calligraphy
class and next door a workshop
on bookbinding,

44:30.167 --> 44:34.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taught by Mohamed Ben Sassi,
whose shop is
just down the street.

44:34.705 --> 44:39.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's thought to be the last
bookbinder working
in the Medina, and is eager to
reach a new

44:39.677 --> 44:41.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
generation.

44:41.311 --> 44:43.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMED BEN SASSI, Tunisia
(through translator):
There is nobody, no one left.

44:43.681 --> 44:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For 40 years, I worked in the
national library,
and there was nobody to do this
job, 40 years.

44:50.187 --> 44:51.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The book will never go away.

44:51.522 --> 44:54.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has witnessed many gales and
thunderbolts
and disasters.

44:54.792 --> 44:56.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is still here.

44:56.593 --> 45:01.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Up the street is
a beautiful,
but dilapidated building called
La Rachidia,

45:01.932 --> 45:06.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opened in the 1930s and once one
of the most
famous concert venues in North
Africa.

45:06.937 --> 45:12.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, volunteers are digitizing
sheet music,
historical documents, concert
posters and

45:12.743 --> 45:24.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
photographs found sitting in
boxes, saving
traditional Tunisian music known
as malouf.

45:24.788 --> 45:29.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there's a project
called MedinaPedia
in the belly of an old Christian
church, where

45:29.927 --> 45:35.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another group of volunteers is
documenting
every building and monument in
the area, researching

45:35.632 --> 45:42.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
famous residents, and uploading
that information
to Wikipedia, a variety of
projects, committed

45:42.506 --> 45:44.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people, young and old.

45:44.775 --> 45:49.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone we spoke to said it
will be important
to move forward in a way that
maintains the

45:49.213 --> 45:54.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
character and the inhabitants of
the Medina,
even while trying to attract
tourists to a

45:54.218 --> 45:59.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country in desperate need of the
economic
boost they bring.

45:59.156 --> 46:04.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite the many challenges the
government
here faces, Leila Ben Gacem says
cultural

46:04.061 --> 46:06.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heritage should continue to be
one of its
priorities.

46:06.864 --> 46:11.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEILA BEN GACEM: The government
underestimates
the potential of heritage and
culture in creating

46:12.002 --> 46:17.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opportunities, and maybe they
even think of
it as something for elite or
something as

46:17.074 --> 46:18.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a luxury.

46:18.909 --> 46:24.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the meantime, civil society
is very active
today in investing, investing
time, money,

46:24.882 --> 46:31.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energy, advocacy to restore such
beautiful
spaces and bring back the magic
to the Medina.

46:31.155 --> 46:35.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A magic found in
every tile
and stone.

46:35.225 --> 46:44.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown
in the Medina of Tunis.

46:45.002 --> 46:52.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to something
sweet.

46:52.643 --> 46:56.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More often than not, a dessert
is better when
you share it.

46:56.280 --> 47:00.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the thinking of one man
who uses baking
to reach out to his community.

47:00.317 --> 47:05.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From PBS station NET in
Nebraska, Dennis Kellogg
explains.

47:05.689 --> 47:10.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: If you're
looking for a good
dessert in Hastings, you can
find plenty of

47:10.794 --> 47:13.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
places to get a sweet treat.

47:13.096 --> 47:18.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some of the city's tastiest
pies and cakes
come from the kitchen of this
small home,

47:18.669 --> 47:21.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where Leo Kellner has lived for
more than
six decades.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: ®MDNM /Thank you, Leo.

47:23.607 --> 47:25.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: ®MDNM /Thank you, Leo.

47:25.242 --> 47:27.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Red velvet is my
favorite.

47:27.978 --> 47:34.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: The doorbell
seems to be always
ringing here, as friends stop by
to pick up

47:34.651 --> 47:37.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one of Leo's culinary creations.

47:37.054 --> 47:39.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Thank you so much for
making this cake.

47:39.289 --> 47:41.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Thank you again.

47:41.158 --> 47:48.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: Leo spends his
days in the
kitchen, gladly baking hundreds
of pies and

47:48.432 --> 47:50.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cakes every year.

47:50.167 --> 47:55.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEO KELLNER, Baker: My crust is
flaky, and
tastes like -- more or less like
a cookie.

47:55.439 --> 47:58.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: And Leo Kellner
is 98-years-old.

47:58.675 --> 48:04.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEO KELLNER: I have got to have
something
to do.

48:04.181 --> 48:07.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I would be dead if I wouldn't be
doing this.

48:07.451 --> 48:12.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I lay at night in bed and think
how I can
change things, make things
better.

48:12.522 --> 48:18.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have changed my pie three
times, the apple
pie.

48:18.528 --> 48:24.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: Leo grew up
during tough times
in the 1930s, watching his mom
and sister

48:24.735 --> 48:27.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bake with whatever ingredients
they happened
to have.

48:27.638 --> 48:32.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spent a lifetime working with
irrigation
and grain-drying businesses.

48:32.843 --> 48:35.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't retire until he was
92.

48:35.779 --> 48:40.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's when Madelon, his wife of
72 years,
got sick and passed away.

48:40.984 --> 48:45.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEO KELLNER: I started about
four months or
so after my wife died.

48:45.522 --> 48:49.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was sitting here not knowing
what to do
with myself.

48:49.526 --> 48:52.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was used to working.

48:52.863 --> 48:58.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had given up what I was
doing, was kind
of sitting here in the house and
I said to

48:58.635 --> 49:00.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
myself, I can bake.

49:00.671 --> 49:06.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: He made 144
apple pies that
first year, and hasn't stopped
since.

49:06.810 --> 49:12.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You might think it provides a
great retirement
income for Leo, but the thing
is, he doesn't

49:12.282 --> 49:14.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
charge a cent.

49:14.117 --> 49:19.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He gives every one of his pies
and cakes away
for free to friends, those who
are sick, or

49:19.523 --> 49:26.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to hospice volunteers, to those
attending
a funeral, to an elderly woman
or a man who

49:26.763 --> 49:28.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just can't afford a good meal.

49:28.532 --> 49:33.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEO KELLNER: You don't know what
that means
to a person, unless you have
been poor, like

49:33.971 --> 49:38.308 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was years ago.

49:38.342 --> 49:41.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would have been so tickled.

49:41.411 --> 49:46.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my folks couldn't even give
me a pie or
a cake or something.

49:46.850 --> 49:51.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So I lived that life.

49:51.154 --> 49:59.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why I am happy when I
can help
somebody put a smile on their
face.

49:59.463 --> 50:05.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MADDY MUSICH, 12 Years Old: Hey,
Leo.

50:05.102 --> 50:09.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: Leo is even
building a pie-making
legacy.

50:09.673 --> 50:15.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's mentoring 12-year-old Maddy
Musich, teaching
her how to bake, because, as Leo
puts it,

50:15.512 --> 50:19.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
girls today need to know more
than just how
to run a computer.

50:19.750 --> 50:25.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MADDY MUSICH: He's like my other
grandpa,
kind of.

50:25.856 --> 50:29.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I get older, I want to bake
for my kids
and teach them how to do it.

50:29.393 --> 50:32.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even if they don't like it,
who doesn't
love food anyway?

50:32.462 --> 50:38.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEO KELLNER: I consider her just
more than
a friend, like part of me.

50:38.101 --> 50:42.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I go, I want her to take
over where I
left off.

50:42.773 --> 50:46.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I think she will.

50:46.143 --> 50:52.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: He can share his
recipes with
Maddy, but she will soon learn
Leo adds something

50:52.349 --> 50:56.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to his pies and cakes that you
can't buy in
a grocery store.

50:56.653 --> 50:58.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEO KELLNER: I make it with
love.

50:58.955 --> 51:03.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't just make it just to be
making it.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I make it with love.

51:05.128 --> 51:08.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's my secret ingredient.

51:09.032 --> 51:15.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS KELLOGG: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm
Dennis Kellogg in Hastings,
Nebraska.

51:15.205 --> 51:19.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And if I could
get to Nebraska
right now, I would be knocking
on Leo's door.

51:19.910 --> 51:23.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
our "NewsHour"
Shares of the day, something
that caught our

51:23.780 --> 51:26.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eye that we thought may be of
interest to
you too.

51:26.750 --> 51:31.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, it caught my eye
while I was
at Muhlenberg College in
Allentown, Pennsylvania,

51:31.888 --> 51:34.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yesterday to give a commencement
address.

51:34.157 --> 51:37.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I had the chance to hear
Mahsheed Mahjor.

51:37.327 --> 51:40.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a citizen of Afghanistan
and one of
the graduates.

51:40.263 --> 51:45.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chosen by her classmates to give
the student
address, Mahsheed spoke of
hardships and inequities

51:45.902 --> 51:50.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the world, and role of
citizenship
and the value of her education.

51:50.540 --> 51:52.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here's some of what she said.

51:52.409 --> 51:55.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHSHEED MAHJOR, Muhlenberg
College Graduate:
I will never take it for
granted, for it has

51:55.545 --> 52:01.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changed my life and transformed
my life in
ways that I couldn't have
imagined.

52:01.585 --> 52:08.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among others, education taught
me that how
interconnected and how
interdependent our

52:08.325 --> 52:15.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world is and how beautiful and
meaningful
these relationships could be.

52:15.632 --> 52:22.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And education motivated me to
stand for what
is right, for human liberation,
for human

52:22.239 --> 52:23.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dignity.

52:23.240 --> 52:27.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I hope it has done the same
for you.

52:27.310 --> 52:35.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The heartbreaking news from
inside the United
States and around the globe is
evidence to

52:35.152 --> 52:40.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that the world is a
bloody, awful
place for many, in case you
haven't realized

52:40.357 --> 52:43.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that yet.

52:43.093 --> 52:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is so because of the unequal
distribution
of wealth and power.

52:50.333 --> 52:58.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is so because the racism and
sexism are
often put before human dignity.

52:58.508 --> 53:04.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is so because the life to
some appear to
be worth more than others.

53:04.481 --> 53:12.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We must remember that our
crucial task is,
is what we will do for others,
for those who

53:12.055 --> 53:16.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do not have privileges that we
do.

53:16.893 --> 53:22.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We should continue to be global
citizens,
being concerned for what doesn't
necessarily

53:22.499 --> 53:29.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
impact us, but it does impact a
fellow human
being near and far from us.

53:29.739 --> 53:36.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We ought to think and work
towards a common
goal, towards human liberation,
towards something

53:36.279 --> 53:43.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bigger than ourselves, towards a
world that
would reduce and dismantle
institutionalized

53:43.753 --> 53:49.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
classism, racism and sexism and
foster social
justice and equity.

53:49.559 --> 53:51.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

53:51.962 --> 53:58.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some words of
wisdom from Mahsheed
Mahjor, graduate of Muhlenberg
College.

53:58.368 --> 54:00.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a young woman going
places.

54:00.971 --> 54:02.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:02.272 --> 54:03.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:03.773 --> 54:13.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.

54:13.883 --> 54:24.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
