JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.739 --> 00:06.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.575 --> 00:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
With no Democrat support, we
couldn't quite

00:10.077 --> 00:11.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get there.

00:11.078 --> 00:13.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're just a very small number
of votes short.

00:13.347 --> 00:18.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a defeat for
Republicans,
President Trump and House
Speaker Paul Ryan

00:18.952 --> 00:24.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pull the GOP's health care bill,
lacking the
votes needed to replace the
Affordable Care

00:24.658 --> 00:26.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Act.

00:26.159 --> 00:27.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:27.694 --> 00:32.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to
analyze a packed week of news.

00:32.332 --> 00:37.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, Jeffrey Brown talks with
the director
of the sequel to the dark
comedy/drama hit

00:37.971 --> 00:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Trainspotting" about bringing
characters
back to life after 20 years.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANNY BOYLE, Director, "T2:
Trainspotting":
One of the joys of doing the
film was the

00:44.878 --> 00:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learning process of seeing how
poorly men
age and how wise women are,
whereas we -- it's

00:51.585 --> 00:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not even like we think we're
living in the
past.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just are, and we're not
admitting it to
ourselves for so long.

00:56.823 --> 01:04.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.298 --> 01:07.034 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:07.067 --> 01:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
effort to replace
Obamacare, the health care law,
lies in ruins

01:17.878 --> 01:19.646 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the 11th hour today, House
GOP leaders
gave up trying to hold a vote on
their bill.

01:24.184 --> 01:26.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins has been at
the Capitol
all day.

01:26.820 --> 01:27.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She begins our coverage.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.089 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:29.122 --> 01:30.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: I
will not sugarcoat this.

01:30.557 --> 01:32.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a disappointing day for
us.

01:32.292 --> 01:36.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: After a
dramatic week of
will they or won't they,
Republicans' selected

01:36.763 --> 01:42.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won't, pulling their sweeping
health care
bill shortly before a scheduled
vote, when

01:42.102 --> 01:44.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it clearly was short of the
support it needed.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.473 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:46.506 --> 01:49.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Moving from an
opposition party
to a governing party comes with
growing pains.

01:49.543 --> 01:53.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, well, we're feeling those
growing pains
today.

01:53.547 --> 01:58.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We came really close today, but
we came up
short.

01:58.151 --> 02:01.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Doing big things is hard.

02:01.088 --> 02:05.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of us, all of us, myself
included, we
will need time to reflect on how
we got to

02:05.726 --> 02:07.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this moment.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The House
speaker then acknowledged
the resulting reality.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.063 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL RYAN: Obamacare is the law
of the land.

02:11.398 --> 02:14.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to remain the law of
the land until
it's replaced.

02:14.034 --> 02:17.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did not have quite the votes
to replace
this law.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, yes, we're going to be
living with
Obamacare for the foreseeable
future.

02:20.507 --> 02:23.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Thank you very much.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were very close, very, very
tight margins.

02:25.412 --> 02:29.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President Trump
pointed to
a lack of Democratic votes and
said he's open

02:29.850 --> 02:31.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to discussing another bill.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for now, health care will
stay as it
is.

02:33.920 --> 02:39.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I have been saying
for the last
year-and-a-half that the best
thing we can

02:39.893 --> 02:45.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do, politically speaking, is let
Obamacare
explode, and it is exploding
right now.

02:45.432 --> 02:52.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This after a
wild 24 hours
of promises and pressure, with
Vice President

02:52.906 --> 02:57.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Pence meeting with the
conservative Freedom
Caucus today, and the White
House standing

02:57.377 --> 03:03.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by an ultimatum President Trump
issued last
night, that, if the bill failed,
he wouldn't

03:03.583 --> 03:05.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
return to the issue.

03:05.285 --> 03:06.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Press Secretary Sean Spicer
today:

03:06.953 --> 03:08.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
I know that the president's made
it clear

03:08.822 --> 03:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is the effort, this
was the train
that's leaving the station, and
that he expects

03:12.626 --> 03:14.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyone -- that this is our
opportunity.

03:14.928 --> 03:19.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republicans
also dangled
some carrots, adding new changes
last night

03:19.433 --> 03:21.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to win votes.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For moderates, they revived a
Medicare tax
on the wealthy, using the
proceeds to help

03:25.305 --> 03:31.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states increase health coverage,
and for conservatives,
a repeal of the Affordable Care
Act's guarantee

03:31.645 --> 03:37.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of basic, essential benefits,
things like
E.R. visits, prescriptions and
preventative

03:37.417 --> 03:38.552 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Removing the essential benefits
did sway some
members.

03:41.688 --> 03:42.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Joe Barton of Texas:

03:42.823 --> 03:44.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:44.624 --> 03:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE BARTON (R), Texas: That is a
big win for
conservative values, so I am now
a yes vote.

03:50.764 --> 03:54.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Others refused
to budge,
including Barton's fellow Texan
Louie Gohmert.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.369 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOUIE GOHMERT (R), Texas: The
president shouldn't
give any more energy.

03:57.270 --> 03:58.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This was up to us.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It wasn't up to him.

03:59.906 --> 04:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm grateful that he spent
as much effort
trying as hard as he did.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: More no's came
from the ranks
of moderates.

04:07.447 --> 04:12.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The chair of House
appropriations, New Jersey's
Rodney Frelinghuysen, cited cuts
to Medicaid

04:12.786 --> 04:14.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
funding.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the White House, President
Trump said this
morning he has no regrets.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Did you rush it, do
you think?

04:20.093 --> 04:22.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We will see what
happens.

04:22.062 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mr. Trump also
said he had
full faith in Speaker Ryan
moving forward.

04:26.266 --> 04:31.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, by early afternoon, Ryan
was at the White
House, delivering the grim news
on the bill's

04:31.638 --> 04:32.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
prospects.

04:32.873 --> 04:35.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats, meanwhile, pointed to
the Republicans'
disunity.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
I think their mistake really was
they were

04:39.312 --> 04:45.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so focused on embarrassing the
Affordable
Care Act, rather than trying to
improve it.

04:45.552 --> 04:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Three months
into their control
of government, Republicans have
a central

04:49.823 --> 04:54.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political and policy platform to
rebuild.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is a seismic moment.

04:56.630 --> 05:02.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaker Ryan says, nonetheless,
he's moving
to the next big mountain to
climb, tax reform,

05:02.068 --> 05:05.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even though accomplishing tax
reform will
now be harder, Judy, because
they don't have

05:05.872 --> 05:08.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the savings that he was hoping
for from health
care reform.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, a lot
of finger-pointing
going on.

05:12.612 --> 05:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is your reading from
talking to all the
people you have talked to about
why they couldn't

05:17.484 --> 05:19.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get this done?

05:19.286 --> 05:20.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, I want to
try and set
aside all the blame game --
there is a lot

05:21.021 --> 05:22.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of that -- and focus on three
things.

05:22.789 --> 05:26.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One, I just talked to Chairman
Greg Walden,
who was one of the co-authors of
this bill.

05:26.526 --> 05:31.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He said he felt that the
goalposts kept moving
from conservatives and
moderates, that they

05:31.364 --> 05:33.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would give them one thing, and
then they would
ask for more.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's one factor.

05:35.902 --> 05:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another, Republicans have a very
large conference,
but with that also comes large
differences

05:40.140 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in policy, and they couldn't
bridge those.

05:42.042 --> 05:44.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The third, Judy, the timeline, I
think, was
a very big factor.

05:44.978 --> 05:49.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republicans shot for the
moon here trying
to pass a massive bill in just
three weeks.

05:49.649 --> 05:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That didn't leave any breathing
room for very
serious concerns.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why I think we saw
this bill fail.

05:54.988 --> 05:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, what
are Republicans
saying about what they think the
implications

05:59.159 --> 06:00.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are for their party, for them?

06:00.927 --> 06:04.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They're worried
about 2018.

06:04.297 --> 06:09.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats would need a sweep to
retake the
House, but for the first time, I
had two different

06:09.336 --> 06:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican members tell me today
they're worried
that that sweep is possible.

06:12.906 --> 06:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not just about their
individual elections,
Judy, but this takes the kind of
air out,

06:17.811 --> 06:21.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
all the energy out from
conservative causes
across the board.

06:21.748 --> 06:27.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been campaigning on
this up and
down, nonprofits, politicians,
for seven years,

06:27.087 --> 06:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they're just not sure where
the energy
now is going to come from for
all of these

06:30.924 --> 06:34.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups that have been pushing
for conservative
causes for years.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
what about
Speaker Ryan himself?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How is he affected by this?

06:38.431 --> 06:41.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I actually
think Speaker
Ryan is doing OK.

06:41.701 --> 06:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our Julie Percha, producer up
here, spoke
to several members of the
Freedom Caucus who

06:45.739 --> 06:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had nothing but good things to
say about Speaker
Ryan.

06:48.208 --> 06:52.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, in his benefit, Judy, it
doesn't look
like anyone else wants his job
right now.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hmm.

06:53.880 --> 06:54.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's interesting.

06:54.881 --> 06:55.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins at the Capitol,
we thank you.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now a view from the White
House today.

07:01.421 --> 07:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reporter Robert Costa of The
Washington Post
interviewed the president as the
bill was

07:05.925 --> 07:08.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being pulled from consideration.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Robert joins me now in the
studio.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Robert, the president called
your cell phone.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What did he say?

07:13.667 --> 07:14.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA, The Washington
Post: Yes.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
He did.

07:15.669 --> 07:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was sitting over here in
Arlington.

07:16.670 --> 07:17.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a blocked number.

07:17.671 --> 07:18.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he got right to the point.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, "Bob, I'm pulling the
bill."

07:20.874 --> 07:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he had just met with House
Speaker Ryan.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said the votes weren't
there.

07:25.111 --> 07:29.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My whip count had about three
dozen Republicans
who were probably not going to
back the measure,

07:29.916 --> 07:32.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he said it was closer, about
five to 12
votes away.

07:32.352 --> 07:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said he's ready to move
on.

07:33.853 --> 07:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's going to not hold the bill
for a few
days.

07:36.323 --> 07:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's going to wait, in his
words, to let it
explode.

07:38.858 --> 07:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He said in his
remarks to the
group of reporters, the
so-called pool there

07:44.764 --> 07:49.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Oval Office, he said that
it's going
to be -- the next move is up to
the Democrats.

07:49.669 --> 07:54.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that your sense of what
they're looking
for, or are they just shoving it
to the side

07:54.574 --> 07:55.775 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: He seems to be
open to a bipartisan
deal.

07:57.577 --> 07:59.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will see if that actually
emerges.

07:59.379 --> 08:04.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I said, you're kind of a
non-ideological
president, even though you're a
Republican.

08:04.384 --> 08:07.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe you're more natural down
the road doing
something with the Democrats.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, a lot of people may say
that, and
he said it with a chuckle.

08:10.390 --> 08:13.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But whether the Democrats would
be willing
to work with the president, we
will have to

08:13.526 --> 08:14.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see.

08:14.527 --> 08:15.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought it was striking,
though.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was pretty even-tempered.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he finished the
conversation.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I said, you have been in the
presidency for
60 days.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Have you learned anything?

08:21.434 --> 08:22.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the lesson here?

08:22.769 --> 08:24.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, "Just another day in
paradise."

08:24.604 --> 08:32.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Robert, he
didn't give
any sense of regret or a sense
that something

08:32.045 --> 08:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he did or his party did had gone
wrong?

08:34.748 --> 08:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Not a bit of
regret.

08:37.684 --> 08:41.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Defiance was the tone,
even-tempered, but
defiant.

08:41.554 --> 08:47.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, if the premiums rise,
in his words,
by 100 percent or 70 percent or
200 percent,

08:47.160 --> 08:48.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just publish the story at The
Post.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said he's going to blame the
Democrats.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was very partisan, very
political.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I also said, did you blame the
speaker?

08:54.901 --> 08:57.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're the newcomer to
Washington, Mr. President.

08:57.370 --> 09:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you blame the House speaker
at all, as
some of your allies are behind
the scenes?

09:01.241 --> 09:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he said three times, "I
don't blame Paul."

09:03.810 --> 09:06.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So revealing,
Robert Costa.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you're going to be hosting
"Washington
Week" a little later tonight on
PBS.

09:08.982 --> 09:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Eight o'clock.

09:09.983 --> 09:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will be
watching.

09:10.984 --> 09:11.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Thank you.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

09:13.820 --> 09:17.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the day's other news: The
State Department
issued a permit to build the
long-delayed

09:17.457 --> 09:18.625 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Keystone X.L.

09:18.658 --> 09:20.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pipeline.

09:20.493 --> 09:25.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The $8 billion project would
allow oil to
be piped from Canada to the
Texas Gulf Coast.

09:25.865 --> 09:30.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama had rejected the
project mainly
for environmental reasons, but
in the Oval

09:30.437 --> 09:35.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Office today, President Trump
said reversing
that decision puts the country's
economic

09:35.508 --> 09:37.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
security first.

09:37.343 --> 09:39.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
It's a great day for American
jobs, and a

09:39.345 --> 09:44.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
historic moment for North
America and energy
independence.

09:44.050 --> 09:48.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This announcement is part of a
new era of
American energy policy that will
lower costs

09:48.288 --> 09:54.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for American families, and very
significantly,
reduce our dependence on foreign
oil, and

09:54.894 --> 09:56.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
create thousands of jobs.

09:56.229 --> 09:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The oil industry
hailed the
decision.

09:59.866 --> 10:02.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Environmental groups vowed to
keep fighting
the pipeline.

10:02.402 --> 10:08.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A federal judge in Virginia
ruled in favor
today of the president's revised
travel ban.

10:08.241 --> 10:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge rejected arguments by
Muslim plaintiffs
who said the ban was
discriminatory.

10:14.280 --> 10:19.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that directly contradicts
federal courts
in Maryland and Hawaii that have
blocked the

10:19.419 --> 10:21.154 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

10:21.187 --> 10:25.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The split increases the
likelihood that the
issue will end up before the
U.S. Supreme

10:25.558 --> 10:27.327 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Court.

10:27.360 --> 10:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In London, police have made two
more arrests
in Wednesday's terror attack
that killed four

10:31.598 --> 10:33.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people near Parliament.

10:33.433 --> 10:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have taken 10 people into
custody since
52-year-old Khalid Masood drove
an SUV into

10:40.139 --> 10:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pedestrians, before being killed
himself.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security was tight again today
around the
site of the attack.

10:46.713 --> 10:52.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Jewish, Christian and
Muslim faith
leaders gathered outside
Westminster Abbey

10:52.585 --> 10:54.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for a minute of silence.

10:54.888 --> 10:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There may be a new migrant
disaster in the
Mediterranean.

10:58.391 --> 11:04.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Spanish aid group reports that
hundreds
are feared dead in three
possible sinkings

11:04.097 --> 11:05.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
off Libya.

11:05.565 --> 11:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rescue workers were out today
hunting for
survivors.

11:08.902 --> 11:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The search began after they came
across bodies
in the water.

11:12.472 --> 11:19.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Yesterday at 6:30 in the
morning, we
found the first body, and four
more of young

11:19.045 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African migrants from ages
between 16 and
25.

11:22.815 --> 11:27.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then we found also the wrecks of
two boats.

11:27.620 --> 11:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We guess there might be around
200 people
missing.

11:31.558 --> 11:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So far this year,
almost 600
people have died trying to cross
the Mediterranean

11:37.230 --> 11:38.231 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Europe.

11:38.264 --> 11:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 5,000 perished in
2016.

11:41.634 --> 11:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was the deadliest year
ever.

11:44.170 --> 11:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Salvage crews in South Korea
today finished
raising a sunken ferry
responsible for the

11:49.909 --> 11:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deaths of more than 300 people
in 2014.

11:53.313 --> 11:58.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, two barges began towing
the ferry to
a transport vessel that will
take it to a

11:58.718 --> 12:00.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
port for inspection.

12:00.219 --> 12:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of the victims of the
sinking were high
school students on a trip.

12:05.592 --> 12:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ousted Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has
been released after six years in
custody.

12:11.698 --> 12:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mubarak, now 88, had been tried
on charges
of ordering the killing of
protesters during

12:17.804 --> 12:21.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Arab Spring revolt in 2011.

12:21.107 --> 12:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier this month, Egypt's top
appeals court
cleared him.

12:24.611 --> 12:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The former leader held power for
30 years
before being overthrown.

12:29.716 --> 12:34.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the House
Intelligence
Committee's probe of Russian
contacts with

12:34.120 --> 12:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump campaign advisers erupted
into fresh
acrimony today.

12:39.058 --> 12:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Chair Devin Nunes
called off a
public hearing next Tuesday with
former intelligence

12:44.497 --> 12:46.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agency leaders.

12:46.399 --> 12:51.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, he said the panel needs
to hear again
from leaders of the FBI and
National Security

12:51.070 --> 12:52.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Agency in a closed session.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:54.674 --> 12:56.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES (R), California:
Until we can
get them in a closed session,
it's not going

12:56.743 --> 12:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be worth it having the open
session.

12:59.145 --> 13:03.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So all members have a chance to
interview
them and hold a hearing in the
closed session.

13:03.783 --> 13:08.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then the
Intelligence Committee's
ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff,
quickly challenged

13:08.988 --> 13:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the decision and disputed the
chairman's explanation.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.626 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:
There must have
been a very strong pushback from
the White

13:15.395 --> 13:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House about the nature of
Monday's hearing.

13:18.164 --> 13:22.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard for me to come to any
other conclusion
about why an agreed-upon hearing
would be

13:22.135 --> 13:23.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suddenly canceled.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, it had to do with
events of this
week.

13:25.638 --> 13:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier this
week, Nunes drew
heat for informing the president
that some

13:30.309 --> 13:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump transition communications
were intercepted,
without first telling committee
Democrats.

13:36.416 --> 13:41.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Nunes also announced that
former Trump
campaign chairman Paul Manafort
will appear

13:41.688 --> 13:43.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voluntarily before the
committee.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will get back to all of this
a little later
in the program.

13:46.526 --> 13:52.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's being reported that
President Trump will
continue to get financial

13:54.100 --> 13:57.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Forbes" magazine quotes the
president's son
Eric as saying that he will
likely provide

13:57.870 --> 13:59.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
quarterly updates.

13:59.939 --> 14:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before taking office, the
president announced
that he would separate himself
from his companies

14:04.944 --> 14:07.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to avoid any conflicts of
interest.

14:07.413 --> 14:13.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A North Carolina man who fired
an assault-style
rifle inside a Washington
pizzeria pleaded

14:14.020 --> 14:16.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
guilty today to weapons charges.

14:16.289 --> 14:21.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Edgar Welch told police that he
drove from
North Carolina last December to
investigate

14:21.627 --> 14:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a bogus online conspiracy
theory.

14:24.664 --> 14:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It claimed that the pizza shop,
named Comet
Ping Pong, was home to a child
sex ring involving

14:31.037 --> 14:33.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Wall Street closed out its
worst week
since the election.

14:36.242 --> 14:41.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly
60 points today to close at
20596.

14:41.981 --> 14:47.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 11 points, while
The S&amp;P 500
slipped about two.

14:47.120 --> 14:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
were down
1 percent to 1.5 percent.

14:52.825 --> 14:57.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's next
in the health care debate; how
investigating

14:57.697 --> 15:03.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
connections between the Trump
campaign and
Russia has split the House
Intelligence Committee;

15:03.669 --> 15:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
take on this
busy week of news; and much
more.

15:13.713 --> 15:18.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
take on this
busy week of news; and much
more.

15:18.918 --> 15:24.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the aftermath of today's
failure by Republicans
to move ahead with repealing and
replacing

15:24.724 --> 15:26.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act.

15:26.659 --> 15:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talk with prominent figures
in both political
parties about what it means and
what is next.

15:31.831 --> 15:38.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke a short while ago with
eight-term
Democratic Representative Tim
Ryan of Ohio.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congressman Ryan, welcome.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you make of all this?

15:41.541 --> 15:43.309 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:43.342 --> 15:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM RYAN (D), Ohio: Well, it's
been a very
interesting day, Judy, you know,
a lot going

15:45.711 --> 15:47.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on here on the Hill.

15:47.480 --> 15:51.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, clearly, the Republicans
didn't have
the cohesiveness, the plan that
was going

15:51.651 --> 15:53.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to move this piece of
legislation forward.

15:53.953 --> 15:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the plan really, in
so many ways,
was disastrous.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was knocking 24 million
people off of their
health care.

16:01.694 --> 16:06.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That became something that a lot
of members
weren't willing to go home and
defend.

16:07.033 --> 16:11.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The repealing out of the stance
abuse coverage,
the mental health coverage, for
people who

16:11.938 --> 16:16.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to go back to districts and
states that
are seeing one of the greatest
heroin and

16:16.042 --> 16:20.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drug epidemics in the history of
our country
happen right before their very
eyes, that

16:20.112 --> 16:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
becomes very tough to vote for
when it hits
the ground back in places like
Ohio or other

16:24.450 --> 16:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states that are having these
huge substance
abuse epidemics happening.

16:27.720 --> 16:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Speaker
Ryan is saying
-- he just said to the press a
few minutes

16:32.658 --> 16:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago that the real disaster is
Obamacare, the
current Affordable Care Act,
that he says

16:41.400 --> 16:45.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's something that's collapsing
of its on
weight, premiums are going up.

16:45.938 --> 16:51.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said a third of the counties
in the country
have only one plan to choose
from.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:53.112 --> 16:57.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM RYAN: Well, there are some
issues with
the Affordable Care Act.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We made great strides.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We covered 20 million people.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are bending the cost curve in
the long
term.

17:03.589 --> 17:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people have the kind of
coverage that
I just talked about, mental
health, substance

17:06.893 --> 17:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abuse, preventative care,
prenatal care, all
the things that save you money
in the long

17:11.797 --> 17:12.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
run.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is in the Affordable Care
Act.

17:14.800 --> 17:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, let's sit down and try to
fix the things
that we need to fix.

17:19.205 --> 17:23.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of the problem is, the
Republicans gutted
payments to the insurance
companies that would

17:23.876 --> 17:27.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have allowed them to participate
in some of
these riskier areas.

17:27.079 --> 17:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We needed to get coverage in
these areas,
but you needed to help the
insurance companies,

17:31.083 --> 17:32.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so they wouldn't lose money.

17:32.852 --> 17:37.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican Party gutted that
part of the
budget, those insurance transfer
payments.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's when the insurance
companies started
to leave.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they're saying it's not
working in
certain areas.

17:41.928 --> 17:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, because they cut the
funding to some
of those areas.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's sit down, Judy, and fix
the problems.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are problems there.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not ashamed to admit it.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We passed a great piece of
legislation that
had some flaws.

17:54.974 --> 17:58.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's sit down and fix them,
Democrats and
Republicans, and make this thing
work.

17:58.611 --> 18:02.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, is your
party prepared
to do that, and do you think the
Republicans

18:02.248 --> 18:03.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are prepared to do that?

18:03.349 --> 18:05.051 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM RYAN: Well, I don't speak on
behalf of
my entire party, but I know I'm
willing to

18:07.119 --> 18:10.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sit down and say, look, we have
made some
great strides.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are some issues.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's sit down and fix them.

18:14.193 --> 18:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have raised my hand to say,
I'm all in to
try to make sure that health
care is more

18:17.496 --> 18:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affordable for more people, that
it's more
accessible.

18:19.832 --> 18:24.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We should have universal
coverage and that
should be affordable for
everybody.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the thing, Judy.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope Republicans would be
willing to
sit down and do it.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been complaining about
Obamacare
for seven years.

18:30.309 --> 18:33.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They get into power, and their
first legislative
initiative, they can't even pass
something

18:33.879 --> 18:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is an attempt to fix it,
but that was
because it was making it worse,
I think, was

18:37.950 --> 18:39.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
why it didn't pass.

18:39.185 --> 18:40.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But here's the thing.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.754 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're the United States of
America.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're the wealthiest country in
the world.

18:44.090 --> 18:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And yet we're 37th in health
care delivery.

18:47.093 --> 18:51.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We spend 2.5 times what other
developed countries
spend on health care.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Clearly, we're not doing
everything right.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to move more of that
money into prevention.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to make sure that our
citizens are
healthier.

18:58.504 --> 19:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We got to have a big national
conversation
about our food system.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is how we're going to solve
the problem
in the long run.

19:04.577 --> 19:08.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when
President Trump says
this was due to -- that this is
really the

19:08.414 --> 19:10.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats' fault, what's your
answer?

19:10.916 --> 19:11.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:11.917 --> 19:13.452 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM RYAN: Well, we're not even
in the majority
in the House of Representatives.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, how could it possibly be
our fault?

19:18.024 --> 19:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has complete control of the
House of Representatives.

19:21.527 --> 19:22.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're all Republicans.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he couldn't even get the
Republicans to
pass it.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's typical Donald Trump.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to find somebody to
blame, and
so he's going to blame the
Democrats.

19:31.337 --> 19:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I assume he's going to blame
President Obama
and maybe even Hillary Clinton
for this problem.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They need to take
responsibility.

19:38.544 --> 19:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They need to put a plan forward
that their
members can vote on and that
actually solve

19:42.681 --> 19:44.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
problems.

19:44.550 --> 19:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem right now with the
Republican
Party, Judy, is they're living
by bumper sticker

19:47.420 --> 19:48.387 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
slogans.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But now they're not in the
minority.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're in the majority now.

19:51.357 --> 19:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dog has actually caught the
car, and they
got to figure out how to govern
the country.

19:55.361 --> 19:59.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Representative
Tim Ryan, we
thank you for talking with us.

19:59.165 --> 20:00.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIM RYAN: Thanks for having me.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next, for an
opposing perspective,
I am joined by Lanhee Chen.

20:04.170 --> 20:09.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is a fellow at the Hoover
Institution who
advised Mitt Romney and Marco
Rubio in their

20:09.241 --> 20:10.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential campaigns.

20:10.576 --> 20:13.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lanhee Chen, welcome back to the
program.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's your reaction to what
happened today?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN, Former Policy
Director, Mitt
Romney Campaign: Well, thank
you, Judy.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think this is clearly a
self-inflected wound
for Republicans.

20:19.418 --> 20:24.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had the opportunity to move
ahead on
really the only train out of
town, if you

20:24.523 --> 20:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will, to repeal the Affordable
Care Act and
replace it with some other
reforms.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they didn't do so.

20:30.162 --> 20:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think it is real
disappointment for
those who have been seeking to
do this for

20:33.966 --> 20:35.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some time.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will have to see what
happens next,
but it appears as though health
care is off

20:37.870 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the table for some period of
time.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to ask
you about
that, but what about the
president?

20:42.241 --> 20:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's comment is that
this is all
due to the Democrats, not
Republicans.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: Well, Democrats
certainly weren't
helpful.

20:50.349 --> 20:53.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They didn't participate in the
process, obviously.

20:53.519 --> 20:57.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, from the Republican
perspective, there
were a lot of people here that
appeared to

20:57.490 --> 20:59.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say they wanted a perfect piece
of legislation.

20:59.925 --> 21:04.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it seems to me that they
allowed the perfect
to be the enemy of the good in
this case,

21:04.396 --> 21:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there were a lot of things
about this
legislation that would have
moved the ball

21:08.067 --> 21:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward, for example, on reform
of Medicaid,
which is a huge entitlement
program.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they had actually voted for
the bill, they
would have been moving forward
that effort.

21:15.608 --> 21:19.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, it seems to me, there
are some Republicans
that stood in the way.

21:19.145 --> 21:22.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as I said, I really see
this as a self-inflicted
wound more than anything else.

21:22.348 --> 21:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what do you
think should
happen next?

21:24.517 --> 21:28.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the president is saying
-- we heard
this from what he told to --
told Robert Costa

21:28.621 --> 21:29.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with The Washington Post.

21:29.655 --> 21:33.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, I'm moving on to tax
reform.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: It's going to be a
challenge.

21:35.861 --> 21:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Speaker Ryan said today, not
being able
to get this done, I think, does
make tax reform

21:40.499 --> 21:42.234 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
harder.

21:42.268 --> 21:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it is probably wise to
move on to
a different subject for some
period of time.

21:45.437 --> 21:49.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is clear that there are
divisions within
the Republican Party, Judy,
about how to handle

21:49.508 --> 21:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care and health care
reform going forward.

21:51.877 --> 21:59.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think this notion that
Obamacare is going
to collapse in one, large giant
flame is probably

21:59.151 --> 22:00.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
simply inaccurate.

22:00.986 --> 22:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's the case that, in
many markets,
you are going to see significant
issues, but

22:04.290 --> 22:06.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Medicaid expansion will
continue.

22:06.392 --> 22:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Obamacare will, by and
large, continue
as well.

22:08.694 --> 22:12.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think we need to take a
step back, take
stock of what's going to happen,
and hopefully

22:12.998 --> 22:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
return to this issue at some
point in the
future.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's
interesting you
should say that, because I'm
looking at what

22:17.369 --> 22:20.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president said when he
talked to the press
a short time ago.

22:20.372 --> 22:21.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said what you just said.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He predicted that it will
collapse.

22:24.877 --> 22:29.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, at that point,
Democrats are
going to come crawling back, in
so many words,

22:29.215 --> 22:31.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looking for a way to work with
Republicans.

22:31.517 --> 22:35.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're saying that your view
of this whole
thing is different.

22:35.454 --> 22:37.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LANHEE CHEN: Yes.

22:37.289 --> 22:40.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think, more than
anything, Judy,
I would call this kind of a
slow-motion train

22:40.326 --> 22:46.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wreck more than a significant
sort of single
implosion or single situation
where the bill

22:46.098 --> 22:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
completely -- where Obamacare
completely goes
down in flames.

22:49.335 --> 22:52.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's the case there are
some markets
where there's significant
difficulty.

22:52.471 --> 22:56.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be additional markets
where there
will be even more difficulty as
we get toward

22:56.542 --> 22:59.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the end of 2017 into 2018.

22:59.578 --> 23:03.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But something like the Medicaid
expansion,
that will continue, and that
will continue

23:03.249 --> 23:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to place pressure on the federal
budget, as
well as on state budgets.

23:06.185 --> 23:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if you're
saying it's not
a good idea for Republicans to
come back to

23:11.857 --> 23:14.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this issue right now, what
happens to it?

23:14.793 --> 23:16.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do you see this going?

23:16.562 --> 23:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: Well, I do think,
as I said,
in certain markets, you are
going to see,

23:19.765 --> 23:22.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly on the individual
market side
and Obamacare exchanges, you are
going to

23:22.801 --> 23:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see continuing declines if
insurer participation.

23:25.904 --> 23:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think premiums continue to
go up in some
markets.

23:29.174 --> 23:33.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there will need to
be efforts
made to look at how to repair
the individual

23:33.379 --> 23:36.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
market and to shore up that part
of this.

23:36.215 --> 23:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if we want to go toward
larger system
change, toward entitlement
reform, et cetera,

23:40.586 --> 23:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's going to have to be a
completely different
discussion.

23:42.521 --> 23:46.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is going to be something
that Republicans
have to get on the same page on
first before

23:46.759 --> 23:48.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that ball gets moved forward.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how long does
it take until
you see Republicans getting
there?

23:51.830 --> 23:56.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANHEE CHEN: Well, I thought --
I had hoped
they would have been able to get
there hopefully

23:56.201 --> 23:58.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the last few weeks, but
that obviously
didn't happen.

23:58.737 --> 24:02.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's something where
they're going
to have to revisit this issue
after dealing

24:02.541 --> 24:07.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more seriously with whether it's
tax reform
or infrastructure spending or
some other issue

24:07.446 --> 24:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be able to demonstrate that
they can govern
and then hopefully come back to
this issue

24:11.617 --> 24:12.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as time goes on.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lanhee Chen, we
thank you very
much.

24:15.487 --> 24:18.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LANHEE CHEN: Thank you.

24:18.857 --> 24:32.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The drama on
Capitol Hill today
wasn't just on the health care
front.

24:32.504 --> 24:37.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we reported earlier, the
House Intelligence
Committee descended into further
division

24:37.376 --> 24:39.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over its Russia investigation.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that.

24:41.513 --> 24:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There were new
and more
serious fractures today on the
Intelligence

24:45.818 --> 24:47.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

24:47.553 --> 24:51.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's investigating Russian
meddling in last
year's election, and alleged
ties between

24:51.156 --> 24:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Trump campaign and Moscow.

24:53.325 --> 24:57.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now the very direction of the
probe itself
seems in question.

24:57.262 --> 25:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here for some more on this is
one of the committee's
Democratic members,
Representative Eric Swalwell

25:00.799 --> 25:02.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of California.

25:02.601 --> 25:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman, you have said
before that you
feel that Chairman Devin Nunes
has a conflict

25:06.438 --> 25:07.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of interests.

25:07.606 --> 25:08.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think he's taking orders
from the White
House?

25:08.474 --> 25:10.142 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

25:10.175 --> 25:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL (D), California: I
think he
betrayed the duty to conduct an
independent,

25:13.245 --> 25:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
collaborative investigation.

25:15.047 --> 25:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were attacked by Russia this
past election,
and our constituents are
counting on us to

25:18.884 --> 25:20.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get to the bottom of what
happened.

25:20.853 --> 25:26.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going off on his own, and
receiving classified
information, not sharing it with
members of

25:26.592 --> 25:30.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the committee, taking it to the
White House,
where the president's campaign
is currently

25:30.362 --> 25:33.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
under criminal and
counterintelligence
investigations.

25:33.232 --> 25:37.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we need to do is,
he needs to
find an on-ramp, because this
investigation

25:37.603 --> 25:39.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
must continue to go forward.

25:39.571 --> 25:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he must work with Democrats.

25:41.440 --> 25:45.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otherwise, our constituents are
going to ask,
how can you conduct a credible
investigation

25:45.377 --> 25:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the largest attack that our
elections
have ever seen?

25:49.281 --> 25:53.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
information at the center
of this particular controversy,
he said that

25:53.051 --> 25:57.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he has information of apparent
unmasking of
identified of U.S. persons tied
to the Trump

25:57.756 --> 26:00.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign collected under legal
surveillance.

26:00.325 --> 26:03.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Have you now seen in the last
couple of days
seen any of this information?

26:03.695 --> 26:05.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:05.631 --> 26:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL: He should unmask
this evidence
for his colleagues on the
Intelligence Committee.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is what is so
disturbing.

26:09.701 --> 26:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told us yesterday, after he
apologized
for how this happened, that we
would see this

26:13.772 --> 26:15.140 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evidence today.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We haven't seen it.

26:16.175 --> 26:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one knows who or what he is
talking about.

26:19.077 --> 26:24.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, it has seriously
compromised the
independence of an investigation
that people

26:24.216 --> 26:26.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are counting on us to conduct.

26:26.051 --> 26:29.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, just in
the past 24
hours or so, the Democratic head
of the Congress,

26:29.321 --> 26:34.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adam Schiff, has said that there
is also -- quote
-- "more than circumstantial
evidence of collusion"

26:34.092 --> 26:35.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between Trump campaign and
Russia.

26:36.028 --> 26:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Have you seen any of that?

26:37.029 --> 26:38.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL: No, so, that's
reserved for
members of the Gang of Eight,
who include

26:41.233 --> 26:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the chairman of the committee
and the ranking
member.

26:43.669 --> 26:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do credit our ranking
member, who is
pushing for all members of the
committee to

26:48.407 --> 26:50.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have access to this information.

26:50.309 --> 26:54.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would also tell you, Hari,
that there
is enough information out there
in the unclassified

26:54.513 --> 27:01.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world that shows serious ties,
personal, political
and financial, that converge
with Russia as

27:01.186 --> 27:03.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they were conducting this
interference campaign.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In your
opinion, what can
salvage this investigation?

27:06.158 --> 27:07.926 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL: Well, it's really
-- the speaker
is the one who is in charge of
who chairs

27:10.963 --> 27:11.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Intelligence Committee.

27:12.030 --> 27:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it looks like he was party
to this stunt.

27:14.633 --> 27:18.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He authorized Devin Nunes to
receive the information
and take it to the White House.

27:18.770 --> 27:23.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we are going to continue
to go forward,
as Democrats, and listen to
witnesses and

27:23.475 --> 27:24.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
review evidence.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we need an independent
commission now
more than ever.

27:26.612 --> 27:29.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's not only the most
comprehensive way
to get to the bottom of what
happened.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now it's an insurance policy
against this
compromised investigation.

27:32.918 --> 27:36.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We heard the
chairman's
comments this morning.

27:36.655 --> 27:42.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you know why he made next
week's session
closed with FBI Director Comey
and NSA Director

27:42.127 --> 27:43.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mike Rogers?

27:43.095 --> 27:44.696 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

27:44.730 --> 27:46.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL: To further
obstruct us from
getting to the bottom of the
truth.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's what is so
frustrating here, is,
we had an open hearing.

27:49.568 --> 27:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The American people for the
first time since
this attack heard evidence about
Russia's

27:54.172 --> 27:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conduct and the Trump team ties,
had that
evidence validated by the FBI
director, who

27:59.778 --> 28:02.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
confirmed an investigation is
under way.

28:02.080 --> 28:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were looking forward to
a hearing
this coming Tuesday from other
witnesses who

28:05.784 --> 28:07.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had information.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to cancel it, I think, only
obstructs
our pursuit for the truth.

28:09.788 --> 28:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But isn't the
bulk of the
committee's work done behind
closed doors?

28:13.191 --> 28:15.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

28:15.127 --> 28:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL: Only if we have
to pass classified
information to a witness or we
have to receive

28:18.263 --> 28:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
classified information from a
witness.

28:21.333 --> 28:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in this case, we had
already received
opening statement testimony in
an unclassified

28:26.872 --> 28:28.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
form from the witnesses.

28:28.674 --> 28:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so now this is on hold.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And people at home are
wondering, what are
you going to do to make sure
we're never in

28:33.946 --> 28:35.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this mess again?

28:35.681 --> 28:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There were
reports this
afternoon that advisers close to
President

28:37.849 --> 28:43.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, Roger Stone and Paul
Manafort and Carter
Page, they are interested in
having a public

28:43.522 --> 28:45.324 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hearing.

28:45.357 --> 28:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They feel essentially that
they're under the
microscope here and they want an
opportunity

28:47.893 --> 28:49.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to address the committee.

28:49.328 --> 28:50.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that an option?

28:50.796 --> 28:51.763 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

28:51.797 --> 28:53.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC SWALWELL: Yes.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are very interested in having
them testify
only in public.

28:55.767 --> 29:01.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the only way we
really earn and
reclaim the independence of this
committee

29:01.473 --> 29:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to bring those witnesses
forward in public
and ask them about serious
questions around

29:07.346 --> 29:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they were doing, why they
were going
to Russia as this interference
campaign was

29:11.550 --> 29:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going on, and, for Mr. Manafort,
why such
extensive financial ties to
Russia and pro-Russia

29:17.923 --> 29:19.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
individuals.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We had two
almost separate
press conferences today by the
heads of this

29:22.394 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
committee.

29:23.929 --> 29:27.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What puts this back on track
towards any sort
of bipartisan kind of effort?

29:27.466 --> 29:29.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SWALWELL: Well, first, the
chairman needs
to fulfill the promise he made
to the committee

29:31.637 --> 29:36.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members yesterday, including
members on his
own side, that he will show us
evidence that

29:36.208 --> 29:39.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he received and took over to the
White House.

29:39.144 --> 29:40.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the first step.

29:40.912 --> 29:46.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unless that occurs, I don't
see how we
get back to having the real
credibility that

29:46.585 --> 29:48.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the American people are counting
on us to
have.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Representative
Eric Swalwell, thank you.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.289 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

29:50.322 --> 29:53.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ERIC SWALWELL: Yes.

29:53.592 --> 29:59.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My pleasure, Hari.

29:59.598 --> 30:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:04.336 --> 30:09.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
movie director
Danny Boyle discusses his sequel
20 years

30:09.541 --> 30:16.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
later to the hit '90s film
"Trainspotting";
and one man's take on whether
corporate sponsorships

30:16.882 --> 30:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compromise the causes they claim
to benefit.

30:21.219 --> 30:23.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first to the analysis of
Shields and Brooks.

30:23.488 --> 30:27.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is syndicated columnist
Mark Shields,
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

30:27.592 --> 30:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, I'm sorry there is no
news to talk
about today, but let's see what
we can find.

30:32.731 --> 30:39.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark, seriously, the move today
in the Congress
and by the president to pull
this health care

30:39.237 --> 30:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bill, what is there to say?

30:42.774 --> 30:47.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republicans wanted -- they
said for months
that this is what was going to
happen.

30:47.913 --> 30:52.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The first thing,
Judy, is, I
think, a general statement.

30:52.951 --> 30:56.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Republican Party is an
opposition party.

30:56.121 --> 30:57.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a protest party.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a protest president.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have a protest party.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a governing party.

31:02.160 --> 31:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It showed itself unable to
accept the responsibility
and the accountability of
governing.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This bill wasn't a bad bill.

31:09.267 --> 31:11.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This bill was just an
abomination.

31:11.069 --> 31:13.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was no public case that
could be made
for the bill.

31:14.005 --> 31:17.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was no public argument
that could be
made for the bill, because
nobody knew what

31:17.409 --> 31:19.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was in it.

31:19.244 --> 31:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was no public campaign for
the bill,
because no organizations --
every organization

31:23.782 --> 31:27.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that cares -- that was involved
in medical
care, whether it was the
American Medical

31:27.285 --> 31:32.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Association, the American
Psychiatric Association,
the American Academy of
Pediatrics, they were

31:32.124 --> 31:34.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all against the bill.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a terrible bill.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was nothing organized.

31:37.129 --> 31:40.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only organizing principle
is, it was against
Barack Obama.

31:40.499 --> 31:47.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Paul Ryan, a very earnest
policy wonk,
showed himself to be an inept
political leader.

31:47.806 --> 31:53.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He couldn't even lean on the
safest seats
in his own party's caucus.

31:53.645 --> 31:58.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are ones you say, these
are people who
are really not threatened for
reelection.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.384 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I need you.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to vote.

32:00.418 --> 32:02.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He couldn't even do that.

32:02.220 --> 32:07.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump showed he has
no understanding
of the legislative process.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He dealt in adjectives.

32:09.194 --> 32:11.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was wonderful, fantastic,
glorious.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He had no idea what was in it.

32:13.932 --> 32:19.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The art of the deal just
collapsed, and this
is a man who gave away the store
to the Freedom

32:19.070 --> 32:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Caucus, and got nothing in
return, didn't
even get their votes.

32:22.440 --> 32:28.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, on no count was this
anything but
a disaster politically, and
public policy,

32:28.146 --> 32:29.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and just for the country.

32:29.214 --> 32:31.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
explain it, David?

32:31.149 --> 32:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, all those
things contributed,
Trump's bad negotiation, lack of
experience,

32:35.654 --> 32:37.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the factionalism.

32:37.422 --> 32:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people talk about divisions
within the
party, blah, blah, blah, but the
core problem

32:40.759 --> 32:43.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was philosophical and
intellectual.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The problem was with the
substance of the
bill.

32:45.564 --> 32:50.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We live in a country that has
widening inequality,
where there's a lot of people
very -- being

32:50.101 --> 32:51.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very insecure.

32:51.870 --> 32:56.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Republicans could have
taken some
of their approaches, like the
tax credits,

32:56.808 --> 33:00.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the health savings accounts
and a lot
of things, and to deal with the
country as

33:00.779 --> 33:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is, as, say, take those
mechanisms, market
mechanisms, to reduce costs, but
to give people

33:06.852 --> 33:11.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
basic security and shore up the
coverage that
they have now.

33:11.756 --> 33:20.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, instead of doing that, they
gave a bill
that was, like, out of "1984,"
which devastated

33:20.665 --> 33:25.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the poor, $880 billion cut out
of Medicaid,
while enriching the rich,
increasing the after-tax

33:25.770 --> 33:30.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
incomes of people making more
than a million
dollars by 14 percent.

33:30.141 --> 33:34.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, this was like every
stereotype of the
Republican Party.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it just didn't fit the
country.

33:37.082 --> 33:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the core problem for the
Republicans is
they can't figure out what they
want to govern.

33:40.285 --> 33:44.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if they were the best and
most efficient
legislators in the history of
the world, if

33:44.789 --> 33:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you don't know what you want to
do, and you
don't know how you're going to
address this

33:47.959 --> 33:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country's problems, you're going
to wind up
with bills which are
superficial, intellectually

33:52.264 --> 33:54.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
incoherent and unpopular.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the last Quinnipiac poll had
this at 17
percent.

33:57.736 --> 34:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it was a failure of
understanding,
what we do we want to do?

34:01.673 --> 34:03.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what killed this bill.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so what does
that mean,
Mark, for what the Republicans
say they want

34:06.011 --> 34:07.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do next?

34:07.178 --> 34:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president and Speaker Ryan
suggested tax
reform.

34:10.982 --> 34:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Major tax reform is the next on
the agenda.

34:14.052 --> 34:18.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The deal that
Republicans in
Congress essentially made with
Donald Trump,

34:18.523 --> 34:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who they didn't know and in most
cases didn't
particularly trust, was, he will
be the instrument

34:25.096 --> 34:27.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of our achieving our agenda.

34:27.432 --> 34:31.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will be -- whether it's
deregulation, whether
it's tax reform, or whatever.

34:31.102 --> 34:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that relationship was
ruptured.

34:34.306 --> 34:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mutual trust, to the degree that
it existed,
was depleted today.

34:39.444 --> 34:41.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Between the
president and...

34:41.680 --> 34:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Between the
president and his
party in Congress, the party
itself.

34:47.018 --> 34:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy, I don't think it's going
to -- it's
not going to be easy.

34:50.088 --> 34:53.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think anything is going
to be easy
from this point forward.

34:53.224 --> 34:58.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you are a Republican, all of
a sudden,
the midterm elections of 2018
got a lot closer.

34:58.196 --> 35:00.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why do I say that?

35:00.098 --> 35:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because when a president's job
approval rating
is 50 percent or above, the
president's party

35:05.971 --> 35:09.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loses an average of 14 House
seats in the
midterm election.

35:09.507 --> 35:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When a president's job rating is
below 50
percent, his party loses an
average of 37

35:15.580 --> 35:16.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House seats.

35:16.881 --> 35:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump today is in -- in
the best polls,
in the high 30s.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's hard to see how his numbers
are going
to go far north from here.

35:24.856 --> 35:25.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is still
early.

35:25.857 --> 35:26.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It is still early.

35:26.858 --> 35:28.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's 64 days and all the rest of
it.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this is not a
confidence-builder.

35:30.595 --> 35:32.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not a trust-builder.

35:32.130 --> 35:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Republicans, all of a
sudden, are starting
to get nervous about 2018.

35:36.634 --> 35:40.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They thought 2018, if you will
recall, when
they thought Hillary Clinton was
going to

35:40.238 --> 35:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
win, was going to be the arrival
of the golden
age.

35:43.274 --> 35:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And right now, they're going to
be on defense.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no Hillary Clinton to
run against.

35:47.012 --> 35:48.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no Barack Obama to run
against.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a referendum on Donald
Trump and his
party.

35:51.449 --> 35:54.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, right now, that is not
working in their
direction.

35:54.452 --> 35:56.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What can
Republicans get done
now?

35:56.454 --> 36:00.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, if they
stick with -- I
think Paul Ryan is a wonderful
guy, a great

36:00.225 --> 36:01.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
politician, a good thinker.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Not a great
politician.

36:03.661 --> 36:04.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: OK, fair, fair.

36:04.662 --> 36:05.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

36:05.663 --> 36:06.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

36:06.664 --> 36:07.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: OK.

36:07.665 --> 36:08.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But people like him.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People on the Hill like him.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ones who were going to vote
for the bill,
a lot of it was just to support
Paul Ryan.

36:12.270 --> 36:12.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, intellectually, he used to
work at a
place called Empower America,
where Jack Kemp

36:12.837 --> 36:14.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Bill Bennett worked.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it had -- it was the
orthodoxy of the
1980s Republicanism.

36:18.009 --> 36:22.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Republicans stick with
that, well,
then they will go down to defeat
after defeat.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to me, the big question is,
how will Donald
Trump react to this?

36:25.417 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a lot of enmity,
frankly, between
him and Ryan in the last few
days, bad communication,

36:30.221 --> 36:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cutting deals behind each
other's backs, mostly
Trump to Ryan.

36:34.159 --> 36:37.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so will he say, OK, I'm not
going to do
this again?

36:37.095 --> 36:40.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to run -- I'm going to
govern as
a true populist.

36:40.098 --> 36:44.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And maybe break up some of the
orthodoxies
that separate Democrats from
Republicans.

36:44.436 --> 36:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe I won't try to pass bills
without -- through
the reconciliation process,
which is a technical

36:49.474 --> 36:53.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing, but messes up every bill
you try to
pass, because it's so arcane,
restrictions

36:53.545 --> 36:55.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on what you can put in a bill.

36:55.346 --> 37:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And maybe I will try to be a 65
percent -- get
some Democrats, get some
Republicans, and

37:00.285 --> 37:02.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
violate the Republican
orthodoxy.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To me, that's the smart lesson
out of this.

37:04.823 --> 37:09.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Run or govern -- try to govern
the way you
actually ran, which is not
orthodox Republican,

37:09.260 --> 37:11.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anybody but.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, if he does
that, Mark,
where does that leave
Republicans, his own

37:13.231 --> 37:14.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
-- his party?

37:14.265 --> 37:16.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I'm not sure
where it
does.

37:16.234 --> 37:19.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I don't think he's
constitutionally capable
of doing that.

37:19.370 --> 37:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The time to do that, David, was
after the
election.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, the country was yearning
to be united.

37:24.209 --> 37:25.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was divided.

37:25.176 --> 37:26.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was polarized.

37:26.177 --> 37:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was the time to do it.

37:27.178 --> 37:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't do nine rallies.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't do red state rallies.

37:30.115 --> 37:35.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the eve of the vote, you
don't go to Louisville
and have cries of "Lock her up"
in the room.

37:35.386 --> 37:37.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You don't do that.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is playing to the narrowest
base.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I agree.

37:42.127 --> 37:45.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the outset, on health care,
he should have
brought in the Democrats and the
Republicans

37:45.230 --> 37:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and say, look, they have to come
in.

37:47.132 --> 37:54.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he beat up on Obamacare,
said it was terrible,
it was horrendous, it was awful,
it had to

37:54.072 --> 37:55.740 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go.

37:55.773 --> 37:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where is the purchase there for
the Democrats
to say, we want to be part of
it?

37:58.376 --> 38:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now he's walking away from
health care in
the country.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is responsible.

38:02.213 --> 38:03.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are the governing party.

38:03.515 --> 38:04.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do Republicans understand that?

38:04.983 --> 38:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If health care is in trouble in
this country,
it's the Republicans.

38:08.486 --> 38:10.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a point to be underlined
that Lanhee
Chen made the good point that
Obamacare is

38:12.090 --> 38:13.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not going to explode.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No one -- on expert thinks that.

38:14.559 --> 38:17.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It may deteriorate over time,
but it's not
going to explode.

38:17.262 --> 38:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not going to walk back
into this.

38:19.397 --> 38:22.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, Republicans now own the
health care
system in this country.

38:22.667 --> 38:25.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's not like people are
going to blame
Barack Obama.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's never going to be on the
ballot again.

38:26.771 --> 38:28.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

38:28.273 --> 38:29.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: When things go
bad, they're
going to blame the Republicans.

38:29.574 --> 38:31.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's why I think -- I
agree.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think he's going to
pivot in some
major way.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this is not brain science.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.749 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who elected him?

38:37.782 --> 38:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Working-class voters, people
making just above
the Medicaid minimum.

38:41.186 --> 38:42.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This bill hammered them.

38:42.587 --> 38:43.922 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who elected him?

38:43.955 --> 38:45.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
People 50 to 64.

38:45.223 --> 38:47.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This bill hammered those people.

38:47.091 --> 38:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why not take people who voted
for you and
reward them?

38:50.195 --> 38:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not -- that's like the
normal thing
to do.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he's not doing it.

38:53.431 --> 38:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if he repeats the error in
tax reform,
same outcome.

38:55.466 --> 38:59.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, this
wasn't the
only bad news for President
Trump this week,

38:59.871 --> 39:01.573 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mark.

39:01.606 --> 39:06.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had the FBI director come
out and confirm
publicly in a hearing before the
Congress

39:06.177 --> 39:12.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they are investigating, the
FBI is investigating
ties between the Trump campaign
and Russian

39:12.550 --> 39:19.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government officials, says they
don't have
evidence yet of coordination,
collusion, but

39:19.190 --> 39:21.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an investigation is under way.

39:21.125 --> 39:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, the week
began with the
president being basically
regarded and described

39:29.701 --> 39:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the intelligence chiefs of
the country
as dishonest, OK, I mean, that
the charge

39:35.573 --> 39:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was with baseless, a charge of
felony he made
against his predecessor, to the
point where

39:40.578 --> 39:47.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal, the
organ of American
conservatism, said he is on the
verge of becoming

39:47.085 --> 39:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- his relationship with honesty
is so loose,
he's become a fake president,
not a fake news

39:52.991 --> 39:53.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, this is devastating.

39:55.793 --> 40:00.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To say that an FBI investigation
has been
going on since July, since July,
it's hard

40:00.732 --> 40:04.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to say that it's going to come
to nothing.

40:04.102 --> 40:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so this is serious stuff,
and it's hurtful.

40:08.906 --> 40:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It puts -- when you doubt the
president's
competence and his honesty in
the same week,

40:13.478 --> 40:15.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, these are blows.

40:15.380 --> 40:22.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regardless of how loyal and
dedicated and
enthusiastic is his base, this
is an erosion

40:22.854 --> 40:24.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of public support and public
trust.

40:24.522 --> 40:26.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does it
affect what he's
able to do?

40:26.591 --> 40:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I was trying
to think
of a president who had a worse
week.

40:29.060 --> 40:33.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, as Mark said, like, to
have your major
legislative initiative die, and
your first

40:33.498 --> 40:37.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
major one, and then get a
scandal into your
integrity in one week, that's a
rarity in

40:37.935 --> 40:41.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American history, let alone this
early in
a term.

40:41.439 --> 40:45.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure we're ever going to
find some
smoking gun that's going to link
the Trump

40:45.343 --> 40:47.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign to Vladimir Putin.

40:47.578 --> 40:54.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there is, to me -- the
big mystery
is the almost magnetic pull
between the Trump

40:54.152 --> 40:55.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crowd and Russia.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Like, what is the basis of that?

40:57.288 --> 40:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it because he had so many
investors?

40:59.223 --> 41:02.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as I have said before --
and we seem
to be getting a little closer to
this answer

41:02.794 --> 41:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- where did Paul Manafort come
from?

41:05.496 --> 41:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How did he become chairman of
the Trump campaign
in the middle of all this, a guy
who had ties

41:09.367 --> 41:11.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to mobsters from Russia?

41:11.636 --> 41:13.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are not normal things.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was the chain of events
that led to that?

41:15.106 --> 41:20.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But whether we have will
actually conversations
or proof or actual evidence, we
-- I -- we

41:20.478 --> 41:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have oversold this story at
times.

41:22.413 --> 41:26.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm not saying it's not
significant, but we
have leapt to the -- connecting
all the dots,

41:27.018 --> 41:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when the dots really aren't
there right now.

41:28.820 --> 41:31.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, one
other thing
I want to ask you about, in any
other week,

41:31.923 --> 41:34.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this would have been the first
thing we talked
about.

41:34.726 --> 41:40.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Mark, that is the nominee
to the Supreme
Court by the president, Neil
Gorsuch, had

41:40.898 --> 41:45.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several days of hearings, didn't
answer all
the questions the Democrats
wanted him to.

41:45.269 --> 41:46.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where does he stand?

41:46.270 --> 41:48.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do his prospects look like?

41:48.139 --> 41:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Didn't even answer
the questions
that Sam Alito and John Roberts
did when they

41:51.275 --> 41:52.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were up there.

41:52.610 --> 41:57.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say one thing that the
Trump campaign
did very well.

41:57.048 --> 41:58.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They did vetting.

41:58.850 --> 42:00.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They vetted the judges.

42:00.418 --> 42:02.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They knew whom they had.

42:02.887 --> 42:05.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they had done as well in
the Cabinet,
it would be different.

42:05.223 --> 42:08.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was the ideal nominee.

42:08.459 --> 42:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think in spite of his
becoming non-forthcoming
and said there's no Democrat
judges, Republican

42:14.098 --> 42:16.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
judges, I think he had a very
good week.

42:16.167 --> 42:17.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You think he's
safe for confirmation?

42:17.535 --> 42:19.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think he --
unless there is
something out there.

42:19.904 --> 42:25.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Chuck Schumer is not a guy
who goes on
a quixotic journey all by
himself.

42:25.643 --> 42:27.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said he is going to lead a
filibuster.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I don't see the votes being
there.

42:30.014 --> 42:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thirty seconds.

42:31.349 --> 42:32.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think the
Democrats are making
a big mistake.

42:32.517 --> 42:33.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The guy is clearly qualified.

42:33.985 --> 42:37.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is clearly within the realm
of what any
Republican would nominate.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're lucky to have a guy of
that quality.

42:39.557 --> 42:41.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I thought he behaved
outstandingly.

42:41.292 --> 42:42.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats should pick their
fights.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will have plenty of fights
in the Trump
era.

42:44.662 --> 42:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to blow up the filibuster
rules over this
is undignified and an insult to
the Senate.

42:50.835 --> 42:54.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gentlemen, thank
you both,
David Brooks, Mark Shields.

42:54.605 --> 42:59.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

42:59.944 --> 43:04.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Thank you.

43:04.315 --> 43:11.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: An
Oscar-winning director
returns with a sequel to a film
that became

43:11.489 --> 43:14.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a cult classic 20 years ago.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown reports.

43:16.260 --> 43:19.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Hello, Mark.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.265 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ACTOR: Simon.

43:21.299 --> 43:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: So, what have you been
for 20 years?

43:30.308 --> 43:34.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a fraught
question, all
right.

43:34.312 --> 43:39.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The new film, "T2:
Trainspotting," is about
a group of men, once the best of
friends growing

43:39.584 --> 43:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up in the projects of Edinburgh,
Scotland,
coming together after 20 years,
with a wee

43:44.822 --> 43:50.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bit of baggage.

43:50.661 --> 43:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Director Danny Boyle says that
nostalgia,
even to the point of denial, is
a central

43:55.032 --> 43:56.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
theme in the film.

43:56.868 --> 43:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANNY BOYLE, Director, "T2:
Trainspotting":
One of their problems is that
they imagine,

43:59.103 --> 44:02.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as men often do, that they can
still live
like they were 20 years old.

44:02.240 --> 44:05.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're saying
that as you smile,
right, that you feel it
yourself.

44:05.309 --> 44:06.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANNY BOYLE: Very much so.

44:06.944 --> 44:09.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's like a -- something
I would absolutely
hold up my hand and admit to.

44:09.714 --> 44:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was one of the joys of
doing the film
was the learning process of
seeing how poorly

44:13.918 --> 44:19.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men age and how wise women are,
whereas we
-- it's not even like we think
we're living

44:19.957 --> 44:21.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the past.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just are, and we're not
admitting it to
ourselves for so long.

44:23.995 --> 44:25.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's one of those things
that happens
in the film.

44:25.763 --> 44:31.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have your cake, you have
your fun,
but you also -- you learn from
it as well,

44:31.335 --> 44:33.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I think.

44:33.170 --> 44:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new film is a
sequel to
the 1996 original
"Trainspotting," about four

44:39.877 --> 44:43.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heroin-using, small-crime
committing, wild-living
young men.

44:43.381 --> 44:50.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Based on a 1993 novel by Irvine
Welsh, it
was a low-budget affair, Boyle's
second feature

44:50.221 --> 44:55.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
film, with then little-known
actors, but it
became a smash hit, one of the
most successful

44:55.693 --> 45:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
films ever made in Britain, with
a large,
almost cultish following in the
U.S. and worldwide.

45:01.599 --> 45:06.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANNY BOYLE: We believed in it
very fervently,
very passionately, in the book
and how we

45:06.671 --> 45:08.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wanted to make it as a film.

45:08.439 --> 45:12.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is Irvine Welsh's
extraordinary voice
that he creates for these
people, and that

45:12.810 --> 45:14.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we inherit in the movies.

45:14.845 --> 45:19.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He gives a voice to people who
are marginalized,
and they are from an
extraordinary city, Edinburgh,

45:19.483 --> 45:21.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but they're from the fringes.

45:21.218 --> 45:25.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The first one was
about this
youthful experience of, you know
can almost

45:25.656 --> 45:26.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do anything.

45:26.691 --> 45:29.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they do, like heroin and all
kinds of
antics.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you feel immortal.

45:31.262 --> 45:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now this is inevitably a
kind of meditation
about aging and mortality.

45:35.633 --> 45:39.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANNY BOYLE: The first film is
really boyhood,
or, you know, when you emerge
from childhood

45:39.937 --> 45:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into those late teens, early 20s
and you feel
reckless and careless, and you
can take all

45:46.043 --> 45:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the risks, terrible risks you
take with yourself
and other people.

45:50.014 --> 45:52.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And most of us get away with it.

45:52.049 --> 45:54.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have -- most of them
have got away
with it.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they move from boyhood to
manhood, really.

45:56.654 --> 46:01.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You get a little sense of the
beginning, a
glimmer of understanding of
where they are

46:01.592 --> 46:05.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the world and what they
should be and what
they need to atone for.

46:05.496 --> 46:12.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For the sequel,
again based
on work by Irvine Welsh, the
four lead actors,

46:12.269 --> 46:16.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including Ewan McGregor and
Jonny Lee Miller,
have returned.

46:16.507 --> 46:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All had gone on to successful
careers, as
has Boyle, who won an Oscar for
best director

46:21.612 --> 46:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for "Slumdog Millionaire," and
later made
the biopic "Steve Jobs."

46:29.420 --> 46:33.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you're making a remake like
this, there's
an opportunity, because you have
a built-in

46:33.391 --> 46:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
audience, in some sense, but
isn't there also
kind of, I don't know, albatross
or something

46:38.996 --> 46:39.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of expectations?

46:40.031 --> 46:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANNY BOYLE: Oh, totally.

46:42.133 --> 46:45.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have to learn very
quickly to take
off the albatross.

46:45.403 --> 46:49.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otherwise, it just gets heavier
and heavier,
worrying about what people will
think of us

46:49.206 --> 46:50.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going back.

46:50.341 --> 46:52.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You just say,
don't blow it,
right?

46:52.410 --> 46:54.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have this memory of a film I
love.

46:54.111 --> 46:55.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANNY BOYLE: Yes.

46:55.112 --> 46:57.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The affection for the first film
was palpable.

46:57.181 --> 46:59.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, indeed, that was one of the
reasons we
went back to it.

46:59.817 --> 47:01.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was still an appetite for
these characters.

47:01.886 --> 47:08.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, yes, you're concerned about
not besmirching
the original and the memory of
the original.

47:08.426 --> 47:14.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we felt -- and we tried 10
years ago,
and we abandoned that attempt,
because it

47:14.131 --> 47:18.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have disappointed people,
we knew, because
it was just a rehash of the
original.

47:18.569 --> 47:19.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was kind of like a caper.

47:20.004 --> 47:24.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "T2" is no
rehash, but it does
pay homage.

47:24.842 --> 47:30.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scenes are recreated from the
original, again
addressing addiction at times,
but equally

47:30.047 --> 47:31.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the bonds of friendship.

47:31.682 --> 47:36.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: I need to detox the
system.

47:36.353 --> 47:38.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Detox the system.

47:38.389 --> 47:40.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does that even mean?

47:40.391 --> 47:42.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't mean anything.

47:42.293 --> 47:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not getting out of your
body that's the
problem.

47:44.061 --> 47:45.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's getting out of your mind.

47:45.396 --> 47:46.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You are an addict.

47:46.597 --> 47:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Obvious question
is, why go
back?

47:48.899 --> 47:50.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANNY BOYLE: Yes.

47:50.601 --> 47:55.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, because I think it is kind
of -- it
is a natural inclination in
human beings.

47:55.272 --> 48:00.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The past is alive in us, and you
often ignore
it for long periods of time.

48:00.044 --> 48:01.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But there is it.

48:01.045 --> 48:02.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANNY BOYLE: Yes, but there it
is.

48:02.880 --> 48:06.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why we have those
catchup moments
where you go, it's not, is it,
20 years like

48:06.317 --> 48:08.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

48:08.085 --> 48:10.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And to the extent
that we're
talking about a film about aging
men, you're

48:10.488 --> 48:11.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
older, too.

48:11.489 --> 48:13.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANNY BOYLE: I am.

48:13.190 --> 48:16.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Did you feel any
trepidation
about going back to your early
period?

48:16.827 --> 48:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANNY BOYLE: Oh, yes, because
you think -- you're
measuring yourself against the
past, really.

48:22.099 --> 48:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh, you feel
that?

48:23.100 --> 48:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANNY BOYLE: Oh, yes, very much
so, yes.

48:25.035 --> 48:30.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also -- because I have a
philosophy, a belief,
which I can see in many, many
other directors

48:30.040 --> 48:34.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that your early work is your
best work, because
you don't know what you're
doing.

48:34.612 --> 48:37.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I certainly felt that way
when we were
making the first
"Trainspotting."

48:37.681 --> 48:41.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were in the dark, me and the
actors, but
none of us had much experience.

48:41.619 --> 48:45.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you're taking huge risks,
ridiculous
risks, a bit like the bravado of
the characters

48:46.023 --> 48:47.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in a way.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, when you come to a
later one and
you look back, then you begin to
simulate

48:50.995 --> 48:55.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of that innocence and some
of that naivete
work and that freshness really.

48:55.633 --> 48:57.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I hope some of that is in
the new movie
as well.

48:57.902 --> 49:00.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's an
interesting philosophy
of life and directing.

49:00.538 --> 49:02.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's all downhill from here.

49:02.106 --> 49:03.140 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

49:03.174 --> 49:04.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:04.175 --> 49:05.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANNY BOYLE: Absolutely, yes.

49:05.609 --> 49:08.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: "T2:
Trainspotting" opens around
the country today.

49:08.312 --> 49:14.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

49:14.985 --> 49:28.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nato Thompson is
a curator
of public art, and the author of
the recent

49:28.465 --> 49:30.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
book "Culture as Weapon."

49:30.467 --> 49:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, he offers his Humble
Opinion on the
confusion created by charitable
advertising.

49:36.740 --> 49:38.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Have a listen.

49:38.509 --> 49:40.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO THOMPSON, Author, "Culture
as Weapon":
Like many of us, I was brought
being told

49:40.244 --> 49:42.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I should make the world a better
place.

49:42.112 --> 49:46.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a curator of contemporary art
in our public
spaces, I often work with
artists who share

49:46.483 --> 49:47.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this basic common value.

49:47.918 --> 49:52.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to rectify social
injustices and to
help our fellow humans.

49:52.489 --> 49:55.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Call it do-gooder art, for lack
of a better
term.

49:55.693 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen a growing interest
in corporations
wanting to support public art.

50:00.030 --> 50:06.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while I too want to go after
the money,
sometimes, I have to stop and
ask, is corporately

50:06.203 --> 50:08.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
funded art just an
advertisement?

50:08.839 --> 50:10.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Am I being paranoid?

50:10.541 --> 50:13.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Am I a pawn in someone else's
game?

50:13.711 --> 50:15.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think it is just me.

50:15.546 --> 50:19.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suspect we must all admit a
bit of confusion
over what is an advertisement
and what is

50:19.783 --> 50:21.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actual social good.

50:21.619 --> 50:27.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, every October, a
particular color
arrives that epitomizes this
phenomena: pink.

50:27.558 --> 50:29.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is the color of breast cancer
awareness.

50:29.894 --> 50:32.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, believe me, I can't imagine
a more important
disease to fight.

50:32.863 --> 50:37.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, please, don't take my
criticism of pink
to be a critique of the actual
work fighting

50:37.201 --> 50:39.036 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
breast cancer.

50:39.069 --> 50:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have also seen, as I am
sure you have,
a lot of sponsors jump on the
pink bandwagon.

50:43.941 --> 50:46.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sports teams have literally
turned pink, from
cleat to helmet.

50:46.810 --> 50:48.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Soup cans turn pink.

50:48.445 --> 50:49.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bowling balls turn pink.

50:49.980 --> 50:52.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even military fighter jets have
turned pink.

50:52.650 --> 50:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, I'm all for awareness, but,
certainly,
some businesses see the pink
color as an opportunity

50:58.689 --> 51:01.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to appeal to the female consumer
market.

51:01.225 --> 51:03.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, I'm just guessing here.

51:03.994 --> 51:04.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This approach actually has a
name.

51:04.995 --> 51:07.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is called cause-related
marketing.

51:07.131 --> 51:11.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One could easily call it a
win-win, and, sometimes,
my artists and I are the lucky
recipients.

51:11.869 --> 51:17.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Social justice causes get, well,
money, and
sponsors get the benefit of
looking moral.

51:17.207 --> 51:20.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For those of a more cynical
persuasion, they
might see such efforts as a bit
of a shell

51:20.811 --> 51:25.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
game, where a company distracts
with the image
of doing good to take the eyes
off practices

51:25.649 --> 51:27.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that are not.

51:27.284 --> 51:31.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You notice this even at the
Academy Awards
of advertising, the Super Bowl.

51:31.255 --> 51:34.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of those ads seem to have
this feeling
as though they are actually out
to do good

51:34.792 --> 51:35.759 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the world.

51:35.793 --> 51:37.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Maybe they are.

51:37.194 --> 51:39.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe they are not.

51:39.229 --> 51:40.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The world is a complex place.

51:40.864 --> 51:45.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wanting to make the world a
better and actually
doing it are not the same thing.

51:45.502 --> 51:49.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's just be aware of how
susceptible we
are as consumers to images.

51:49.440 --> 51:55.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suggest we should focus on all
of the practices
of companies vying for our
attention, in order

51:55.546 --> 51:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to make a better judgment.

51:57.014 --> 52:02.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Curator Nato
Thompson, in his
Humble Opinion.

52:02.186 --> 52:08.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the "NewsHour" online
right now: What's
in the new 2017 NASA
Congressional Authorization

52:08.525 --> 52:09.927 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Act?

52:09.960 --> 52:12.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bill makes some major
changes to the space
agency's priorities.

52:12.863 --> 52:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We take a close look and explain
why it matters.

52:16.233 --> 52:21.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:21.071 --> 52:25.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stay tuned for more on this big
week on Capitol
Hill and the defeat of the
Republican health

52:25.776 --> 52:31.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care bill with "Washington
Week," hosted tonight
by Robert Costa of The
Washington Post, who,

52:31.548 --> 52:36.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you heard, joined us earlier
tonight about
that unexpected phone call he
got from President

52:36.186 --> 52:37.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump today.

52:37.955 --> 52:43.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on "PBS NewsHour" Saturday:
an inside
look at South Sudan's growing
humanitarian

52:43.894 --> 52:49.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crisis, as the world's newest
country confronts
famine and fears of genocide.

52:49.233 --> 52:53.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: When I caught up with
a spokesman
for the government troops known
as the Sudan

52:53.704 --> 52:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People's Liberation Army, or
SPLA, he denied
that abuses are happening in a
systematic

52:59.376 --> 53:00.778 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

53:00.811 --> 53:04.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: How come that a national
army like this
will attack civilians?

53:04.615 --> 53:06.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are not angels.

53:06.984 --> 53:13.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within us, there are some
criminals, but these
criminals does not represent our
image as

53:13.390 --> 53:15.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the SPLA.

53:15.125 --> 53:19.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are very few elements,
very few
elements that might have
committed some crimes.

53:19.930 --> 53:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
night on "PBS
NewsHour Weekend."

53:23.734 --> 53:28.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For our part, we will be back
right here on
Monday with a look at life on
the U.S.-Mexico

53:28.338 --> 53:29.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
border.

53:29.473 --> 53:30.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:30.574 --> 53:31.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:31.575 --> 53:32.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:32.576 --> 53:42.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you, and we will see you
soon.
