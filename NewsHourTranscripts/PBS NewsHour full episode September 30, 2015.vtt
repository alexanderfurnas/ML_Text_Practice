WEBVTT

00:05.939 --> 00:09.910
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is
away.

00:09.910 --> 00:15.582
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Russia flexes its muscle in the
Middle East, launching
airstrikes

00:15.582 --> 00:21.955
in Syria and sending military
advisers into Iraq. Margaret
Warner sits down with the Iraqi

00:21.955 --> 00:26.059
prime minister, Haider al-Abadi.

00:26.059 --> 00:31.832
Also ahead this Wednesday: a
major setback in Afghanistan, as
U.S.-led coalition forces

00:31.832 --> 00:37.371
grapple with Taliban insurgents
who have seized a crucial city
in the north.

00:37.371 --> 00:44.011
Plus: how a surge of patients on
Medicaid is straining the health
care system in California.

00:44.011 --> 00:47.614
DR. TED MAZER, San Diego: Why am
I seeing all of those people?
Because nobody else is

00:47.614 --> 00:51.652
available in their communities
to see them. Why not? Because
the rates are unacceptable,

00:51.652 --> 00:54.454
the hassles from the managed
care plans, as well as the
state, are unacceptable to most

00:54.454 --> 00:56.423
offices to deal with.

00:56.423 --> 01:03.130
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:03.130 --> 01:07.634
(BREAK)

01:07.634 --> 01:18.111
JUDY WOODRUFF: Moscow's military
buildup in Syria came to full
flower today, with the

01:18.111 --> 01:23.250
opening of an air barrage. The
Russians said they're targeting
the Islamic State, but that

01:23.250 --> 01:29.056
claim was disputed. And American
officials issued a series of
warnings about where the

01:29.056 --> 01:33.627
airstrikes could lead. We will
have a full report after the
news summary.

01:33.627 --> 01:39.967
In Afghanistan, the Taliban kept
a tight grip on a major
provincial capital they overran

01:39.967 --> 01:43.837
on Monday, and Afghan government
forces faced the prospect of a
critical test when they

01:43.837 --> 01:46.406
try to take it back.

01:46.406 --> 01:49.710
William Brangham reports
on the day's developments.

01:49.710 --> 01:55.382
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Afghan troops
could be seen in action around
Kunduz today, as fighting

01:55.382 --> 01:59.119
raged for a third day. And the
local police chief insisted
they're making progress, backed

01:59.119 --> 02:01.321
up by U.S. airstrikes.

02:01.321 --> 02:06.093
MAN (through translator): The
situation is better now. As you
are aware, some areas have

02:06.093 --> 02:10.530
been retaken by security forces.
The operation is ongoing. We
retook the new police
headquarters,

02:10.530 --> 02:13.367
the jail and some
parts of the city.

02:13.367 --> 02:17.504
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But there was
no sign of a broader
counteroffensive, and a regional

02:17.504 --> 02:22.075
official complained that Afghan
troops had -- quote -- "no will
to fight." The Taliban

02:22.075 --> 02:26.513
seized Kunduz on Monday, sealing
off roads and hunting down
government officials.

02:26.513 --> 02:31.718
Up to 5,000 police and soldiers
retreated to the city's airport,
which Taliban fighters

02:31.718 --> 02:36.857
tried and failed to take
overnight. But Taliban forces
did capture a key hilltop
fortress

02:36.857 --> 02:39.726
today. And civilians
were in full flight.

02:39.726 --> 02:44.097
QADIR KHAN, Afghanistan (through
translator): Kunduz is under
fire as a result of the conflict

02:44.097 --> 02:47.834
over these few days. The
situation is very bad. All of
the residents are fed up and
thousands

02:47.834 --> 02:50.404
of families are
escaping the province.

02:50.404 --> 02:54.307
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The loss of
Kunduz was a blow to President
Ashraf Ghani and his fractious

02:54.307 --> 02:58.145
national unity government. Ghani
and chief executive officer
Abdullah Abdullah faced

02:58.145 --> 03:01.681
angry denunciations in the
Afghan Parliament today.

03:01.681 --> 03:04.351
IQBAL SAFI, Afghan Parliament
Member (through translator): The
leaders of the Afghan national

03:04.351 --> 03:08.488
unity government are unable to
administrate the current
situation in the country. The

03:08.488 --> 03:11.992
people must stand against them
and the people must stone them
and kill them in their palaces.

03:11.992 --> 03:17.030
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All of this
came with some 9,800 American
troops still in Afghanistan,

03:17.030 --> 03:20.934
largely in a training role. And
reports surfaced that U.S.
commanders will recommend
keeping

03:20.934 --> 03:24.938
several thousand in
Afghanistan beyond 2016.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.240
White House spokesman
Josh Earnest:

03:27.240 --> 03:29.810
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: We're going to
continue to monitor the efforts

03:29.810 --> 03:36.316
by the Afghan government and
Afghan security forces to retake
Kunduz. And that will factor

03:36.316 --> 03:42.622
into a longer-term assessment of
the conditions on the ground,
which will influence longer-term

03:42.622 --> 03:45.725
policy decisions that the
president will have to make.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.862
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Obama's current plan calls for
withdrawing all but about 1,000

03:48.862 --> 03:51.798
U.S. troops by the
end of next year.

03:51.798 --> 03:54.868
I'm William Brangham for the
"PBS NewsHour" in Washington.

03:54.868 --> 04:00.740
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's word that
a ship carrying weapons from
Iran was intercepted last week

04:00.740 --> 04:06.847
off the Southern Arabian
Peninsula. A coalition led by
Saudi Arabia says the vessel was
smuggling

04:06.847 --> 04:13.487
arms to Shiite rebels in Yemen.
Sunni Arab states are fighting
against the rebels. A

04:13.487 --> 04:17.891
U.S.-backed naval coalition
says, in fact, that it actually
stopped the vessel, and that

04:17.891 --> 04:22.295
the crew claimed to
be bound for Somalia.

04:22.295 --> 04:27.567
Palestinian President Mahmoud
Abbas declared today that he
will no longer be bound by
agreements

04:27.567 --> 04:32.038
signed with Israel. He addressed
world leaders at the United
Nations General Assembly, and

04:32.038 --> 04:35.609
said there's no point in
further negotiations.

04:35.609 --> 04:39.913
MAHMOUD ABBAS, Palestinian
Authority President (through
translator): As long as Israel
refuses

04:39.913 --> 04:45.785
to commit to the agreements
signed with us, which render us
an authority without real

04:45.785 --> 04:50.524
powers, and as long as Israel
refuses to cease settlement
activities, Israel has thus left

04:50.524 --> 04:57.063
us no choice. We will not remain
the only ones committed to those
agreements.

04:57.063 --> 05:00.600
JUDY WOODRUFF: Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
dismissed Abbas' remarks as --
quote

05:00.600 --> 05:04.371
-- "a speech of lies."

05:04.371 --> 05:08.808
Back in this country, the state
of Georgia has executed a woman
for the first time in

05:08.808 --> 05:16.316
seven decades. Kelly Gissendaner
was put to death by lethal
injection just after midnight.

05:16.316 --> 05:22.556
She had been convicted in the
1997 murder of her husband. More
than 100 supporters gathered

05:22.556 --> 05:26.493
outside the state prison in
Jackson. In addition, Pope
Francis had asked that her death
sentence

05:26.493 --> 05:29.863
be commuted.

05:29.863 --> 05:35.602
It turns out the Kentucky county
clerk who refused marriage
licenses to gay couples met

05:35.602 --> 05:41.675
with Pope Francis last week. Kim
Davis told ABC News she spoke
briefly with the pontiff

05:41.675 --> 05:45.345
in Washington on Thursday, and
that he had told her to -- quote
-- "stay strong." The

05:45.345 --> 05:49.082
Vatican had no comment.

05:49.082 --> 05:54.454
An internal report out today
finds that a Secret Service
official targeted Congressman

05:54.454 --> 06:00.694
Jason Chaffetz for investigating
scandals at the agency. It says
the official suggest

06:00.694 --> 06:06.666
leaking damaging information
from an old job application by
the Utah Republican. It also

06:06.666 --> 06:13.540
says that scores of Secret
Service employees accessed his
file, possibly illegally.

06:13.540 --> 06:19.012
The Atlantic Coast is now
waiting to see what Hurricane
Joaquin will do. The storm
gained

06:19.012 --> 06:24.651
hurricane strength today,
brushed the Eastern Bahamas, and
kept growing. The National
Hurricane

06:24.651 --> 06:30.790
Center predicted that it would
churn north, possibly striking
the U.S. Eastern Seaboard

06:30.790 --> 06:36.496
by early next week. That's
likely to add to flooding in
several Southeastern states.
They

06:36.496 --> 06:41.101
have been hit by heavy
rainstorms over the past two
days.

06:41.101 --> 06:46.106
Wall Street has been flooded by
sell orders in recent days. But,
today, traders went looking

06:46.106 --> 06:54.047
for bargains. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained 235
points to close near 16285. The

06:54.047 --> 07:00.120
Nasdaq rose more than 100
points. And the S&P 500 added
36. Even so, stocks here and

07:00.120 --> 07:05.925
abroad ended their worst
financial quarter in four years.

07:05.925 --> 07:12.098
And a federal appeals court has
struck down a plan to let
colleges pay student athletes

07:12.098 --> 07:17.871
up to $5,000 a year. Today's
ruling said the proposal to
offer cash to football and
basketball

07:17.871 --> 07:21.775
players would destroy
amateur athletics.

07:21.775 --> 07:28.214
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Russia launches strikes in
Syria; the prime minister of
Iraq

07:28.214 --> 07:44.831
on fighting is; a new round of
drama on Capitol Hill, and much
more.

07:44.831 --> 07:50.637
Russian military aircraft bombed
a number of sites in Syria
today, deepening its involvement

07:50.637 --> 07:54.674
in that nation's civil war. But
there are conflicting reports
about exactly what Russia

07:54.674 --> 07:56.509
was targeting.

07:56.509 --> 07:59.679
Hari Sreenivasan
has this report.

07:59.679 --> 08:04.517
HARI SREENIVASAN: This amateur
video purports to be the first
evidence of Russian warplanes

08:04.517 --> 08:10.023
in action over Syria, plumes of
smoke rising over cities as
fighters streak across the

08:10.023 --> 08:14.627
skies. The assault began hours
after the Russian parliament
authorized action and President

08:14.627 --> 08:17.997
Vladimir Putin vowed
to forge ahead.

08:17.997 --> 08:22.635
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
The only right way to fight
international

08:22.635 --> 08:27.807
terrorism in Syria is to act
preemptively, to fight and
eliminate fighters and
terrorists

08:27.807 --> 08:32.746
on the territories they have
already occupied, not to wait
until they come to our home.

08:32.746 --> 08:37.984
HARI SREENIVASAN: But exactly
what the Russians hit, and why,
remained unclear. There were

08:37.984 --> 08:43.490
strikes near Homs and in Hama
province, and Moscow reported
attacking eight Islamic State

08:43.490 --> 08:49.262
targets. But, by all accounts
is, or ISIL, has no significant
presence in those areas.

08:49.262 --> 08:55.068
Instead, the Free Syrian Army
charged its forces were
targeted. the western-backed
faction

08:55.068 --> 09:00.740
has fought Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad, an ally of
Russia. U.S. officials agreed
the

09:00.740 --> 09:05.712
strikes may have hit moderate
rebel factions, and not Islamic
State forces. The Kremlin

09:05.712 --> 09:11.651
denied it, but also claimed most
of the Free Syrian Army has now
joined ISIL ranks.

09:11.651 --> 09:16.022
And, at the United Nations,
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
was dismissive.

09:16.022 --> 09:18.525
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister: Everything --
everything was said by the
Russian Ministry

09:18.525 --> 09:22.595
of Defense. Don't listen to
Pentagon about the Russian
strikes.

09:22.595 --> 09:26.833
HARI SREENIVASAN: Secretary of
State John Kerry was also at the
U.N. He said Washington

09:26.833 --> 09:32.205
would welcome any genuine effort
to defeat ISIL, but he issued a
warning as well.

09:32.205 --> 09:36.109
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: We would have grave
concerns should Russia strike
areas

09:36.109 --> 09:41.314
where ISIL and al-Qaida
affiliated targets are now
operating -- are not operating.

09:41.314 --> 09:45.084
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile, at
a U.S. House hearing, a top
Pentagon official complained

09:45.084 --> 09:48.154
the Russians gave just one
hour's notice of the strikes.

09:48.154 --> 09:51.424
ROBERT WORK, U.S. Deputy Defense
Secretary: We are alarmed by
what happened this morning.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.260
What was agreed by the two
presidents is that our
militaries would talk, so that
we would

09:54.260 --> 09:56.663
deconflict operations.

09:56.663 --> 10:01.167
HARI SREENIVASAN: Defense
Secretary Ashton Carter said
later those military-to-military

10:01.167 --> 10:04.404
talks are set to take place in
the coming days. But he said the
Kremlin is making a

10:04.404 --> 10:06.172
mistake.

10:06.172 --> 10:11.177
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: By supporting Assad
and thereby, seemingly, taking

10:11.177 --> 10:18.651
on everybody who is fighting
Assad, you're taking on the
whole rest of the country of

10:18.651 --> 10:23.523
Syria. That is not our position.
And so that's one of the reasons
why -- in fact, it is the

10:23.523 --> 10:29.963
central reason why the Russian
approach here is doomed to fail.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.733
HARI SREENIVASAN: Carter said
the Russian actions will not
deter the U.S.-led air war

10:33.733 --> 10:37.370
on Islamic State fighters that's
been under way for a year.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.206
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

10:40.206 --> 10:44.444
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late this
evening, Secretary Kerry and
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov

10:44.444 --> 10:49.048
came out together and
agreed to military talks.

10:49.048 --> 10:54.187
We get a closer Russian -- look
at Russia's military moves in
Syria with Andrew Weiss.

10:54.187 --> 10:59.425
He was the director of Russian,
Ukrainian, and Eurasian affairs
at the White House National

10:59.425 --> 11:04.664
Security Council during the
Clinton and George H.W. Bush
administrations. He's now with
the

11:04.664 --> 11:10.103
Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace. And Steven
Simon, he's a visiting lecturer

11:10.103 --> 11:14.040
at Dartmouth College. He served
on the National Security Council
staff during the Obama and

11:14.040 --> 11:16.342
Clinton administrations.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.479
And we welcome you both
back to the program.

11:19.479 --> 11:23.249
Let me start with
you, Steven Simon.

11:23.249 --> 11:28.855
Is this an occasion for the U.S.
to be pleased that it has a
partner in going after ISIS

11:28.855 --> 11:36.296
or alarmed that the Russians are
in Syria helping their friend
President Assad?

11:36.296 --> 11:44.304
STEVEN SIMON, Dartmouth College:
I think, on balance, there's
cause for some satisfaction

11:44.304 --> 11:51.511
and the presence now in Syria of
a powerful military player with
a serious strategic stake

11:51.511 --> 11:56.049
in defeating ISIS.

11:56.049 --> 12:04.223
It's really the only, I would
say, tacit partner. It's
certainly not an explicit or de
jure

12:04.223 --> 12:11.264
partner of the United States in
this battle against ISIS. So, at
least the United States

12:11.264 --> 12:17.203
has a partner, even if it's not
official. On the other hand, it
does mean that there

12:17.203 --> 12:23.376
is a serious friend of the Assad
regime also present in Syria,
and this is undoubtedly

12:23.376 --> 12:25.778
a cause for concern for
the administration.

12:25.778 --> 12:29.349
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
turn to you, Andrew Weiss.

12:29.349 --> 12:33.419
More cause for concern or a
cause for some satisfaction?

12:33.419 --> 12:37.624
ANDREW WEISS, Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace: I think
the cause for concern here

12:37.624 --> 12:41.761
is that Russia is plunging
headlong into a military
adventure in a part of the world

12:41.761 --> 12:44.797
where it's been absent for the
better part of the last two
decades.

12:44.797 --> 12:49.135
So, I defer to my friend Steve
Simon about the impact on the
ground. It certainly looks

12:49.135 --> 12:53.306
like this is a big shot in the
arm for Bashar al-Assad. The
question is, have the Russians

12:53.306 --> 12:57.844
thought two or three moves
ahead? This to me looks
suspiciously like what happened
in

12:57.844 --> 13:02.081
Ukraine, where what seemed like
a good idea, a very pressurized
decision by the Russians

13:02.081 --> 13:06.352
to unleash aggression against
Ukraine, has backfired quite
badly.

13:06.352 --> 13:10.289
And so when I hear Secretary of
Defense Carter today saying that
he thinks this is ultimately

13:10.289 --> 13:14.060
going to basically be something
that is doomed to fail or that
is going to hurt Russia, I

13:14.060 --> 13:16.195
have very little
reason to doubt that.

13:16.195 --> 13:18.531
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean?
Come back to you, Andrew Weiss.
What do you mean it

13:18.531 --> 13:21.234
looks like what
happened in Ukraine?

13:21.234 --> 13:26.806
ANDREW WEISS: Well, people like
to talk Vladimir Putin as if he
is this great master strategist.

13:26.806 --> 13:31.411
In fact, what he is someone who
is fairly impulsive. And so the
intervention in Ukraine

13:31.411 --> 13:35.048
was done very spur of the
moment. And now what we're
seeing -- and we have had about

13:35.048 --> 13:40.953
three weeks or so of a steady
drip of Russian military buildup
in and around the Western

13:40.953 --> 13:45.892
Mediterranean coast of Syria,
and now he's plunging into a
military adventure.

13:45.892 --> 13:50.697
There's no domestic Russian
political support for foreign
military activity of this type.

13:50.697 --> 13:54.000
And I think there's a real
question, which is, he is
basically now putting a target
on

13:54.000 --> 13:56.536
the back of every Russian
soldier and many Russian
civilians, including inside
Russia

13:56.536 --> 13:58.471
itself.

13:58.471 --> 14:02.742
So, he's creating a recruitment
boon, I think, for the global
local jihadist movement, and

14:02.742 --> 14:04.410
he's putting Russia at the
center of that, as opposed to
the United States or other
Western

14:04.410 --> 14:06.145
partners.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.548
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steven Simon, why
was it so difficult today to
figure out who the Russians

14:08.548 --> 14:11.551
were targeting?

14:11.551 --> 14:18.458
STEVEN SIMON: Because the
situation on the ground is, in
fact, confused, and there is

14:18.458 --> 14:23.463
no geolocation of the attacks
that are publicly available yet.

14:23.463 --> 14:29.502
The information available to me
is that they struck targets
affiliated with al-Nusra, which

14:29.502 --> 14:36.109
is another Islamist group. But,
as a practical matter, the first
priority for the Russians

14:36.109 --> 14:41.848
right now is protection of the
regime and the survival of the
regime and its viability.

14:41.848 --> 14:46.986
So, they're going to attack the
targets that they and the regime
have decided are most

14:46.986 --> 14:51.591
threatening to the regime right
now, and then move on to targets
that are less immediately

14:51.591 --> 14:53.893
threatening.

14:53.893 --> 15:01.434
So, whoever was knocking at the
gate right now was going to get
the first Russian blow.

15:01.434 --> 15:06.939
The other thing, of course, is
that the Syrians will be
encouraging the Russians to be
attacking

15:06.939 --> 15:13.045
ISIS targets the United States
has thus far refrained from
attacking because they're
politically

15:13.045 --> 15:21.087
sensitive. If there's a target
that looks as though its
destruction would be mostly

15:21.087 --> 15:27.093
of benefit to the regime, rather
than to the Syrian people at
large, then the United States

15:27.093 --> 15:32.398
will save its ammunition, keep
its powder dry, and strike other
targets that are less

15:32.398 --> 15:37.837
ambiguous, if I can
put it that way.

15:37.837 --> 15:41.207
So, that would be -- that will
be the Soviet -- the Russian
priorities.

15:41.207 --> 15:45.945
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Andrew
Weiss, for any American or
anybody listening to this, it

15:45.945 --> 15:49.182
sounds like a very confusing
situation to keep track of who
is up and who is down and

15:49.182 --> 15:51.584
who is being targeted.

15:51.584 --> 15:56.656
I mean, how should we -- how
should Americans view this? Do
we wait and withhold judgment

15:56.656 --> 16:00.359
until we see what the Russians
do over the next few days?

16:00.359 --> 16:04.530
ANDREW WEISS: Well, I think
President Obama's been quite
reluctant to get the U.S. more

16:04.530 --> 16:09.335
involved militarily, and that's
been going on for some time now.
So, I think the idea

16:09.335 --> 16:11.637
that the U.S. is either going to
stand up to the Russians and
tell them to knock it

16:11.637 --> 16:14.440
off, all that, I
think is misplaced.

16:14.440 --> 16:19.979
The real question, I think, for
us, as the U.S. and other
Western partners in the fight

16:19.979 --> 16:23.316
-- and the regional partners in
the fight against ISIS, is
whether we're going to bump

16:23.316 --> 16:27.253
into the Russians in some sort.
And the Russians up to now had
talked a good game, saying,

16:27.253 --> 16:30.690
oh, we want our militaries
talking, this is really
important.

16:30.690 --> 16:34.527
But they have plunged ahead
without getting that
coordination mechanism locked
in, and

16:34.527 --> 16:39.031
I think there's a real risk here
that the Russians, who don't
have the same level of

16:39.031 --> 16:42.969
experience, don't have the same
kind of intelligence backbone to
support their operations, could

16:42.969 --> 16:47.006
be doing things that are either
dangerous or that put Western
pilots and others at risk.

16:47.006 --> 16:51.244
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Simon, why
isn't that a big worry? I mean,
there was a sense that

16:51.244 --> 16:57.083
we were led to believe ahead of
time the Russians were going to
give the West, the U.S.-led

16:57.083 --> 16:59.919
coalition, more advanced notice.
It sounds like they barely had
an hour's word ahead

16:59.919 --> 17:01.354
of time.

17:01.354 --> 17:05.491
STEVEN SIMON: Yes, I
think it is problematic.

17:05.491 --> 17:10.196
And we have got to get those
mil-mil talks going and there
needs to be better coordination.

17:10.196 --> 17:17.904
But, as a practical matter, the
Russians are going to be
striking in sectors of Syrian

17:17.904 --> 17:22.942
territory and Syrian airspace
that lie outside of the areas
that the United States has
focused

17:22.942 --> 17:28.814
on, which are mainly targets
that are close to the Turkish
border in the north.

17:28.814 --> 17:35.221
So, as a practical matter, I
think the risk of a collision
are low.

17:35.221 --> 17:39.058
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just
quickly conclude asking you
both, what are you looking for

17:39.058 --> 17:43.062
in the next few days to tell you
whether this is a positive
development or not?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.398
Andrew Weiss?

17:45.398 --> 17:49.135
ANDREW WEISS: I think the
immediate question is how the
Russian people will react.

17:49.135 --> 17:54.540
I have no doubt that there's
great sense of celebration
inside Assad's inner circle, and

17:54.540 --> 17:58.311
frankly in Tehran, but I don't
think the Russian people were
prepared for any of this. This

17:58.311 --> 18:03.349
has all been thrown at them with
maybe two or three weeks'
notice. It plays to Putin's

18:03.349 --> 18:07.687
domestic agenda, which is to say
Russia is a big, great power, it
can thrust itself into

18:07.687 --> 18:12.425
the international stage at its
own -- a time of its own liking
and a place of its choosing,

18:12.425 --> 18:15.594
but there's no one I think at
home who is really enthusiastic
about this whole activity.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.863
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we are
going to have to leave it there.

18:17.863 --> 18:25.104
Andrew Weiss, Steven
Simon, thank you both.

18:25.104 --> 18:37.984
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we get
the view from Baghdad on
Russia's bombing and the fight

18:37.984 --> 18:42.588
against the Islamic State, or
Da'esh, as the group is called
in Arabic.

18:42.588 --> 18:47.360
"NewsHour" chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret Warner
spoke today with Iraqi Prime

18:47.360 --> 18:51.864
Minister Haider al-Abadi. He is
in New York attending the U.N.
General Assembly.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.400
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Prime
Minister, thank you for joining
us.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.235
HAIDER AL-ABADI, Iraqi
Prime Minister: Welcome.

18:56.235 --> 19:00.439
MARGARET WARNER: It's been
confirmed today that the
Russians launched an airstrike
in

19:00.439 --> 19:05.811
Syria right outside the city of
Homs. Is that kind of thing
helpful, do you think, to the

19:05.811 --> 19:08.714
common fight against
the Islamic State?

19:08.714 --> 19:14.487
HAIDER AL-ABADI: Well, of course
it is beneficial. Don't forget,
Iraq was attacked from across

19:14.487 --> 19:19.759
the Syrian border into
Iraq by Da'esh, by ISIL.

19:19.759 --> 19:26.399
And that cost us a lot of human
costs in terms of people killed,
people being kidnapped,

19:26.399 --> 19:32.638
people being enslaved, women,
children. So, any joining of
this fight against Da'esh by

19:32.638 --> 19:36.742
anyone, we very much welcome. We
established this international
coalition.

19:36.742 --> 19:39.345
MARGARET WARNER: You're talking
about the U.S.-led coalition?

19:39.345 --> 19:43.582
HAIDER AL-ABADI: Correct. That's
to help Iraq to stand in the
face of Da'esh.

19:43.582 --> 19:48.387
And if the Russians are moving
against Da'esh now in Syria, we
very much welcome this.

19:48.387 --> 19:52.291
MARGARET WARNER: Well, that is
really the question. The U.S.
government was saying today

19:52.291 --> 19:56.662
that, in fact, that's not a
Da'esh, or ISIS, stronghold
where they bombed; in fact, it's

19:56.662 --> 20:00.499
held mostly by the opposition
to President Assad.

20:00.499 --> 20:03.803
What do you think are
the Russian intentions?

20:03.803 --> 20:08.441
HAIDER AL-ABADI: Our message to
the Russians -- I met with Putin
-- please join this fight

20:08.441 --> 20:10.409
against Da'esh.

20:10.409 --> 20:15.214
Da'esh is a dangerous terrorist
organization, not only against
Iraq, against Syria, against

20:15.214 --> 20:19.251
the whole region, against the
whole world. It is time that we
all join the same forces

20:19.251 --> 20:21.320
to fight Da'esh.

20:21.320 --> 20:25.624
MARGARET WARNER: But do you
think that the Russian intention
is only to do that or to

20:25.624 --> 20:28.561
also prop up the
Assad government?

20:28.561 --> 20:34.033
HAIDER AL-ABADI: I cannot be in
the mind of what the Russians
want. But what I have been

20:34.033 --> 20:39.472
told by President Putin, yes,
they consider Da'esh a very
dangerous organization. It is

20:39.472 --> 20:45.277
threatening the national
security of Russia, and the
Russians are in it to fight
Da'esh.

20:45.277 --> 20:49.748
MARGARET WARNER: Can you foresee
the day that Iraq might ask the
Russians to come in and

20:49.748 --> 20:53.752
bomb in Iraq, to assist what
your ground forces are doing?

20:53.752 --> 20:57.656
HAIDER AL-ABADI: Well, if the
Russians are prepared to join
the international coalition,

20:57.656 --> 21:01.660
which is helping Iraq, they are
welcome. I think I would welcome
the Russians to do that.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.864
MARGARET WARNER: But, I mean,
they're not part of the U.S.-led
coalition. They have

21:04.864 --> 21:09.568
a different group. Are you
saying they'd have to first join
the U.S.-led coalition or just

21:09.568 --> 21:14.073
that, if they say they want to
defeat Da'esh, that in fact you
would welcome their help,

21:14.073 --> 21:16.308
including bombs?

21:16.308 --> 21:18.644
HAIDER AL-ABADI: Yes, I think I
would welcome that, but that
they need a lot of work to

21:18.644 --> 21:21.580
liaison between everybody there.

21:21.580 --> 21:27.419
We need, like, a common
platform, where there should be
no conflict. We have to
deconflict

21:27.419 --> 21:31.590
any misunderstanding between the
countries which are helping Iraq
inside Iraq.

21:31.590 --> 21:35.027
MARGARET WARNER: Another thing,
of course, that happened over
the last few days was news

21:35.027 --> 21:42.501
that Iraq had entered an
intelligence pact with Russia
and Iran and Syria to share
intelligence

21:42.501 --> 21:46.639
about ISIS. Why did
you join that?

21:46.639 --> 21:54.013
HAIDER AL-ABADI: ISIL is an
international terrorist
organization. As far as the
intelligence

21:54.013 --> 21:59.652
is concerned, we can only gather
information about ISIL inside
Iraq.

21:59.652 --> 22:04.456
We need the help of other
countries. Russia now considers
ISIL as a national threat to

22:04.456 --> 22:09.795
them. It is a national threat to
Syria. And, of course, it is a
threat to Iran as well.

22:09.795 --> 22:13.065
Now, to share this intelligence
with these countries is going to
help us. I will do whatever

22:13.065 --> 22:15.834
it takes to protect
the Iraqi people.

22:15.834 --> 22:21.707
And there are many terrorist
networks all over the world and
fighters coming across

22:21.707 --> 22:26.011
different countries, to Syria,
to Iraq. I need the help of that
intelligence, as well

22:26.011 --> 22:27.112
as the intelligence of the
international coalition, which
is...

22:27.112 --> 22:28.714
(CROSSTALK)

22:28.714 --> 22:33.786
MARGARET WARNER: But doesn't
most of your intelligence in
fact come from the Americans?

22:33.786 --> 22:40.492
And are you worried that the
U.S. will become more wary and
less forthcoming sharing
intelligence

22:40.492 --> 22:44.296
with you if they know it also
goes to Iran and Russia and
Syria?

22:44.296 --> 22:47.533
HAIDER AL-ABADI: No, we will be
careful not to share this
information which comes from

22:47.533 --> 22:50.636
other parties with
another party.

22:50.636 --> 22:58.143
But, you see, Russia has an
interest. We have about 2,500
Chechen fighters from Russia who

22:58.143 --> 23:04.049
are taking part with Da'esh
inside Iraq and inside Syria.
Inside Iraq, they are very
dangerous

23:04.049 --> 23:07.886
guys. They do detonation. They
kill a lot of people. So, I
think to have the Russians

23:07.886 --> 23:13.759
on board will help me, will help
my government to protect Iraqis
and to save more lives.

23:13.759 --> 23:17.429
MARGARET WARNER: Now, you met
with President Obama privately
after this news came out.

23:17.429 --> 23:20.766
Did he seem upset, annoyed?

23:20.766 --> 23:25.704
HAIDER AL-ABADI: Well, I think
there is some political enmity
between probably the United

23:25.704 --> 23:28.874
States and Russia. That
is very much understood.

23:28.874 --> 23:33.312
The Russians want to play a role
in the Middle East. They want to
play another role in Russia.

23:33.312 --> 23:38.684
I understand that. But, for me,
these minor political
differences, I should put aside.

23:38.684 --> 23:44.290
MARGARET WARNER: What the U.S.
was upset about is that you, for
whom, you know, the U.S.

23:44.290 --> 23:49.061
is providing air cover for your
troops, retraining of your
troops, didn't even give the
Americans

23:49.061 --> 23:51.930
a heads-up. Why not?

23:51.930 --> 23:55.834
HAIDER AL-ABADI: I think, no,
they knew about it, about this
intelligence sharing of
information.

23:55.834 --> 23:58.804
MARGARET WARNER: They say
they didn't in advance.

23:58.804 --> 24:01.273
HAIDER AL-ABADI: I mean, they
were -- advance -- well,
probably not in advance before
we

24:01.273 --> 24:04.543
have done it, but later,
after we have done it.

24:04.543 --> 24:09.048
I mean, this has been going on
for about three months now. This
is not new. I don't know

24:09.048 --> 24:13.185
why the news was broke recently.
It's very low-level. It's very
low-level. It is not

24:13.185 --> 24:16.922
high-level. There is no military
cooperation whatsoever.

24:16.922 --> 24:21.460
MARGARET WARNER: So, if I might,
back to the meeting with
President Obama, what did he

24:21.460 --> 24:23.696
say?

24:23.696 --> 24:28.133
HAIDER AL-ABADI: It's mainly to
do with American and
international coalition support
to Iraq.

24:28.133 --> 24:32.671
We need more equipment.
We need more support.

24:32.671 --> 24:36.909
And I think that the president
was very much forthcoming in
escalating the support for

24:36.909 --> 24:41.013
Iraq, for our forces to achieve
victory on the ground. We are, I
think, the only army

24:41.013 --> 24:43.482
in the region who are
fighting Da'esh.

24:43.482 --> 24:49.655
MARGARET WARNER: Let me ask you
about your fight in Iraq. It
seems to have hit a stalemate.

24:49.655 --> 24:54.860
You had a little early success,
sort of freezing ISIS in place
last summer, but, since then,

24:54.860 --> 24:59.631
you have been unable to retake
some major cities like Ramadi.
Why is that?

24:59.631 --> 25:04.703
HAIDER AL-ABADI: Well, I think,
last time was in April, when we
took back Tikrit. And,

25:04.703 --> 25:07.873
since then, of course,
we lost Ramadi.

25:07.873 --> 25:13.579
But after -- a month-and-a-half
after we lost Ramadi, we started
a counteroffensive, and

25:13.579 --> 25:19.618
we have almost encircled not
only Ramadi, but manyfold areas
other than Ramadi to kick

25:19.618 --> 25:24.623
Da'esh out. Of course, this
summer, in particular, was very
hot, extremely hot.

25:24.623 --> 25:30.963
I don't think, when soldiers are
carrying about eight, 10
kilograms of equipment and

25:30.963 --> 25:37.536
of body armor, you wouldn't
expect them to fight in such a
heat weather. We have made

25:37.536 --> 25:41.874
progress, but not as much as we
anticipated because of the
weather.

25:41.874 --> 25:46.712
MARGARET WARNER: Many Americans
wonder, why should we keep
getting involved, losing lives

25:46.712 --> 25:51.617
and treasure, trying to help
these countries resolve their
differences? Why not just walk

25:51.617 --> 25:54.086
away and let them resolve
themselves? What would you say
to those American taxpayers

25:54.086 --> 25:56.121
and voters?

25:56.121 --> 26:00.592
HAIDER AL-ABADI: See, Da'esh, or
ISIL, is not only threat to Iraq
or the region. It's

26:00.592 --> 26:02.961
for the whole world.

26:02.961 --> 26:08.267
We have blocked the advance of
Da'esh to the south. If they are
allowed to go to the south,

26:08.267 --> 26:14.706
they would control all the Gulf
areas, all the oil supply of the
world. They will threaten

26:14.706 --> 26:18.844
the whole world. They will
establish what they consider
their rightful state, which

26:18.844 --> 26:21.914
is, of course, terror
state, in the whole region.

26:21.914 --> 26:26.785
We have blocked that in Iraq. We
not only stopped it, but we are
reversing it. We are

26:26.785 --> 26:31.824
the only country now reversing
the acts of this terrorist
organization. If we don't
receive

26:31.824 --> 26:37.296
this international support, I'm
not sure we can stand on our
own. We gave a lot of
sacrifices.

26:37.296 --> 26:40.299
We are prepared to give more.
Iraqis are sacrificing
themselves to defend their land
and to push

26:40.299 --> 26:43.001
Da'esh out.

26:43.001 --> 26:46.972
If we don't receive this
international support, God knows
what is going to happen in this

26:46.972 --> 26:49.174
region and what's going to
happen in the rest of the world.

26:49.174 --> 26:51.477
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Prime
Minister, thank you.

26:51.477 --> 26:57.883
HAIDER AL-ABADI: OK, thank you.

26:57.883 --> 27:05.657
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:05.657 --> 27:10.629
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
questions about Coca-Cola
funding research on obesity; and

27:10.629 --> 27:16.335
a look at racial
diversity in Hollywood.

27:16.335 --> 27:20.138
Just hours before a possible
government shutdown, Congress
today passed a bill to keep
funding

27:20.138 --> 27:24.209
flowing until December 11.

27:24.209 --> 27:28.614
But today's votes showed the
continued sharp divide within
the Republican Party and it

27:28.614 --> 27:32.751
seemed to set up an even
bigger fight in December.

27:32.751 --> 27:37.456
To unpack another dramatic day
in Congress, our political
director, Lisa Desjardins, has

27:37.456 --> 27:42.127
been following the developments,
and she joins us now from
Capitol Hill.

27:42.127 --> 27:47.032
So, Lisa, they dodged a bullet.
They avoided the shutdown, but
this was despite the opposition

27:47.032 --> 27:50.836
of over 150 Republicans in
the House. What happened?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.771
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

27:52.771 --> 27:56.441
You know, this seemed to be a
fait accompli as we walked in
the door this morning. Of

27:56.441 --> 28:00.479
course, a shutdown would be
averted. That was the
expectation. But I think there
were

28:00.479 --> 28:05.684
several surprises today, Judy,
and the biggest note for today
was that two-thirds of House

28:05.684 --> 28:10.289
Republicans voted against the
bill to continue funding
government.

28:10.289 --> 28:14.893
There were a variety of reasons,
they said, for that, but at the
top of that list, Judy,

28:14.893 --> 28:19.031
was the fight over Planned
Parenthood. Now, it's an
interesting contrast, Judy,
because

28:19.031 --> 28:23.335
while two-thirds of House
Republicans voted against that
funding bill to keep government

28:23.335 --> 28:27.406
running, two-thirds of Senate
Republicans voted for it.

28:27.406 --> 28:31.877
So, what we saw today, Judy, was
such a great contrast between
the Senate, which seems to

28:31.877 --> 28:35.847
be running on procedure and
tradition right now, and the
House, where there is so much

28:35.847 --> 28:39.451
anger among House Republicans,
that, really, Republicans seem
to be running there mostly

28:39.451 --> 28:42.020
on emotion and anger.

28:42.020 --> 28:45.424
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, you know, we
have been told, Lisa, that
there's a group of, what,

28:45.424 --> 28:49.728
40 or 50 hard-liners, if you
will, in the Republican Party in
the House who were giving

28:49.728 --> 28:53.966
fits to Speaker Boehner,
leading to his resignation.

28:53.966 --> 28:59.705
But now you have got 150
Republicans voting against
keeping the government going
over

28:59.705 --> 29:02.641
this Planned Parenthood
issue. What does that say?

29:02.641 --> 29:06.778
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, I think
we can't read too far into this,
because I think this was

29:06.778 --> 29:11.016
a certain vote. Republicans knew
that government wasn't going to
shut down, that enough Democrats

29:11.016 --> 29:13.785
would vote yes to keep
government going.

29:13.785 --> 29:18.824
So, in a way, it wasn't a
complete test of what these
Republicans would do if it were

29:18.824 --> 29:23.295
solely up to them. But I think
you're right that we have this
caucus that is the most

29:23.295 --> 29:28.533
conservative group in the House,
40 or so members, and they are
the most vocal. They

29:28.533 --> 29:33.538
are the ones that really are
dominating discussion, even
still, even after House Speaker
Boehner's

29:33.538 --> 29:37.909
resignation, to the degree,
Judy, where today there was even
a last-ditch, last-minute vote

29:37.909 --> 29:40.545
on Planned Parenthood
in the House.

29:40.545 --> 29:45.917
It was completely symbolic. It
will not have any effect on
funding. But just the fact that

29:45.917 --> 29:50.589
that came up yet again today
shows that that group of House
conservatives that is so vocal

29:50.589 --> 29:55.394
really has an outweighed amount
of power on their conference.

29:55.394 --> 30:00.198
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, again, they
averted the shutdown now, but
what does this say about

30:00.198 --> 30:03.101
the future, December, another
funding vote, so many other
things that could come up
between

30:03.101 --> 30:05.370
now and then?

30:05.370 --> 30:09.808
LISA DESJARDINS: I think any
student of history or Congress
or legislation needs to pay very

30:09.808 --> 30:14.112
close attention to what happens
the next few months. It is going
to be exciting, potentially

30:14.112 --> 30:19.551
confusing, and potentially
critical to the future of this
country, as we face yet another

30:19.551 --> 30:22.320
deadline for the debt ceiling,
but also as their there may be
an opening, Judy, for the

30:22.320 --> 30:24.589
next month.

30:24.589 --> 30:29.928
As House Speaker Boehner remains
in his position, there might be
an opportunity for him to get

30:29.928 --> 30:34.433
through or try to get through
some legislation that moderate
Republicans like, things like

30:34.433 --> 30:40.639
the Export-Import Bank, or
highway funding, to find a more
secure source of highway
funding,

30:40.639 --> 30:45.510
or even, imagine this, a
two-year budget deal. That's
something that the Senate
leader, Mitch

30:45.510 --> 30:48.113
McConnell, was talking about,
and sources on both sides told
me there are staff discussion

30:48.113 --> 30:51.349
now, not a lot of time to do it.

30:51.349 --> 30:56.221
But if they could, Judy, that
would certainly save the next
speaker a lot of headache. Now,

30:56.221 --> 31:00.992
the next big problem, of course,
comes in December. This funding
that was extended today

31:00.992 --> 31:05.197
runs out then. And, Judy, I have
to tell you Democrats and
Republicans both are digging

31:05.197 --> 31:08.867
in. I think that will be a
ginormous fight, if that's a
word.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.370
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, if those
things come to pass that you
described in the next few

31:12.370 --> 31:14.606
months, a lot of conservatives
will not be happy. So, you're
going to have a lot to cover

31:14.606 --> 31:15.907
up on the Hill.

31:15.907 --> 31:20.045
Lisa Desjardins, thank you.

31:20.045 --> 31:26.451
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you.

31:26.451 --> 31:34.960
JUDY WOODRUFF: The number of
people who lack health insurance
has fallen substantially

31:34.960 --> 31:40.165
since the implementation of the
federal health care law known as
the Affordable Care Act.

31:40.165 --> 31:46.304
That's been particularly true in
the 30 states that expanded
Medicaid. But in more than a

31:46.304 --> 31:52.577
dozen of those states,
enrollment in the public
insurance program for the poor
has far eclipsed

31:52.577 --> 31:57.149
projections, straining budgets
and an overburdened health care
system.

31:57.149 --> 32:01.219
Special correspondent Sarah
Varney has our report from San
Diego.

32:01.219 --> 32:06.424
This story was produced in
collaboration with our partner
Kaiser Health news.

32:06.424 --> 32:11.263
SARAH VARNEY: The Affordable
Care Act unleashed a building
boom of community health centers

32:11.263 --> 32:19.437
across the country, at a cost of
$11 billion. More than 950 new
health centers have opened,

32:19.437 --> 32:24.342
with hundreds more on the way,
all meant to accommodate
millions of new Medicaid
patients,

32:24.342 --> 32:26.178
people like Lori Simpson.

32:26.178 --> 32:27.179
LORI SIMPSON, Medicaid
Patient: Hi. How are you?

32:27.179 --> 32:28.280
WOMAN: Good. How are you doing?

32:28.280 --> 32:30.515
LORI SIMPSON: Doing good.

32:30.515 --> 32:34.953
SARAH VARNEY: At age 58, after
several worrisome decades
without health insurance, she's
finally

32:34.953 --> 32:38.857
getting treatment for her
dangerously high blood pressure,
as well as a thyroid disorder,

32:38.857 --> 32:42.727
and after years of double
vision, surgery for her eyes.

32:42.727 --> 32:47.566
LORI SIMPSON: I have nine
medications that I get every
month, and mine comes to a
little

32:47.566 --> 32:53.772
over $200. My husband, he's a
diabetic, and his medication
alone without doctors' visits

32:53.772 --> 32:56.541
or anything comes to
over $400 a month.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.677
SARAH VARNEY: And for that,
how much do you have to pay?

32:58.677 --> 33:01.746
LORI SIMPSON: We don't pay
anything. It's all covered. It's
just amazing.

33:01.746 --> 33:05.550
WOMAN: It's a little
bit this way.

33:05.550 --> 33:10.889
SARAH VARNEY: Simpson goes to
the Family Health Centers of San
Diego, which saw an increase

33:10.889 --> 33:15.160
of 24,000 patients, almost
overnight, after the Medicaid
expansion.

33:15.160 --> 33:17.162
DR. CHRIS GORDON, Family Health
Centers of San Diego: Sit up
straight. Breathe normally.

33:17.162 --> 33:21.967
SARAH VARNEY: DR. Chris Gordon,
the assistant medical director
here, says it was a rush

33:21.967 --> 33:25.604
primary care clinics have been
waiting for ever since President
Obama signed the health

33:25.604 --> 33:27.272
law.

33:27.272 --> 33:30.542
DR. CHRIS GORDON: We have
anticipated this for years, and
been planning for it. We have

33:30.542 --> 33:34.746
capacity to take on patients.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.648
These are patients that haven't
had access before because they
just didn't have the financial

33:36.648 --> 33:38.350
means to get in.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.986
Extend all the way out.

33:40.986 --> 33:43.655
And now all of a sudden, they
actually get to come in, get to
spend time with somebody

33:43.655 --> 33:46.591
and get to feel, you know,
like they're heard.

33:46.591 --> 33:50.996
SARAH VARNEY: That's not to say
there haven't been problems.
Three million more people than

33:50.996 --> 33:56.368
expected have enrolled in
Medicaid in California. Other
states have also seen surges far
beyond

33:56.368 --> 34:02.407
initial projections, including
Kentucky, Michigan, Oregon, and
Washington State.

34:02.407 --> 34:06.811
As successful as California has
been in enrolling millions in
Medicaid and building new
primary

34:06.811 --> 34:11.783
care clinics, patient advocates
say the Medicaid expansion has
exacerbated longstanding
shortages

34:11.783 --> 34:17.689
in specialty care. Community
clinic directors say it's often
difficult to find cardiologists,

34:17.689 --> 34:21.192
orthopedists and other
specialists to see their
patients and that low-income
Californians

34:21.192 --> 34:26.431
still face formidable hurdles
when they need medical
treatment.

34:26.431 --> 34:31.503
For Alessandro Gonzales Gomez,
the search for specialty care
has been burdensome. Gomez

34:31.503 --> 34:36.675
spent years working as a car
salesman and auto parts delivery
driver. But now, at age

34:36.675 --> 34:40.078
60 and living along, he shuffles
around his home in an Escondido
trailer park hampered

34:40.078 --> 34:43.815
by spells of dizziness.

34:43.815 --> 34:49.554
The spells disrupt his daily
prayers and curtail his driving.
He's now insured under Medicaid,

34:49.554 --> 34:52.757
but most of the specialists he
needs to see are an hour away.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.260
ALESSANDRO GONZALES GOMEZ,
Medicaid Patient: On my way over
there, I didn't feel well at

34:55.260 --> 34:58.463
all. I all of a sudden started
getting dizzy again, so I turned
and around just went and

34:58.463 --> 35:02.634
told them, and I can't
do this. It's too far.

35:02.634 --> 35:09.841
And I even asked for the
director of the clinic,
explained my problems. And she
told me that

35:09.841 --> 35:14.112
that's the way it worked out,
that there were only certain
doctors that would contract with

35:14.112 --> 35:14.813
them.

35:14.813 --> 35:15.580
ALESSANDRO GONZALES
GOMEZ: Doctor.

35:15.580 --> 35:16.681
DR. TED MAZER, San
Diego: How you doing?

35:16.681 --> 35:16.982
ALESSANDRO GONZALES GOMEZ: OK.

35:16.982 --> 35:17.716
(CROSSTALK)

35:17.716 --> 35:18.984
DR. TED MAZER: Pull you
up a chair right here.

35:18.984 --> 35:20.585
ALESSANDRO GONZALES GOMEZ: OK.

35:20.585 --> 35:24.789
SARAH VARNEY: One of the doctors
he has managed to reach is Ted
Mazer. Mazer is one of the

35:24.789 --> 35:30.195
few ears, nose, and throat
surgeons in San Diego County who
accepts Medicaid. He says

35:30.195 --> 35:34.032
the state isn't paying
specialists enough to cover
their costs.

35:34.032 --> 35:37.102
DR. TED MAZER: Certain
surgeries, I can be out of the
office for two hours, and we
might

35:37.102 --> 35:40.739
get $300. My overhead is more
than that. So, that's a loss.

35:40.739 --> 35:45.210
SARAH VARNEY: Dr. Mazer sees
only a limited number of
Medicaid patients, but he often

35:45.210 --> 35:48.213
degrees to treat those like
Qadir Koshna (ph), a 19-year-old
in need of a complicated nose

35:48.213 --> 35:49.247
surgery.

35:49.247 --> 35:51.649
MAN: OK. Lay your
head back for me.

35:51.649 --> 35:54.285
SARAH VARNEY: But Mazer says the
state is failing to guarantee
access to this type of

35:54.285 --> 35:57.222
care for all Medicaid patients.

35:57.222 --> 36:00.759
DR. TED MAZER: If it was
working, I wouldn't have
patients coming here from
Oceanside and

36:00.759 --> 36:03.261
Fallbrook and from the Mexican
border and the Imperial County
area and the Riverside

36:03.261 --> 36:06.564
border. I'm one office.

36:06.564 --> 36:10.168
Why am I seeing all of those
people? Because nobody else is
available in their communities

36:10.168 --> 36:14.372
to see them. Why not? Because
the rates are unacceptable, the
hassles from the managed

36:14.372 --> 36:18.443
care plans, as well as the
state, are unacceptable to most
offices to deal with.

36:18.443 --> 36:22.814
SARAH VARNEY: The complaints
extend beyond San Diego. A
withering state audit released

36:22.814 --> 36:27.085
this summer found that
regulators couldn't verify if
health plans had enough doctors

36:27.085 --> 36:32.257
in their Medicaid networks or if
the distances patients had to
drive were unreasonable.

36:32.257 --> 36:36.461
The state's call centers were
overwhelmed with phone
representatives answering just

36:36.461 --> 36:41.966
half of all calls. And too
often, those obstacles have
forced patients to seek help in
expensive

36:41.966 --> 36:47.772
emergency rooms. In a recent
national survey, three out of
four E.R. physicians said
patient

36:47.772 --> 36:51.876
volume had increased, a pressing
concern the Medicaid expansion
was meant to address.

36:51.876 --> 36:52.010
DR. CHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI,
Medical Director, U.C. San Diego
Emergency Department: There's

36:52.010 --> 36:55.513
a lot of people here
with chronic back pain.

36:55.513 --> 37:00.285
SARAH VARNEY: Dr. Christian
Tomaszewski, the medical
director of U.C. San Diego's
Emergency

37:00.285 --> 37:04.289
Department, says E.R. visits
have increased 11 percent since
the Medicaid expansion.

37:04.289 --> 37:07.826
DR. CHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: A lot
of these patients, what we're
also noticing, are coming

37:07.826 --> 37:14.632
here looking for subspecialty
care. They need an orthopedist
for a complicated fracture.

37:14.632 --> 37:21.306
They might need a head and neck
doctor for some complicated
throat problem. And they're

37:21.306 --> 37:25.543
using the emergency department
as a gateway to have access to
that kind of care.

37:25.543 --> 37:30.415
SARAH VARNEY: At nearby Scripps
Mercy Hospital, visits by new
Medicaid patients are up 30

37:30.415 --> 37:34.786
percent due to the health law,
says Dr. Davis Cracroft, the
hospital's medical director.

37:34.786 --> 37:39.390
Dr. DAVIS CRACROFT, Scripps
Mercy Hospital: They have
insurance, they come for care,
but

37:39.390 --> 37:44.162
the overall goal is to get them
into a primary care doctor's
office or get them the specialty

37:44.162 --> 37:48.666
care that they need, and
oftentimes that's difficult for
them to achieve.

37:48.666 --> 37:49.634
JENNIFER KENT, Director,
California Department of Health
Care Services: We're committed
to

37:49.634 --> 37:52.770
having the conversation with you
about how it needs to be spent.

37:52.770 --> 37:57.108
SARAH VARNEY: California's
Medicaid program is a budgetary
behemoth that falls to Jennifer

37:57.108 --> 38:01.412
Kent to manage. She's the
California Department of Health
Care services director.

38:01.412 --> 38:04.482
JENNIFER KENT: There's
definitely growing pains as the
system broadly has to stretch

38:04.482 --> 38:07.685
to accommodate the
influx of enrollees.

38:07.685 --> 38:12.290
SARAH VARNEY: Kent says the
state is fixing its phone system
and looks closely at complaints,

38:12.290 --> 38:15.894
but that problems with physician
access are isolated and are
being addressed.

38:15.894 --> 38:19.264
JENNIFER KENT: We are
struggling, just as every other
state is, in terms of, how do

38:19.264 --> 38:23.835
we bring people into California,
how do we grow primary care
providers, and then, more

38:23.835 --> 38:26.371
importantly, how do we provide
specialists in areas where there
may not be specialists

38:26.371 --> 38:28.673
today?

38:28.673 --> 38:33.611
SARAH VARNEY: California's
governor, Democrat Jerry Brown,
has championed the Medicaid
expansion,

38:33.611 --> 38:37.015
but like other governors, he's
leery of paying physicians more
money just as the state
confronts

38:37.015 --> 38:39.751
a drop in federal aid.

38:39.751 --> 38:45.089
The federal government is
currently paying for the entire
Medicaid expansion, but, in

38:45.089 --> 38:52.096
2020, federal drops to 90
percent. Instead, he wants the
state to spend its money
revamping

38:52.096 --> 38:57.235
a system to better serve
low-income patients, who are
often sicker and can be hard to
reach.

38:57.235 --> 39:03.741
Despite the challenges, there is
evidence progress is being made.
A recent survey found

39:03.741 --> 39:07.612
that in states that expanded
Medicaid, 93 percent of new
enrollees are satisfied with

39:07.612 --> 39:10.848
their coverage.

39:10.848 --> 39:15.253
Alessandro Gonzales Gomez says
he will continue the long drives
across the county...

39:15.253 --> 39:18.723
ALESSANDRO GONZALES GOMEZ: Next
week, I have to go to La Jolla.

39:18.723 --> 39:21.559
SARAH VARNEY: ... because his
Medicaid card has opened up
doors, even if those doors are

39:21.559 --> 39:24.128
often difficult to reach.

39:24.128 --> 39:31.436
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Sarah Varney in San Diego.

39:31.436 --> 39:42.647
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we look at a
second health story, one about
childhood obesity, the role

39:42.647 --> 39:47.919
of sugary drinks in fueling the
epidemic and corporate
influence.

39:47.919 --> 39:53.091
A series of reports is putting a
fresh spotlight on the spending
and role of Coca-Cola, a company

39:53.091 --> 39:55.994
that's known for its
sweet products.

39:55.994 --> 39:59.030
Hari Sreenivasan has more
from our New York studios.

39:59.030 --> 40:03.534
HARI SREENIVASAN: Coke is the
world's largest producer of
sugary beverages, so you might

40:03.534 --> 40:08.840
not think the American Academy
of Pediatrics would partner with
the company. But that had

40:08.840 --> 40:13.711
indeed been the case until this
week. It was a main sponsor of
the academy's Web site,

40:13.711 --> 40:18.783
healthychildren.org, and a past
sponsor of the group's national
conference.

40:18.783 --> 40:24.122
It's provided over $100 million
in financial support to other
professional medical and

40:24.122 --> 40:28.826
health groups as well. The
Academy is now ending its
relationship with Coke. And it

40:28.826 --> 40:32.597
comes after a recent story in
The New York Times laid out how
the company has paid for

40:32.597 --> 40:37.101
scientific research that plays
down the role of soda in
obesity.

40:37.101 --> 40:40.638
Anahad O'Connor has been working
on these stories, joins me now.

40:40.638 --> 40:43.641
So, I guess the first story --
or the most recent story first,
what's the connection

40:43.641 --> 40:46.644
between Coke and the
Academy of Pediatrics?

40:46.644 --> 40:50.815
ANAHAD O'CONNOR, The New York
Times: So, the first story I did
was looking at Coke's -- the

40:50.815 --> 40:54.085
money that they were paying a
lot of researchers and
institutions to do research
that, you

40:54.085 --> 40:58.556
know, was downplaying the role
of sugary drinks in obesity.

40:58.556 --> 41:03.761
And in response to that story,
the CEO of Coca-Cola said, we're
not trying to deceive

41:03.761 --> 41:08.232
the public. We're trying to work
with institutions to promote
active healthy living, and we
are

41:08.232 --> 41:12.570
going to release all of the
funding that we provided to
scientists, universities, to
health

41:12.570 --> 41:15.239
groups over the past five years.

41:15.239 --> 41:23.247
And so they released a trove of
data showing this extensive
number of grants. And in that

41:23.247 --> 41:27.218
data, we saw that the American
Academy of Pediatrics was in
there, and Coke had provided

41:27.218 --> 41:31.089
something like $3 million to the
Academy, at least over the past
five years.

41:31.089 --> 41:33.091
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how
do the pediatricians feel?

41:33.091 --> 41:38.062
ANAHAD O'CONNOR: So, the actual
members of the Academy -- and
there's more than 64,000

41:38.062 --> 41:41.933
pediatricians who are part of
this Academy -- it's very
prestigious -- a lot of them

41:41.933 --> 41:46.170
are very upset. When I spoke to
them, they said they couldn't
believe that the Academy

41:46.170 --> 41:51.275
had partnered with Coke or
worked with it to any extent,
because sugary drinks are
considered

41:51.275 --> 41:57.015
a very major factor in the
obesity epidemic, especially
among children.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.985
These pediatricians see the
effects of it firsthand. They
see type 2 diabetes,
hypertension.

42:00.985 --> 42:06.157
You know, all these diseases
that used to occur in middle age
and later in life, they

42:06.157 --> 42:10.728
see them in children now. And
they think that sugary drinks
are a primary influence of that.

42:10.728 --> 42:13.798
So, pediatricians
were very upset.

42:13.798 --> 42:16.768
HARI SREENIVASAN: And yet they
are -- here they are at a
conference, and they're carrying

42:16.768 --> 42:19.404
around bags that have Coke in it
while they're trying to tell
their patients don't feed your

42:19.404 --> 42:21.606
kids sugary drinks.

42:21.606 --> 42:26.844
ANAHAD O'CONNOR: Yes, so some
pediatricians said it was
analogous to, you know, a major

42:26.844 --> 42:31.883
lung association group or
university partnering with, you
know, the tobacco industry. It
just

42:31.883 --> 42:34.252
was completely contradictory.

42:34.252 --> 42:37.688
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what's the
correlation? Is there influence
on academic research? You

42:37.688 --> 42:40.224
point to a case in Louisiana.

42:40.224 --> 42:44.829
ANAHAD O'CONNOR: So there was a
case in Louisiana at the
Pennington Biomedical Center at
Louisiana

42:44.829 --> 42:48.232
State University.

42:48.232 --> 42:52.270
They actually were one of the
largest recipients of Coke
money. They took something like
$7

42:52.270 --> 42:59.110
million over the past five
years. And they just recently
released the results of a major

42:59.110 --> 43:05.883
worldwide study that looked at
obesity in children and the
major factors of the epidemic.

43:05.883 --> 43:11.088
And they found that some of the
major causes were a lack of
sleep, a lack of exercise,

43:11.088 --> 43:13.124
television

43:13.124 --> 43:18.963
The one thing they didn't
mention was sugary drinks. And
that seemed very striking,
because

43:18.963 --> 43:23.000
you look at other independent
research, and it's all pointing
to sugary drinks. But the

43:23.000 --> 43:27.672
universities and institutions
that are taking Coke money, many
of them are, you know, seeming

43:27.672 --> 43:32.543
to exclude sugary drinks from,
you know, the obesity epidemic.

43:32.543 --> 43:36.247
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how
singular is Coke in this? I
mean, in the past, there have
been

43:36.247 --> 43:42.487
companies, industries, lobbying
efforts on Capitol Hill.
Certainly, that still happens.

43:42.487 --> 43:45.223
Are there other food companies
or beverage companies that are
trying this?

43:45.223 --> 43:50.194
ANAHAD O'CONNOR: So, Coke is
certainly part of several
lobbying and trade groups where

43:50.194 --> 43:56.767
-- that are -- also include
other large corporations and
food and industry players.

43:56.767 --> 44:01.172
But Coca-Cola really seemed to
have been out front on this. I
talked to one expert, Marion

44:01.172 --> 44:05.843
Nestle at NYU, who wrote a book
called "Soda Politics" and
studies the beverage industry

44:05.843 --> 44:09.347
and the food industry, and she
said that she had never seen
another corporation that had

44:09.347 --> 44:12.650
such a hand in so many
public institutions.

44:12.650 --> 44:17.321
You know, Coke has partnered
with all of these academic and
medical groups. They have
partnered

44:17.321 --> 44:23.728
with the Boys and Girls Club.
They have partnered with
minority groups like the NAACP
and the

44:23.728 --> 44:28.266
Hispanic Federation. And, you
know, they're winning loyalty
and allies.

44:28.266 --> 44:32.870
So, for example, when Michael
Bloomberg, you know, tried to
introduce his, you know, soda

44:32.870 --> 44:39.977
cap and restrictions in 2012,
the beverage industry, supported
by Coke, filed a lawsuit

44:39.977 --> 44:44.849
against Michael Bloomberg, and
the NAACP and the Hispanic
Federation actually filed amicus

44:44.849 --> 44:49.020
briefs supporting the beverage
industry against Bloomberg.

44:49.020 --> 44:56.193
And that was very shocking,
because the minority communities
have a disproportionately high

44:56.193 --> 45:01.899
prevalence of obesity, and, you
know, they seemed to be able to
benefit the most from

45:01.899 --> 45:06.003
soda restrictions. And yet these
groups were siding with
industry.

45:06.003 --> 45:12.209
HARI SREENIVASAN: Anahad
O'Connor of The New York Times,
thanks so much for joining us.

45:12.209 --> 45:18.215
ANAHAD O'CONNOR: Thank
you for having me.

45:18.215 --> 45:24.355
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another
installment in our ongoing
series Race Matters.

45:24.355 --> 45:28.292
This year, a record number of
African-American actors won Emmy
Awards for outstanding
performances

45:28.292 --> 45:31.262
on television.

45:31.262 --> 45:35.199
Special correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault explores why what
we are seeing on television

45:35.199 --> 45:38.135
is finally becoming
more diverse.

45:38.135 --> 45:43.007
MAN: Viola Davis, "How to
Get Away With Murder."

45:43.007 --> 45:46.677
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Viola
Davis won an Emmy for
outstanding lead actress in a
drama

45:46.677 --> 45:53.117
series last week, she made
history as the first black woman
to win in that category.

45:53.117 --> 45:57.421
And she called on a history that
dates back to the 1800s with
words spoken by the abolitionist

45:57.421 --> 46:00.091
Harriet Tubman.

46:00.091 --> 46:09.233
VIOLA DAVIS, Actress: In my
mind, I see a line, and over
that line, I see green fields

46:09.233 --> 46:17.441
and lovely flowers and beautiful
white women with their arms
stretched out to me over that

46:17.441 --> 46:24.115
line. But I can't seem to get
there no how. I can't seem to
get over that line.

46:24.115 --> 46:28.753
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But
Davis was using Tubman's words
to illustrate lack of
opportunities

46:28.753 --> 46:32.790
in the movie industry for
African-American women today,
saying:

46:32.790 --> 46:38.195
VIOLA DAVIS: You cannot win an
Emmy for roles that are simply
not there.

46:38.195 --> 46:42.166
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: To
pursue that further, we met up
with a man who's been involved
in

46:42.166 --> 46:48.205
looking at just that issue over
time. He's Darnell Hunt, chair
of the department of sociology

46:48.205 --> 46:53.177
at UCLA, and the head of its
Ralph Bunche Center for
African-American Studies.

46:53.177 --> 46:55.479
Professor Darnell Hunt,
thank you for joining us.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.214
DARNELL HUNT, Chair, Department
of Sociology, UCLA: I'm glad to
be here.

46:57.214 --> 47:01.218
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: The
other night at the Emmy Awards,
Viola Davis seems to have

47:01.218 --> 47:04.655
really struck a nerve, which
coincides, incidentally, with
the research you have been
doing.

47:04.655 --> 47:06.157
DARNELL HUNT: Yes.

47:06.157 --> 47:08.626
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Tell us
a little bit about what she had
to say and how that resonated

47:08.626 --> 47:10.895
with your studies.

47:10.895 --> 47:15.433
DARNELL HUNT: Well, you know, I
think that Viola made a really
important point. It's

47:15.433 --> 47:19.236
hard to win awards if there are
no roles, you know? And that's
been the history.

47:19.236 --> 47:23.107
It's an industry that's been
dominated by white men for
generations. And, unfortunately,

47:23.107 --> 47:26.777
it's woefully out of step with
where America is going. I mean,
we're almost 40 percent

47:26.777 --> 47:30.114
minority right now, and clearly
a little bit more than 50
percent female.

47:30.114 --> 47:35.419
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
aside from the basic fairness --
and that's a huge one, obviously

47:35.419 --> 47:41.225
-- but what else is wrong with
the kinds of equations that you
have spelled out?

47:41.225 --> 47:44.495
DARNELL HUNT: On the one hand,
there's the question of
employment. You know, it's just

47:44.495 --> 47:49.200
unfair that talent of color
aren't given the same
opportunities as white and male
actors,

47:49.200 --> 47:52.503
directors, producers,
writers, et cetera.

47:52.503 --> 47:57.374
But, more importantly, as a
sociologist, I'm interested in
the impact on society. So, when

47:57.374 --> 48:02.179
we talk about representations,
meaning the images that
circulate, if you don't have
diversity

48:02.179 --> 48:06.050
in the media, it's not likely
that you're going to generate
and circulate the types

48:06.050 --> 48:10.888
of images that are healthy in
a diverse democratic society.

48:10.888 --> 48:16.994
The more we see images that
reproduce this notion that white
men are in charge, the more

48:16.994 --> 48:21.866
we start to normalize that idea,
and it becomes hard for people
of color, particularly youth,

48:21.866 --> 48:26.103
to think about the possibilities
that are there before them, to
aspire to certain types

48:26.103 --> 48:29.673
of careers if they tonight see
those role models reflected in
the media.

48:29.673 --> 48:34.245
At the same time, we also know
that people learn a lot about
what they think they know

48:34.245 --> 48:39.416
about other people from what
they see in the media. If they
see certain types of images

48:39.416 --> 48:44.455
reproduced over and over again
for other groups that limit them
to narrow types of roles and

48:44.455 --> 48:48.893
portrayals, they start to take
those prejudices into their
interactions with those people

48:48.893 --> 48:51.562
in real society, and that
creates all kinds of
discriminatory problems.

48:51.562 --> 48:55.432
I mean, right now, we're
grappling with racial profiling.
All these fears about young
black

48:55.432 --> 48:58.068
men in some ways are related to
types of images that have
circulated about young black men

48:58.068 --> 49:00.337
throughout our history.

49:00.337 --> 49:04.608
So, from the very beginning, we
designed our study to look at
the relationship between

49:04.608 --> 49:08.779
diversity and the bottom line,
since that's what the industry
is. It's about making money.

49:08.779 --> 49:13.851
TV shows that roughly reflect
the diversity of American
society, that is, between 30
percent

49:13.851 --> 49:18.155
and 40 percent diverse on the
screen, on average, had the
highest ratings.

49:18.155 --> 49:20.891
And that was like a clarion call
for a lot of people in the
industry who had no idea,

49:20.891 --> 49:23.494
because there are so few
shows that are that diverse.

49:23.494 --> 49:25.563
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You did
something concrete to help
change that. Tell us a little

49:25.563 --> 49:27.832
bit about that.

49:27.832 --> 49:32.369
DARNELL HUNT: Well, the first
thing we did was, when we
conceived of the study, we
decided

49:32.369 --> 49:35.606
we were going to go to the
industry directly for support.

49:35.606 --> 49:40.344
Our rationale was that if we
went directly to the industry
for support, they would be

49:40.344 --> 49:44.014
forced, if they supported the
study, to read it. You know,
it's quite as simple as that.

49:44.014 --> 49:45.783
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Excuse
me. Who are you talking to?

49:45.783 --> 49:47.852
DARNELL HUNT: Well, we're
talking to people in the
industry directly. We're talking
to...

49:47.852 --> 49:49.987
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Behind-the-camera people?

49:49.987 --> 49:53.123
DARNELL HUNT: Well, the people
who make the decisions. We're
talking to the people who

49:53.123 --> 49:57.661
make up the executive suites
that are about 94 percent white
and 100 percent male if you

49:57.661 --> 50:01.899
look at the major Hollywood
studios, 94 percent white and 86
percent male if you look at the

50:01.899 --> 50:04.501
television networks.

50:04.501 --> 50:08.005
We're talking about an industry
that is heavily controlled by
white men. So, we're talking

50:08.005 --> 50:10.841
to them. We're telling them
what's wrong with this picture.

50:10.841 --> 50:13.777
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And what
kind of reaction are you
getting?

50:13.777 --> 50:18.182
DARNELL HUNT: Well, you know,
for years, people would say,
yes, diversity is a great thing,

50:18.182 --> 50:21.185
but they thought of it as a
luxury, something that we will
get around to at some point.

50:21.185 --> 50:24.355
But when you start connecting
diversity to the bottom line, to
the dollars, to shareholder

50:24.355 --> 50:27.358
value, suddenly, it becomes
more of an imperative.

50:27.358 --> 50:34.531
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How do
you think this is going to
impact the racial discourse that

50:34.531 --> 50:39.270
we have in this country now,
which is really very difficult
and often very toxic?

50:39.270 --> 50:42.907
DARNELL HUNT: Yes,
yes. Yes, I agree.

50:42.907 --> 50:48.412
And where we are right now with
race is very difficult. I mean,
it's sort of a period of

50:48.412 --> 50:54.385
contradictions. I mean, we have
an African-American president.
And that has created the
illusion

50:54.385 --> 50:57.788
for a number of people that
we're beyond race, that race
doesn't matter anymore. And yet

50:57.788 --> 51:02.760
we have all these high-profile
cases around the country of
racial profiling, of vigilantism

51:02.760 --> 51:06.230
and so forth and so on and
that's rooted in race, racial
hate crimes, et cetera, et
cetera,

51:06.230 --> 51:08.632
et cetera.

51:08.632 --> 51:15.306
Race is a core reality of
American experience. Media
images on television need to
reflect

51:15.306 --> 51:22.546
that reality to help people who
consume media and who don't have
the day-to-day, face-to-face

51:22.546 --> 51:27.851
contact with others, or where
that contact is minimal, to help
them have a greater appreciation

51:27.851 --> 51:31.488
of other experiences and how
they're all part of the American
fabric.

51:31.488 --> 51:35.292
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So
that's your solution, more
diversity. And how long do you
think

51:35.292 --> 51:39.763
it's going to take? And how do
you see it happening? What is
the solution?

51:39.763 --> 51:41.732
DARNELL HUNT: I don't believe
that there's a silver bullet,
that if you just do this

51:41.732 --> 51:44.735
one thing, you solve the
problems of the world.

51:44.735 --> 51:50.207
I think that it will require
lots of interventions on lots of
fronts. I think there needs to

51:50.207 --> 51:56.046
be continuing public pressure to
demand the types of diversity on
screen that are reflective

51:56.046 --> 52:00.584
of American diversity.

52:00.584 --> 52:05.089
People in the industry
themselves, that is to say,
those who are in charge, need to
get

52:05.089 --> 52:11.362
the memo and recognize that the
bottom line also is going to be
increasingly dependent

52:11.362 --> 52:16.233
upon diversity. And I think that
you need more diverse voices in
the writers room. You

52:16.233 --> 52:22.606
need more diverse voices
pitching TV ideas, movie ideas.
And the stories themselves, not

52:22.606 --> 52:25.676
just the characters in the
story, but the stories need to
be more diverse, and from

52:25.676 --> 52:28.379
the perspective of
other types of people.

52:28.379 --> 52:32.950
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You have
sat down with industry
executives. Were they receptive

52:32.950 --> 52:36.387
to your positions that they
needed to be more diverse?

52:36.387 --> 52:38.889
DARNELL HUNT: Absolutely.

52:38.889 --> 52:45.429
We're getting really strong
acceptance of our study among
major decision-makers in the

52:45.429 --> 52:49.767
industry. In fact, a number of
them, a number of major studios
and networks, have already

52:49.767 --> 52:53.037
signed on as financial
sponsors of our study.

52:53.037 --> 52:57.274
And we're really careful to
diversify that group, because we
want to maintain our
independence

52:57.274 --> 53:02.212
and our objectivity as
researchers. But, nonetheless,
we think it's valuable to have
them as stakeholders

53:02.212 --> 53:05.015
in the process, because they're
likely to use the results.

53:05.015 --> 53:09.586
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Well,
Professor Darnell Hunt, thank
you.

53:09.586 --> 53:15.959
DARNELL HUNT: Thank you.

53:15.959 --> 53:20.998
JUDY WOODRUFF: That brings us to
our "NewsHour" Shares of the
day, something that caught our

53:20.998 --> 53:24.468
eye which might be of
interest to you, too.

53:24.468 --> 53:29.740
We have two events of note this
evening. The first comes from
East China, where a massive

53:29.740 --> 53:36.146
so-called tidal bore pushed up
the Qiantang River today.
Thousands watched as the leading

53:36.146 --> 53:42.953
edge of the incoming tide roared
in, crashing into riverbanks and
dams along the way. It

53:42.953 --> 53:48.292
was the largest tidal bore in
the area in 10 years and was
caused by high tides linked

53:48.292 --> 53:53.497
to the same lunar cycle that
brought us Sunday's blood moon.

53:53.497 --> 53:59.369
And a new world record was set
in the skies of Southern
California yesterday afternoon.

53:59.369 --> 54:06.877
For a brief moment, 202
skydivers from 30 different
countries gripped each other's
hands,

54:06.877 --> 54:14.618
arms and legs while 10,000 feet
up in the air. By forming not
one, but two massive human

54:14.618 --> 54:21.125
snowflakes, the skydivers
created the largest aerial
sequential formation of all
time. The

54:21.125 --> 54:25.162
accomplishment smashed the
old record of 117 people.

54:25.162 --> 54:28.232
I'm glad there's somebody out
there willing to do that.

54:28.232 --> 54:31.535
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:31.535 --> 54:35.038
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow evening. For all
of us at the "PBS NewsHour,"

54:35.038 --> 54:35.005
thank you, and good night.
