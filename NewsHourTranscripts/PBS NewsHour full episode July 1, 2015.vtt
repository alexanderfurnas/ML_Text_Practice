WEBVTT

00:11.545 --> 00:16.583
JUDY WOODRUFF: A wave of deadly
attacks by Islamic State
militants puts Egypt on edge.

00:16.583 --> 00:21.488
Good evening. I'm Judy
Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is away.

00:21.488 --> 00:27.160
Also ahead this Wednesday: From
health care to marriage, a
historic term for the Supreme

00:27.160 --> 00:31.798
Court comes to a close. We talk
with President Obama's point
person on health care, Secretary

00:31.798 --> 00:35.269
Sylvia Burwell, and review
the high court's year.

00:35.269 --> 00:39.706
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal": We saw in many of the
big cases this term

00:39.706 --> 00:43.644
that the justices on the right
don't march in lockstep when it
comes to interpreting

00:43.644 --> 00:45.646
the Constitution.

00:45.646 --> 00:50.550
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, teaching
for the whole brain -- educators
harness discoveries in

00:50.550 --> 00:54.321
neuroscience to improve
how students learn.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.623
JASSELLE CIRINO, Teacher,
Francis Scott Key Elementary:
We like to say that the more

00:56.623 --> 01:02.262
you talk, the more students you
lose, and so we use different
methods to engage multiple

01:02.262 --> 01:06.967
parts of the brain. And that
way, you get 100 percent
engagement.

01:06.967 --> 01:11.972
JUDY WOODRUFF: And exploring
the mysteries of Ceres, a dwarf
planet that hangs out in

01:11.972 --> 01:15.108
the asteroid belt.

01:15.108 --> 01:16.810
Those are some of the stories
we're covering on tonight's "PBS
NewsHour."

01:16.810 --> 01:18.645
(BREAK)

01:18.645 --> 01:23.450
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Justice
Department has launched an
investigation of major airlines

01:23.450 --> 01:28.922
and possible collusion to keep
fares higher. The department
confirmed the probe after

01:28.922 --> 01:34.494
the Associated Press reported it
focuses on whether carriers have
limited available seats.

01:34.494 --> 01:39.299
American Airlines, Delta,
Southwest and United now control
more than 80 percent of

01:39.299 --> 01:42.703
all seats on domestic flights.

01:42.703 --> 01:48.508
The United States and Cuba will
reopen their embassies in each
other's countries, in Havana

01:48.508 --> 01:54.014
and Washington, later this month
for the first time in more than
50 years. President Obama

01:54.014 --> 01:57.384
made the formal announcement
this morning in the White House
Rose Garden. He said

01:57.384 --> 02:00.721
both countries are
ready to move forward.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.657
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: Instead of
supporting democracy and
opportunity

02:03.657 --> 02:08.829
for the Cuban people, our
efforts to isolate Cuba, despite
good intentions, increasingly

02:08.829 --> 02:12.199
had the opposite effect,
cementing the status quo and
isolating the United States from
our

02:12.199 --> 02:16.503
neighbors in this hemisphere.

02:16.503 --> 02:20.140
The progress that we mark today
is yet another demonstration
that we don't have to be
imprisoned

02:20.140 --> 02:25.112
by the past. When something
isn't working, we can and will
change.

02:25.112 --> 02:28.348
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of
State John Kerry will travel to
Cuba for the American Embassy's

02:28.348 --> 02:32.386
opening on July 20.

02:32.386 --> 02:37.691
Secretary Kerry is in Vienna now
for the Iran nuclear talks. He
said today there's been

02:37.691 --> 02:43.630
enough progress to go beyond
yesterday's deadline. His
Iranian counterpart, Mohammad
Javad

02:43.630 --> 02:49.236
Zarif, also talked of progress,
but he offered few details.

02:49.236 --> 02:54.207
Investigators converged on a
small South Carolina town today,
after the latest in a series of

02:54.207 --> 03:01.548
fires at black churches across
the south. Mount Zion AME
Church at Greeleyville burned

03:01.548 --> 03:06.853
last night. The fire broke out
as lightning was moving across
the area, and federal
investigators

03:06.853 --> 03:11.258
said initial indications suggest
it wasn't arson. But they're
not ready to make that

03:11.258 --> 03:13.226
official.

03:13.226 --> 03:16.963
CRAIG CHILCOTT, ATF: We haven't
ruled anything in or anything
out at this point. We're

03:16.963 --> 03:22.502
going to let the case dictate
and we're going to investigate
it, as the facts will ultimately

03:22.502 --> 03:26.573
determine what occurred. We're
going to bring all the assets of
the federal government

03:26.573 --> 03:30.544
to bear to investigate
this -- this fire.

03:30.544 --> 03:34.247
JUDY WOODRUFF: The same church
was the target of a fire set by
two Ku Klux Klan members

03:34.247 --> 03:38.385
in 1995.

03:38.385 --> 03:43.523
The presidential fund-raising
race has begun in earnest.
Democrat Hillary Clinton's
campaign

03:43.523 --> 03:49.663
said today that it took in more
than $45 million in the second
quarter. That eclipses a record

03:49.663 --> 03:56.703
set by President Obama in 2011.
Clinton formally announced her
bid in April.

03:56.703 --> 04:01.842
The president's residence is
making itself more welcoming to
some visitors and more hostile

04:01.842 --> 04:08.415
to others. Officials today
ended a 40-year ban on
photography during public tours
of

04:08.415 --> 04:14.788
the White House by encouraging
people to snap pictures. But
selfie sticks and video cameras

04:14.788 --> 04:20.660
remain on the banned list.
Meanwhile, outside the executive
mansion, work crews added sharp

04:20.660 --> 04:26.900
metal spikes to the fencing to
stop intruders. That follows
several security breaches.

04:26.900 --> 04:33.273
Thousands of people marched in
Hong Kong today, pressing the
city's leader to step down, and

04:33.273 --> 04:39.012
calling for full democracy. The
annual protest marks the city's
handover from British to

04:39.012 --> 04:46.186
Chinese rule in 1997. Last
year, pro-democracy forces
blocked streets for 79 days,
demanding

04:46.186 --> 04:48.688
reforms.

04:48.688 --> 04:54.761
In Indonesia, the death toll
passed 140 in the crash of a
military transport plane. The

04:54.761 --> 04:59.900
plane went down Tuesday, after
taking off from Medan city. By
today, an excavator

04:59.900 --> 05:03.703
began clearing away what's
left of the wreckage.

05:03.703 --> 05:07.841
LT. COL. MOHAMAD RIDWAN,
Indonesian Army (through
translator): Today, we have
completed the

05:07.841 --> 05:12.646
evacuation of the bodies. We
hope that the evacuation of the
aircraft's tail can be completed

05:12.646 --> 05:15.415
as soon as possible. Our
constraint is the lack of
equipment we need for cutting to
quickly

05:15.415 --> 05:18.051
move the wreckage.

05:18.051 --> 05:22.889
JUDY WOODRUFF: Investigators
are now focused on why the plane
had far more passengers than

05:22.889 --> 05:27.327
first believed. Civilians
apparently were permitted on
board for a fee, in violation

05:27.327 --> 05:30.730
of military rules.

05:30.730 --> 05:35.869
The wave of migrants crossing
the Mediterranean has grown more
than 80 percent from a year

05:35.869 --> 05:43.343
ago. The United Nations Refugee
Agency reported today that
137,000 refugees have landed in

05:43.343 --> 05:49.115
Europe since January. That far
outstrips the 75,000 who made
the crossing in the first

05:49.115 --> 05:55.455
half of 2014. Greece is now the
leading destination for the
migrants.

05:55.455 --> 06:00.594
In economic news, Wall Street
pushed higher, anticipating that
the June jobs report due

06:00.594 --> 06:05.565
tomorrow will be stronger than
expected. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained nearly

06:05.565 --> 06:16.142
140 points to close near 17760.
The Nasdaq rose 26 points and
the S&P 500 added 14.

06:16.142 --> 06:22.382
U.S. soccer fans celebrated
today, after the women's
national team reached the World
Cup

06:22.382 --> 06:28.188
final. The Americans beat
Germany 2-0 in last night's
semifinal in Montreal. They

06:28.188 --> 06:33.960
will play either Japan or
England in Sunday's title match.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.032
And the man known as Britain's
Schindler for saving Jewish
children from the Nazis has

06:39.032 --> 06:47.807
died. In 1939, Nicholas Winton
managed to get more than 650
children on trains out of

06:47.807 --> 06:54.781
Czechoslovakia, just before
World War II broke out.
Nicholas Winton was 106 years
old.

06:54.781 --> 07:00.420
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Islamic State militants wage
coordinated attacks on troops

07:00.420 --> 07:06.660
stationed in Egypt's Northern
Sinai; an uncertain future for
Greece in Europe as it heads
toward

07:06.660 --> 07:12.432
a referendum; U.S. Health and
Human Services Secretary Sylvia
Burwell on the future of

07:12.432 --> 07:18.872
health care; analyzing a
historic term for the Supreme
Court; techniques informed by

07:18.872 --> 07:24.878
neuroscience to help students
learn better; uncovering the
mysteries of the dwarf planet

07:24.878 --> 07:41.227
Ceres; and hearing again from
the ballet dancer who is now a
first, Misty Copeland.

07:41.227 --> 07:46.333
Islamic State militants fought
for hours with Egyptian
government troops today in the
Northern

07:46.333 --> 07:51.504
Sinai Peninsula. When it was
over, 100 militants and more
than 60 soldiers had reportedly
been

07:51.504 --> 07:53.606
killed.

07:53.606 --> 07:58.078
The lengthy battle began after
the Islamic State forces
launched a massive coordinated

07:58.078 --> 08:01.581
assault on army and
police positions.

08:01.581 --> 08:07.754
For more on this, I spoke with
Reuters correspondent Yara
Bayoumy in Cairo.

08:07.754 --> 08:11.024
Yara Bayoumy, thank you
for talking with us.

08:11.024 --> 08:14.094
First of all, tell us what
happened in the Northern Sinai.

08:14.094 --> 08:18.798
YARA BAYOUMY, Reuters:
Well, it started

08:18.798 --> 08:23.403
out really early this morning
when we heard that there were a
number of attacks on military

08:23.403 --> 08:29.142
checkpoints in North Sinai
by a number of militants.

08:29.142 --> 08:35.148
That happens often, actually,
because North Sinai is the
epicenter of an insurgency here

08:35.148 --> 08:42.522
in Egypt. But it quickly
escalated, and we saw that it
was a very widespread,
coordinated

08:42.522 --> 08:48.828
assault on a number of military
checkpoints in Northern Sinai by
militants. And actually

08:48.828 --> 08:53.767
Islamic State's Egypt's
affiliate claimed responsibility
for those attacks.

08:53.767 --> 08:59.706
We had security forces that did
tell us that the intention of
the militants was to basically

08:59.706 --> 09:04.110
lay siege to one of the town of
Sheikh Zuweid, which is one of
the most (INAUDIBLE) towns

09:04.110 --> 09:10.216
in North Sinai. And, of course,
this is all part of the
militants' broader campaign

09:10.216 --> 09:15.488
in their attacks against
security forces and their
ultimate aim of wanting or
seeking to

09:15.488 --> 09:17.857
topple the Cairo government.

09:17.857 --> 09:23.163
JUDY WOODRUFF: I read that this
went on for hours and hours.
How well-equipped,

09:23.163 --> 09:26.933
how prepared was the
Egyptian military?

09:26.933 --> 09:33.840
YARA BAYOUMY: Well, the
Egyptian military has been
fighting this insurgency for
over

09:33.840 --> 09:42.849
-- or about two years now. And
it has actually intensified
since the military ousted
Islamic

09:42.849 --> 09:49.289
President Mohammed Morsi of the
Muslim Brotherhood in 2013,
after mass protests against him.

09:49.289 --> 09:56.763
So, the army has been very --
very used to this kind of
warfare, but, of course, the

09:56.763 --> 10:05.672
Egyptian army is a largely
conventional army. And the
enemy that it's confronting is
largely

10:05.672 --> 10:11.010
an enemy that uses guerrilla
warfare tactics in North Sinai,
so ones that really largely

10:11.010 --> 10:15.515
depends on car bombs, IEDs.

10:15.515 --> 10:23.356
And, of course, we can't forget
that these militants operate in
areas that -- some of

10:23.356 --> 10:29.929
which provide havens for them
within the region. And so it's
a very difficult enemy that

10:29.929 --> 10:37.837
they're confronting. In terms
of how they have managed to do,
this was, as I said, a

10:37.837 --> 10:44.611
very sustained -- a very
sustained attack or clash that
happened today.

10:44.611 --> 10:51.684
Most of the times, the militants
tend to launch attacks and then
disappear or melt away into

10:51.684 --> 10:54.988
various neighborhoods within
Northern Sinai, but, this time,
it seems like they really

10:54.988 --> 10:57.957
did put up a fight.

10:57.957 --> 11:01.394
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, just
quickly, these militants are an
affiliate, an offshoot of

11:01.394 --> 11:03.963
Islamic State?

11:03.963 --> 11:08.368
YARA BAYOUMY: Right. So
they're called Sinai Province,
and they have -- you know,

11:08.368 --> 11:12.438
they have pledged allegiance
to Islamic State.

11:12.438 --> 11:18.945
And they very early on claimed
responsibility for these
attacks, saying that they have
launched

11:18.945 --> 11:24.317
attacks on 15 military
checkpoints. They carried out
three -- and there were three

11:24.317 --> 11:31.858
suicide bombings. The army said
that they used car bombs as
well. They did have
anti-aircraft

11:31.858 --> 11:35.929
weaponry as well, so they did
seem to have -- they were very
well-prepared for this assault

11:35.929 --> 11:37.730
that they launched today.

11:37.730 --> 11:40.767
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're
going to have to leave it there.

11:40.767 --> 11:44.871
Yara Bayoumy, thank you for
joining us from Cairo. We
appreciate it.

11:44.871 --> 11:52.145
YARA BAYOUMY: Thank you.

11:52.145 --> 12:00.787
JUDY WOODRUFF: One day after an
historic missed payment to the
International Monetary

12:00.787 --> 12:05.358
Fund, the scene in Greece became
ever more desperate and chaotic,
as European creditors

12:05.358 --> 12:09.262
rebuffed a late request
by the country's leader.

12:09.262 --> 12:14.000
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports from Athens.

12:14.000 --> 12:20.974
MALCOLM BRABANT: Greece's
ceremonial guard symbolizing
national pride marched past the

12:20.974 --> 12:24.611
prime minister's residence, as
Alexis Tsipras blasted his
country's creditors on national

12:24.611 --> 12:26.546
TV.

12:26.546 --> 12:30.750
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greek Prime
Minister (through translator):
I know well that at this hour,

12:30.750 --> 12:35.254
the warning sirens are loud.
They are blackmailing you and
calling on you to vote yes to
all

12:35.254 --> 12:37.757
the measures the creditors are
asking for, without any prospect
of coming out of this

12:37.757 --> 12:39.926
crisis.

12:39.926 --> 12:43.096
MALCOLM BRABANT: Instead,
Tsipras urged a show of defiance
against austerity measures

12:43.096 --> 12:45.365
in Sunday's referendum.

12:45.365 --> 12:51.004
ALEXIS TSIPRAS (through
translator): On the other hand,
a no-vote is not just a slogan.

12:51.004 --> 12:56.142
No is a decisive step towards a
better agreement that we aim to
sign immediately after Sunday's

12:56.142 --> 13:00.346
result. It consists of the
people's clear mandate on how
they want to live the next

13:00.346 --> 13:05.418
day. No doesn't mean clashing
with Europe, but returning to a
Europe of values.

13:05.418 --> 13:11.357
MALCOLM BRABANT: Hours earlier,
Tsipras had sent a letter to
those same creditors,

13:11.357 --> 13:17.230
accepting bailout terms, but
with some conditions. They
included keeping in place a
discounted

13:17.230 --> 13:22.669
sales tax for Greek islands
popular with tourists,
stretching out defense spending
cuts and delaying

13:22.669 --> 13:26.973
the phase-out of an income
supplement for poor pensioners.

13:26.973 --> 13:31.277
But for leaders of the European
Union, it was too little, too
late. The view from

13:31.277 --> 13:36.049
German Chancellor Angela Merkel
reinforced by other European
leaders was no deal before

13:36.049 --> 13:38.384
the referendum.

13:38.384 --> 13:44.357
ANGELA MERKEL, German Chancellor
(through translator): Holding a
referendum is a democratic

13:44.357 --> 13:48.895
sovereign right of the Greek
state. It is the legitimate
right of Greece to do that

13:48.895 --> 13:54.200
whenever they want and about
whatever they want. But to make
it as clear, it is also

13:54.200 --> 13:58.504
a democratic sovereign right of
the other 18 member states of
the Eurozone to respond

13:58.504 --> 14:01.874
to the Greek decision
in a proportionate way.

14:01.874 --> 14:06.112
MALCOLM BRABANT: Meanwhile, for
desperate pensioners in Athens,
it was another long,

14:06.112 --> 14:11.217
frustrating day outside the few
designated banks that opened
their doors to retirees.

14:11.217 --> 14:16.289
Only those whose last names
began with the letters A through
I were served, and even

14:16.289 --> 14:18.324
then, they were given the
equivalent of just $133.

14:18.324 --> 14:19.559
Do you have enough money
to pay these people?

14:19.559 --> 14:23.329
MAN: I don't know.
I don't know.

14:23.329 --> 14:27.900
MALCOLM BRABANT: Some of those
in the line couldn't believe how
far they'd fallen.

14:27.900 --> 14:32.605
MAN (through translator): I
lived abroad for 40 years and I
brought back $1.5 million

14:32.605 --> 14:34.574
back into the country.

14:34.574 --> 14:40.113
MALCOLM BRABANT: And as the day
wore on, tensions built and
tempers flared.

14:40.113 --> 14:45.051
MAN (through translator): Don't
push me around or I will punch
you in the face. Don't

14:45.051 --> 14:48.321
tell me how long you have been
here. I have been here since
3:00 this morning.

14:48.321 --> 14:52.625
MALCOLM BRABANT: The police
were called in to keep order,
and in the end, these pensioners

14:52.625 --> 14:56.062
did get their money, but it's a
scene that will doubtless be
repeated tomorrow with many

14:56.062 --> 14:58.931
people now past all patience.

14:58.931 --> 15:03.970
GIORGOS HAZIDIMITRAKIS, Greece
(through translator): Whether
they give me only 120 euros or
not,

15:03.970 --> 15:07.607
it's the same thing. As far as
I am concerned, they're trying
to fool us.

15:07.607 --> 15:11.210
HARALAMBOS KATIS, Greece
(through translator): The
working class should form a
society

15:11.210 --> 15:15.214
which solves the problems of the
ordinary people and not the
profits of the rich.

15:15.214 --> 15:20.052
MALCOLM BRABANT: All of which
sets the stage for a showdown at
the ballot box.

15:20.052 --> 15:24.924
The call by Prime Minister
Alexis Tsipras to Greeks to vote
no in Sunday's referendum

15:24.924 --> 15:30.029
should not come as a surprise to
the country's European partners.
Tsipras is embroiled,

15:30.029 --> 15:34.300
so he says, in a fight to
restore Greek dignity. But make
no mistake. He's also involved

15:34.300 --> 15:38.004
in a battle to secure his
political future and legacy.

15:38.004 --> 15:42.708
If he loses the referendum, he
will no doubt have to resign and
call a general election.

15:42.708 --> 15:47.246
But, according to the latest
opinion polls, the no-camp is
substantially in the lead with

15:47.246 --> 15:52.051
54 percent support, where the
yes-camp is trailing at 33
percent. Those numbers may

15:52.051 --> 15:56.222
narrow over the next coming days
as a result of Greeks government
an early bitter taste

15:56.222 --> 15:58.324
of capital controls -- Judy.

15:58.324 --> 16:02.728
JUDY WOODRUFF: Malcolm
Brabant in Athens.

16:02.728 --> 16:18.411
And you can see more of
Malcolm's reporting on the Greek
crisis on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

16:18.411 --> 16:22.949
In the wake of the Supreme
Court's decision to uphold the
health care law, the president

16:22.949 --> 16:27.787
headed to Nashville today to
make the case that more states
should participate. More

16:27.787 --> 16:32.658
than 20 states, mostly led by
Republicans, have rejected an
expansion of Medicaid, including

16:32.658 --> 16:34.560
in Tennessee.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.630
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: And the federal
government is there to help

16:37.630 --> 16:44.170
and to work with those states
that are ready to get going.

16:44.170 --> 16:48.374
I will tell you, the states that
have taken full advantage of all
the federal options

16:48.374 --> 16:56.749
available, they have an even
lower uninsured rate and a
healthier population, and more

16:56.749 --> 17:00.887
people signing up for the
options that are available than
those state how have not taken

17:00.887 --> 17:04.390
full advantage of those options.
And that's just a fact.

17:04.390 --> 17:07.560
JUDY WOODRUFF: We pick up on
what happens now to the health
care law and the issues

17:07.560 --> 17:11.664
surrounding coverage and costs.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.033
Department of Health and Human
Services Secretary
MDNM MD-BO Sylvia Burwell is
the point

17:14.033 --> 17:15.835
person for the administration.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.670
MDNM MD-BO Sylvia
Burwell, welcome.

17:17.670 --> 17:18.804
SYLVIA MATHEWS BURWELL, U.S.
Health and Human Services
Secretary: Thank you so much
for

17:18.804 --> 17:21.073
having me.

17:21.073 --> 17:25.011
JUDY WOODRUFF: So the
administration just won this big
victory in the Supreme Court

17:25.011 --> 17:30.316
just last week, the president
already out on the road saying
it needs to be improved,

17:30.316 --> 17:33.319
the health care law.

17:33.319 --> 17:36.489
How do you know this is a wise
approach when, I guess, half the
American people say they're

17:36.489 --> 17:39.091
still not sure
they like the law?

17:39.091 --> 17:40.993
MDNM MD-BO SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: Well, I think what we
want to do is use this as

17:40.993 --> 17:44.397
an opportunity to build on the
progress that's been made.

17:44.397 --> 17:48.100
And whether that's the progress
that's been made for those that
are in the employer-based

17:48.100 --> 17:52.705
market, those that no longer can
be kept out of insurance because
of preexisting conditions

17:52.705 --> 17:55.875
or can keep their child on until
26, or those that are newly
insured, we have made a lot

17:55.875 --> 17:58.878
of progress.

17:58.878 --> 18:02.048
And we want to do is turn now
and build on that progress and
use this moment as an
opportunity

18:02.048 --> 18:04.483
to move forward.

18:04.483 --> 18:09.655
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm sure you
know very well Republican
members of Congress, Republicans

18:09.655 --> 18:14.260
running for president are saying
they want to either completely
repeal the law or undo

18:14.260 --> 18:17.563
big chunks of it.

18:17.563 --> 18:22.101
How worried are you that they
may do that either in the next
year-and-a-half or when

18:22.101 --> 18:24.503
there is a new president?

18:24.503 --> 18:25.237
MDNM MD-BO SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: Well, you know, I
think the president's been clear

18:25.237 --> 18:28.274
about the issue of repeal.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.477
And what we're hoping is that
the conversation can turn to the
substance, and I think that's

18:31.477 --> 18:36.048
what the president was
reflecting today, in terms of
most Americans want to make sure

18:36.048 --> 18:41.320
-- they don't want to go back to
a time where you can't get
insurance if you have
preexisting

18:41.320 --> 18:45.791
conditions or your children up
to 26, or in terms of the
consumer protections that are

18:45.791 --> 18:49.562
in place, and whether that's
lifetime limits no longer exist
or annual limits no longer

18:49.562 --> 18:51.230
exist.

18:51.230 --> 18:55.267
And I don't think folks want to
go back to that. And so I think
what we want to do

18:55.267 --> 19:00.439
is focus on there has been a lot
of progress made in terms of
quality, affordability and

19:00.439 --> 19:02.441
access, but we believe that
there is more that can be made,
and we would like to work

19:02.441 --> 19:04.744
together to do that.

19:04.744 --> 19:08.814
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about some of the modifications
that have been discussed.

19:08.814 --> 19:13.052
Even people who support the
plan are saying there are parts
of it that need changing,

19:13.052 --> 19:18.190
the so-called Cadillac tax
on the more generous plans.

19:18.190 --> 19:23.896
The thinking is that this could
cause employers to cut back on
benefits, to pass along the

19:23.896 --> 19:27.266
cost. Is that something that
the administration is willing to
take a look at and maybe get

19:27.266 --> 19:29.568
rid of?

19:29.568 --> 19:31.837
MDNM MD-BO SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: So, with regard to
what we said about the things

19:31.837 --> 19:35.541
we want to look at, and how
we're going to think about each
of those things is in terms

19:35.541 --> 19:39.912
of, how does it impact access,
affordability and quality, and
what does it do in terms

19:39.912 --> 19:43.783
of the deficit and the
health of the economy?

19:43.783 --> 19:47.787
These are the things that, for
all the issues, we're ready to
have the conversation in terms

19:47.787 --> 19:52.391
of -- in our budget even, we
actually have proposed extending
some of the tax credits

19:52.391 --> 19:56.695
to a larger group of small
businesses. In our budget, we
have also proposed things that

19:56.695 --> 20:01.801
we think will help with
increasing costs in the
pharmaceutical space as well.

20:01.801 --> 20:05.504
And that's about making sure we
have the ability to negotiate
with pharmaceuticals about price

20:05.504 --> 20:07.306
for Part D and Medicare.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.675
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what
about the Cadillac tax?

20:09.675 --> 20:12.745
MDNM MD-BO SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: As I said, in terms of
that one, there is the

20:12.745 --> 20:17.850
issue of what it means in terms
of the deficit. That is a very
expensive thing. And so,

20:17.850 --> 20:20.319
as we think about that, that's
one of the things that we think
is problematic in that

20:20.319 --> 20:22.321
space.

20:22.321 --> 20:28.727
JUDY WOODRUFF: As you know,
also, one of the persistent
criticisms of the law and health

20:28.727 --> 20:34.800
care in general is that the
costs is so high, that premium
costs are high.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.872
We looked at some numbers today.
In many places, people are
paying 10 percent, 20 percent,

20:39.872 --> 20:46.212
even 30 percent of their gross
income for these premiums. How
do you reverse this

20:46.212 --> 20:49.748
trend, which seems to be
happening in places all over the
country?

20:49.748 --> 20:51.884
MDNM MD-BO SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: So, first, I think
it's important to recognize

20:51.884 --> 20:55.888
that in terms of premium growth,
that we have seen some of the
lowest premium growth in

20:55.888 --> 21:00.426
the employer-based market that
we have seen in many, many years
in terms of a decade.

21:00.426 --> 21:05.831
We have also seen that price
increases in the health system
are at some of the lowest

21:05.831 --> 21:09.135
in decades. With regard to what
we're seeing now in terms of
some of the premiums that

21:09.135 --> 21:13.105
have been posted and are being
talked about, those are the
proposed premiums.

21:13.105 --> 21:18.611
And part of the Affordable Care
Act created a process of
transparency and review. So

21:18.611 --> 21:22.715
when insurers are going to
charge more than a 10 percent
increase, that needs to be
reviewed

21:22.715 --> 21:28.254
and there needs to be
justification. The Affordable
Care Act actually has put in
place

21:28.254 --> 21:33.159
things that we believe both
increase transparency and
increase downward pressure on
the premiums,

21:33.159 --> 21:36.428
but I think everyone knows,
before the Affordable Care Act,
we saw these premium increases
that

21:36.428 --> 21:38.931
existed as well.

21:38.931 --> 21:42.468
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about the difficulty in getting
people to sign up. This

21:42.468 --> 21:45.704
is something I know the
administration's worked very
hard on.

21:45.704 --> 21:51.610
But even today, we're told
something like 18 million
Americans who are eligible who

21:51.610 --> 21:57.983
are uninsured still have not
signed up, decided to buy
insurance. Many of these are
Hispanic,

21:57.983 --> 22:04.123
young people, young men. How do
you reach out to these
individuals? How do you
persuade

22:04.123 --> 22:06.725
them to sign up when they
haven't been willing before now?

22:06.725 --> 22:09.862
MDNM MD-BO SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: So, we know a couple
of things.

22:09.862 --> 22:15.000
First, 16.4 million fewer
Americans are uninsured now.
And that is progress and
progress we

22:15.000 --> 22:19.438
want to build. We want to do
this year as part of our open
enrollment and focus, as

22:19.438 --> 22:24.777
we did last year, on meeting the
consumer where they are, making
sure that we understand

22:24.777 --> 22:28.280
what these consumers are making
their choices on and that they
have the information they

22:28.280 --> 22:33.619
need to make good decisions and
know that they can find
affordable, quality care.

22:33.619 --> 22:38.090
We know that many people don't
realize that there are tax
credits that can help make it

22:38.090 --> 22:42.895
affordable. We also know that
many people, differing groups
need to be -- have individual

22:42.895 --> 22:47.533
contact. And that's why we use
navigators and assisters, so
that people can ask the

22:47.533 --> 22:50.369
questions of an individual and
have a conversation about what
is a very important and personal

22:50.369 --> 22:52.705
matter.

22:52.705 --> 22:57.576
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, of course,
another important part of this
is coverage for low-income
individuals,

22:57.576 --> 23:03.148
for the poor, Medicaid. A
number of governors, a number of
states have said they are not

23:03.148 --> 23:07.219
going to go along with
expanded Medicaid coverage.

23:07.219 --> 23:13.092
There is difficulty. We know
the administration is going to
be reducing, I guess, from 100

23:13.092 --> 23:18.664
percent down to 90 percent of
the portion it covers. You
still see state leaders saying

23:18.664 --> 23:22.868
this is something they can't
afford to do. How do you
persuade them otherwise?

23:22.868 --> 23:24.336
MDNM MD-BO SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: Well, first, I think
it's important that the 100

23:24.336 --> 23:27.439
percent goes through 2016.

23:27.439 --> 23:32.878
So, for many governors, it's
important to go ahead and fully
get that 100 percent payment

23:32.878 --> 23:37.650
that the federal government is
willing to make in terms of
expanding and providing coverage

23:37.650 --> 23:42.488
for many working people in their
state who can't afford that
coverage right now.

23:42.488 --> 23:47.026
And we believe that, in terms of
the expansion, it's important
for two fundamental reasons.

23:47.026 --> 23:51.397
One is for the individuals.
And those individuals, as I
said, many are working,

23:51.397 --> 23:55.601
are people who can get health
security and financial security
by the expansion.

23:55.601 --> 24:00.339
I think the other thing that's
important is what this does mean
in terms of jobs and the

24:00.339 --> 24:05.010
economy. And in Kentucky, where
they did expand, they have done
studies so that they

24:05.010 --> 24:09.548
make sure they track what's
happening. And a study done by
Deloitte, as well as the
University

24:09.548 --> 24:15.721
of Louisville, showed that, in
the state of Kentucky, by the
year 2021, they expect 40,000

24:15.721 --> 24:20.759
new jobs to be created because
of the expansion and $30 billion
to flow into the budgets of

24:20.759 --> 24:22.961
the state of Kentucky.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.664
JUDY WOODRUFF: So that's
something you will think is
going to happen elsewhere?

24:25.664 --> 24:28.534
MDNM MD-BO SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: We think it is. And
we think that it's because

24:28.534 --> 24:32.204
of the substance in terms of
what it means in the states,
both for individuals, as well

24:32.204 --> 24:36.008
as for the states' economies
and providers in those states.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.610
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sylvia Burwell,
secretary of the Department of
Health and Human Services,

24:38.610 --> 24:40.245
thank you.

24:40.245 --> 24:42.748
MDNM MD-BO SYLVIA MATHEWS
BURWELL: Judy, thanks for
having me.

24:42.748 --> 24:47.119
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the case on
the health care law, with
Secretary Burwell named as

24:47.119 --> 24:51.523
a defendant, was, of course,
just one decision in a dramatic
and, some believe, historic

24:51.523 --> 24:54.093
Supreme Court session.

24:54.093 --> 24:59.898
That session started last
October, and it ended this week.
In all, the high court

24:59.898 --> 25:05.170
heard 67 cases. Many of the
most significant rulings came
out in just the past seven days.

25:05.170 --> 25:09.808
And some of the decisions
showed surprise splits among the
justices.

25:09.808 --> 25:13.746
Jeffrey Brown looks at what we
learned from and about the
court.

25:13.746 --> 25:19.118
JEFFREY BROWN: The court's 2015
session took on a big and broad
landscape, free speech,

25:19.118 --> 25:23.989
the rights of pregnant workers,
housing discrimination, the use
of lethal injection, and, of
course,

25:23.989 --> 25:27.092
the fate of Obamacare, and the
definition of marriage itself.

25:27.092 --> 25:29.928
We take our own big and
broad look with three

25:29.928 --> 25:35.701
of the country's top Supreme
Court watchers, Joan Biskupic,
legal affairs editor for Reuters

25:35.701 --> 25:41.006
and author of biographies of
Justices Scalia and Sotomayor,
Amy Howe, editor of SCOTUSblog,

25:41.006 --> 25:44.643
and, of course, our own regular
contributor Marcia Coyle of "The
National Law Journal,"

25:44.643 --> 25:46.645
author of the book
"The Roberts Court."

25:46.645 --> 25:47.413
Welcome to you all.

25:47.413 --> 25:49.481
Joan, you start us off.

25:49.481 --> 25:53.685
Was there a big theme that you
saw emerge from this term?

25:53.685 --> 25:56.088
JOAN BISKUPIC, Reuters: Well,
you know, we always try to
isolate the courts for the

25:56.088 --> 25:58.791
one term.

25:58.791 --> 26:03.061
But the court never sits still
to just say, OK, just judge us
by this term. So we have

26:03.061 --> 26:08.500
to step back a little bit. Of
course, we had the upholding for
the second time of President

26:08.500 --> 26:11.303
Obama's Affordable Care Act,
which was big for so many of
your viewers. We had this

26:11.303 --> 26:15.207
fundamental right to
same-sex marriage declared.

26:15.207 --> 26:20.312
And those two sort of gave the
court a little bit of liberal
identification, but the truth

26:20.312 --> 26:25.217
is that this is still pretty
much of a conservative court.
They also upheld the lethal
injection

26:25.217 --> 26:31.323
nationwide for death penalty.
So I would say that we saw
several things, but mostly

26:31.323 --> 26:34.927
what it comes down to is, it
depends on the case, it depends
on Anthony Kennedy, our
traditional

26:34.927 --> 26:37.596
swing vote justice.

26:37.596 --> 26:41.633
And this time, he did go more
with the liberals. And for the
chief himself, we saw him going

26:41.633 --> 26:44.603
in both directions, but still
being very consistent for
himself.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.406
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, Amy, pick up
on that. The chief, the key
players, what do you

26:47.406 --> 26:49.141
see?

26:49.141 --> 26:51.944
AMY HOWE, SCOTUSblog.com: Well,
I think it was interesting,
because it's certainly

26:51.944 --> 26:57.583
true that the four liberal
justices were in the majority in
a lot of the important cases

26:57.583 --> 27:02.387
this term, including same-sex
marriage, including Obamacare,
housing discrimination.

27:02.387 --> 27:06.792
But I wouldn't look at this as a
term in which the law
necessarily moved to the left,
that

27:06.792 --> 27:11.263
these were actually liberal
victories, as much as they were
the liberals staving off

27:11.263 --> 27:16.435
efforts by the right to move the
law to the right. And so
same-sex marriage, undoubtedly,

27:16.435 --> 27:19.705
that was a decision that
moved the law to the left.

27:19.705 --> 27:24.409
Until last Friday, there was no
nationwide right to same-sex
marriage. Now there is.

27:24.409 --> 27:29.248
But when you look at a lot of
the other big cases, whether
you're talking about Obamacare,

27:29.248 --> 27:34.319
housing discrimination, a case
involving whether or not
Congress can order interest the
executive

27:34.319 --> 27:39.024
branch to put Israel on the
passport of U.S. citizens who
were born in Jerusalem, these

27:39.024 --> 27:41.860
are all cases in which all that
happened really was that the law
stayed the same.

27:41.860 --> 27:42.628
JEFFREY BROWN: Status quo.

27:42.628 --> 27:44.863
AMY HOWE: Yes.

27:44.863 --> 27:47.399
JEFFREY BROWN: Marcia, you
have, of course, worked us
through, walked it through play

27:47.399 --> 27:51.169
by play throughout the term.
Put a bigger hat on here.

27:51.169 --> 27:55.707
Let me show a couple of graphics
that we have to show some of the
alliances. So, the Affordable

27:55.707 --> 28:01.813
Care Act, here's the 6-3
decision in that. And then we
will put up the gay marriage

28:01.813 --> 28:05.217
case, and you can see the
shifts. What do you see in
terms of the alliances that took

28:05.217 --> 28:07.185
place this term?

28:07.185 --> 28:09.354
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal": Well, I think the
alliances are what distinguished

28:09.354 --> 28:11.957
a lot of these cases.

28:11.957 --> 28:18.931
You saw movement from justices
on the right over to the left,
and they were the reason

28:18.931 --> 28:25.704
that we had the victories in the
same-sex marriage case, health
care as well. I think

28:25.704 --> 28:30.342
we learned a lot about the court
from this particular term. We
learned a lot about

28:30.342 --> 28:35.881
the differences among the
justices on the right and how
they interpret the Constitution

28:35.881 --> 28:38.984
and how they interpret
federal laws.

28:38.984 --> 28:39.785
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean the
right as a bloc itself? It was
interesting to watch.

28:39.785 --> 28:41.286
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

28:41.286 --> 28:47.125
I think we -- as we have said in
the past, these justices on the
left and the right are

28:47.125 --> 28:54.032
not monolithic blocs at all.
And we saw in many of the big
cases this term that the

28:54.032 --> 28:59.338
justices on the right don't
march in lockstep when it comes
to interpreting the
Constitution.

28:59.338 --> 29:05.277
We saw, for example, in same-sex
marriage that Justice Kennedy
has a broader conception

29:05.277 --> 29:11.116
of individual -- individual
liberty that is protected by the
14th Amendment than his -- the

29:11.116 --> 29:15.754
colleagues to the right of him.
And we saw in the health care
case that the chief justice

29:15.754 --> 29:20.392
interprets statutes differently
from Justice Scalia.

29:20.392 --> 29:24.796
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Joan, can we
talk about a -- we talk about a
Roberts court, right?

29:24.796 --> 29:27.733
But we're saying here that that
has meanings that change around.

29:27.733 --> 29:30.002
JOAN BISKUPIC: It does.

29:30.002 --> 29:35.307
And the chief himself was in the
majority less this term than he
has been in past terms.

29:35.307 --> 29:40.379
And that's another reason to
remember that you judge a term
by the particular cases that

29:40.379 --> 29:45.150
are up there for those nine
months. And next year, we're
going to have so many other

29:45.150 --> 29:48.120
different kinds of cases that,
frankly, at this point might
play more to the justices

29:48.120 --> 29:51.089
on the right wing.

29:51.089 --> 29:55.927
But it's Roberts court in name.
We informally give it that. In
terms of winners and losers,

29:55.927 --> 29:59.965
we probably should say it's the
Kennedy court, as we have said
for many, many years. But

29:59.965 --> 30:05.437
just to pick up with what Marcia
said about the justices on the
left hanging together,

30:05.437 --> 30:09.441
Justice Ginsburg has a view that
she will assign an opinion, she
will write up an opinion,

30:09.441 --> 30:12.944
and they will sign it. Her
colleagues will sign it.

30:12.944 --> 30:17.282
Once you're -- if you're in the
dissent and you're on the right
wing, they're going to

30:17.282 --> 30:20.986
naturally splinter even further
than they already are. There is
a lot of difference

30:20.986 --> 30:25.691
between Clarence Thomas, who is
on the far right, and Anthony
Kennedy, who is also on

30:25.691 --> 30:28.827
the right, much more of a
difference than among at all
those four justices on the
liberal

30:28.827 --> 30:29.327
side.

30:29.327 --> 30:31.630
JEFFREY BROWN: I want to ask.

30:31.630 --> 30:35.867
I will start with you on this,
Amy Howe, the question of the
rhetoric, because it's something

30:35.867 --> 30:41.339
we all watch and you're all
there in the court and reading
the decisions. There's a lot

30:41.339 --> 30:45.644
of strong rhetoric this term,
right? This is Glossip vs.
Gross, the capital execution

30:45.644 --> 30:47.746
case, right?

30:47.746 --> 30:52.551
So, we have Justice Scalia
referring to some words by
Justice Breyer as gobbledygook.
Scalia

30:52.551 --> 30:53.752
is always good for...

30:53.752 --> 30:53.985
(CROSSTALK)

30:53.985 --> 30:54.653
(LAUGHTER)

30:54.653 --> 30:55.554
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.456
Was this unusual?

30:57.456 --> 31:01.493
AMY HOWE: It did seem a little
bit unusual. Every term, by the
end of the term -- because,

31:01.493 --> 31:04.629
frequently, especially the last
few years, that's when a lot of
the high-profile cases

31:04.629 --> 31:06.865
have been coming down

31:06.865 --> 31:11.603
And so those are the cases on
which the justices are more
likely to be closely divided.
They're

31:11.603 --> 31:13.739
tired of each other. They're
ready for summer vacation.

31:13.739 --> 31:14.673
JEFFREY BROWN: They're normal
people, like the rest of us.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.208
(CROSSTALK)

31:16.208 --> 31:17.209
AMY HOWE: They're tired.
They're tired, and they're tired
of each other, because they're

31:17.209 --> 31:20.445
working so hard at
the end of June.

31:20.445 --> 31:25.183
But this session, when you had
Justice Scalia in the same-sex
marriage case saying that

31:25.183 --> 31:29.054
he would rather hide his head in
a bag than sign on to an opinion
that started the way

31:29.054 --> 31:31.890
that Justice Kennedy started his
opinion in the same-sex marriage
case, that's really

31:31.890 --> 31:34.292
kind of remarkable.

31:34.292 --> 31:38.296
And so I think there is a couple
of things going on. I think
that the conservatives

31:38.296 --> 31:42.968
this term were frustrated that
they were on the losing side in
some of these cases,
particularly

31:42.968 --> 31:48.039
maybe the Obamacare, ACA
subsidies case, that they
probably expected to win.

31:48.039 --> 31:52.010
And it seemed, when I looked
back at the rhetoric in some of
the dissents, the rhetoric was

31:52.010 --> 31:57.649
particularly strong on the part
of justices like Justices
Scalia, Thomas and Alito, when

31:57.649 --> 32:01.753
it was directed at majority
opinions, for example, in the
same-sex marriage case, in

32:01.753 --> 32:05.891
the Obamacare case, that were
written by conservatives.

32:05.891 --> 32:09.928
It's one thing if you're Justice
Scalia and you think Justice
Ginsburg has written an

32:09.928 --> 32:15.100
end-driven opinion with no
grounding in legal doctrine or
anything like that. We kind

32:15.100 --> 32:18.570
of expect that from her, is the
thinking on Justice Scalia's
part.

32:18.570 --> 32:22.874
But it's another thing when you
have got Justice Kennedy or the
chief justice changing sides

32:22.874 --> 32:26.545
in a case that he regards
as fundamentally important.

32:26.545 --> 32:29.214
JEFFREY BROWN: What about,
Marcia, now looking ahead? And
Joan referred to some of these

32:29.214 --> 32:30.081
cases. There are some
big cases coming.

32:30.081 --> 32:31.416
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.118
JEFFREY BROWN: I mean, there's
always big ones, but there's big
ones that could shift

32:33.118 --> 32:34.319
our whole perception
again. Right?

32:34.319 --> 32:36.388
MARCIA COYLE: There are.

32:36.388 --> 32:42.160
Already, the court has on its
docket for next term a major
case involving unions and agency

32:42.160 --> 32:48.800
shop fees that non-union members
pay in order for the union to
represent them during collective

32:48.800 --> 32:52.304
bargaining. There, it seems,
sentiment on the court to find
that they're unconstitutional

32:52.304 --> 32:55.640
under the First Amendment.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.911
The court also has, once again,
taken affirmative action in
higher education, a case...

32:59.911 --> 33:02.848
JEFFREY BROWN: Which has
colleges worried again.

33:02.848 --> 33:05.083
MARCIA COYLE: Absolutely. And
it's the second time for this
particular case that

33:05.083 --> 33:08.286
they're going to
be looking at it.

33:08.286 --> 33:14.025
The court has a political case
involving the meaning of one
person, one vote, after all

33:14.025 --> 33:19.164
these years, in redistricting,
and teeing up we're seeing
coming now, because there

33:19.164 --> 33:26.071
have been a slew of emergency
requests for stays in lower
court cases involving abortion

33:26.071 --> 33:32.010
clinics, voting rights. And we
may also see next term a
challenge to President Obama's

33:32.010 --> 33:34.779
executive action on immigration.

33:34.779 --> 33:38.550
So, it could be, as Joan said,
an extremely different term.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.686
JEFFREY BROWN: Just a very
brief last word on that? You
see some real challenges?

33:41.686 --> 33:44.322
JOAN BISKUPIC: Yes. I think
next year at this time, we could
all be sitting around

33:44.322 --> 33:47.626
saying, what a swing
to the right it was.

33:47.626 --> 33:50.128
And I will just mention one
thing that the chief himself has
said at this time of year.

33:50.128 --> 33:51.897
It's a very good thing we all
get a break from each other.

33:51.897 --> 33:53.698
(LAUGHTER)

33:53.698 --> 33:57.469
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, on
that -- not that I want to take
a break from the three

33:57.469 --> 33:59.037
of you, but we will end there.

33:59.037 --> 33:59.804
Joan Biskupic, Amy Howe, Marcia
Coyle, thanks very much.

33:59.804 --> 34:00.338
AMY HOWE: Thank you.

34:00.338 --> 34:04.509
MARCIA COYLE: Thanks, Jeff.

34:04.509 --> 34:10.682
JOAN BISKUPIC: Thanks, Jeff.

34:10.682 --> 34:16.588
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next:
neuroscience and education.

34:16.588 --> 34:21.693
Thousands of teachers around the
country are learning about an
alternative teaching program

34:21.693 --> 34:25.397
that aims to use scientific
discoveries about the brain to
improve the way children learn

34:25.397 --> 34:28.233
in the classroom.

34:28.233 --> 34:32.437
Special correspondent John
Tulenko of Learning Matters
reports from Philadelphia.

34:32.437 --> 34:40.111
JASSELLE CIRINO, Teacher,
Francis Scott Key Elementary:
When I say class, you...

34:40.111 --> 34:48.520
CLASS: You stop what you're
doing. Look at the teacher.

34:48.520 --> 34:54.092
JOHN TULENKO: Today is Wacky
Wednesday in Jasselle Cirino's
third grade classroom, which

34:54.092 --> 34:55.794
explains the blue wig.

34:55.794 --> 34:58.363
JASSELLE CIRINO: So I want
you to teach your neighbor.

34:58.363 --> 35:00.765
JOHN TULENKO: But the rest of
what you're about to see is what
her classroom looks like

35:00.765 --> 35:01.967
every day.

35:01.967 --> 35:04.269
JASSELLE CIRINO: I
want giant gestures.

35:04.269 --> 35:08.740
JOHN TULENKO: She uses a set of
techniques some call whole brain
teaching.

35:08.740 --> 35:13.712
JASSELLE CIRINO: A lot of times
in traditional teaching, you're
just lecturing, and you're

35:13.712 --> 35:19.718
talking and talking. And what
we like to say, whole brainers,
we like to say that the

35:19.718 --> 35:25.557
more you talk, the more students
you lose. And so we use
different methods to engage

35:25.557 --> 35:30.695
multiple parts of the brain.
And that way, you get 100
percent engagement.

35:30.695 --> 35:35.767
JOHN TULENKO: These days,
scientists can look further into
the brain than ever, pinpointing

35:35.767 --> 35:39.504
the neurons and circuits that
control how we think and act.
All that's sparking a

35:39.504 --> 35:43.441
movement that's changing the
way some teachers teach.

35:43.441 --> 35:46.478
Are there parts of the brain
that you're aiming at?

35:46.478 --> 35:50.782
JASSELLE CIRINO: Yes, the
hippocampus, the motor cortex,
the prefrontal cortex, which

35:50.782 --> 35:58.323
is the brain's boss, so
something like class, it turns
on the prefrontal cortex, which
makes

35:58.323 --> 36:01.059
the brain's decisions.

36:01.059 --> 36:07.599
So it says, hey, pay attention.
I'm about to tell you something.
So, once I have their

36:07.599 --> 36:12.804
attention, I teach the material
usually through mirrors.

36:12.804 --> 36:15.707
This deals with the
mirror neurons in your

36:15.707 --> 36:23.314
brain. And so what I say, they
repeat. To learn anything, you
have to repeat something.

36:23.314 --> 36:27.352
You have to repeat something
that's modeled to you. That's
where it starts.

36:27.352 --> 36:31.956
JOHN TULENKO: A lot of times in
your class, I saw you gesture,
and then you asked your

36:31.956 --> 36:34.192
students to gesture.

36:34.192 --> 36:38.763
JASSELLE CIRINO: Right. That's
for engaging their motor cortex.
When you act things

36:38.763 --> 36:45.603
out while you're reading, you
comprehend more. And we use
brainees. These are gestures

36:45.603 --> 36:47.839
that are tied to writing skills.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.108
JOHN TULENKO: Can you
give me some examples?

36:50.108 --> 37:02.253
JASSELLE CIRINO: Sure. For
example is an example. But or
however. If, then,

37:02.253 --> 37:08.059
so more of like a cause and
effect. Adjective. A noun is a
person, place or thing, compare,

37:08.059 --> 37:13.531
contrast, simile, metaphor, I
mean, the list goes on and on.

37:13.531 --> 37:18.203
JOHN TULENKO: I saw you a bunch
of times where you would stop,
and then you would say

37:18.203 --> 37:19.537
to the group, teach.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.306
JASSELLE CIRINO: Teach.

37:21.306 --> 37:23.908
JOHN TULENKO: What's
going on there?

37:23.908 --> 37:28.646
JASSELLE CIRINO: So I have
taught them the lesson, but now
they need to teach that main

37:28.646 --> 37:33.618
point to each other. They're
getting another repetition of
the material, but, this time,

37:33.618 --> 37:37.122
a lot of times it's in their own
words. And they're learning how
to put things in their

37:37.122 --> 37:39.958
own words.

37:39.958 --> 37:43.962
You're writing while you're
doing it. You're gesturing, so
you're remembering it in
different

37:43.962 --> 37:48.700
parts of the brain. You're not
just listening. You're also
speaking. You need to be doing

37:48.700 --> 37:52.604
all of these things at once in
order to engage the whole brain.

37:52.604 --> 37:57.375
JOHN TULENKO: We wanted to know
if science actually backed up
any of this. So we brought

37:57.375 --> 38:02.347
a video of Jasselle's class to
Daphna Shohamy, a neuroscientist
at Columbia University.

38:02.347 --> 38:06.951
DAPHNA SHOHAMY, Neuroscientist,
Columbia University: I buy it.
It makes great sense to me.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.855
I mean, the brain is really in
many ways wired for actions.
Right? It's -- it's really

38:10.855 --> 38:16.161
not wired to sit passively and
absorb any information. But I
think where -- you know,

38:16.161 --> 38:22.066
where I wouldn't fully agree is
the idea that more activity is
always good. More brain

38:22.066 --> 38:25.937
activity in more places doesn't
equal more learning or a better
memory.

38:25.937 --> 38:29.607
JOHN TULENKO: OK. How can
children learn better?

38:29.607 --> 38:33.111
DAPHNA SHOHAMY: Right, right.
Yes, it's the million-dollar
question. I think we

38:33.111 --> 38:35.213
have some answers.

38:35.213 --> 38:38.149
The brain learns when things are
surprising and interesting.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.852
JASSELLE CIRINO: What
is going on here?

38:40.852 --> 38:45.790
DAPHNA SHOHAMY: So if I give
you a $20 bill, now, all of a
sudden, you will sort of have

38:45.790 --> 38:49.627
a burst of activity in your
dopamine neurons. They fire.

38:49.627 --> 38:54.933
But if I do that regularly, like
every five minutes, I give you
$20, your dopamine neurons

38:54.933 --> 39:01.506
will stop firing. So what these
neurons are doing is they're
signaling how unexpected

39:01.506 --> 39:04.876
an event was in the world.
They're not signaling how good
or bad it was. They're
signaling

39:04.876 --> 39:10.481
how unexpectedly good or
unexpectedly bad it was.

39:10.481 --> 39:15.486
So keeping things a little bit
noisy and a little bit different
is actually really beneficial

39:15.486 --> 39:17.422
for learning in many
different ways.

39:17.422 --> 39:21.759
JASSELLE CIRINO:
Hold your horses.

39:21.759 --> 39:26.164
JOHN TULENKO: Neuroscience says
there's something else important
going on here.

39:26.164 --> 39:30.368
JASSELLE CIRINO: When you're
learning things, just even in
life, you connect it with a type

39:30.368 --> 39:34.739
of feeling. And so the main
emotion we want you to feel in a
whole brain classroom is

39:34.739 --> 39:35.240
fun.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.275
Seriously?

39:37.275 --> 39:41.479
DAPHNA SHOHAMY: Our brain was
evolved to survive. We need to
remember things that

39:41.479 --> 39:45.950
were of emotional and social
significance. That's probably
much more important than

39:45.950 --> 39:49.420
remembering any bit of
information that was
communicated to us within a
lecture.

39:49.420 --> 39:52.557
JASSELLE CIRINO: We're done
being blah. It's time to get
fuzzy.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.859
CLASS: Fuzzy!

39:54.859 --> 39:59.697
JOHN TULENKO: Here are a few
other things neuroscientists
think the rest of us ought

39:59.697 --> 40:05.103
to know about the brain, that
stress damages neurons and
impairs learning. Brain
training

40:05.103 --> 40:09.307
games claim to be effective,
but, in fact, the jury's still
out.

40:09.307 --> 40:13.211
What does help is regular
physical exercise. Staying
active keeps the brain
developing

40:13.211 --> 40:17.215
and delays cognitive
decline as we get older.

40:17.215 --> 40:22.620
In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
I'm John Tulenko reporting for
the "NewsHour."

40:22.620 --> 40:31.963
JUDY WOODRUFF: As for results,
a study on the effect of whole
brain teaching in one

40:31.963 --> 40:36.634
California elementary school
found test scores in math and
language arts rose by an average

40:36.634 --> 40:49.314
of 11 percent.

40:49.314 --> 40:53.785
Let's look at a space mission
that's generating lots of
interest and excitement. It's
the

40:53.785 --> 40:59.791
mission to orbit the dwarf
planet Ceres by the NASA
spacecraft named Dawn.

40:59.791 --> 41:04.429
It arrived in March, and as the
spacecraft has gotten closer in
recent weeks, it's getting

41:04.429 --> 41:08.499
a better view of the planet,
leading to some intriguing
questions.

41:08.499 --> 41:10.635
MARC RAYMAN, Dawn Mission
Director: Our team sat down
with Dawn's mission director

41:10.635 --> 41:15.773
in California and put
together this video.

41:15.773 --> 41:24.048
We launched Dawn from Cape
Canaveral in September 2007. In
my view, Dawn is exploring two

41:24.048 --> 41:30.054
of the last uncharted worlds in
the inner solar system. In more
than 57 years of space

41:30.054 --> 41:40.465
exploration, it's the only
spacecraft ever to orbit two
extraterrestrial destinations.

41:40.465 --> 41:46.938
I'm Marc Rayman, the chief
engineer and mission director
for the Dawn mission.

41:46.938 --> 41:52.210
Vesta and Ceres are the two most
massive objects in the main
asteroid belt. There are
millions

41:52.210 --> 41:57.248
of objects orbiting the sun
there between Mars and Jupiter.
But Ceres itself contains

41:57.248 --> 42:02.153
about a third of the mass
of all of those objects.

42:02.153 --> 42:06.557
Ceres is the largest object in
the main asteroid belt. In
fact, it's the largest object
between

42:06.557 --> 42:11.896
the sun and Pluto that a
spacecraft had not visited prior
to Dawn, so it's almost 600

42:11.896 --> 42:16.501
miles across. This is a big
place. It's more than one
million square miles. It's

42:16.501 --> 42:22.039
got 38 percent of the area of
the continental United States.

42:22.039 --> 42:28.946
Ceres and Vesta, they are
remnants from the epic in our
solar system of the formation

42:28.946 --> 42:36.854
of planets, the dawn of our
solar system. And so scientists
want to study these bodies

42:36.854 --> 42:41.993
because they may tell us more
about the conditions and the
processes that were acting at
the

42:41.993 --> 42:45.163
times planets formed.

42:45.163 --> 42:52.036
As Dawn got closer to Ceres, one
of the first things we saw were
those bright spots. And

42:52.036 --> 42:59.410
it's impossible not to be
mesmerized by these glowing
beacons shining out from the
unfamiliar

42:59.410 --> 43:06.350
lands ahead.

43:06.350 --> 43:13.191
The reason these are so bright
is that they reflect so much
more light than the rest of

43:13.191 --> 43:18.529
Ceres does, maybe five times or
more as much light as the rest
of Ceres. And so the contrast

43:18.529 --> 43:22.733
is just stark.

43:22.733 --> 43:27.405
There are many possibilities for
what the bright spots might be.
They might be ice

43:27.405 --> 43:35.346
in some form. They also might
be the remnants from ice that
was on the surface and
sublimated.

43:35.346 --> 43:41.619
That is, it's almost as if the
ice evaporated into space and
left behind the materials that

43:41.619 --> 43:47.825
had been dissolved in it, so
essentially salts that could be
very, very reflective.

43:47.825 --> 43:52.196
And while we don't know yet what
they are, as we continue to get
in closer and get measurements,

43:52.196 --> 43:55.233
not only with the camera, but
with the other sensors on the
spacecraft, we will figure

43:55.233 --> 43:58.769
out what they are.

43:58.769 --> 44:08.880
What it is about them, whether
it's a difference in the
chemical compositional nature of
this

44:08.880 --> 44:15.520
material or something about its
structure, its makeup, why it
reflects so much more light,

44:15.520 --> 44:19.090
we don't know. And it makes you
want to send a spacecraft there
to find out. And,

44:19.090 --> 44:22.026
by golly, that's
what we're doing.

44:22.026 --> 44:29.967
At Ceres, we fly the spacecraft
in four different orbits in
order to study this alien world.

44:29.967 --> 44:35.873
So, we started out in an orbit
8,400 miles high, and then
eventually, we will fly it

44:35.873 --> 44:41.345
down to only about 230 miles,
which is actually a little bit
closer to the surface of Ceres

44:41.345 --> 44:46.083
than the International Space
Station is to the surface of
Earth.

44:46.083 --> 44:51.255
Part of what is so exciting is,
not only does each orbit answer
questions for us, but it

44:51.255 --> 44:55.860
raises new questions. And then
we can answer those questions by
going lower and getting

44:55.860 --> 45:04.168
more detailed data. It's been a
remarkable, ambitious
interplanetary adventure.

45:04.168 --> 45:09.106
JUDY WOODRUFF: Our own Jenny
Marder helped produce that
piece. And visited NASA for

45:09.106 --> 45:11.008
the story. And
she joins me now.

45:11.008 --> 45:14.412
So, Jenny, thank you
for being here.

45:14.412 --> 45:17.181
Really interesting. And you
just -- you heard the mission
director say, this is really

45:17.181 --> 45:19.050
about learning about the
origins of our solar system.

45:19.050 --> 45:22.153
JENNY MARDER: That's right.

45:22.153 --> 45:29.126
Ceres is known as a protoplanet,
and that means that scientists
believe it was in the

45:29.126 --> 45:34.899
process of forming, like a
full-pledged planet, and its
formation was suddenly halted,
likely

45:34.899 --> 45:38.069
by the tremendous
gravity of Jupiter.

45:38.069 --> 45:43.140
So what you're really seeing is
a planet in the process of
forming which is frozen in

45:43.140 --> 45:46.711
time, so that it's really a
window into the beginning of the
solar system.

45:46.711 --> 45:53.384
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as we just
saw in that description in the
pictures, the spacecraft

45:53.384 --> 45:57.688
Dawn is getting closer and
closer. We heard him talk about
the bright spots. What is

45:57.688 --> 46:00.224
the spacecraft seeing now?

46:00.224 --> 46:05.596
JENNY MARDER: The spacecraft is
maneuvering now from its third
to its second orbit. Each

46:05.596 --> 46:09.700
orbit brings it closer and
closer to the surface of Ceres.

46:09.700 --> 46:16.507
So the images that we're seeing,
we're seeing images of the
craters, of valleys, a
three-mile-high

46:16.507 --> 46:21.112
cone that sort of looks like a
volcano on Earth. And we're
seeing these bright spots

46:21.112 --> 46:25.549
which are very interesting. In
August, we will start getting a
new crop of photos. These

46:25.549 --> 46:31.088
are images coming from
Dawn at the third orbit.

46:31.088 --> 46:34.992
Those photos will be three times
sharper than the images we're
seeing now. And then, in

46:34.992 --> 46:42.366
early December, when it gets to
its closest altitude, those will
be 12 times sharper than

46:42.366 --> 46:46.303
what we're seeing now and
actually 850 times sharper than
what we were seeing back in
January,

46:46.303 --> 46:48.739
when Dawn first started
capturing these images.

46:48.739 --> 46:51.108
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, still trying
to figure out if there could
have been life or could

46:51.108 --> 46:53.778
be life on this dwarf planet?

46:53.778 --> 46:57.381
JENNY MARDER: Yes, that's a
really interesting question.

46:57.381 --> 47:02.186
It's a question that this
mission likely won't answer,
because they're not collecting
anything

47:02.186 --> 47:06.090
from the surface of the planet.
They will just -- they're just
orbiting it. However,

47:06.090 --> 47:11.495
Ceres does seem to possibly,
very possibly have the
ingredients for life.

47:11.495 --> 47:13.330
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because
of those bright spots?

47:13.330 --> 47:17.168
JENNY MARDER: At least as we
know it on Earth, life requires
three ingredients, food,

47:17.168 --> 47:20.438
water, and energy.

47:20.438 --> 47:26.243
And the energy could come from
radioactive nuclear decay from
the planet's interior.

47:26.243 --> 47:32.049
The planet is very dark, which
they think indicates carbon-rich
compounds on the surface.

47:32.049 --> 47:35.352
And then the third ingredient
is water. And it looks like
it's likely that these

47:35.352 --> 47:40.224
bright spots are evidence of
water, of a liquid water mantle
underneath the surface.

47:40.224 --> 47:42.226
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it sounds
like the scientists are very
excited about this.

47:42.226 --> 47:44.995
JENNY MARDER: Yes.

47:44.995 --> 47:50.468
What's so cool about this is, is
it's incredible detective story
that we're just seeing unfolding

47:50.468 --> 47:54.839
in real time. And as we get
closer and closer to the surface
of Ceres, this planet just

47:54.839 --> 47:57.308
comes increasingly into focus.

47:57.308 --> 47:59.276
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jenny Marder,
thank you very much.

47:59.276 --> 48:02.046
JENNY MARDER: Thank you.

48:02.046 --> 48:04.949
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can
learn more about the Dawn
mission to Ceres by going to our

48:04.949 --> 48:20.564
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

48:20.564 --> 48:26.203
Finally tonight: an encore look
at classical ballerina Misty
Copeland, who yesterday became

48:26.203 --> 48:31.041
the first African-American
female principal dancer in
American Ballet Theatre's 75-
year

48:31.041 --> 48:34.078
history.

48:34.078 --> 48:39.216
Copeland sat down with us last
year to share the story of her
rise from poverty to the

48:39.216 --> 48:44.789
spotlight. She read from her
memoir, "Life in Motion: An
Unlikely Ballerina," and she

48:44.789 --> 48:48.726
recounted the evening she first
danced the title role in
Stravinsky's "Firebird."

48:48.726 --> 48:51.962
MISTY COPELAND, American
Ballet Theatre: Outside,

48:51.962 --> 48:56.467
the largest crowd I have ever
seen waits. Prominent members
of the African-American

48:56.467 --> 49:01.372
community and trailblazers in
the world of dance who have
seldom received their due are

49:01.372 --> 49:05.676
here tonight, but I know I will
also dance for those who aren't
here, who pass the Metropolitan

49:05.676 --> 49:09.547
Opera House, but cannot
imagine what goes on inside.

49:09.547 --> 49:16.086
They may be poor, like I have
been; insecure, like I have
been; misunderstood, like I have

49:16.086 --> 49:22.459
been. I will be dancing for
them, too. I run onto the stage
and feel myself transform.

49:22.459 --> 49:28.165
As I approach center, my flock
parts, leaving me to stand
alone. There's a brief second

49:28.165 --> 49:32.236
of silence before the audience
erupts into applause once more,
clapping so loudly I can

49:32.236 --> 49:38.676
barely hear the music.
And so it begins.

49:38.676 --> 49:42.680
I'm Misty Copeland. And I'm a
soloist with American Ballet
Theatre.

49:42.680 --> 49:48.118
I didn't come from a background
that would've introduced me to
this world in any way. I

49:48.118 --> 49:51.555
didn't come from a family with
money. I had no knowledge of
the ballet world. I

49:51.555 --> 49:55.259
had never heard
classical music before.

49:55.259 --> 50:01.932
But I think, above all of that,
just starting at 13 and only
training for four years before

50:01.932 --> 50:05.369
I was accepted into American
Ballet Theatre, America's
national ballet company, I think

50:05.369 --> 50:08.572
is the most unlikely of it all.

50:08.572 --> 50:13.777
I took a free ballet class at a
Boys and Girls Club surrounded
by other kids that had similar

50:13.777 --> 50:19.183
backgrounds to me that were all
older. And I was selected to
come to my teacher's school

50:19.183 --> 50:23.120
on a full scholarship. It was
the first time in my life that
that had been presented

50:23.120 --> 50:26.123
to me, that I had no limits and
that I could dream. That wasn't
something I grew up in

50:26.123 --> 50:29.193
my home atmosphere having.

50:29.193 --> 50:35.499
I remember the first time I sat
on the stage at the Metropolitan
Opera House. I was 19

50:35.499 --> 50:40.504
years old, still struggling to
find my place in ABT's Corps de
Ballet. I traced the marley

50:40.504 --> 50:46.176
floor with my pointe shoes, and
imagine myself on the stage, not
as a member of the corps,

50:46.176 --> 50:51.415
but as a principal dancer. It
felt right. It felt like a
promise. Some day, somehow,

50:51.415 --> 50:58.088
it was going to happen for me.

50:58.088 --> 51:03.127
The ballet world, I don't think
is an art form that is quick to
change or to adjust

51:03.127 --> 51:08.165
or evolve. ABT and most
classical companies are about
kind of following this slow and

51:08.165 --> 51:14.638
steady process of proving
yourself and moving up through
the ranks. And because I was

51:14.638 --> 51:20.611
so able and capable of mimicking
and doing movements that I had
never done before, I

51:20.611 --> 51:24.715
could just see it and imitate
it, choreographers wanted to
work with me.

51:24.715 --> 51:30.287
You just have to be given the
opportunity and just give
everything to it and dive into

51:30.287 --> 51:34.124
it and really commit to these
roles, which, with these
opportunities I have been given,

51:34.124 --> 51:41.198
with Firebird and Swanilda,
Gamzatti, all of these parts
that I really just -- I took

51:41.198 --> 51:46.136
care with all of them because I
have so much respect for this
art form.

51:46.136 --> 51:54.411
The ballet world, I think, is so
similar to theater and drama,
and you're becoming a character.

51:54.411 --> 51:59.516
I mean, it's not you out there
on the stage. You know, there
is no role called Misty

51:59.516 --> 52:05.089
that I am playing. We're
portraying a character. And
even if you are in the Corps de
Ballet,

52:05.089 --> 52:11.829
you know, why can't there be a
beige swan, a brown swan, a
black swan out there?

52:11.829 --> 52:19.570
So I understand the importance
of me having a voice and
exposing people beyond the
typical

52:19.570 --> 52:24.375
ballet world to this art form.
I think it saved my life. And I
want to introduce it

52:24.375 --> 52:29.480
to more people. And coming full
circle, that's something that
I'm trying to do now,

52:29.480 --> 52:35.319
is to give back to those
communities through Boys and
Girls Clubs, being an alum.

52:35.319 --> 52:41.058
To invite people into my world
as it's happening, I think, is
really amazing. To have grown

52:41.058 --> 52:47.331
men that have never seen a
ballet in their life look at me
and see a woman that they

52:47.331 --> 52:52.369
can relate to, someone who looks
like their sister, their
daughter, their mother, and

52:52.369 --> 52:56.206
to say, well, I'm going to put
my child in that because they
can see themselves through

52:56.206 --> 52:59.109
you, I think it's creating a
completely different path for
these people that never saw
themselves

52:59.109 --> 53:01.512
in this world.

53:01.512 --> 53:06.617
And to watch me still growing in
it and on my path, I think, is
really powerful.

53:06.617 --> 53:12.556
JUDY WOODRUFF: Misty Copeland's
huge talent reminding us just
how far she's come to get

53:12.556 --> 53:17.161
where she is today, yesterday
named the first African-American
woman to be principal dancer

53:17.161 --> 53:20.697
for the American Ballet Theatre.

53:20.697 --> 53:26.437
And on the "NewsHour" online:
How does an expert in time use
structure her day? We

53:26.437 --> 53:30.607
spent an afternoon going through
the to-do list of the director
of the University of

53:30.607 --> 53:35.446
Maryland's Time Use Laboratory.
You won't be surprised to learn
that she doesn't always

53:35.446 --> 53:40.117
practice what she teaches. Her
story is part of our work-life
balance series, and

53:40.117 --> 53:45.722
that's on our home page.
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:45.722 --> 53:48.225
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:48.225 --> 53:53.630
On Thursday, we will kick off a
two-part series on the legendary
band the Grateful Dead, who

53:53.630 --> 53:59.303
are reuniting this weekend for a
series of concerts in Chicago.
But, first, we sit

53:59.303 --> 54:03.440
down with drummer Mickey Hart
and his project to replicate the
sounds of the universe.

54:03.440 --> 54:06.243
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.246
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
at the "PBS NewsHour," thank

54:09.246 --> 54:09.680
you, and good night.
