JUDY WOODRUFF: When it comes
to Wall Street, many people
think of money and greed, but

00:04.933 --> 00:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a professor at Harvard Business
School argues there's a lot
more to the world of finance,

00:11.100 --> 00:13.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and he uses books and
movies to make his case.

00:13.266 --> 00:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our economics correspondent
Paul Solman has the story.

00:16.300 --> 00:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's part of our series
Making Sense, which
airs every Thursday.

00:19.833 --> 00:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTORS: One, two, three!

00:22.266 --> 00:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:24.300 --> 00:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The field
of finance, you might say
it has an image problem.

00:33.633 --> 00:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Consider "The Wolf of
Wall Street," based on
a real-life character.

00:37.133 --> 00:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEONARDO DICAPRIO, Actor:
If anybody here thinks I'm
superficial or materialistic, go

00:40.900 --> 00:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get a job at McDonald's,
because that's where you
(EXPLETIVE DELETED) belong.

00:46.833 --> 00:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

00:48.966 --> 00:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Investment banker
Patrick Bateman in "American
Psycho" is fictional, but not

00:54.300 --> 00:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entirely implausible.

00:56.766 --> 00:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN BALE, Actor: I
have all the characteristics
of a human being, flesh,
blood, skin, hair,

01:01.933 --> 01:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but not a single clear,
identifiable emotion, except
for greed and disgust.

01:08.066 --> 01:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL DOUGLAS, Actor: I am
not a destroyer of companies.

01:10.833 --> 01:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Hey, finance has
had an image problem since
buyout bro Gordon Gekko graced

01:16.700 --> 01:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the silver screen 30 years ago.

01:18.733 --> 01:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL DOUGLAS: The point
is, ladies and gentlemen that
greed, for lack of a better

01:24.600 --> 01:26.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
word, is good.

01:26.066 --> 01:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: Big bank, small
bank, I like to make money.

01:29.533 --> 01:31.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right?

01:31.500 --> 01:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the real
events of the 2008 financial
crisis only made matters worse.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: That's America's
housing market.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Harvard
Business School's Mihir
Desai says there are
two faces to finance,

01:43.366 --> 01:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
though he readily acknowledges
the dark one to his students.

01:45.266 --> 01:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ÑMD+ITÑÑMD-ITÑ MIHIR DESAI,
Harvard Business School: Many

01:46.766 --> 01:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people demonize what you do,
and it's hard to live that way.

01:49.866 --> 01:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And he
told me he gets why that
perception is so pervasive.

01:53.700 --> 01:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: When you have
real-life figures like Martin
Shkreli, who was both a hedge

01:58.200 --> 02:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fund trader and then took over
a pharmaceutical company, jacked
up prices by 5000 percent,

02:05.200 --> 02:08.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
subsequently engaged in
a variety of nefarious
behavior, and very
proudly so, so it almost

02:09.866 --> 02:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
makes you feel like real
life is outpacing fiction.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Desai has
written a book to try
to balance the picture,
"The Wisdom of Finance."

02:18.433 --> 02:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: The goal in the
book is to try to demystify
finance so that the people who

02:20.933 --> 02:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
currently demonize it will
come to understand it, as
opposed to simply oppose it.

02:25.566 --> 02:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then for the people
who are in finance, we have
to get back to the ideas.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The ideas matter.

02:31.066 --> 02:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To Professor
Desai, the big idea of finance
is illustrated by the Quincunx

02:37.000 --> 02:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
machine in Boston's Museum of
Science: the ability to find
order in a seemingly random,

02:42.100 --> 02:44.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and therefore
risk-forsaken, world.

02:44.366 --> 02:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: This was a real
revolution in probability,
which is random things happening

02:50.733 --> 02:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
results in predictable patterns.

02:52.966 --> 02:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Balls drop,
bounce randomly left or
right as they encounter
the pins, and eventually

02:58.433 --> 03:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hit bottom to form
a bell-shaped curve.

03:01.133 --> 03:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: Things that seem
random actually end up resulting
in a very orderly pattern,

03:05.600 --> 03:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in fact, this bell-shaped
distribution or
normal distribution.

03:08.266 --> 03:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, of course, is the
foundation of finance, because
you observe a lot of random

03:12.500 --> 03:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things, but it ends up
behaving in predictable ways.

03:15.866 --> 03:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Randomness and
its risks are everywhere.

03:19.233 --> 03:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Finance's job, to
try to manage them.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Case in point?

03:23.833 --> 03:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The income plight of women
throughout most of history.

03:26.333 --> 03:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: You should consider
that it is by no means certain
that another offer of marriage

03:30.500 --> 03:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
may ever be made to you.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: Mr. Collins, who
delivers the worst proposal
ever to Lizzy Bennet in "Pride

03:37.800 --> 03:39.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Prejudice."

03:39.866 --> 03:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: I am well aware that
1,000 pounds is all you may
ever be entitled to, but rest

03:45.133 --> 03:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
assured I shall never
reproach on that score
when we are married.

03:48.966 --> 03:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: You're not that
wealthy, you're not that
pretty, you have an offer on the

03:52.833 --> 03:54.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
table today from me.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You would better take it.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's the great
economic risk faced by all
Jane Austen's Bennet girls, but

04:00.666 --> 04:02.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
says Desai:

04:02.700 --> 04:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: Lizzy turns down
Mr. Collins, and the advice
of her mother, because she

04:05.400 --> 04:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wants to roll the dice again.

04:07.533 --> 04:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Of course, that ends up
very nicely, ultimately,
with Mr. Darcy, but,
at the time, she didn't

04:10.633 --> 04:12.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
know.

04:12.133 --> 04:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No, Lizzy was
lucky in love and money.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She accepted the risk.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But most others didn't.

04:19.666 --> 04:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: The next day,
he gives the same proposal to
Charlotte, her friend, and she

04:23.466 --> 04:25.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
takes it.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Cousin Elizabeth,
you can see before you
the happiest of men.

04:27.633 --> 04:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Charlotte
Lucas' lot wasn't the
happiest, but better than
penury, one imagines.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: She said, I'm just
going to take the solution.

04:35.366 --> 04:37.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: In Anthony
Trollope "Phineas Finn":

04:37.500 --> 04:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: How nice to find
you and to find you alone.

04:40.766 --> 04:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Violet Effingham
had a very different
problem: too many suitors.

04:47.233 --> 04:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: And you
look very piratical
tonight, Lord Chiltern.

04:49.900 --> 04:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: That is because you see
me by the side of all these
smug, glossy parliament men.

04:53.833 --> 04:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: She doesn't know
who to choose, and she says,
you know, if only I could marry

04:58.000 --> 04:59.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all 10.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, she's the
essence of diversification.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because then
you wouldn't have all
your eggs in one basket.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You would have 10 different
guys, 10 different fortunes.

05:05.766 --> 05:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIHIR DESAI: Exactly.

05:07.766 --> 05:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The intuition that you
can lower risk by dividing
resources is extremely old.

05:13.733 --> 05:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That diversification idea goes
back to shipping, when you split
up your cargo across routes.

05:19.933 --> 05:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It goes back to agriculture,
when people would
split up their land.

05:22.100 --> 05:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Ecclesiastes, we see
the advice to invest in
seven ventures -- no,
eight ventures, because

05:27.366 --> 05:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you never know what
disaster will happen.

05:28.833 --> 05:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So this is
the benign face of finance.

05:32.200 --> 05:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It allows you to protect against
risk by, among other things,
diversifying your investments.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But then there's
the dark face again.

05:41.033 --> 05:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you invest, you're still
stuck with the risk of giving
your money to someone else.

05:45.700 --> 05:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: I gave my
money to Tim Cook, who runs
Apple, and I own one share.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the problem.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't watch Tim Cook.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the underlying problem
becomes, well, wait a second,
how do I monitor that guy?

05:56.366 --> 05:57.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do I watch that guy?

05:57.800 --> 05:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do I make sure he's
doing the right thing for me?

05:59.300 --> 06:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is the
principal-agent problem.

06:02.633 --> 06:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The principal is the
shareholder, who has the wealth.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The agent is the manager
entrusted with it.

06:08.033 --> 06:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: If you only know
what I went through for you.

06:11.633 --> 06:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And principals
and agents can have conflicting
interests, in the case of

06:18.800 --> 06:21.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"The Producers,"
extremely conflicting.

06:21.600 --> 06:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENE WILDER, Actor:
It's absolutely amazing
that, under the right
circumstances, a producer

06:26.433 --> 06:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could make more money with a
flop than he could with a hit.

06:28.800 --> 06:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: The essence of "The
Producers" is that these two
folks, Bialystock and Bloom,

06:35.766 --> 06:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to rip off a bunch of
investors, and by creating a
flop, the investors won't want

06:37.933 --> 06:39.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their money back.

06:39.433 --> 06:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They raised 25000 percent
of what they actually need.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They create this -- what they
think is going to be a flop,
"Springtime For Hitler," and,

06:48.566 --> 06:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of course, it becomes a
hit, and they go to jail.

06:55.933 --> 06:58.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These investors trusted
Bialystock and Bloom.

06:58.466 --> 06:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They couldn't
actually monitor them.

06:59.866 --> 07:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They turned out to be bad eggs.

07:01.766 --> 07:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is the problem
with capital markets.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the problem with me
giving money to people and not
knowing what they end up doing.

07:07.166 --> 07:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, of course,
for every Bialystock,
there's a Buffett, for
every Bernie Madoff,

07:14.166 --> 07:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1,000 honest brokers,
because there have always
been two faces of finance.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: This is actually
my favorite book about finance.

07:21.866 --> 07:23.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's from 1688.

07:23.100 --> 07:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes, a
good year for finance.

07:25.033 --> 07:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: And it was
"Confusion de Confusiones."

07:29.066 --> 07:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He basically describes finance
as the most noble profession,
as well as the most notorious

07:36.233 --> 07:38.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
profession.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have lost sense
of the nobility part that he
describes, and we tend to focus

07:40.900 --> 07:43.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the negative.

07:43.033 --> 07:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Desai, wanting
to accentuate the positive,
uses an exemplar of finance

07:48.300 --> 07:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Willa Cather's 19th
century novel, "O Pioneers!"

07:50.966 --> 07:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: Alexandra
Bergson is this wonderful
character who is a farmer,
who starts by basically

07:57.433 --> 07:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing a leveraged buyout of
farms near where she lives.

07:59.466 --> 08:01.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: She borrows
money in order to buy.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MIHIR DESAI: She borrows
a bunch of money to
buy all of these farms.

08:03.266 --> 08:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: Now, I
have figured it out.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We sell most of the cattle e
and the corn we have left over.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We buy the Lindstrom place.

08:10.066 --> 08:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then we take out two loans
on our half-section and
buy Peter Crow's place.

08:13.866 --> 08:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIHIR DESAI: She ends up
engaging in transactions
that would be in any
finance textbook.

08:18.733 --> 08:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But she never loses
sight of who she is.

08:21.066 --> 08:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She never behaves in ways that
would suggest that she thinks
everything is due to her skill,

08:25.200 --> 08:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as opposed to luck.

08:26.733 --> 08:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's very conscious of and
very humble of her outcome.

08:29.633 --> 08:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: You have worked wonders
with this land, Alexandra.

08:32.266 --> 08:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: Oh, we hadn't any of
us much to do with it, Carl.

08:35.866 --> 08:37.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The land did it.

08:37.900 --> 08:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: We really need good
stories about finance, because
good stories will guide good

08:41.733 --> 08:43.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behavior.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's a lesson Desai
tries to teach his students.

08:45.566 --> 08:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: Pick your stories
carefully, because you will
live your life by these stories.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some of you might
pick Gordon Gekko.

08:51.066 --> 08:52.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't recommend it.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Alexandra Bergson is
a fantastic model.

08:54.866 --> 08:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the
"PBS NewsHour," this is
economics correspondent
Paul Solman reporting

08:59.233 --> 09:01.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Boston.

09:01.433 --> 09:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who knew
by watching all these
films that you could get
great economic advice?

09:07.300 --> 09:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, while writing his book,
Professor Desai says he was
surprised to discover how many

09:11.866 --> 09:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
great writers, painters
and musicians also
held jobs in finance.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
