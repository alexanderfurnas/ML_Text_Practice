JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.041 --> 00:13.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: a
deadly night in Dallas.
Authorities are piecing together

00:13.480 --> 00:19.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a sniper attack that left five
police officers dead and seven
wounded, ending a week filled

00:19.219 --> 00:22.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with violence and sorrow.

00:22.556 --> 00:26.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Here in
Dallas, emotions are still
running high after the worst
attack

00:26.193 --> 00:29.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on police since 9/11. We
will have the latest.

00:29.529 --> 00:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then, I sit down
with Hillary Clinton to talk the
state of race and justice

00:33.700 --> 00:35.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the U.S.

00:35.636 --> 00:40.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: The cuts
across so many of the divides in

00:40.140 --> 00:45.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our country, and it should send
a clarion call to every single
one of us. We do not

00:45.012 --> 00:47.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want to live like this.

00:47.581 --> 00:51.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze this full week of

00:51.985 --> 00:53.453 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

00:53.453 --> 00:59.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:59.493 --> 01:03.730 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.730 --> 01:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This has been a
day of great tragedy in a city
that has known great tragedy

01:11.838 --> 01:14.574 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

01:14.574 --> 01:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night's sniper ambush in
Dallas left five police officers
dead, the worst loss

01:20.213 --> 01:24.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for American law enforcement
since 9/11. It happened just
blocks from where President

01:24.184 --> 01:27.854 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Kennedy was
assassinated in 1963.

01:27.854 --> 01:31.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan begins
our coverage from Dallas.

01:31.692 --> 01:40.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A barrage of
gunfire, the wail of police
sirens, signals that downtown

01:40.534 --> 01:47.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dallas had morphed into a combat
zone. The shooting sent hundreds
of people running for

01:47.074 --> 01:50.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their lives. They had been
peacefully marching against
fatal police shootings in
Minnesota

01:50.243 --> 01:52.312 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Louisiana.

01:52.312 --> 01:57.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JASON MCDANIEL, Dallas: They
just started going off, I mean,
just, pow, pow, pow, pow,

01:57.851 --> 02:03.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pow. And then everybody started
running everywhere. As we were
leaving, we heard the automatic

02:03.657 --> 02:07.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fire, the dah, dah, dah, dah,
the back-to-back fire. And it
was -- it just was wild.

02:07.861 --> 02:11.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Somebody's really
armed to the teeth.

02:11.298 --> 02:14.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The horror was
quickly up on social media for
the world to see. A gunman

02:14.901 --> 02:20.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was spotted shooting a rifle at
police from behind a pillar.

02:20.007 --> 02:24.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, officers cornered a
suspect in a nearby parking
garage. After four hours of
failed

02:24.845 --> 02:28.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
negotiations, police detonated a
bomb on a robotic vehicle,
killing the man.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Dallas Police Chief David Brown:

02:31.418 --> 02:35.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROWN, Dallas Police
Chief: He said he was upset
about the recent police
shootings.

02:35.689 --> 02:42.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The suspect said he was upset at
white people. The suspect stated
he wanted to kill white

02:42.129 --> 02:44.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people, especially
white officers.

02:44.598 --> 02:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Investigators
identified him as Micah Johnson
of Mesquite, Texas. He

02:48.735 --> 02:53.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had served six years in the Army
Reserve, with one tour in
Afghanistan. He told police

02:53.507 --> 02:56.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he had acted alone, and
organizers of the Dallas protest
said they had never heard of

02:56.143 --> 02:57.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

02:57.844 --> 03:01.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Black Lives Matter movement
issued a statement on its main
Twitter page, saying it -- quote

03:01.915 --> 03:06.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "advocates dignity, justice
and freedom, not murder."

03:06.686 --> 03:11.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Authorities initially said three
suspects were in custody. They
gave no other details

03:11.591 --> 03:16.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the day went on. Meanwhile,
much of downtown Dallas was
cordoned off as a crime scene,

03:16.730 --> 03:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
although officials did allow a
prayer vigil. And police Chief
Brown appealed for support

03:19.833 --> 03:21.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and unity.

03:21.668 --> 03:27.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROWN: All I know is that
this must stop, this
divisiveness between our police

03:27.441 --> 03:40.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and our citizens. We don't feel
much support most days. Let's
not make today most days.

03:40.454 --> 03:44.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Until last
night, the Dallas Police
Department had the fewest number
of

03:44.391 --> 03:49.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officer-related shootings of any
American city this year. Still,
this city of 1.3 million

03:49.763 --> 03:53.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people is rattled, and
wondering what comes next.

03:53.667 --> 03:57.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Some of those concerned
residents were at Elaine's
Kitchen in South Dallas.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER REED, Dallas: You never
know what kind of police is
going to pull behind you. And

04:00.874 --> 04:05.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same way, you know, I don't know
what's on the minds of anybody
that wants to cause a

04:05.979 --> 04:10.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harm to a police officer,
because if they can kill one
person, they can kill any
person.

04:10.517 --> 04:14.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHERRUNDA WHITE, Dallas: For
some people, they see things,
what's going on in the world,

04:14.788 --> 04:19.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and think, I guess, they can
take it into their own hands or
retaliate, but, of course,

04:19.593 --> 04:21.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
violence isn't the answer.

04:21.828 --> 04:24.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dallas Mayor
Mike Rawlings called for calm
today, and he vowed greater

04:24.664 --> 04:29.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
protection for police
in the future.

04:29.002 --> 04:32.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dallas killings echoed
around the world as well.
President Obama got the news in
Poland

04:32.372 --> 04:34.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at a NATO summit.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: Let's be clear.
There is no possible
justification

04:37.310 --> 04:44.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for these kinds of attacks or
any violence against law
enforcement. The FBI is already

04:44.351 --> 04:49.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in touch with the Dallas police,
and anyone involved in these
senseless murders will be

04:49.256 --> 04:51.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
held fully accountable.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Washington,
Democrat John Lewis of Georgia
and the Congressional

04:55.195 --> 04:58.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Black Caucus made an
appeal for reconciliation.

04:58.431 --> 05:02.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. JOHN LEWIS (D), Georgia: I
really believe that we must come
to that point in our country

05:02.836 --> 05:07.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where we respect the dignity and
the worth of every human being.
We can do it. But leaders

05:07.841 --> 05:09.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
must lead.

05:09.910 --> 05:13.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And Attorney
General Loretta Lynch also
sought to reassure the country,

05:13.647 --> 05:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after the tumult of recent days.

05:16.082 --> 05:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: Do not let this week
precipitate a new normal in

05:19.519 --> 05:26.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this country. I ask you to turn
to each other, not against each
other, as we move forward.

05:26.693 --> 05:31.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Elsewhere,
protesters did stand united last
night, marching peacefully

05:31.765 --> 05:35.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in New York City, Chicago, and
Philadelphia to demand justice
for black victims killed

05:35.168 --> 05:38.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by police.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There was even one in
Washington, D.C., last night
before I headed home, Judy, that
we

05:41.575 --> 05:44.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stopped by, and streamed
on Facebook live.

05:44.611 --> 05:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Hari, I know
you have been learning more this
evening about this sniper,

05:49.082 --> 05:52.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this gunman. What have
you been able to learn?

05:52.686 --> 05:56.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We knew that
the 25-year-old had been in the
Army Reserve. We knew now

05:56.690 --> 06:01.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- we know now during the day
that he was -- also had a tour
in Afghanistan.

06:01.728 --> 06:05.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what we're also learning is
that, according to police, that
he had been plotting this

06:05.398 --> 06:10.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for quite some time. At his
home, they found a detailed
combat journal. They found a lot

06:10.537 --> 06:15.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bomb-making material. They found
ammunition and rifles. This is
according to the police

06:15.175 --> 06:17.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
chief today.

06:17.510 --> 06:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, they don't think that
there are any known ties to
international organizations

06:22.782 --> 06:25.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or even black nationalist
organizations, but this is a
picture that is going to be
filled

06:25.252 --> 06:27.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in more and more over the
next couple of days.

06:27.821 --> 06:31.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Hari, I know
you have only been there today,
but what is your sense of

06:31.725 --> 06:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how the community is dealing
with this and what are you
learning about the relations

06:35.161 --> 06:39.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there between the people
and the police force?

06:39.899 --> 06:44.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know, I
used to live here for a few
years back when I worked for

06:44.838 --> 06:49.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another network, but one of the
things that was interesting is
that this is a police department

06:49.075 --> 06:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's actually made significant
strides in trying to enforce
community policing, trying

06:53.246 --> 06:55.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get in touch with
their communities.

06:55.815 --> 07:00.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the last several years,
they have decreased the number
of officer-related incidents of

07:00.320 --> 07:03.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violence. They have decreased
the number of arrests. They have
decreased the number of

07:03.857 --> 07:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complaints of use of force. This
is, by all measures throughout
the country, this is a

07:07.961 --> 07:10.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
force that's trying
to do things right.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is actually a greater deal
of trust between the Dallas
Police Department and the

07:13.967 --> 07:15.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
citizens here than there
was 10 years ago.

07:15.235 --> 07:19.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which is
what makes it so ironic.

07:19.873 --> 07:25.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan, reporting for
us from Dallas, we thank you.

07:25.145 --> 07:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police reported attacks in three
more states today after the
Dallas ambush. They said a

07:29.916 --> 07:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suspect in Valdosta, Georgia,
ambushed an officer who answered
a 911 call. Both were

07:35.622 --> 07:41.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wounded. A suburban Saint Louis
man critically wounded a
policeman during a traffic stop.

07:41.628 --> 07:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Bristol, Tennessee,
officers wounded a suspect after
he fired at them.

07:47.367 --> 07:52.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The events in Dallas drew quick
reactions from the presidential
candidates.

07:52.172 --> 07:56.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Donald Trump said, in
a statement: "It is a
coordinated, premeditated
assault

07:56.743 --> 08:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the men and women who keep us
safe. We must restore law and
order."

08:02.148 --> 08:06.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Democrat Hillary Clinton
said in a tweet: "I mourn for
the officers shot while doing

08:06.486 --> 08:10.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their sacred duty to protect
peaceful protesters."

08:10.357 --> 08:14.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have an interview with
Secretary Clinton right after
the news summary.

08:14.928 --> 08:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A sitting member of the U.S.
House has been indicted on fraud
charges. Florida Democrat

08:20.567 --> 08:25.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Corrine Brown and her chief of
staff were charged today. The
indictment says they used

08:25.772 --> 08:29.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
funds from a fraudulent charity
to line their own pockets. The
money was supposed to fund

08:29.843 --> 08:34.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
scholarships for poor students.

08:34.814 --> 08:40.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Economic news, meanwhile, was
positive. Hiring in the U.S.
surged in June, after two months

08:40.820 --> 08:48.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of subpar results. The Labor
Department reports employers
added a net 287,000 jobs, the
most

08:48.128 --> 08:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
since last October. The
unemployment rate rose
two-tenths to 4.9 percent, as
more people

08:53.733 --> 08:57.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
started looking for work.

08:57.837 --> 09:03.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The jobs news helped Wall Street
finish recovering from the
Brexit sell-off. The Dow Jones
industrial

09:03.042 --> 09:09.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
average gained 250 points to
close at 18146. The Nasdaq rose
nearly 80 points, and the

09:09.649 --> 09:13.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
S&amp;P 500 added 32.

09:13.920 --> 09:20.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Iraq, Prime Minister Haider
al-Abadi fired Baghdad's
security chief and accepted the

09:20.059 --> 09:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interior minister's resignation,
after a wave of Islamic State
attacks. At least 186 people

09:27.233 --> 09:34.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
died Sunday in a Baghdad car
bombing, and an attack last
night in Balad killed 37 more

09:34.607 --> 09:39.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a Shiite shrine. A suicide
bomber blew himself up at the
shrine's entrance, allowing

09:39.012 --> 09:42.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other attackers to push inside.

09:42.048 --> 09:46.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iraq's top Shiite cleric
blamed poor security.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AHMED AL-SAFI, Spokesman for
Grand Ayatollah Sistani (through
translator): At the beginning

09:49.889 --> 09:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this week, at the end of the
holy month of Ramadan, ISIS
targeted innocent people

09:54.661 --> 09:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and killed hundreds of them.
Last night, the terrorists
targeted the holy shrine.

09:58.932 --> 10:03.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if the authorities won't
live up to their
responsibilities and put an end
to such security

10:03.837 --> 10:07.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violations, the terrorists will
continue committing crimes
against the Iraqi people.

10:07.707 --> 10:14.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The attacks come
as ISIS has been losing
territory elsewhere in Iraq.

10:14.013 --> 10:19.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The number of refugees seeking
asylum in Germany dropped
sharply in the first half of the
year.

10:19.185 --> 10:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Berlin says 222,000 people have
registered so far. The number
for all of last year topped

10:24.390 --> 10:27.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one million.

10:27.327 --> 10:32.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since then, the Balkan nations
have largely shut off overland
migration, and Turkey has

10:32.365 --> 10:38.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
curbed crossing of the Aegean
Sea in a deal with the European
Union.

10:38.104 --> 10:43.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And back in this country, the
House of Representatives passed
last-minute legislation to stem
the

10:43.042 --> 10:48.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
surge in drug abuse deaths, and
they sent it to the Senate.
Nearly 50,000 people died

10:48.915 --> 10:54.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of drug overdoses in the U.S. in
2014. That's the last year
measured. And it's double the

10:54.254 --> 11:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figure from 2000. More than half
are caused by heroin and
opioids.

11:00.860 --> 11:05.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Hillary Clinton on the Dallas
police shooting and race
relations

11:05.398 --> 11:10.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the U.S.; NATO's largest
military buildup in Europe since
the end of the Cold War; and

11:10.236 --> 11:22.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return to the events in
Dallas and the violence
involving police across the
country

11:25.752 --> 11:28.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this week.

11:28.488 --> 11:32.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we get the perspective of
the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee, Hillary
Clinton.

11:32.992 --> 11:37.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also invited Donald Trump. He
declined, but we hope to talk
with him soon.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spoke with the Secretary
Clinton a short time ago.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome, Secretary Clinton.

11:43.770 --> 11:49.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I talk to you, we're hearing
about still more attacks on the
police in this country.

11:49.742 --> 11:54.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why do you think it is, more
than 50 years after the height
of the civil rights movement,

11:54.581 --> 11:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we're seeing events in this
country like what we have
witnessed this week?

11:58.484 --> 12:01.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: Judy, I
wish I could answer that
question.

12:01.854 --> 12:06.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have thought so much about it.

12:06.292 --> 12:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm not sure of all the
reasons why we are witnessing
this kind of violence. And

12:13.366 --> 12:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have got to look at it
broadly. What happened in
Dallas, what's happening to
other police

12:17.570 --> 12:22.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officers in our country
is absolutely outrageous.

12:22.675 --> 12:27.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got to do much more to
protect and respect the police.
And we have to do much

12:27.313 --> 12:32.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more to make sure that citizens
in our country, particularly
African-Americans, feel
respected

12:32.518 --> 12:35.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and protected by the police.

12:35.755 --> 12:40.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have got to listen to
each other. We need a
conversation. White people need

12:40.960 --> 12:45.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to be listening to
African-Americans about what it
feels like to live with, you
know,

12:45.632 --> 12:50.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fear and anxiety, to be
profiled, to worry about what
will happen to their children
when

12:50.203 --> 12:56.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they go out to play or out
on a date or go for a drive.

12:56.142 --> 13:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to listen to the fears
of our police officers, who get
up every day and do a dangerous

13:01.581 --> 13:04.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job, like the police in Dallas
who ran toward the shooting when
it broke out after a peaceful

13:04.851 --> 13:07.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
protest.

13:07.954 --> 13:12.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to do everything I can
in this campaign to try to find
common ground, bring people

13:12.859 --> 13:18.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
together. And I have got some
specific ideas about what we can
do for criminal justice

13:18.031 --> 13:23.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
reform. We need national
guidelines about the use of
force, particularly lethal
force.

13:23.770 --> 13:30.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to work with the 18,000
police departments in our
country, some of whom are real
models

13:30.076 --> 13:34.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and others should be learning
from about how they de-escalate
tension, rather than turning

13:34.547 --> 13:38.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a routine traffic
stop into a killing.

13:38.351 --> 13:44.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, we need to
investigate the implicit bias
that, unfortunately, too many

13:44.323 --> 13:49.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of us still have. And when it's
an implicit bias in a police
officer, it can lead to an

13:49.062 --> 13:52.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
escalating situation.

13:52.498 --> 13:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have got work to do.
Certainly, our elected
officials, our leaders in our
communities,

13:58.404 --> 14:05.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but really all of us as
Americans have a stake in trying
to listen respectfully to each
other

14:05.011 --> 14:09.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, you know, really try to
find ways we can contribute to
ending this violence that

14:09.749 --> 14:12.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is stalking our nation.

14:12.452 --> 14:17.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you
saying you think you could make
more progress on this than

14:17.957 --> 14:23.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an African-American president
who has made improving race
relations a priority of his

14:23.529 --> 14:25.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration?

14:25.465 --> 14:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I
think President Obama has done
an extraordinary job in trying

14:33.539 --> 14:42.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to explain and provide
information to anyone who's
willing to listen about the
inequities

14:42.849 --> 14:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the difficulties that are
being confronted by so many of
our fellow Americans.

14:49.789 --> 14:57.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His policing commission that he
put together after Ferguson,
Missouri, has excellent
recommendations,

14:57.163 --> 15:02.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but not enough police
departments have followed them.
And I want to put money in the
budget

15:02.635 --> 15:07.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I'm president to make it
possible for every police
department to implement these

15:07.273 --> 15:10.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
important reforms.

15:10.610 --> 15:17.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, too, there has got
to be a national conversation.
And it can't be just elected

15:17.383 --> 15:22.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials. We need people in
communities talking to each
other. You know, during the
primary

15:22.855 --> 15:28.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign in Kentucky, I had a
wonderful experience one Sunday
morning going to an
African-American

15:28.594 --> 15:31.097 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
church.

15:31.097 --> 15:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it just so happened, the day
I was there, they were being
visited by a white church.

15:37.170 --> 15:44.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you had a mixed choir. You
had both preachers addressing
the congregation. You had people

15:44.010 --> 15:49.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shaking hands and exchanging
views and talking about their
lives.

15:49.348 --> 15:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, that may sound easy,
but it's hard in lots of places
in our country. And it needs

15:54.821 --> 15:59.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to happen not just on Sunday.
It needs to happen every day.

15:59.592 --> 16:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as a white person, I want
to make clear that whites have
to listen. We have to recognize,

16:07.400 --> 16:14.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, many of the fears and
anxieties that our
African-American, our Latino and

16:14.407 --> 16:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
others in our society feel. We
saw the terrible shooting at the
Pulse nightclub in Orlando,

16:19.846 --> 16:22.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our LGBT friends.

16:22.682 --> 16:31.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this cuts across so many
of the divides in our country.
And it should send a clarion

16:31.090 --> 16:36.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
call to every single one of us.
We do not want to live like
this. We don't want people,

16:36.028 --> 16:40.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any American, living in fear. We
don't want our police living in
fear.

16:40.299 --> 16:44.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we want to end that,
we're going to have to work
together.

16:44.170 --> 16:48.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Madam Secretary,
we also want to ask you about
the FBI report that came

16:48.741 --> 16:51.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out this week.

16:51.377 --> 16:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We heard the director, James
Comey, say they were not going
to recommend criminal charges

16:57.116 --> 17:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against you, but he said that
you and your colleagues at the
State Department were, in

17:01.554 --> 17:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his words, extremely careless in
the handling of very sensitive,
highly classified information.

17:08.628 --> 17:14.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you believe you benefited
from a double standard, that
ordinary government employees

17:14.834 --> 17:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experience one sort of treatment
and a different one for you?

17:18.104 --> 17:21.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON:
No, not at all.

17:21.474 --> 17:29.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, I think Director Comey
made exactly the opposite point
in his long testimony yesterday,

17:29.382 --> 17:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that those who somehow hoped
that action would be taken are
the ones who were hoping for

17:35.187 --> 17:38.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a double standard.

17:38.024 --> 17:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He made very clear there was no
basis for going forward. And he
also clarified what

17:42.161 --> 17:45.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he said in his statement.

17:45.631 --> 17:51.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, with respect to the
handling of classified material,
I take it very seriously,

17:51.704 --> 17:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the 300 or so people with
whom I e-mailed on the course of
my time in the State Department

17:59.245 --> 18:04.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
do as well. These are
experienced diplomats. They have
expertise in handling classified

18:04.150 --> 18:08.454 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
material. They
were not careless.

18:08.454 --> 18:13.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the material that they sent
to me, they didn't believe was
classified. The very, very

18:13.526 --> 18:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
few examples that Director Comey
pointed to have also been
clarified, as he accounted

18:21.267 --> 18:25.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yesterday. The State Department
has said two of the three that
he had pointed to were human

18:25.905 --> 18:29.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
error. They were not
to be classified.

18:29.108 --> 18:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm very proud of the work
that we did over four years. And
I'm very proud of our

18:34.380 --> 18:39.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
diplomats and our other
professionals, who have to act
in real time. They are
responding

18:39.885 --> 18:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to heads of state, to press
inquiries. And they are doing
the best they can. I do not

18:44.724 --> 18:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe they were careless. I do
not believe that they sent
material that they thought

18:50.363 --> 18:57.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was classified, and certainly no
finding of anything intentional
was made after this
investigation.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last question,
then. Do you think Director
Comey erred in calling it -- in

19:01.907 --> 19:05.378 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
saying it was
extremely careless?

19:05.378 --> 19:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I ask that because one of
the arguments you make in your
comparison with Donald Trump

19:10.383 --> 19:15.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is that you, as a president,
would be more competent than he
would be in the White House.

19:15.588 --> 19:20.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, I
think there is a lot of evidence
to that, based on eight

19:20.726 --> 19:26.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years as a senator handling a
lot of classified material,
based as four years as a
secretary

19:26.899 --> 19:34.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of state, handling classified
material, which, in my view,
didn't include what was sent on

19:34.874 --> 19:39.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an unclassified system, and
certainly was the judgment of
the hundreds of people with

19:39.578 --> 19:43.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
experience and expertise
who dealt with me.

19:43.449 --> 19:50.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, look, I am grateful for the
professionalism of the FBI and
the Department of Justice.

19:50.556 --> 19:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I repeat that I made a
mistake using personal e-mail,
and I regret that very much.

19:55.828 --> 20:01.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think, if one looks at the
totality of my public service
and the very difficult

20:01.901 --> 20:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decisions that I grappled with,
from bin Laden to the Iran
sanctions and so much more,
people

20:08.507 --> 20:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can count on me to do the
job that is required.

20:12.511 --> 20:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary Hillary
Clinton, we thank you for
talking to us on this day.

20:17.083 --> 20:20.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON:
Thank you very much, Judy.

20:20.086 --> 20:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now back
to this week's violence.

20:24.023 --> 20:28.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Minnesota to Texas, it has
brought long-simmering tensions
to the spotlight, sparking a
national

20:28.527 --> 20:31.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dialogue on race and policing.

20:31.597 --> 20:33.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown picks
up that conversation.

20:33.632 --> 20:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And for that, I'm
joined by three people closely
involved with this.

20:38.037 --> 20:44.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Malik Aziz is the deputy police
chief for Dallas. Edward Flynn
is police chief for Milwaukee.

20:44.243 --> 20:48.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His force has faced scrutiny and
protests tied to past police
shootings there. And Michael

20:48.981 --> 20:53.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eric Dyson is a writer and
professor of sociology at
Georgetown University. He is the
author

20:53.886 --> 20:57.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of "The Black Presidency," and
wrote a piece today's The New
York Times called "Death in

20:57.623 --> 20:58.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Black and White."

20:58.457 --> 20:59.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you all.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Malik Aziz, I would
like to start with you.

21:02.962 --> 21:06.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And as we start the
conversation, could I ask you
first, are you able to now to
confirm

21:06.665 --> 21:09.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that it was one shooter
last night in Dallas?

21:09.668 --> 21:12.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALIK AZIZ, Deputy Police Chief,
Dallas Police Department: Well,
all I can really confirm

21:12.004 --> 21:16.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now is that it's -- we
know that it's at least one
shooter.

21:16.208 --> 21:20.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with our investigative unit,
who is one of the best in the
nation, they're turning

21:20.779 --> 21:26.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over every rock and looking in
every crevice to make sure that
the Dallas police, as you

21:26.452 --> 21:30.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heard our chief, David Brown and
the mayor say earlier, that they
believe it's a lone

21:30.623 --> 21:33.192 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
shooter. We just
want to make sure.

21:33.192 --> 21:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we haven't concluded any
investigation. We're just on the
surface. So, right now,

21:37.897 --> 21:42.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have that one lone shooter,
and we're going to make sure
that he is the only one before

21:42.935 --> 21:47.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we release any definitive
totality of statements.

21:47.006 --> 21:51.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell us,
Commander Aziz, your own
feelings, the feelings of
members of the

21:51.277 --> 21:54.480 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
force about what
happened last night.

21:54.480 --> 22:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALIK AZIZ: Well, I can say,
extend my heartfelt condolences
and heartfelt sympathy to the

22:01.921 --> 22:08.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family, friends, loved ones, my
brothers and sisters in blue
across the nation and abroad,

22:08.127 --> 22:16.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that our hearts here in Dallas
today are very heavy, a very
somber attitude, one of
disbelief.

22:16.535 --> 22:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is one of those days. I
have been in law enforcement 27
years here in the city

22:21.640 --> 22:27.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or county of Dallas, and I have
never had a day like yesterday.
It's a day of days,

22:27.846 --> 22:31.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the worst day of our career
and my career and many others,
and one of the worst in the

22:31.817 --> 22:33.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nation.

22:33.953 --> 22:39.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So our men and women are hurt
today, but I must say the
outpouring of the residential

22:39.725 --> 22:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and business community in
Dallas, our awesome citizenry,
and they have shown why they're

22:45.064 --> 22:48.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the best cities in the
world, that Dallas is one of the
best cities in the world.

22:48.634 --> 22:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have shown us so much love
and support, and so much love
and support in the nation

22:51.237 --> 22:53.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and abroad.

22:53.439 --> 22:58.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Chief Flynn in
Milwaukee, what impact has there
been in your force or perhaps

22:58.711 --> 23:01.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in other forces from what
happened last night?

23:01.614 --> 23:05.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EDWARD FLYNN, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin, Police Chief: Well, I
think it's a recognition -- and

23:05.751 --> 23:11.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's certainly a topic of
discussion among our officers --
of the great conundrum that

23:11.123 --> 23:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surrounds American policing,
which it is very important for
us, most specifically, to
protect

23:15.160 --> 23:19.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the rights of the people
most displeased with us.

23:19.098 --> 23:23.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done that many times
here in Milwaukee, and that
takes place in city after city
across

23:23.002 --> 23:29.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country. Dallas is a fine
police department, but it's not
an anomaly among American big

23:29.141 --> 23:33.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cities. Going all the way back
to the mid-'90s, when the
Clinton administration passed
the

23:33.879 --> 23:38.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
omnibus crime bill, policing has
embraced the notion of
community-based policing,
reaching

23:38.851 --> 23:43.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out to disadvantaged
neighborhoods and doing our best
to create alliances with those
neighborhoods

23:43.355 --> 23:47.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to work with them to
create safe environments.

23:47.626 --> 23:52.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what we endeavor to
do. And there is no group of
people in America more committed

23:52.197 --> 23:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to protecting black lives than
America's police officers in our
urban centers. We're the one

23:56.869 --> 24:01.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group of people, in fact, that
regularly risk our lives to do
that.

24:01.373 --> 24:04.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, and,
Michael Eric Dyson, I will bring
you into this now.

24:04.143 --> 24:10.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What impact does what happened
last night have on this larger
ongoing discussion of

24:10.683 --> 24:13.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the shooting of many
African-Americans by the police?

24:13.719 --> 24:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL ERIC DYSON, Professor,
Georgetown University: Well, it
throws into the bold

24:15.621 --> 24:23.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relief that all lives of course
are significant, important and,
ultimately, clearly, matter.

24:23.929 --> 24:29.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When Black Lives Matter says
their theme, what they're trying
to underscore is that

24:29.168 --> 24:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is an historic legacy and
pattern of inequality that has
prevailed in this culture

24:33.205 --> 24:37.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that has stigmatized
and demonized others.

24:37.042 --> 24:41.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reality is, when we look at
the situation in Dallas, the
lives of those police people

24:41.847 --> 24:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are significant and matter. They
should be taken seriously. We
grieve with them in that

24:46.985 --> 24:51.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city and nation for the loss of
life by a deranged person who
sought to execute his

24:51.824 --> 24:55.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vision of justice in the world.

24:55.861 --> 24:59.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want the same empathy of
the police departments of this
nation which do a fine

24:59.998 --> 25:05.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
job in many instances to defend
the lives of those who have been
vulnerable. When police

25:05.904 --> 25:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people act with disregard for
life, and end up targeting one
population vs. another, when

25:14.747 --> 25:21.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the lethal and ferocious
consequences of policing in
situations like we have seen
this week

25:21.487 --> 25:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
occur, we want the police, who
we defend, who I will defend and
say they have a righteous

25:27.025 --> 25:31.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
duty and job to do, we also want
these police to say, this
doesn't represent the best of

25:31.296 --> 25:35.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who we are, this doesn't
represent what our ideals are.

25:35.267 --> 25:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when citizens who are
clearly not in the wrong and who
are trying to comply with the

25:41.440 --> 25:47.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wishes of a particular police
person who are then killed, we
have to have the police
supporting

25:47.546 --> 25:54.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
citizens who suggest that that
is wrong, even as citizens
should stand behind great police

25:54.119 --> 25:56.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, two of which -- two of
which whose representatives we
have on the show today,

25:56.955 --> 25:59.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to say, this is the
appropriate thing.

25:59.725 --> 26:03.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask, Malik
Aziz, react, respond to that,
please, because the Dallas

26:03.796 --> 26:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police Department has been
considered a leader in community
involvement and bringing down

26:08.600 --> 26:12.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the numbers of killings. What is
your response to Michael Eric
Dyson?

26:12.237 --> 26:17.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALIK AZIZ: Well, yes, we have
just what he said. Community
policing, community engagement,

26:17.943 --> 26:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dallas police has -- every chief
has built on a strong foundation
and endeavored to make

26:22.114 --> 26:24.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it better.

26:24.416 --> 26:31.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There can be no progress actual
unless we actually work
together. The police and the

26:31.023 --> 26:35.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community must work together.
There is no us vs. them. It's
only us working together.

26:35.627 --> 26:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when we look at things, and
we must show compassion. Any
police officer, any police

26:41.467 --> 26:46.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
chief who doesn't show
compassion or you don't think
he's bothered when we have to
take a

26:46.071 --> 26:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life, it is not easy. And we are
often in those things because,
by the very nature of

26:52.211 --> 26:57.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the job, it calls on us to
engage. And we want to engage
the right way. We want to be

26:57.549 --> 26:59.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accountable.

26:59.117 --> 27:03.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why we have police chief
and police leaders to make sure
that we are responsible

27:03.155 --> 27:10.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and accountable, but we also
must endeavor to actually have a
coalescing of community

27:10.128 --> 27:15.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and police and realize that
we're not on an island when it
comes to policing.

27:15.434 --> 27:21.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we don't actually -- if a
community doesn't actually
demand for a right way to be
policed,

27:21.039 --> 27:24.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then you will leave it up to the
police to give you our version
of policing. And that

27:24.743 --> 27:27.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may not be what community
actually needs.

27:27.679 --> 27:32.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Edward Flynn, let
me ask you. This is also a day
in which we have had a

27:32.351 --> 27:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of -- some talk on social
media and elsewhere that the
rhetoric against police is
perhaps

27:37.856 --> 27:41.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
inciting violence as we
saw last night in Dallas.

27:41.760 --> 27:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you see a growing anti-police
atmosphere in the country?

27:47.366 --> 27:53.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDWARD FLYNN: I think what we're
finding on the streets of our
cities is a level of license

27:53.639 --> 27:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being taken by the offending
community to challenge officers
on the streets of our most

27:58.844 --> 28:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disadvantaged neighborhoods,
where our efforts are the most
important and most requested.

28:05.317 --> 28:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what we need to do is
step back from this binary
discussion we're having right

28:09.221 --> 28:14.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now that, on the right hand, we
talk about police use of force,
when it's right or when

28:14.092 --> 28:18.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's apparently wrong, and then
on the left hand, we talk about
the fact that the greatest

28:18.564 --> 28:24.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disparity of race in America
right now is as a crime victim,
all right?

28:24.336 --> 28:29.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our central cities, our
communities of disadvantage
characterized by
intergenerational poverty

28:29.107 --> 28:34.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the highest rates of
violence for what we like to
call the industrialized society.

28:34.112 --> 28:39.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're the most heavily armed,
most violent society in the
industrialized West.

28:39.217 --> 28:43.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is our African-American
communities of disadvantage that
suffer the most from

28:43.956 --> 28:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it. Their partners in dealing
with it are the police, who are
often placed in difficult

28:48.727 --> 28:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or ambiguous circumstances and
sometimes do the wrong thing,
but overwhelmingly are the

28:52.130 --> 28:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
community partners.

28:55.300 --> 28:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we're going to have that
community discussion, we have to
talk about it all at the same
time,

28:59.972 --> 29:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the same neighborhoods
with the highest rates of
violence have the highest rates
of

29:03.008 --> 29:07.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
poverty, unemployment,
substandard housing and lack of
education.

29:07.045 --> 29:09.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We haven't had that
conversation in 40 years.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.683 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So,
Michael Eric Dyson...

29:11.683 --> 29:13.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDWARD FLYNN: We have been
delegating America's social
problems to the police.

29:13.552 --> 29:16.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, how do we get
there in our last minute here?

29:16.955 --> 29:19.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL ERIC DYSON: No, it's
extremely important to take what
the chief said, to integrate

29:19.591 --> 29:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all of those facets together.

29:22.661 --> 29:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we talk about the economic
inequality that prevails in the
cities, when police are

29:26.465 --> 29:31.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thrown into the cauldron,
seething as it is, when black
and brown people are subject to

29:31.970 --> 29:36.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes excessive use of force
against them, when they are
policed by people who come from

29:36.842 --> 29:41.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside of their communities,
community policing is a grand
and great ideal.

29:41.113 --> 29:46.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that the issues of
inequality must be put forth on
the table. And the respect

29:46.585 --> 29:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for human life, why is it that
there is a vicious repetition of
pattern in certain communities

29:51.890 --> 29:56.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not others? We must see each
other as human beings. We must
acknowledge the difficulty

29:56.828 --> 30:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the job that the police have
to do, but also to respect the
humanity of those people.

30:01.400 --> 30:06.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we see this week the tragic
loss of life of those police,
but before that two black

30:06.304 --> 30:11.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
victims who didn't deserve to
die, and we would expect the
police to say, this is wrong,

30:11.910 --> 30:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is a scurrilous and, I
think, an insensitive offense to
any American.

30:17.516 --> 30:22.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And when we see police
empathizing with that, then
those who empathize with the
police can

30:22.020 --> 30:26.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bridge that gulf. And, together,
we can address the issues that
need to be addressed.

30:26.024 --> 30:30.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Michael Eric
Dyson, Milwaukee Police Chief
Edward Flynn, and Malik Aziz

30:30.195 --> 30:31.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Dallas, thank you,
three, very much.

30:31.496 --> 30:36.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL ERIC DYSON:
Thank you so kindly.

30:36.134 --> 30:43.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MALIK AZIZ: Thank you.

30:43.775 --> 30:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: Leaders
from NATO countries met in
Poland today to finalize plans
to beef

30:51.583 --> 30:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up the military alliance.

30:54.786 --> 30:59.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time since the
Cold War, multinational troops
will continuously rotate through
four

30:59.191 --> 31:02.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
countries in Eastern Europe.

31:02.561 --> 31:06.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Nick
Schifrin, with the help of the
Pulitzer Center on Crisis

31:06.965 --> 31:11.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reporting, concludes our series
with a look at America's largest
military buildup there

31:11.903 --> 31:17.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a quarter-century, and why
Russia sees it as a threat.

31:17.509 --> 31:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Here's the
scenario: An unnamed enemy has
invaded a NATO ally. The U.S.
response

31:30.489 --> 31:36.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is heavy and swift. For U.S.
troops who have been fighting in
Iraq and Afghanistan, this

31:36.261 --> 31:38.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is more firepower than
they have ever had.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: That (EXPLETIVE DELETED)
was (EXPLETIVE DELETED) wild.

31:40.499 --> 31:44.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAPT. JOEL MARBUT, U.S. Army: We
have been fighting an insurgency
for the last 14 years.

31:44.202 --> 31:49.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we're prepared to fight
someone who is closely matched
to our combat power.

31:49.875 --> 31:54.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Captain Joel
Marbut deployed twice to
Afghanistan. This exercise, held

31:54.312 --> 31:58.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last month, was the largest in
Eastern Europe since the Cold
War.

31:58.383 --> 32:00.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAPT. JOEL MARBUT: Now they're
prepared for any enemy
counterattack to come back
across

32:00.418 --> 32:02.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the international border.

32:02.487 --> 32:06.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Marbut isn't
allowed to name that enemy. But
in the command tent, Lieutenant

32:06.124 --> 32:10.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Colonel Johnny Evans pulls fewer
punches when discussing his
Polish hosts.

32:10.562 --> 32:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. COL. JOHNNY EVANS, U.S.
Army: And they see examples of
Russian aggression. Us being

32:15.467 --> 32:19.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, assuring them that the
U.S. has not abandoned them,
that the U.S. is still a strong

32:19.137 --> 32:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supporter of NATO can do nothing
but provide additional
assurance.

32:23.809 --> 32:28.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On the training
ground, there was even a
burned-out Soviet-style tank for

32:28.213 --> 32:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
target practice. This is not
only assurance to allies. It's
also deterrence and a warning

32:32.083 --> 32:38.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Russia.

32:38.156 --> 32:43.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After the Cold War, the U.S.
military dramatically downsized
in Europe, from 200,000 to
30,000

32:43.328 --> 32:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
troops. Now the U.S. is planning
to quadruple spending. And it
will rotate 4,200-soldier

32:48.934 --> 32:52.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heavily armored brigades back to
back with their own equipment at
the highest level of

32:52.003 --> 32:53.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
readiness.

32:53.471 --> 32:57.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. GEN. BEN HODGES, Commander,
U.S. Army Europe: That is a
powerful capability that

32:57.642 --> 33:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be very effective at help
-- changing the calculus for
Russia or any potential
adversary

33:03.815 --> 33:06.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Europe.

33:06.017 --> 33:11.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: General Ben
Hodges commands all U.S. Army
forces in Europe. Those new

33:11.356 --> 33:15.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American troops are in addition
to 700-person NATO battalions
deploying to the Baltic states

33:15.627 --> 33:17.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Poland.

33:17.295 --> 33:20.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We spoke to Hodges during
the Poland exercise.

33:20.098 --> 33:25.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. GEN. BEN HODGES: I think a
combination of a NATO battalion,
plus a U.S. armored brigade

33:25.937 --> 33:30.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
combat team, that's a powerful
deterrent. If deterrence fails,
now you're talking about

33:30.442 --> 33:32.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a liberation campaign.

33:32.844 --> 33:37.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For the Poles,
that word liberation doesn't
feel farfetched.

33:37.716 --> 33:40.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNA MARIA ANDERS, Polish
Senator: The Poles are very
nervous, obviously, because of
World

33:40.685 --> 33:42.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War II.

33:42.654 --> 33:46.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Few Polish
politicians have more World War
II credentials than Minister

33:46.524 --> 33:51.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Senator Anna Maria Anders.
Her father was Wladyslaw Anders,
who fought the Soviets

33:51.997 --> 33:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as Poland's army commander.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, this community remembers
how, during the war, the Soviets
deported local residents

33:58.803 --> 34:00.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Siberia.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA MARIA ANDERS: These people
are worried that it will happen
again.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What convinced
them it could happen again?

34:04.476 --> 34:06.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANNA MARIA ANDERS:
Crimea. Crimea.

34:06.678 --> 34:10.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In 2014, Russian
soldiers in Crimea sparked an
annexation from Ukraine.

34:10.282 --> 34:12.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It took less than a month.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA MARIA ANDERS: I think that
we all have become a little
complacent. We haven't had

34:15.420 --> 34:19.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a war in so long.

34:19.124 --> 34:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: U.S. soldiers are
teaching Poles military
hardware, starting in childhood.

34:24.296 --> 34:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. COL. DERIC HOLBROOK, U.S.
Army: That's where the trust
starts, from that youngest

34:28.333 --> 34:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generation building trust. They
understand that America is
aligned with Poland.

34:34.673 --> 34:41.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Lieutenant
Colonel Deric Holbrook leads the
2nd Cavalry's Field Artillery
Squadron.

34:41.780 --> 34:46.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of the Polish exercise is
visiting small towns like
Suwalki. Soldiers and fathers
encouraged

34:46.384 --> 34:50.422 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
kids to become
comfortable with guns.

34:50.422 --> 34:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearby, young baton twirlers
entertained the crowd. It seemed
like this entire town of

34:57.996 --> 35:06.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
60,000 showed up in support. The
next morning, Holbrook's men hit
the road.

35:06.471 --> 35:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were on a 500-mile drive,
the longest military movement in
Eastern Europe since

35:11.443 --> 35:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
World War II. They drove through
this 60-mile-wide gap between
NATO members Poland and
Lithuania.

35:16.247 --> 35:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the Suwalki Gap, where
NATO's notion of collective
self-defense is perhaps most

35:23.388 --> 35:28.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vulnerable. Thirty miles to my
west is Kaliningrad, a Russian
enclave. Thirty miles to my
east,

35:28.226 --> 35:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Belarus, a Russian ally. If
Russia wanted to move into this
gap, it could most likely

35:34.466 --> 35:39.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cut off the Baltic states from
the rest of Europe and the rest
of NATO.

35:39.437 --> 35:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That geography is a product of
NATO's expansion east. In 1949,
NATO's eastern border was Italy.

35:45.076 --> 35:51.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By 1999, it had added seven more
countries, by 2009, nine more
countries, including the

35:51.116 --> 35:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Baltics. Suddenly, NATO had
beachheads on Russia's borders.

35:54.786 --> 35:58.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIMITRI SIMES, Center for the
National Interest: If we would
discover that there would be
Russian

35:58.857 --> 36:05.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
troops in Mexico, I wonder how
many American politicians and
indeed American people would

36:05.930 --> 36:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that think this is an
acceptable situation.

36:08.700 --> 36:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Dimitri Simes
leads the Washington think tank
the center for the National
Interest.

36:15.006 --> 36:20.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For Russia, NATO isn't
defensive. Since 1999, NATO has
launched wars in Kosovo,
Afghanistan

36:20.445 --> 36:24.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Libya. Each one
ended in regime change.

36:24.182 --> 36:30.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIMITRI SIMES: That certainly
made an impression in Moscow
that NATO expansion was a direct

36:30.288 --> 36:34.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threat, not just to their
security, but also to their
domestic stability.

36:34.626 --> 36:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Russia again felt
threatened when the U.S. either
encouraged or supported

36:38.696 --> 36:43.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revolutions in previously
pro-Russian countries. The final
straw was Ukraine.

36:43.868 --> 36:51.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIMITRI SIMES: If Ukraine is
hostile and joins NATO, that
would be viewed by Russia as an

36:51.142 --> 36:53.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
existential threat.

36:53.445 --> 36:57.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: This isn't only
the thinking of intellectuals or
the Moscow elite.

36:57.649 --> 37:00.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VITALIY ANATOLIEVICH, Cossack
Commander (through translator):
We are not going to Mexico.
Imagine

37:00.385 --> 37:03.388 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
if Russia moved
its troops there.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Vitaliy
Anatolievich is a Cossack
commander in the breakaway
Ukrainian region

37:06.991 --> 37:12.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Donetsk. His forefathers,
known as free Cossacks, were
notorious and feared 19th
century

37:12.664 --> 37:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
horsemen. They fought and died
for this land they referred to
as Greater Russia.

37:19.671 --> 37:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, they're training their
children what Cossacks have
stood for, for generations,

37:25.510 --> 37:36.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
love of land and church. It's a
nostalgia for the days before
the Soviet Union collapsed.

37:36.855 --> 37:40.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you feel like what you're
doing now is trying to restore
the power and pride that

37:40.425 --> 37:43.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was lost in 1991?

37:43.328 --> 37:46.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VITALIY ANATOLIEVICH (through
translator): Of course I feel
that. It's a renaissance

37:46.264 --> 37:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
here. This is pure patriotism.

37:49.434 --> 37:53.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That patriotism
is a pledge to be an irregular
force for Russia in Ukraine

37:53.905 --> 37:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and beyond. And they cheer
disunity in the European Union
because they oppose what they

37:57.442 --> 38:00.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
perceive as Western culture.

38:00.278 --> 38:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VITALIY ANATOLIEVICH (through
translator): We don't educate
them as they do in Europe

38:03.414 --> 38:08.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about gay pride and all that. Is
that normal? It's not normal.

38:08.319 --> 38:13.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The cultural and
military divides within Europe
are widening. Another flash

38:13.591 --> 38:16.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point? Newly built NATO missile
defense sites in Romania and
Poland. Russia labels them

38:16.794 --> 38:20.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
threats, and vows to retaliate.

38:20.498 --> 38:25.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President: Yesterday, in those
areas of Romania, people simply
didn't

38:25.370 --> 38:29.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know what it means to be in the
crosshairs. Then, today, we will
be forced to carry out

38:29.407 --> 38:32.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
certain measures to
ensure our security.

38:32.277 --> 38:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. GEN. BEN HODGES: For Russia
to say that this is threatening
to them is a ridiculous

38:34.846 --> 38:36.714 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assertion.

38:36.714 --> 38:39.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Russia would say
those missile defense systems
can be turned from the Middle

38:39.717 --> 38:42.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
East toward Russia.

38:42.587 --> 38:47.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. GEN. BEN HODGES: If -- and
it's extremely unlikely -- but
if Russia ever launched a

38:47.892 --> 38:52.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear or a missile strike, I
mean, there would be hundreds of
missiles. So this defense

38:52.797 --> 39:01.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shield that's been installed is
for individual -- I mean, it's a
completely different scenario.

39:01.339 --> 39:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: President Putin's
threats are made possible by
nearly a decade of Russian

39:08.079 --> 39:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military expansion. According to
one study, if it wanted to,
Russia could overwhelm NATO

39:12.217 --> 39:17.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
troops in the Baltics in
fewer than three days.

39:17.522 --> 39:20.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it really a deterrence to
have a few battalions in Eastern
Europe, when Russia has hundreds

39:20.191 --> 39:23.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of thousands of troops
across the border?

39:23.328 --> 39:28.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LT. GEN. BEN HODGES: You make a
fair point. Certainly, Russia
has been provocative. They

39:28.299 --> 39:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk about nuclear weapons
against Sweden, Denmark,
Romania.

39:32.870 --> 39:37.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIMITRI SIMES: When they feel
that they are threatened, they
have a tendency to close

39:37.976 --> 39:43.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ranks. Putin now has universal
excuse. Whatever is going wrong
in Russia, he is blaming it

39:43.681 --> 39:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Obama, he is blaming it on
NATO, he is blaming it on the
European Union.

39:48.920 --> 39:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most patriotic Russians,
they feel, well, perhaps our
country is being under
tremendous

39:54.859 --> 39:57.161 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
threat.

39:57.161 --> 40:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: That fuels a
cycle of increasingly large
exercises and increasingly
violent warnings.

40:02.533 --> 40:05.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This level of tension hasn't
been felt in a generation. And
it's being taught by both

40:05.270 --> 40:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sides to the next generation.

40:07.939 --> 40:18.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick
Schifrin in Szczecin, Poland.

40:18.082 --> 40:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.
That's syndicated columnist Mark

40:25.857 --> 40:29.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shields and New York Times
columnist David Brooks.

40:29.994 --> 40:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Welcome to you both, although
the show, the program tonight,
Mark and David, consumed

40:35.166 --> 40:40.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with these killings of two black
men by police in Minnesota and
Louisiana, and then, last

40:40.071 --> 40:44.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
night, this terrible attack
on the police in Dallas.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of
all this, David?

40:46.944 --> 40:51.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it's
been a crappy week.

40:51.482 --> 40:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had the killings. We
have had, frankly, both our
presidential candidates behaving

40:56.688 --> 41:02.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reprehensibly. And so I think
we're sort of at a moment where,
on the one hand, a lot

41:02.193 --> 41:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of harsh truths are being
exposed, a lot of people who
have been silent are speaking
out.

41:08.566 --> 41:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of that is about
violence, as we have seen,
against African-Americans.
Frankly,

41:11.336 --> 41:13.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the Trump movement, it's
members of the white working
class speaking out. And

41:13.871 --> 41:16.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's all to the good.

41:16.908 --> 41:23.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question, to me, is, are we
going to speak out in a way that
is actual dialogue and
conversation,

41:23.281 --> 41:27.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or are we going to drift into
tribal thinking? There's been a
lot of rancid
overgeneralizations

41:27.852 --> 41:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our society, that all African
men behind the wheel are
dangerous, that all Muslims

41:31.856 --> 41:38.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are somehow involved in
terrorism, that all cops are
somehow at war with communities.

41:38.996 --> 41:43.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we can speak in a way
that's not tribalistic, that's
not making these
generalizations, then

41:43.668 --> 41:47.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we may make something out of the
current moment. But I'm not
always hopeful after a bad week

41:47.171 --> 41:48.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this one.

41:48.373 --> 41:52.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, what do
you make out of all this?

41:52.243 --> 41:57.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, I think that
we all -- or at least I --
speaking for myself, I was
overconfident,

41:57.515 --> 42:01.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over-optimistic in 2008.

42:01.252 --> 42:08.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought the original sin of
America, racism, that it was a
time to celebrate, that we had

42:08.893 --> 42:12.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done something really rather
remarkable in electing an
African -- and we did --
electing

42:12.563 --> 42:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an African-American president,
and that, somehow, with -- this
terrible chapter was behind us.

42:18.202 --> 42:24.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The constant in every one of
these killings and tragedies
this week is race. And I get

42:24.876 --> 42:32.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the feeling, almost like 1968,
that events are in the saddle.
It's not Vietnam. There

42:32.617 --> 42:37.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aren't 548 Americans dying every
week. And we haven't had a James
Earl Ray or a Sirhan

42:37.221 --> 42:43.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sirhan yet to assassinate our
leaders, but just a sense,
whether it's Zika, whether it's

42:43.060 --> 42:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Istanbul, whether it's Orlando,
that events are in the saddle
and that things are not

42:48.900 --> 42:50.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to get better.

42:50.401 --> 42:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a dreary political
landscape right now.

42:54.205 --> 42:59.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, this is a
year where there has been,
David, a lot of anger and

42:59.844 --> 43:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recrimination in the political
conversation. How do the events
of this week play into that?

43:03.815 --> 43:06.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see that?

43:06.050 --> 43:09.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it's
a period of bad feeling.

43:09.353 --> 43:14.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when bad feeling happen,
then walls go up and things
close. And we're seeing a lot

43:14.926 --> 43:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of closed-ness, a lot that
things that were open, whether
it was open trade, open free

43:18.129 --> 43:22.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
movement of people, open
conversations, some of that's
closing, or at least the
impulses

43:22.967 --> 43:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within a lot of societies,
including in NATO, by the way,
which we just heard about,
between

43:25.803 --> 43:28.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eastern and Western Europe, a
lot of walls going up and a lot
of candidates proposing

43:28.873 --> 43:31.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
walls going up.

43:31.876 --> 43:37.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when people are in a
period of bad mood, then they
want to hunker down and protect.

43:37.648 --> 43:42.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the exact opposite
from what we need now. And let's
be frank. It doesn't help

43:42.920 --> 43:48.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that we have an American
political debate with basically
one all-white party.

43:48.359 --> 43:54.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that just means we fall
along very polarized lines when
we fall into the normal default

43:54.599 --> 43:59.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
position of politics, that we
fall along racially polarized
lines. And we have to
acknowledge

43:59.604 --> 44:03.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's an inherently dangerous
situation, given everything else
that's happening.

44:03.207 --> 44:06.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Mark? Are we just not equipped
to deal with these issues

44:06.911 --> 44:09.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anymore, that we have
become so polarized?

44:09.146 --> 44:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: We have become
incredibly polarized, Judy.

44:12.483 --> 44:19.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I don't think if it's a
consequence or reflection of the
silos from which we get our
information,

44:19.023 --> 44:21.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I don't have to listen to
the other side. I can just get
my own prejudice and perspective

44:21.893 --> 44:25.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reinforced.

44:25.429 --> 44:33.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we are in a time of
incredible political division,
made more so by our polarized
politics.

44:33.204 --> 44:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we -- there used to be a
great test in politics when I
first started in the business,

44:39.911 --> 44:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it used to be, can you make
a statement for your candidate
for 90 seconds without

44:42.413 --> 44:45.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mentioning your opponent?

44:45.349 --> 44:52.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's unthinkable in this
election year, when, according
to the very respected Pew

44:52.423 --> 45:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
poll, a majority of both
Secretary Clinton's and Mr.
Trump's supporters are basically
voting

45:02.066 --> 45:08.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against their opponent, rather
than for their own candidate.
And I think that's a reflection

45:08.039 --> 45:11.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the condition of our
politics right now.

45:11.008 --> 45:15.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, if you
single out, if you look at
Donald Trump for a moment,
David,

45:15.746 --> 45:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he clearly has been saying some
things that have brought, I
think, consternation to some.

45:21.686 --> 45:25.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And people would say, well,
there's blame to go around.

45:25.289 --> 45:31.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But Donald Trump was in
Washington this week, we were
told, to try to bring unity to
the

45:31.662 --> 45:34.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Party, to meet, sit
down with members of Congress
who are Republican to try to
bring

45:34.999 --> 45:38.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them on board, and it ended up,
apparently, in his meeting with
Republican senators dissolving

45:38.636 --> 45:42.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into more name-calling.

45:42.373 --> 45:45.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, what -- how united is
the Republican Party right now
with just one week to go before

45:45.876 --> 45:46.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their convention?

45:46.911 --> 45:50.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Not at all.

45:50.915 --> 45:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gave a speech earlier in the
week, the Star of David,
mosquito speech, whatever you

45:54.719 --> 45:58.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to call it. This speech --
Mike Murphy, the Republican
consultant, said he's always

45:58.255 --> 46:00.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ranting, but, sometimes, he
veers into full drunk wedding
toast mode.

46:00.625 --> 46:02.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:02.326 --> 46:07.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And that speech
was incoherent in its logic and
random and what one senses

46:07.598 --> 46:10.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in him, rising resentment.

46:10.735 --> 46:15.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In that speech, he ripped on
CNN. He ripped on whoever was in
his way. And then he comes

46:15.106 --> 46:18.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Washington and he rips on
whoever is not totally loyal to
him, whether it's Ben Sasse

46:18.743 --> 46:22.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or Mark Kirk, two senators.

46:22.980 --> 46:28.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he's just filled with a
resentment, even at this moment
of incipient triumph,

46:28.219 --> 46:33.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least in the nomination. And
so you see Donald Trump being
ever more Trumpian, and

46:33.624 --> 46:36.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rather than being more
tame and more civilized.

46:36.193 --> 46:39.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you see a
little more unity in the
Republican Party or less?

46:39.864 --> 46:47.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think there's a
forced sense of unity right now,
when Bill Flores, Republican

46:47.104 --> 46:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
congressman from Texas, says
that very encouraging that Mr.
Trump is making fewer and fewer
unforced

46:53.277 --> 46:56.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
errors, and he thought
that is great progress.

46:56.814 --> 47:04.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree with David about the
performance yesterday before the
Republican Senate Caucus in
particular,

47:04.355 --> 47:09.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he took on Jeff Flake, the
senator from Arizona, and said,
you're going to lose this

47:09.960 --> 47:13.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year. And, of course, Jeff Flake
isn't running this year. John
McCain is. They have six-year

47:13.998 --> 47:17.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terms in the Senate. I don't
know if Mr. Trump's aware of
that.

47:17.501 --> 47:23.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then beating up on Mark
Kirk, who is an embattled
Republican in Illinois, very
difficult

47:23.374 --> 47:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
uphill race. And, Judy, I mean,
where was Mitch McConnell, the
Republican Senate leader,

47:29.380 --> 47:33.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stand up and say, wait a
minute, you're not going to come
in here, Mr. Trump, I don't

47:33.084 --> 47:37.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care if you are the presidential
nominee, and attack and belittle
and demean the senators

47:37.288 --> 47:40.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
whose support you're
supposedly seeking?

47:40.491 --> 47:47.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just -- so, there is a
lack of courage, there is a lack
of just common decency, it

47:47.364 --> 47:49.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seems to me, in the
Republicans right now.

47:49.834 --> 47:54.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, meantime,
David, we know that the
Democratic nominee to be, as you

47:54.004 --> 47:58.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pointed out, has had her
own bad news this week.

47:58.509 --> 48:04.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As you may have seen, I
interviewed her a short time ago
for the program and asked her

48:04.115 --> 48:08.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about FBI Director Jim Comey's
conclusion that, no, there
weren't going to be criminal

48:08.953 --> 48:13.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charges brought, but that she
and the people around her had
been extremely careless in

48:13.290 --> 48:16.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the way they handled
confidential information.

48:16.093 --> 48:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said that is not the case,
that that's wrong. But, you
know, whichever way you look

48:22.233 --> 48:27.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at that, what are we to make of
this investigation, of its
conclusion? Where does it leave
her

48:27.338 --> 48:29.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the presumptive nominee?

48:29.974 --> 48:34.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I agree with
both sides of Comey's
conclusion, that she shouldn't

48:34.345 --> 48:41.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be charged, but that, basically,
the defense she has given us and
for all these months

48:41.285 --> 48:46.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was a tissue of lies, that she
didn't have one device, she sent
over 100 classified things,

48:46.123 --> 48:52.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she had multiple servers, and
that her staff didn't even look
at some of the -- some of

48:52.129 --> 48:55.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the things they deleted as
personal, some of the e-mails
were actually business.

48:55.499 --> 49:00.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so she's told a series of
falsehood. And, frankly, I
thought her reaction tonight was

49:00.938 --> 49:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a little off-tone, a little too
defiant, when a little humility
and a little contrition

49:05.643 --> 49:10.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might be in order, given what
Comey said, completely
accurately.

49:10.080 --> 49:14.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, if she had real
opposition, this would have been
devastating for her. I don't
think

49:14.819 --> 49:19.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it rises to the level of sort of
indictable offense, but I do
think it's sobering, and

49:19.990 --> 49:23.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be sobering even if you
love Hillary Clinton and you are
a Democratic, to see someone's

49:23.527 --> 49:27.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
claims be exposed as
falsehoods so readily.

49:27.398 --> 49:30.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where do
you come down on this?

49:30.000 --> 49:33.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I was amazed
at her answer. I really was.

49:33.571 --> 49:40.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought James Comey, the
director the FBI's decision was
that she was -- verdict was not

49:40.511 --> 49:47.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
innocent, is what his verdict
was. And you're absolutely
right. He deemed her people and

49:47.384 --> 49:53.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
herself very careless in
treating -- the way they treated
confidential information.

49:53.591 --> 49:59.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Judy, the Wall Street
Journal/NBC poll, the last poll,
asked questions of personal
characteristics.

49:59.163 --> 50:04.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They asked, who do you think is
more honest or trustworthy? And
Donald Trump, not known

50:04.702 --> 50:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as an ethical giant in most
circles, was the choice of 41
percent. Hillary Clinton was

50:09.440 --> 50:13.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at 25 percent. A meager margin
thought her -- she was more
honest and trustworthy than

50:13.110 --> 50:16.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

50:16.347 --> 50:20.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a real problem. It's
been a problem, lack of
transparency and forthrightness,
all

50:20.651 --> 50:27.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way back to the Rose firm's
billing records some 20 years
ago in the White House. And

50:27.558 --> 50:32.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought that there was going
to be a start of almost a candor
offensive, the fact that

50:32.229 --> 50:35.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she was doing the
interview with you.

50:35.199 --> 50:41.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just think it's time for
frankness and an acknowledgment
that this was wrong, that

50:41.605 --> 50:48.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they were misleading. And to
me, it's not going to go away.

50:48.212 --> 50:54.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The advantage she has -- and
it's an inescapable advantage --
Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the
Canadian

50:54.118 --> 51:00.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
prime minister, ran for
reelection in 1972, father of
Justin Trudeau, it was a bad
economy,

51:00.357 --> 51:05.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he said, the choice is --
don't compare me, please, to the
almighty. Compare me to

51:05.329 --> 51:10.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the alternative.

51:10.234 --> 51:14.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's her advantage, is
that her alternative is the man
that David just described,
Donald

51:14.471 --> 51:18.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, who every day makes it
about Donald Trump. I mean, he
is an egomaniac with an

51:18.475 --> 51:20.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inferiority complex.

51:20.377 --> 51:24.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But picking up on
that, David, the Republicans are
saying they're going to

51:24.381 --> 51:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drive home this e-mail story
every day between now and the
election. Is that smart on their

51:29.720 --> 51:30.421 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
part?

51:30.421 --> 51:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think so.

51:33.157 --> 51:38.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the untrustworthiness is
a core weakness. I have to say,
I think Trump manages to commit

51:38.896 --> 51:43.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political suicide on a daily
basis, and yet he doesn't seem
to die. I'm -- my big takeaway

51:43.801 --> 51:48.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the race so far is he's
only down four points in the
national polls.

51:48.973 --> 51:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, to me, looking at the
way he has behaved, this should
be a much bigger victory for --
or

51:52.810 --> 51:56.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least a lead for Secretary
Clinton, but it's not showing up
that way because of doubts

51:56.513 --> 51:59.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about her nearly as great.

51:59.650 --> 52:04.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's
certainly something that has our
attention, along with some other

52:04.621 --> 52:07.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sad -- a lot of sad
things this week.

52:07.691 --> 52:16.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mark Shields, David
Brooks, thank you both.

52:16.900 --> 52:32.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week," which airs
tonight on PBS, and she has a
preview

52:32.549 --> 52:33.150 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
-- Gwen.

52:33.150 --> 52:36.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Hi Judy.

52:36.020 --> 52:41.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we will bring you the
latest on the horrific shootings
in Texas, Minnesota and

52:41.158 --> 52:45.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Louisiana, and we will sum up a
week that could be the turning
point we have been waiting

52:45.129 --> 52:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for in a fraught political year,
with reporters from The
Washington Post, The Wall Street

52:49.333 --> 52:53.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Journal, CNN and NPR.

52:53.170 --> 52:56.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As always, so much to talk
about, Judy, tonight on
"Washington Week."

52:56.440 --> 52:59.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
we will be watching.

52:59.810 --> 53:04.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And tomorrow on "PBS NewsHour
Weekend," our coverage from
Dallas continues with additional

53:04.815 --> 53:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reporting from Hari Sreenivasan
and our entire team on the
ground.

53:09.420 --> 53:14.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And join us again right here on
Monday for the start of our
series The End of AIDS. We

53:14.725 --> 53:20.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
planned to begin that today, but
we postponed it in light of
breaking news from Dallas.

53:20.197 --> 53:23.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Monday, our first report
comes from San Francisco, a city
with one of the world's

53:23.734 --> 53:27.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
most ambitious plans to
eliminate the deadly disease.

53:27.538 --> 53:30.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For now, that's the "NewsHour."
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:30.207 --> 53:38.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have a great weekend. Thank
you, and good night.
