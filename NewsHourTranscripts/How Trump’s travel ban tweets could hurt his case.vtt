JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: to
a part of the Trump agenda
that the administration still

00:04.066 --> 00:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has not been able to implement:
his travel ban on visitors from
six mostly Muslim countries.

00:11.066 --> 00:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The revised version of the
ban remains on hold by federal
court order, and the president

00:15.333 --> 00:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this morning aired out
his grievances once again.

00:18.533 --> 00:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

00:20.500 --> 00:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This afternoon,
the White House deputy press
secretary said it didn't matter

00:26.300 --> 00:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what President Trump's executive
order on immigration is called.

00:28.333 --> 00:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Deputy
White House Press Secretary:
I think that the president

00:30.333 --> 00:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
isn't concerned with
what you call it.

00:32.333 --> 00:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's concerned with national
security and protecting
people in this country.

00:35.966 --> 00:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning, the
president was very concerned,
stating: "People, the lawyers

00:42.900 --> 00:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the courts can call it
whatever they want, but I am
calling it what we need and what

00:46.433 --> 00:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it is, a travel ban."

00:48.900 --> 00:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, it his own aides
who refused to call it that.

00:52.166 --> 00:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEAN SPICER, White
House Press Secretary:
It's not a travel ban.

00:54.233 --> 00:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a -- it's a vetting
system to keep America safe.

00:57.066 --> 00:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's it, plain and simple.

00:59.133 --> 00:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary: It's
not a travel ban, remember.

00:59.966 --> 01:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a travel pause.

01:02.066 --> 01:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the president said, for
90 days, we were going to pause
in terms of people from those

01:07.466 --> 01:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries coming to the United
States that would give me time
to look at additional vetting.

01:13.233 --> 01:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump
also slammed his own
Justice Department,
saying it should have

01:16.666 --> 01:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stuck with the original
executive order, "not
the watered-down,
politically correct current

01:23.600 --> 01:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
version," even though it was the
president himself who revoked
the original version when

01:26.833 --> 01:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he signed the new one.

01:29.366 --> 01:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump has asked the
Justice Department to
seek a quick Supreme
Court hearing to reinstate

01:34.966 --> 01:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the order after lower courts
blocked it from taking effect.

01:36.566 --> 01:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's up to the
justices to decide how
quickly they will act.

01:40.633 --> 01:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

01:43.233 --> 01:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Separately,
there's word tonight
that the FBI has arrested
a federal contract

01:50.200 --> 01:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
employee on charges of
leaking a secret document
on Russian election hacking.

01:55.433 --> 01:58.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NBC News reports that a
Georgia woman allegedly
gave the National
Security Agency document

02:00.200 --> 02:02.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to "The Intercept,"
an online magazine.

02:02.666 --> 02:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says it shows Russian
military intelligence
engineered a cyber-attack
on at least one

02:08.733 --> 02:12.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
U.S. supplier of voting
software last year.

02:12.233 --> 02:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hackers also tried to dupe
elections officials into
handing over log-in credentials.

02:19.300 --> 02:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's the first evidence
that Moscow tried to go
beyond swaying public
opinion and interfere

02:23.533 --> 02:25.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in election machinery.

02:25.566 --> 02:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on all this and more,
we turn to Politics Monday
with Amy Walter of The Cook

02:30.100 --> 02:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Political Report and
Tamara Keith of NPR.

02:33.200 --> 02:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Amy and Tam, this is a story
that has just been breaking
literally within the last

02:37.600 --> 02:39.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hour.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We learned about this online
magazine, Amy, a few hours ago,
but now we're learning about

02:44.666 --> 02:47.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the arrest.

02:47.300 --> 02:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it is the case that
the Russians were able to
in some way interfere or
get close to interfering

02:53.000 --> 02:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the machinery of an
election, what does that mean?

02:55.133 --> 02:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well, that's just one
more piece of what has been

02:59.833 --> 03:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this never-ending puzzle
called the Russian
impact on this election.

03:06.866 --> 03:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's difficult about
sifting through all of this,
Judy, it's a little bit like

03:10.333 --> 03:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of those games where
there's a picture made up
of a lot of different tiles.

03:17.266 --> 03:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't know what that picture
is until you flip over all
the tiles to get the picture.

03:19.733 --> 03:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all we're getting the
one tile here and one tile
there and one tile over here.

03:23.600 --> 03:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we have little pieces, but
we don't know what the big
picture is, and I don't know

03:27.500 --> 03:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we're going ever going
to find out the big picture.

03:30.033 --> 03:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then put on top of it all of
the politics around it, whether
it's the president saying

03:34.466 --> 03:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he doesn't know really if
the Russians interfered in
this, the push by Democrats
to really politicize

03:41.933 --> 03:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of this, the Russian
-- including Hillary
Clinton, who says that
the Russian interference

03:46.966 --> 03:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cost her the election.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now, of course, we have
James Comey, the FBI director,
coming to the Hill to talk more

03:52.766 --> 03:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about this Thursday.

03:54.833 --> 03:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking
of which, Tam, the White House
did announce today, as we

03:57.900 --> 04:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reported, that the president
is not going to step in and
exert what we call executive

04:02.566 --> 04:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
privilege to prevent James
Comey from doing that.

04:05.033 --> 04:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: No, there was a question
of whether they could actually

04:08.333 --> 04:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assert that privilege and
whether they'd succeed.

04:11.466 --> 04:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, yes, they're saying that
the president will not do that.

04:15.100 --> 04:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was also a question of,
politically, whether it was
a good idea for the president

04:18.600 --> 04:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try to interfere with Comey
testifying, because that would
just cause a lot of people

04:22.466 --> 04:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to say, well, what is he hiding?

04:24.500 --> 04:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy,
there was a lot of speculation
about this, people saying, if

04:28.666 --> 04:31.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the president did that,
it would be explosive.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

04:32.733 --> 04:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me him go and testify,
and then respond to that.

04:39.233 --> 04:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you block him from testifying
in the first place, the first
thing everybody is going

04:41.300 --> 04:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say is, well, of course the
White House has something to
hide, that's why they don't

04:44.066 --> 04:46.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
want him to testify.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's go
back, Tam, to this other story
we have been dealing with

04:48.700 --> 04:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for several hours today,
and that is the storm
of tweets that you just
heard John Yang reporting

04:52.700 --> 04:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on from the president today,
basically doubling down on his
original travel ban, saying, I

04:59.766 --> 05:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't care what anybody calls
it, I want the travel ban, and
I don't like what the Justice

05:01.466 --> 05:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Department did and
so on and so on.

05:04.633 --> 05:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Does he help himself
with this, or is it --
is it there some risk?

05:08.066 --> 05:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Is that
a serious question?

05:10.166 --> 05:11.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:11.866 --> 05:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Lawyers
would say, many lawyers
would say, stop talking.

05:15.266 --> 05:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those lawyers include George
Conway, who is someone who
was up for potentially a job,

05:22.166 --> 05:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a high-level job in the Justice
Department, pulled out of
that job last week, happens

05:25.066 --> 05:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be the husband of
Kellyanne Conway, said
in a series of tweets,
basically, the president's

05:31.966 --> 05:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tweets may make people
feel good, but they are
not helping his legal case.

05:35.033 --> 05:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, the lawyer who is
representing Hawaii in one of
these cases that has led to the

05:41.933 --> 05:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
travel ban being blocked
essentially said, wow,
thank you, President Trump.

05:46.200 --> 05:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're certainly helping us.

05:47.766 --> 05:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Didn't realize you were
going to be co-counsel.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:50.900 --> 05:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And that's what
-- part of the reason that the
courts didn't enact the travel

05:56.766 --> 06:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ban in the first place was
based on statements that Trump
made on the campaign trail.

06:02.933 --> 06:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it is clear that his
own words have made this that
much more difficult, that the

06:06.466 --> 06:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actual text of the ban is as
much an issue as what he said
in his campaign about wanting

06:15.833 --> 06:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to ban Muslims, and now going
to Twitter and also making
the case against himself.

06:22.800 --> 06:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So he has made it that much
harder, if not - - to get
beyond just the text of this.

06:28.866 --> 06:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, on top of
all this, at the same time,
Tam, Kellyanne Conway, who

06:34.433 --> 06:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we mentioned a moment ago
because her husband was tweeting
criticism of the president, was

06:37.533 --> 06:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
telling reporters this morning
-- she was interviewed on
one of the morning television

06:40.933 --> 06:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shows -- just don't pay
attention to the tweets.

06:43.433 --> 06:44.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Right.

06:44.433 --> 06:46.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That you
should be focused on what the
president is getting done.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, why focus
on the tweets, she says.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, because they are
statements of the president
of the United States.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when the president
of the United States says
something, it matters.

06:54.666 --> 06:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, sometimes, his
statements come on letterhead
from the White House that
say this is an official

07:01.133 --> 07:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
statement of the president
of the United States.

07:03.100 --> 07:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the reality is that,
often, he goes on Twitter and
contradicts the things that are

07:07.066 --> 07:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the official letterhead.

07:09.133 --> 07:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, really, his tweets are this
unprecedented access to what
is in the mind of the president

07:15.466 --> 07:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

07:16.466 --> 07:18.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is unfiltered.

07:18.133 --> 07:22.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His spokeswoman was
asked today, are these
tweets being vetted yet?

07:22.133 --> 07:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are lawyers vetting the tweets?

07:23.666 --> 07:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she said, I don't think so.

07:25.933 --> 07:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, actually, this is
what the president thinks.

07:28.933 --> 07:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: And says.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it shouldn't be any
different if he says
it on Twitter than if
he says it at a press

07:33.200 --> 07:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
conference or if he
sent something on
official letterhead.

07:35.433 --> 07:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I should
say we at the "NewsHour" view
the tweets as another form

07:38.866 --> 07:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of statement from the
president, from the White House.

07:40.900 --> 07:41.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

07:41.900 --> 07:43.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There
are official statements.

07:44.600 --> 07:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are executive orders,
any number of other ways.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can give interviews.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They can make speeches.

07:47.366 --> 07:48.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

07:48.833 --> 07:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And Twitter is
another one of those methods.

07:49.766 --> 07:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Twitter is...

07:50.533 --> 07:51.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

07:51.800 --> 07:54.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ...
of communicating.

07:54.433 --> 07:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And everything
he says as a private -
- when he was a private
citizen is very different

07:57.100 --> 07:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than when he is president of the
president of the United States.

07:59.266 --> 08:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No matter what he says, in what
venue he says it, it carries
the weight of the president

08:02.700 --> 08:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It carries the weight of being
the leader of this country.

08:06.266 --> 08:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Though I think
that he considers the tweets
to be sort of a direct message

08:08.466 --> 08:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to his base, whereas the
more official statements are
seen for a wider audience.

08:15.400 --> 08:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think he sees those tweets
as going directly with the
base, going around the media.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But everybody else is
watching, including leaders
from around the world.

08:22.666 --> 08:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Everybody
is watching who focuses
on this administration.

08:26.633 --> 08:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quickly, Tam, meantime,
the White House was trying
to today to regroup.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said this is going
to be infrastructure week.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had a little briefing for
the news media where they said,
we're going to be focusing

08:37.033 --> 08:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a plan to pour a lot of
effort and money into rebuilding
the nation's infrastructure.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's still not clear about
the details and the cost, but
they're trying to change the

08:47.266 --> 08:48.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
subject.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes,
infrastructure week
is going really well.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It started with the president
tweeting at 6:00 in the morning
about something completely

08:53.466 --> 08:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unrelated to infrastructure.

08:55.700 --> 09:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But they did announce a
proposal on privatizing
air traffic control.

09:02.766 --> 09:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president held a big, flashy
signing ceremony to sign a memo
being sent to Congress to say

09:07.133 --> 09:09.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that these are the
ideas that he supports.

09:09.033 --> 09:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is not a bill signing.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is a memo signing.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, regrouping.

09:13.433 --> 09:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, and for
President Trump, this should
be his biggest, most powerful

09:19.033 --> 09:21.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
statement.

09:21.033 --> 09:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was elected to Congress as
a businessman, as a deal-maker,
as a builder of things, to

09:24.466 --> 09:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put together an infrastructure
bill that Democrats,
Republicans can agree
on, that he can promote.

09:29.366 --> 09:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This should be one of the
easiest things for him to do,
and yet, both by his own tweets

09:36.366 --> 09:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and by the fact that this
bill itself, as it stands, is
not going to get support from

09:38.333 --> 09:39.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrats.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

09:41.466 --> 09:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Also, there is
no infrastructure bill, just
to be clear, at this point.

09:42.700 --> 09:43.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We
will keep watching.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I know you will too.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: We will
keep watching, yes.

09:46.366 --> 09:47.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy,
Tam, thank you.

09:47.866 --> 09:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Thank you.
