WEBVTT

00:06.106 --> 00:09.743
GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill. Judy Woodruff is
away.

00:09.743 --> 00:13.580
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Interest rates stay at record
lows -- how the Federal
Reserve's

00:13.580 --> 00:18.352
decision affects Americans
and the economy.

00:18.352 --> 00:22.856
Also ahead this Thursday: the
key moments on stage, as
presidential candidates make

00:22.856 --> 00:27.494
their appeals to voters,
highlights from the second
Republican debate.

00:27.494 --> 00:33.467
Plus: papal economics. As the
U.S. readies for a visit from
Francis, Paul Solman reports

00:33.467 --> 00:38.705
on the pope's critique of
capitalism, an economic model
that the pope says overlooks the
poor.

00:38.705 --> 00:44.444
REV. JIM WALLIS, President &
CEO, Sojourners: And Jesus says,
you either serve God or mammon.

00:44.444 --> 00:49.049
That's pretty radical. Mammon
means money. You serve God or
you serve money.

00:49.049 --> 00:55.889
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:55.889 --> 01:00.394
(BREAK)

01:00.394 --> 01:08.635
GWEN IFILL: The word from the
Federal Reserve today, interest
rates aren't going anywhere

01:08.635 --> 01:11.271
just yet.

01:11.271 --> 01:15.876
The announcement ended weeks of
speculation, but Wall Street
wasn't sure what to make of

01:15.876 --> 01:24.351
the news. The Dow Jones
industrial average lost 65
points to close below 16675. The
Nasdaq

01:24.351 --> 01:28.956
rose four points. And the S&P
500 slipped five. We will hear
some of what the Fed had

01:28.956 --> 01:33.727
to say, and examine its
reasoning, right after the news
summary.

01:33.727 --> 01:39.199
The flash point in the crisis
engulfing Europe shifted to
Croatia today with fresh scenes

01:39.199 --> 01:43.670
of chaos. Thousands of people
poured into the country at a key
border crossing with

01:43.670 --> 01:48.208
Serbia, after Hungary closed
its border yesterday.

01:48.208 --> 01:51.845
Jonathan Miller of Independent
Television News reports from the
scene.

01:51.845 --> 01:56.984
JONATHAN MILLER: On the Croatian
front of the crisis threatening
to overwhelm this continent,

01:56.984 --> 02:03.357
even riot police proved
hopelessly unable to contain the
onward surge of refugees and

02:03.357 --> 02:05.359
migrants.

02:05.359 --> 02:11.231
Hours waiting for a train which
never came in blazing heat with
insufficient water and

02:11.231 --> 02:16.303
in a total information vacuum
was too much for the multitude
who had streamed across

02:16.303 --> 02:21.675
the Serbian border into the
European Union in the past 24
hours alone.

02:21.675 --> 02:27.180
The desperation here is
incredible. They have been
pushing women through and
manhandling

02:27.180 --> 02:31.618
little children over their heads
to get them out of this crush,
this chaos the knock-on

02:31.618 --> 02:37.057
effect of the closure of the
gates to Hungary 100 miles
northeast. It's been obvious for

02:37.057 --> 02:40.694
days that a new route would open
up through the Western Balkans,
but somehow no one had

02:40.694 --> 02:43.397
expected this.

02:43.397 --> 02:48.835
The U.N. Refugee Agency was
nowhere to be seen. The handful
of Croatian Red Cross workers

02:48.835 --> 02:54.374
were stretched beyond their
limits. Women fainted, children
became separated from their

02:54.374 --> 02:59.880
parents, but police didn't use
their batons. From early
morning, fresh arrivals have
streamed

02:59.880 --> 03:06.286
across the fields to the
Tovarnik station, just 500
meters inside Croatia.

03:06.286 --> 03:09.790
Thousands crowded on to the
railway tracks. They have been
told the train was coming to

03:09.790 --> 03:16.396
take them to Zagreb. There were
Afghans, Syrians and Iraqis.
There were Somalia and Eritreans

03:16.396 --> 03:21.701
too, many here acutely aware
that in Western Europe, where
they're headed, there are large

03:21.701 --> 03:24.504
numbers of people who do
not want to let them in.

03:24.504 --> 03:30.710
MAN: We want to live in peace
because we leave Syria to live
in peace in Europe.

03:30.710 --> 03:35.982
JONATHAN MILLER: As the
temperature rose, so did the
frustration. No sign of any
train.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.118
Croatia's interior
minister turned up.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.420
Are you overwhelmed?

03:40.420 --> 03:44.925
RANKO OSTOJIC, Croatian Interior
Minister: Absolutely, yes,
because this country in this

03:44.925 --> 03:51.731
moment, the figures are very
important. During the nine
months, Croatia has 1,500
illegal

03:51.731 --> 03:58.638
immigrants altogether. We have
in this 24 hours 6,500, and you
ask me, are we overwhelmed?

03:58.638 --> 04:01.575
Yes. Absolutely yes.

04:01.575 --> 04:07.080
JONATHAN MILLER: He said he
spoke to the U.N. Refugee Agency
to inform them this was their

04:07.080 --> 04:12.486
problem now. After weeks and
sometimes months on the road,
this international mass
migration

04:12.486 --> 04:16.656
is unstoppable.

04:16.656 --> 04:22.295
There has been barbed wire and
tear gas, water cannon, boat
capsizes, thirst, hunger and

04:22.295 --> 04:26.666
exhaustion, but they keep on
coming, and they keep on keeping
on.

04:26.666 --> 04:31.605
GWEN IFILL: Austria and Slovenia
have now imposed new border
checks ahead of an expected

04:31.605 --> 04:36.409
surge in the thousand
traveling through Croatia.

04:36.409 --> 04:41.681
In South Sudan, a truck carrying
gasoline exploded today, killing
more than 100 people.

04:41.681 --> 04:47.387
It happened in a town west of
the capital, Juba, as people
were trying to siphon fuel.

04:47.387 --> 04:51.625
Officials say a crowd had
gathered around the truck, when
someone lit a cigarette.

04:51.625 --> 04:58.431
Meanwhile, twin suicide bombings
in Iraq killed at least 23
people and wounded nearly 70.

04:58.431 --> 05:03.003
The bombers blew themselves up
at police checkpoints in mainly
Shiite sections of Baghdad. The

05:03.003 --> 05:07.774
Islamic State group
claimed responsibility.

05:07.774 --> 05:12.312
Thousands in Chile spent the day
sifting through debris after a
powerful earthquake struck

05:12.312 --> 05:18.585
last night. At least 10 people
were killed. The quake had a
magnitude of 8.3, so strong

05:18.585 --> 05:24.191
that was felt across much of
South America. Today, people in
small towns along and near

05:24.191 --> 05:30.197
the Pacific coast picked through
what was left after the quake
and small tsunamis hit.

05:30.197 --> 05:35.435
MAN (through translator): We
never imagined the water could
do so much damage. The
earthquake

05:35.435 --> 05:38.338
didn't do that much damage. It
was the water. It was the
tsunami that destroyed part of

05:38.338 --> 05:42.576
our lives. It destroyed our
memories, our pictures.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.745
GWEN IFILL: More than a million
people were forced to evacuate
their homes, but most of

05:45.745 --> 05:50.083
Chile was spared major damage.

05:50.083 --> 05:56.890
The military in Burkina Faso
seized power today,
short-circuiting a democratic
transition.

05:56.890 --> 06:01.795
Instead, the army installed a
general with close ties to a
former president who was ousted

06:01.795 --> 06:06.933
last year. Troops then broke up
attempts to protest the coup.
Hospitals filled with victims

06:06.933 --> 06:12.739
of the street clashes. At least
three people were killed, and
dozens more were wounded.

06:12.739 --> 06:17.944
Back in this country, two more
bodies were found in burned-out
homes in Northern California.

06:17.944 --> 06:23.316
That makes five people killed in
two major wildfires in recent
days. The latest victims

06:23.316 --> 06:29.155
died in the so-called Valley
Fire raging near Napa Valley,
north of San Francisco.

06:29.155 --> 06:33.526
And in Southern Utah, the death
toll hit 19 in Monday's flash
floods. Search teams discovered

06:33.526 --> 06:36.963
another body today.

06:36.963 --> 06:42.702
An American soldier accused of
desertion in Afghanistan went
before a military judge today

06:42.702 --> 06:48.942
for a crucial hearing. Sergeant
Bowe Bergdahl disappeared from
his post in 2009 and was

06:48.942 --> 06:55.649
held by the Taliban for five
years before being exchanged for
five Taliban commanders.

06:55.649 --> 07:00.654
The hearing at Fort Sam Houston
in San Antonio will decide if
Bergdahl is court-martialed.

07:00.654 --> 07:06.860
The three Americans who helped
foil an attack on a train bound
for Paris got a White House

07:06.860 --> 07:12.999
welcome today. President Obama
posed for pictures with Airman
1st Class Spencer Stone, Army

07:12.999 --> 07:17.203
Specialist Alek Skarlatos and
Anthony Sadler, and thanked them
for confronting a would-be

07:17.203 --> 07:19.039
gunman.

07:19.039 --> 07:24.544
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: They represent
the very best of America,
American

07:24.544 --> 07:32.819
character. And, you know, it's
these kinds of young people who
make me extraordinarily

07:32.819 --> 07:35.955
optimistic and hopeful
about our future.

07:35.955 --> 07:39.926
GWEN IFILL: The men were also
given medals at a Pentagon
ceremony. They had already
received

07:39.926 --> 07:44.631
the Legion of Honor Medal,
the highest award in France.

07:44.631 --> 07:49.636
And there's word of major
progress against a deadly
disease. U.N. health agencies
report

07:49.636 --> 07:55.608
malaria deaths have fallen 60
percent in the last 15 years.
That means more than six million

07:55.608 --> 08:00.680
lives saved, the vast majority
of them are children in Africa.
Officials also say the

08:00.680 --> 08:05.318
disease is far from eradicated.
There have already been 214
million new cases just this

08:05.318 --> 08:07.854
year.

08:07.854 --> 08:12.225
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what the Federal Reserve's
decision on interest rates

08:12.225 --> 08:28.842
means for American business;
highlights from last night's
Republican debate, and much
more.

08:28.842 --> 08:33.546
It's been seven years since the
Federal Reserve took the unusual
step of lowering interest

08:33.546 --> 08:38.885
rates to near zero. More
extraordinary, rates have not
moved up since then.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.822
For much of this summer, the
expectation was that this would
be the day that the Fed would

08:42.822 --> 08:47.027
announce a change. But, once
again, the Fed decided to leave
rates where they were.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.763
Jeffrey Brown picks up
the story from there.

08:49.763 --> 08:54.234
JEFFREY BROWN: Expectations
began to change just weeks ago
following market turmoil and

08:54.234 --> 08:58.838
worries over China. During a
press conference this afternoon,
Federal Reserve Chairwoman

08:58.838 --> 09:04.611
Janet Yellen spoke of those
factors, but also said a hike
may still be in the cards.

09:04.611 --> 09:10.517
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: Most participants
continue to think that economic

09:10.517 --> 09:15.622
conditions will call for or make
appropriate an increase in the
federal funds rate by the

09:15.622 --> 09:18.558
end of this year.

09:18.558 --> 09:24.197
Of course, there will always be
uncertainty. We can't expect
that uncertainty to be fully

09:24.197 --> 09:31.838
resolved. But in light of the
developments that we have seen
and the impacts on financial

09:31.838 --> 09:36.843
markets, we want to take a
little bit more time to evaluate
the likely impacts on the

09:36.843 --> 09:39.045
United States.

09:39.045 --> 09:42.482
JEFFREY BROWN: Some insight now
into this decision and where the
Fed may head soon from

09:42.482 --> 09:44.818
a close observer.

09:44.818 --> 09:51.458
Krishna Guha is the vice
chairman of Evercore ISI, an
independent investment banking
advisory

09:51.458 --> 09:55.295
firm. From 2010 to 2013, he
served as head of communications
at the New York Federal

09:55.295 --> 09:55.662
Reserve.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.497
Nice to see you again.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.465
KRISHNA GUHA, Vice Chairman,
Evercore ISI: Great to see you,
Jeff.

09:58.465 --> 10:01.568
JEFFREY BROWN: The Fed did make
clear that the recent turmoil in
the markets and Europe

10:01.568 --> 10:03.937
was a factor here.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.639
KRISHNA GUHA: I think that's
right, but it's not just so much
the turmoil in the markets,

10:06.639 --> 10:09.175
per se.

10:09.175 --> 10:14.981
The Fed is saying is, it looks
like the market weakness was
driven by concerns about China

10:14.981 --> 10:19.519
and the emerging markets. And if
that's right, that's something
the Fed should be paying

10:19.519 --> 10:24.157
attention to, not market
volatility from day to day, but
concerns about global growth.

10:24.157 --> 10:26.226
That's really what
they focused on.

10:26.226 --> 10:29.262
JEFFREY BROWN: The release today
says the Fed is -- quote --
"monitoring developments

10:29.262 --> 10:32.966
abroad." It's a sort of --
that bland kind of statement.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.902
Of course, they're always
monitoring developments abroad,
but this says they're really
watching

10:35.902 --> 10:37.604
it and worried.

10:37.604 --> 10:40.807
KRISHNA GUHA: It says they're
paying close attention to these
developments.

10:40.807 --> 10:45.078
Now, I think one of the reasons
why markets, the stock market
was a bit jittery today is

10:45.078 --> 10:49.816
people were wondering, does the
Fed know something we don't? I
don't think that's the case. I

10:49.816 --> 10:53.920
think they're being prudent. I
think they're saying, things
look weak in China and other

10:53.920 --> 10:58.324
emerging markets, weaker than we
thought a few months ago, and
the markets are telling

10:58.324 --> 11:03.363
us that there may be some
problems here, so let's take a
short time out at least and
evaluate

11:03.363 --> 11:06.332
these developments, see what
happens. And then we can make a
better assessment of what

11:06.332 --> 11:08.268
they mean for the U.S.

11:08.268 --> 11:12.171
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, a short
time out. There were some real
divisions that have come out

11:12.171 --> 11:17.710
about what happens next. Right?
There was a minority, but still
a strong minority, suggesting

11:17.710 --> 11:20.947
nothing should happen even
through -- at least through the
end of the year.

11:20.947 --> 11:24.217
KRISHNA GUHA: So I think --
you're, of course, right, and
the Fed officials give you their

11:24.217 --> 11:27.620
dots, where they think
interest rates will go.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.288
JEFFREY BROWN: The tally.

11:28.288 --> 11:28.588
(CROSSTALK)

11:28.588 --> 11:30.023
KRISHNA GUHA: Yes, that's right.

11:30.023 --> 11:34.661
So, most of them said they still
expect to have that hike by
year-end. Four are now saying,

11:34.661 --> 11:40.266
no, 2016 or maybe even 2017. So
I think they're leaning towards
December, but they're giving

11:40.266 --> 11:46.339
themselves the option to delay
if the world looks threatening
at that point.

11:46.339 --> 11:50.176
JEFFREY BROWN: Is this unusual,
in your experience, to have that
kind of division vocalized or

11:50.176 --> 11:51.978
put down in the tally form?

11:51.978 --> 11:54.581
KRISHNA GUHA: You
know, not really.

11:54.581 --> 11:58.217
And I think that's a good thing,
not a bad thing, because you
don't want group think

11:58.217 --> 12:03.222
at a central bank. You want
people to have their own
perspectives, difference of
views.

12:03.222 --> 12:07.994
Right now, there is, I think, a
fairly cohesive mainstream view
that we're getting closer

12:07.994 --> 12:12.332
to the point at which the
domestic economy will support a
rate hike, but it's worth paying

12:12.332 --> 12:15.234
attention to these
international developments.

12:15.234 --> 12:19.238
Now, you have some people --
Jeff Lacker dissented -- who
would like to hike today, and
you have

12:19.238 --> 12:23.943
got a few who are already
pushing back into next year, but
I think the mainstream is
saying,

12:23.943 --> 12:28.014
by the end of the year,
probably, but we will keep an
eye on things.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.917
JEFFREY BROWN: But, just
briefly, so in the meantime, you
do have people breathing a sigh

12:30.917 --> 12:34.787
of relief in Europe, that are
elsewhere who are looking to the
U.S. economy as a driver

12:34.787 --> 12:37.023
still.

12:37.023 --> 12:42.428
KRISHNA GUHA: Yes to some
degree, but it's also the case
that, of course, if you're
sitting

12:42.428 --> 12:47.467
in Europe right now, the fact
that the U.S. is not raising
rates means the dollar is a

12:47.467 --> 12:51.638
bit weaker, means their
currency, the euro, is a big
stronger.

12:51.638 --> 12:55.942
And if your economy still has a
lot of challenges, like the
European economy, you would
actually

12:55.942 --> 12:58.878
perhaps prefer the Fed was
hiking, so your currency would
weaken and you would pick up

12:58.878 --> 13:00.079
some more trade.

13:00.079 --> 13:01.047
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.149
Krishna Guha, thank you so much.

13:03.149 --> 13:11.057
KRISHNA GUHA: Thank you.

13:11.057 --> 13:18.131
GWEN IFILL: The Republican
candidates now have two debates
under their belts and they're

13:18.131 --> 13:22.268
now working to capitalize on
last night's meeting -- one
clear winner, CNN, which scored

13:22.268 --> 13:26.139
nearly 23 million viewers.

13:26.139 --> 13:30.843
While Donald Trump continues to
be the marquee draw, business
executive Carly Fiorina and

13:30.843 --> 13:40.119
Senator Marco Rubio also grabbed
their share of the spotlight.

13:40.119 --> 13:44.891
President Reagan's Air Force One
served as the backdrop for 11
Republicans who hope to

13:44.891 --> 13:50.430
have their own presidential
plane someday. But they first
had to survive the night.

13:50.430 --> 13:55.535
As expected, the primary target
was front-runner Donald Trump,
who has upended the race and

13:55.535 --> 14:01.107
left previously strong
contenders like Wisconsin
governor Scott Walker in the
dust.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.875
GOV. SCOTT WALKER (R-WI),
Presidential Candidate: This is
what's wrong with this debate.
We're

14:02.875 --> 14:07.080
not talking about real issues.
And, Mr. Trump, we don't need an
apprentice in the White House.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.149
We don't need an apprentice in
the White House. We have one
right now.

14:10.149 --> 14:14.787
GWEN IFILL: Walker and former
Florida Governor Jeb Bush tried
to use the face-off to
reestablish

14:14.787 --> 14:19.025
lost footing by linking Trump
to the leading Democrat.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.294
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: You got Hillary
Clinton to go to your wedding.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.995
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: That's true. That's
true.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.530
JEB BUSH: Because you gave her
money. Maybe it works for
Hillary Clinton.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.798
DONALD TRUMP: I was
-- excuse me, Jeb.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.568
JEB BUSH: It doesn't work
for anybody on this stage.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.669
DONALD TRUMP: Jeb, I was a
businessman. I got along with
Clinton. I got along with
everybody.

14:29.669 --> 14:31.270
That was my job, to get
along with people.

14:31.270 --> 14:32.739
JEB BUSH: But the
simple fact is...

14:32.739 --> 14:35.141
DONALD TRUMP: I didn't want
to -- excuse me one second.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.442
JEB BUSH: No. The simple fact
is, Donald, you could not
take...

14:36.442 --> 14:38.544
DONALD TRUMP: OK, more
energy tonight. I like that.

14:38.544 --> 14:42.415
GWEN IFILL: Trump came prepared
to criticize Bush as well over
his stance on women's health

14:42.415 --> 14:44.117
programs.

14:44.117 --> 14:47.220
DONALD TRUMP: I know, but why
did you say it? I heard it
myself. Why did you say it?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.187
JEB BUSH: We increased child
support -- we increased child
support with a broken system

14:48.187 --> 14:49.756
by 90 percent.

14:49.756 --> 14:50.857
DONALD TRUMP: You said you're
going to cut funding for women's
health. You said it.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.358
JEB BUSH: I have a proven
record. I have a proven record.

14:52.358 --> 14:55.762
DONALD TRUMP: You said it.

14:55.762 --> 15:01.501
GWEN IFILL: Carly Fiorina, a
former Hewlett-Packard CEO who
was relegated to the second-tier
debate

15:01.501 --> 15:06.973
last time, seized the moment to
slash at Trump while presenting
herself as a leader.

15:06.973 --> 15:10.343
CARLY FIORINA (R), Presidential
Candidate: I also think that one
of the benefits of a

15:10.343 --> 15:15.348
presidential campaign is, the
character and capability,
judgment and temperament of
every

15:15.348 --> 15:20.052
single one of us is revealed
over time and under pressure.

15:20.052 --> 15:24.257
GWEN IFILL: The only woman in
the field also came prepared to
belittle Trump, who in an

15:24.257 --> 15:27.360
interview, had
criticized her looks.

15:27.360 --> 15:32.498
CARLY FIORINA: You know, it's
interesting to me Mr. Trump said
that he heard Mr. Bush

15:32.498 --> 15:36.602
very clearly and what Mr. Bush
said. I think women all over
this country heard very clearly

15:36.602 --> 15:37.970
what Mr. Trump said.

15:37.970 --> 15:41.107
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

15:41.107 --> 15:48.314
GWEN IFILL: Trump, in turn,
dismissed Fiorina as a failure
in business.

15:48.314 --> 15:52.351
But New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie, struggling in the
polls himself, repeatedly
returned

15:52.351 --> 15:56.689
to his theme of the night: that
the campaign wasn't about them.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.259
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate: While
I'm as entertained as anyone by
this

16:00.259 --> 16:05.131
personal back-and-forth about
the history of Donald and
Carly's career, for the
55-year-old

16:05.131 --> 16:09.068
construction worker out in that
audience tonight who doesn't
have a job, who can't fund his

16:09.068 --> 16:11.270
child's education, I have got to
tell you the truth. They could
care less about your

16:11.270 --> 16:14.273
careers. They care about theirs.

16:14.273 --> 16:18.711
GWEN IFILL: Each member of the
11-candidate field took turns
trying to break through.

16:18.711 --> 16:22.615
For Florida Senator Marco Rubio,
it was on foreign policy.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.117
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate: The
United States military wasn't
built to

16:25.117 --> 16:29.655
conduct pinprick attacks. If the
United States military is going
to be engaged by a commander

16:29.655 --> 16:33.326
in chief, it should only be
engaged in an endeavor to win.
And we're not going to authorize

16:33.326 --> 16:37.463
use of force if you're not put
in a position where they can
win.

16:37.463 --> 16:41.701
GWEN IFILL: And in an earlier
forum, South Carolina Senator
Lindsey Graham targeted former

16:41.701 --> 16:45.738
Senator Rick Santorum
on immigration reform.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.707
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC),
Presidential Candidate: How many
democrats did you have on your
bill?

16:47.707 --> 16:49.575
RICK SANTORUM: I don't know how
many Democrats I had on my
bill...

16:49.575 --> 16:50.776
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: I
can tell you. None.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.613
RICK SANTORUM: But, the point is
-- the point is, is that I had a
bill...

16:53.613 --> 16:55.481
SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM:
That went nowhere.

16:55.481 --> 16:59.485
GWEN IFILL: The attention
turns now to the Democrats.

16:59.485 --> 17:03.256
Clinton used an appearance on
"The Tonight Show" last night to
mock her competition.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.523
JIMMY FALLON, Host, "The Tonight
Show With Jimmy Fallon": How are
you, Hillary? Haven't

17:04.523 --> 17:07.526
seen you since my last wedding.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.329
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: Well,
I'm sure I'll see you at the
next one.

17:10.329 --> 17:14.200
The Democrats' first
debate is October 13.

17:14.200 --> 17:25.411
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

17:25.411 --> 17:30.983
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
making sense of Pope Francis'
critique of capitalism; an

17:30.983 --> 17:36.355
American-trained soldier now a
leader for the Islamic State
group; how body cameras

17:36.355 --> 17:42.194
change our view of policing and
justice; and after a Texas teen
is arrested for taking

17:42.194 --> 17:48.267
a homemade clock to school, what
it's like to grow up as a Muslim
in America?

17:48.267 --> 17:53.472
But, first, General Motors and
the government reached a
settlement today over how the
automaker

17:53.472 --> 17:59.178
handled a defect that led to
deaths, injuries and the recall
of millions of vehicles. The

17:59.178 --> 18:02.448
agreement may resolve many of
the cases, but some remain
concerned that the government

18:02.448 --> 18:05.985
may have let GM off too lightly.

18:05.985 --> 18:09.355
Hari Sreenivasan has the story
from our New York studios.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.424
PREET BHARARA, U.S. Attorney,
Southern District of New York:
This office and GM have entered

18:11.424 --> 18:13.793
into a deferred
prosecution agreement.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.830
HARI SREENIVASAN: The formal
announcement from U.S. attorney
Preet Bharara in New York

18:17.830 --> 18:24.603
followed years of recalls,
lawsuits and congressional
hearings. GM agreed to pay $900
million over

18:24.603 --> 18:29.508
faulty ignition switches that
shut off engines and disabled
safety systems. The company now

18:29.508 --> 18:33.746
admits it hid the deadly
defect for more than a decade.

18:33.746 --> 18:38.617
PREET BHARARA: They didn't tell
the truth in the best way that
they should have to the

18:38.617 --> 18:43.155
regulator and to the public
about a serious safety issue
that risked life and limb.

18:43.155 --> 18:47.493
HARI SREENIVASAN: An independent
monitor will check GM's
compliance, and pending criminal

18:47.493 --> 18:52.798
charges could be dropped after
three years. But the deal does
have its critics.

18:52.798 --> 18:58.270
In a statement today, Democratic
Senators Ed Markey and Richard
Blumenthal said: "The

18:58.270 --> 19:03.175
124 families who lost loved ones
deserved individual criminal
accountability. It is

19:03.175 --> 19:06.679
shameful that they will not
be held fully accountable."

19:06.679 --> 19:09.715
Back in New York, prosecutor
Bharara defended the agreement.

19:09.715 --> 19:17.056
PREET BHARARA: We're not done
and it remains possible that we
will charge an individual,

19:17.056 --> 19:21.594
but the law doesn't always let
us do what we wish we could do.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.997
HARI SREENIVASAN: And in Warren,
Michigan, GM's chief, Mary
Barra, summed up the automaker's

19:24.997 --> 19:27.833
perspective at an
employee town hall.

19:27.833 --> 19:33.205
MARY BARRA, CEO, General Motors:
This is a tough agreement. It
further highlights the

19:33.205 --> 19:37.777
mistakes that were made by
certain people in GM and it
imposes significant penalties

19:37.777 --> 19:39.779
and obligations.

19:39.779 --> 19:48.587
HARI SREENIVASAN: GM also today
said it will spend $575 million
to settle civil lawsuits.

19:48.587 --> 19:52.491
Let's learn more about this
settlement and the questions
surrounding a lack of charges.

19:52.491 --> 19:56.328
David Shepardson of The Detroit
News was at today's press
conference and joins me now.

19:56.328 --> 20:01.000
It seems that we kind of learned
today the limits of the law. GM
wasn't necessarily found

20:01.000 --> 20:06.572
guilty of the ignition switch
problem, but more of the wire
fraud connected to the cover-up.

20:06.572 --> 20:09.975
DAVID SHEPARDSON, The Detroit
News: It's basically the same
charge the federal prosecutors
have

20:09.975 --> 20:15.481
used for years for gangs and
different crimes, you know,
using a telephone or any
electronic

20:15.481 --> 20:18.350
device across state lines.

20:18.350 --> 20:24.423
And the U.S. attorney said there
is not a statute that makes it a
crime solely for an

20:24.423 --> 20:29.895
auto company to sell defective
vehicles, and that they were not
able to determine whether

20:29.895 --> 20:34.767
individual employees, you know,
actually were engaged in a
cover-up or intentionally
committing

20:34.767 --> 20:40.005
a crime without that specific
statute. And so they said
they're not giving up, and
they're

20:40.005 --> 20:43.909
not ruling out any criminal
charges in the long run. But,
realistically, this is probably

20:43.909 --> 20:47.613
the end of the criminal
side of this case.

20:47.613 --> 20:51.951
HARI SREENIVASAN: A lot of
families of the victims are
saying, listen, my loved one
died,

20:51.951 --> 20:54.620
and there's not a single human
being at General Motors that's
responsible for this that we

20:54.620 --> 20:57.389
can find criminally
negligent here?

20:57.389 --> 21:01.660
DAVID SHEPARDSON: You have 124
deaths, and GM's independent
compensation fund is tied

21:01.660 --> 21:06.265
to this, 270 injuries,
some of them very serious.

21:06.265 --> 21:11.804
And what the U.S. attorney said
is, GM had this silent culture
where no one was taking

21:11.804 --> 21:17.576
responsibility. The CEO has
called it a culture of
incompetence and neglect. And,
essentially,

21:17.576 --> 21:22.414
because of this huge incompetent
company, no one is being held
responsible. And it is

21:22.414 --> 21:24.617
-- you know, like you said,
there are a lot of families.

21:24.617 --> 21:29.955
And the U.S. attorney personally
met with the families and said
he was sorry and he

21:29.955 --> 21:33.259
said they're as aggressive as
any other office in the country,
but they can't find a statute

21:33.259 --> 21:36.529
to specifically go after
those individual employees.

21:36.529 --> 21:39.698
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's
probably discomforting for any
auto owner, that there is no law
that

21:39.698 --> 21:41.834
can actually prosecute this.

21:41.834 --> 21:47.106
But how much has GM paid so far?
And it seems like this is less
than what Toyota was fined

21:47.106 --> 21:49.575
with for the sticky accelerator
problem a couple years ago.

21:49.575 --> 21:52.144
DAVID SHEPARDSON: That's right.

21:52.144 --> 21:57.917
In fact, the Toyota sudden
acceleration problem, which was
linked to about five or six
deaths,

21:57.917 --> 22:03.822
resulted in a $1.2 billion fine.
GM is paying to the U.S.
government $900 million. There's

22:03.822 --> 22:09.461
about $1.2 billion more in
settlements of lawsuit,
including to shareholders and
people

22:09.461 --> 22:12.665
who sued over ignition switch
defects. And then there's the
independent compensation

22:12.665 --> 22:15.968
fund that's awarded
about $600 million.

22:15.968 --> 22:22.641
What the U.S. attorney said was,
we're essentially going easier
on GM because they fully
cooperated,

22:22.641 --> 22:26.612
that not only did their
attorneys, you know, turn over
information to us before they
even

22:26.612 --> 22:30.516
told the executives, but they
created this compensation fund
and they quickly said, we're

22:30.516 --> 22:33.085
going to change our culture.

22:33.085 --> 22:38.457
Toyota was accused of misleading
government regulators and not
coming clean for much longer.

22:38.457 --> 22:40.793
It took them four-and-a-half
years to reach that settlement.
So that's part of the reason

22:40.793 --> 22:43.229
for the difference in the fines.

22:43.229 --> 22:46.031
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right. And
this also doesn't count what it
is going to cost to

22:46.031 --> 22:47.866
fix the ignition switches
of all these recalled cars.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.969
DAVID SHEPARDSON: That's right.

22:49.969 --> 22:56.508
GM last year took about $4
billion in charges for -- much
of it in the 30 million vehicles

22:56.508 --> 23:01.347
they recalled, including another
12 million vehicles beyond the
ones involved in this

23:01.347 --> 23:06.685
criminal case for other ignition
problems, for other key issues.
So the expenses are

23:06.685 --> 23:11.257
significant. There's many,
hundreds of lawsuits left to be
resolved. So it's not over yet.

23:11.257 --> 23:14.593
HARI SREENIVASAN: But what are
the next steps? Is GM
essentially on some sort of
probation

23:14.593 --> 23:17.029
for the next few years? They
didn't have to admit any
wrongdoing, but keep their nose

23:17.029 --> 23:19.031
clean?

23:19.031 --> 23:21.900
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Well, they
didn't have to plead guilty.
They were charged with two
felonies.

23:21.900 --> 23:27.172
But they were required to admit
to the information that's laid
out in these two charges.

23:27.172 --> 23:30.709
And so, for the next three
years, they will have a consent
decree. They will be on
probation.

23:30.709 --> 23:35.514
If they violate the law, the
government could seek to
reinstate those felonies and
actually

23:35.514 --> 23:38.617
going through conviction. But
the reality is, there are not a
lot of penalties to a

23:38.617 --> 23:40.853
big company.

23:40.853 --> 23:45.924
Companies don't go to jail. You
know, individuals do. And for
the most part, Wall Street have

23:45.924 --> 23:48.694
basically baked in this cost of
the settlement, so the stock was
up a little bit today.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.095
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

23:50.095 --> 23:54.199
David Shepardson of The
Detroit News, thanks so much.

23:54.199 --> 24:01.140
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Thanks, Hari.

24:01.140 --> 24:07.313
GWEN IFILL: Pope Francis'
upcoming visit to the U.S. next
week is generating huge interest

24:07.313 --> 24:10.916
and expectation.

24:10.916 --> 24:15.154
Part of that excitement is
rooted in the different tone the
pope has taken on a number of
issues,

24:15.154 --> 24:19.191
from marriage to the role of
women in the church. But he has
also issued a tough critique

24:19.191 --> 24:23.595
of capitalism and called for
more action on climate change.

24:23.595 --> 24:27.299
We kick off our coverage of the
pope's trip, which will continue
all next week, with a

24:27.299 --> 24:31.270
look at those issues from our
economics correspondent Paul
Solman.

24:31.270 --> 24:36.108
It's part of our weekly series
Making Sense, which airs every
Thursday on the "NewsHour."

24:36.108 --> 24:40.245
PAUL SOLMAN: Are you excited
that the pope is coming here?

24:40.245 --> 24:42.815
CHILDREN: Yay!

24:42.815 --> 24:46.885
WOMAN: It's a blessing that the
pope is coming to visit us,
especially the poor people that

24:46.885 --> 24:50.856
need a little bit more.

24:50.856 --> 24:55.661
PAUL SOLMAN: A senior center in
East Harlem, the poorest part of
Manhattan and the one

24:55.661 --> 25:00.966
with the closest ties to Latin
America, home to Jorge Mario
Bergoglio, the Argentinean

25:00.966 --> 25:03.969
Jesuit priest now known
as Pope Francis.

25:03.969 --> 25:06.839
MELISSA MARK-VIVERITO, New York
City Council Speaker: And just
south of this district,

25:06.839 --> 25:11.844
we have the most wealthy
district in the city of New York
in the Upper East Side.

25:11.844 --> 25:15.347
PAUL SOLMAN: Melissa
Mark-Viverito is the first
Puerto Rico-born speaker of the
New

25:15.347 --> 25:19.785
York City Council, where she
also represents El Barrio.

25:19.785 --> 25:22.154
MELISSA MARK-VIVERITO: There is
a real contrast, which speaks to
really the vision and, I think,

25:22.154 --> 25:25.057
the philosophy of what
the pope is all about.

25:25.057 --> 25:29.762
PAUL SOLMAN: The pope put that
vision and philosophy bluntly in
June, with his controversial

25:29.762 --> 25:35.667
encyclical on climate change and
poverty, blaming what he calls
unbridled capitalism

25:35.667 --> 25:40.139
for ruining the Earth, with
tragic effects on those he cares
most about, the world's

25:40.139 --> 25:42.007
poorest.

25:42.007 --> 25:45.077
MELISSA MARK-VIVERITO: I think
that that's the reason why the
pope's visit is so important,

25:45.077 --> 25:49.014
is to continue to shine the
light on those challenges and
challenge us, as government

25:49.014 --> 25:52.151
and as leaders in our
communities, to overcome them.

25:52.151 --> 25:56.555
PAUL SOLMAN: And presumably,
that's why Francis will come
here, to challenge government to

25:56.555 --> 26:01.527
do more for the environment and
for the poor. But will
government respond?

26:01.527 --> 26:04.897
The issue has already entered
the race for president.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.599
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: I don't get economic
policy from my -- from my
bishops

26:07.599 --> 26:10.602
or my cardinals or my pope.

26:10.602 --> 26:15.307
PAUL SOLMAN: Conservative
Americans like presidential
candidate Jeb Bush, a convert to
Catholicism,

26:15.307 --> 26:18.076
say the pope should steer
clear of politics.

26:18.076 --> 26:24.283
JEB BUSH: I think religion ought
to be about making us better as
people and less about

26:24.283 --> 26:28.587
things that end up getting
into the political realm.

26:28.587 --> 26:33.692
PAUL SOLMAN: But Francis seems
to think politics is about
making us better as people, more

26:33.692 --> 26:38.697
generous, kinder and gentler to
the poor, to each other, to the
Earth.

26:38.697 --> 26:40.966
Activist Naomi Klein:

26:40.966 --> 26:44.536
NAOMI KLEIN, Activist: It kind
of felt a little bit like being
invited into the world's oldest

26:44.536 --> 26:46.872
secret society.

26:46.872 --> 26:50.843
PAUL SOLMAN: Klein is one of the
pope's more surprising new
advisers, a self-described

26:50.843 --> 26:53.712
secular feminist.

26:53.712 --> 26:59.184
NAOMI KLEIN: My views about
climate change about the economy
are pretty radical. There

26:59.184 --> 27:04.723
are people out there who are
saying this pope is a closet
socialist, and then for them to

27:04.723 --> 27:09.294
invite somebody who's written a
book whose subtitle is
"Capitalism vs. the Climate" is

27:09.294 --> 27:13.265
kind of saying, well, we're
not backing down, frankly.

27:13.265 --> 27:19.037
PAUL SOLMAN: Moreover, says
progressive evangelical Jim
Wallis, Pope Francis is squarely
within

27:19.037 --> 27:24.776
the tradition of his
vow-of-poverty namesake and of
Jesus, who told the rich man
hoping

27:24.776 --> 27:29.114
to enter the kingdom of heaven
that he should give away all his
possessions.

27:29.114 --> 27:35.454
REV. JIM WALLIS, President &
CEO, Sojourners: And Jesus says,
you either serve God or mammon.

27:35.454 --> 27:40.559
That's pretty radical. Mammon
means money. You serve God or
you serve money.

27:40.559 --> 27:43.195
PAUL SOLMAN: Isn't that why
people say that Jesus was a
socialist?

27:43.195 --> 27:50.636
REV. JIM WALLIS: How we decide
the morality, the integrity, the
righteousness of an economy

27:50.636 --> 27:55.274
is not how the wealthiest do,
but how the poorest do. That's
in the text. Now, that

27:55.274 --> 27:59.444
is more radical than
communism and socialism.

27:59.444 --> 28:02.848
PAUL SOLMAN: I tried to be even
more provocative with Marie
Dennis, who heads a Catholic
peace

28:02.848 --> 28:04.216
and justice movement.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.452
So, is the pope a communist?

28:07.452 --> 28:11.089
MARIE DENNIS, Co-President, Pax
Christi International: No, the
pope is not a communist. Pope
Francis

28:11.089 --> 28:18.830
keeps -- as the church ought to
do, keeps a distance from any
particular system, whether

28:18.830 --> 28:24.937
it's communism or socialism or
capitalism, in order to be able
to critique whatever system

28:24.937 --> 28:28.774
is not serving the needs
of people and the planet.

28:28.774 --> 28:33.845
PAUL SOLMAN: But in his
encyclical, he is stridently
anti-capitalist, or at least the

28:33.845 --> 28:37.182
unbridled version,
as he calls it.

28:37.182 --> 28:43.922
MARIE DENNIS: His critique of
unbridled capitalism is very
strong, absolutely, and he is
very

28:43.922 --> 28:49.828
serious about it, because of his
experience. He lived his whole
life in a Latin America

28:49.828 --> 28:57.002
that was on the receiving end of
some very destructive economy
policies. And I think

28:57.002 --> 29:02.741
what Pope Francis is trying to
do is amplify voices that have
been calling for a different

29:02.741 --> 29:05.310
system for decades.

29:05.310 --> 29:09.081
PAUL SOLMAN: A different
economic system? Is what the
pope argues for really what the

29:09.081 --> 29:10.983
world's poor need?

29:10.983 --> 29:12.250
RICHARD SYLLA, ProfessorMD-BO ,
New York University: Well, I
would say that the pope

29:12.250 --> 29:15.754
is probably not a
well-trained economist.

29:15.754 --> 29:19.324
PAUL SOLMAN: New York University
professor Richard Sylla:

29:19.324 --> 29:22.160
RICHARD SYLLA: And economic
historians like myself study
these things, and we're pretty

29:22.160 --> 29:24.496
big fans of capitalism.

29:24.496 --> 29:29.801
PAUL SOLMAN: The pope's argument
isn't that, historically,
capitalism has not done a good

29:29.801 --> 29:35.140
job. It's that now capitalism is
a new form of colonialism, is
suppressing the poor and

29:35.140 --> 29:37.643
keeping them down.

29:37.643 --> 29:42.481
RICHARD SYLLA: I have to
disagree with that, because, in
this age of globalization, my

29:42.481 --> 29:46.051
view is that capitalism is
actually working to make the
lives better for the poorer
people

29:46.051 --> 29:47.953
of the world.

29:47.953 --> 29:51.723
PAUL SOLMAN: But there's so much
poverty in the world. Hasn't
capitalism created that?

29:51.723 --> 29:57.863
RICHARD SYLLA: No, capitalism is
not the culprit. Capitalism,
when it's allowed to do its
work,

29:57.863 --> 30:03.568
some of us would say work its
magic, it has a tremendous
ability to raise living levels

30:03.568 --> 30:10.876
for the people who live under
that system. That doesn't mean
it's perfect, but I think

30:10.876 --> 30:15.013
to sort of say that capitalism
is the problem, let's get rid of
it, as the pope may be hinting,

30:15.013 --> 30:18.483
is to throw the baby out
with the bathwater.

30:18.483 --> 30:24.089
PAUL SOLMAN: The pope, however,
is more than hinting. He writes
that -- quote -- "Whatever

30:24.089 --> 30:29.961
is fragile, like the
environment, is defenseless
before the interests of a
deified market,

30:29.961 --> 30:36.401
a market that doesn't take into
account fundamental rights of
the poor and underprivileged."

30:36.401 --> 30:40.706
The pope being unavailable to
respond to economist Richard
Sylla's defense of markets, I
asked

30:40.706 --> 30:45.410
his radical bedfellow,
Naomi Klein, for a reply.

30:45.410 --> 30:49.481
NAOMI KLEIN: Yes, this is a
system that has pulled many
people out of poverty, but it

30:49.481 --> 30:55.087
has also thrown many people into
destitution. Now, my goal here
is not to say capitalism

30:55.087 --> 31:00.425
has never done anything good.
It's to say we need a better
system, because now the fate

31:00.425 --> 31:02.461
of our species hangs
in the balance.

31:02.461 --> 31:05.497
PAUL SOLMAN: Or, as
Reverend Wallis puts it:

31:05.497 --> 31:10.335
REV. JIM WALLIS: Is our economy
today good news for the poor?
The economy is for, more

31:10.335 --> 31:18.043
and more, the very top, the very
few, and the middle are all very
insecure. And half

31:18.043 --> 31:23.915
of God's children, half the
world's people are left behind
by the economy. God's economy

31:23.915 --> 31:31.256
is very simple. There is enough,
if we share it. It's really as
simple as that.

31:31.256 --> 31:36.561
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, maybe it's
simple, maybe it isn't. But that
seems to be what Pope Francis

31:36.561 --> 31:41.533
believes. And the New York
neighborhood he will visit, with
its homeless, its mentally

31:41.533 --> 31:47.272
ill, its drug-ravaged denizens,
cries out for help, says local
resident Rodney Johnson.

31:47.272 --> 31:51.676
RODNEY JOHNSON, East Harlem:
There's a lot of changes that
need to be made.

31:51.676 --> 31:54.679
PAUL SOLMAN: Like what?

31:54.679 --> 31:58.583
RODNEY JOHNSON: Like people
getting housing, people really
getting help on their drug
problems,

31:58.583 --> 32:03.288
people -- somebody really
sitting down and understanding
people on what they been through

32:03.288 --> 32:08.260
in life, and what they need in
order to get off the streets,
because there's really no

32:08.260 --> 32:13.398
-- there's really no compassion
out here enough to help people
on their feet. It's not out

32:13.398 --> 32:18.170
here no more. There used
to be, but it's gone.

32:18.170 --> 32:22.774
PAUL SOLMAN: From East Harlem,
among other locations, this is
economics correspondent

32:22.774 --> 32:31.983
Paul Solman, reporting
for the "PBS NewsHour."

32:31.983 --> 32:43.328
GWEN IFILL: New reports surfaced
today that the U.S. and Russia
will begin military-to-military

32:43.328 --> 32:49.367
talks about Syria, even as
Vladimir Putin moves to bolster
his old ally Bashar al-Assad.

32:49.367 --> 32:53.004
But will Russia also be fighting
a man they have battled before?

32:53.004 --> 32:56.441
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret Warner
reports.

32:56.441 --> 33:01.613
MARGARET WARNER: The man is Abu
Omar al Shishani, the Islamic
State military commander for the

33:01.613 --> 33:05.851
Northern District of Syria, seen
here last August as the group
pursued its lightning

33:05.851 --> 33:09.354
march across Northern
and Central Iraq.

33:09.354 --> 33:12.624
ABU OMAR AL SHISHANI, Islamic
State (through translator): It
is time for the sons of the

33:12.624 --> 33:16.995
Islamic State to defend the
Islamic State of Iraq and Sham
and defend our imam, who

33:16.995 --> 33:20.165
the world gathered against
with all its strength.

33:20.165 --> 33:24.502
MARGARET WARNER: Unlike most
I.S. fighters, he was speaking
Russian. His real name is

33:24.502 --> 33:31.276
Tarkhan Batirashvili. He's an
ethnic Chechen reportedly born
30 years ago in Georgia, then

33:31.276 --> 33:36.615
part of the Soviet Union, to a
Christian father and Muslim
mother. Tapped as a special
forces

33:36.615 --> 33:40.552
soldier in the Georgian army, he
fought fiercely against the
Russian army when the two
countries

33:40.552 --> 33:45.724
went to war over the province
of South Ossetia in 2008.

33:45.724 --> 33:50.128
Mitchell Prothero of McClatchy
Newspapers has just written an
exhaustive profile of

33:50.128 --> 33:53.999
al Shishani, with startling new
information. I spoke with him
via Skype from his bureau

33:53.999 --> 33:56.568
in Northern Iraq.

33:56.568 --> 34:00.672
How significant a military
figure is al Shishani in ISIS?

34:00.672 --> 34:03.708
MITCHELL PROTHERO, McClatchy
Newspapers: If he's not the
overall military commander for

34:03.708 --> 34:06.578
the Islamic State, he's
definitely in charge of the
Northern Syrian Front, which is
one

34:06.578 --> 34:09.381
of the most active and serious.

34:09.381 --> 34:13.418
MARGARET WARNER: Now, you
uncovered a very interesting new
twist in this story, with

34:13.418 --> 34:18.390
-- some of his skills actually
came from training by the
Americans.

34:18.390 --> 34:22.360
MITCHELL PROTHERO: In 2005 and
'6, there was a lot of
cooperation -- and there still
is

34:22.360 --> 34:26.965
today on some level -- between
the American intelligence
services and the U.S. military

34:26.965 --> 34:30.802
in training the Georgian armies
and their intelligence services.

34:30.802 --> 34:35.140
He had been tapped for training
as a special forces unit. And
that was done through the

34:35.140 --> 34:38.009
United States. But, again, there
was nothing that would flag him
as a security risk on

34:38.009 --> 34:39.744
paper.

34:39.744 --> 34:44.282
MARGARET WARNER: How effective
was he as a fighter against the
Russians back in 2008?

34:44.282 --> 34:47.085
MITCHELL PROTHERO: He was
considered a rising star of the
Georgian military.

34:47.085 --> 34:52.757
He was a senior non-commissioned
officer in a special forces unit
that was tasked with

34:52.757 --> 34:57.762
basically being the eyes and
ears of the Georgian military
and was one of their most
successful

34:57.762 --> 35:00.598
battle commanders during the
very brief 2008 war before the
Russians sort of rolled over

35:00.598 --> 35:02.534
them.

35:02.534 --> 35:06.738
MARGARET WARNER: Yet, scarcely
six years later, he was in
Syria, swearing allegiance to
the

35:06.738 --> 35:12.110
Islamic State. It's an unusual
evolution for a man brought up
in a moderate Muslim enclave

35:12.110 --> 35:15.814
in the predominantly
Christian nation of Georgia.

35:15.814 --> 35:21.086
Shishani was arrested in 2010 on
what his family says was a
trumped-up weapons possession

35:21.086 --> 35:26.391
charge and he spent 16 months in
prison. Once released, he fled
to Istanbul.

35:26.391 --> 35:30.328
MITCHELL PROTHERO: At that
point, appears to have been
radicalized somewhat, maybe his

35:30.328 --> 35:34.299
prison experience. And people
also suggested that the death of
his mother to cancer shortly

35:34.299 --> 35:38.703
after his release from prison
sort of led to him having a
religious awakening, and he

35:38.703 --> 35:42.340
adopted her religion. His
father, as we said, is
Christian.

35:42.340 --> 35:49.347
And by June of 2012, he shows up
in Aleppo as a little-known sort
of foreign fighter

35:49.347 --> 35:54.119
in a small group of guys, and
slowly -- or, actually, rather
quickly, built a movement

35:54.119 --> 35:58.256
that slowly then became
part of the Islamic State.

35:58.256 --> 36:03.461
I was told that part of why he
was able to be convinced to
bring his unit and to join

36:03.461 --> 36:08.633
the Islamic State was a promise
that the Islamic State would
organize basically an emirate

36:08.633 --> 36:12.504
in the Caucasus that would
then go after the Russians.

36:12.504 --> 36:16.441
MARGARET WARNER: And, says
Prothero, al Shishani has
emerged as an effective
recruiter of other

36:16.441 --> 36:20.578
Muslim fighters from other
former Soviet republics.

36:20.578 --> 36:24.749
MITCHELL PROTHERO: The Chechens
and a lot of these other former
Russian-speaking province

36:24.749 --> 36:29.320
guys have a tendency to be very
professional, military-wise.

36:29.320 --> 36:34.726
They're considered sort of the
shock troops or special forces
of the Islamic State. They're

36:34.726 --> 36:40.098
moved around from place to place
to fight in specific areas. They
were part of the Mosul

36:40.098 --> 36:45.537
operation, although a lot of
that was local Iraqis. There is
always sort of a core of

36:45.537 --> 36:48.473
these just very disciplined and
experienced foreign fighters, as
opposed to the guys that

36:48.473 --> 36:50.742
are coming from Europe.

36:50.742 --> 36:56.047
MARGARET WARNER: What makes him
so particularly effective? What
makes him a standout in that

36:56.047 --> 37:00.985
group of already effective
and disciplined fighters?

37:00.985 --> 37:05.423
MITCHELL PROTHERO: It sounds
like he's quite capable of
thinking strategically and
tactically

37:05.423 --> 37:08.793
from a military standpoint that
you don't always get with a lot
of these guys, even

37:08.793 --> 37:12.964
if they're fierce fighters.
It takes more to run an army.

37:12.964 --> 37:17.335
MARGARET WARNER: Today, al
Shishani is on the U.S. Treasury
Department's list of specially

37:17.335 --> 37:23.575
designated global terrorists and
he carries a $5 million bounty
on his head.

37:23.575 --> 37:28.913
So, as the Russian military
appears to be moving its way
into Syria, this hardened
Chechen

37:28.913 --> 37:31.950
fighter may have the battle
coming that he's long been
waiting for.

37:31.950 --> 37:39.491
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner in Washington.

37:39.491 --> 37:52.070
GWEN IFILL: Now: how body
cameras on police and cell
phones everywhere are changing
our

37:52.070 --> 37:55.507
views on justice.

37:55.507 --> 37:59.844
Charlayne Hunter-Gault has the
latest installment in our series
Race Matters.

37:59.844 --> 38:04.115
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: From the
Michael Brown fatal shooting by
a policeman in Ferguson,

38:04.115 --> 38:09.687
Missouri, last year to New York
City last week, when a
plainclothes police officer
roughly

38:09.687 --> 38:13.391
threw former tennis pro James
Blake to the ground, police have
been under fire for attacks

38:13.391 --> 38:15.960
on black people.

38:15.960 --> 38:21.533
But, in many instances, police
representatives have pushed
back, insisting their offices

38:21.533 --> 38:27.705
were merely doing their jobs.
How to narrow such profound
fractures between the public

38:27.705 --> 38:33.578
and the police is the subject of
extensive research by Brian
Jackson, a senior political

38:33.578 --> 38:38.283
scientist at the RAND
Corporation, a nonprofit think
tank working on improving policy
and

38:38.283 --> 38:40.852
decision-making.

38:40.852 --> 38:44.355
Brian Jackson, thank
you for joining us.

38:44.355 --> 38:50.762
Your study focused on what you
describe as profound fractures
between the public and

38:50.762 --> 38:55.733
the police, and you say it's
been a long trend. Can you
expand on that just a little
bit?

38:55.733 --> 38:58.736
BRIAN JACKSON, RAND Corporation:
Well, of course, policing in the
United States isn't

38:58.736 --> 39:01.739
something that started a week
ago. It's something that started
at -- near the beginning of our

39:01.739 --> 39:04.475
country.

39:04.475 --> 39:09.881
And the relationships that
police have with their
communities goes back to events
that

39:09.881 --> 39:13.918
happened during the era of
segregation, during war
protests, when police didn't
always take

39:13.918 --> 39:17.855
actions that today, you know,
we see as appropriate.

39:17.855 --> 39:22.427
And so for individuals who have
an interaction with a police
officer today, they're often

39:22.427 --> 39:26.831
seeing that interaction as part
of a pattern that went back a
long time. And this is part

39:26.831 --> 39:33.238
of why it's very challenging to
build and maintain trusted
relationships between police

39:33.238 --> 39:38.443
officers and different
communities, because the police
have to sort of take on and
understand

39:38.443 --> 39:41.779
this history that goes back
probably well before any of the
officers who were on the

39:41.779 --> 39:44.582
force now were police officers.

39:44.582 --> 39:46.517
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, it's
going on in the heads of black
people or people who

39:46.517 --> 39:48.720
are victims, but not in
the heads of policemen?

39:48.720 --> 39:51.422
BRIAN JACKSON:
Well, yes, indeed.

39:51.422 --> 39:55.026
And it's not just a minority
community thing -- issue. I
mean, you have people who were

39:55.026 --> 39:57.528
members of protest communities
during the '60s and '70s, who
have very different views

39:57.528 --> 40:00.131
of police.

40:00.131 --> 40:04.135
Really, this is a question of
the many communities that exist
in the United States and the
fact

40:04.135 --> 40:07.672
that all of them need good
relationships with the police
departments that protect them.

40:07.672 --> 40:11.743
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But I
think you see statistics showing
that blacks are three times

40:11.743 --> 40:17.148
as likely as whites to be killed
by the police. That widens the
fractures, doesn't it?

40:17.148 --> 40:22.754
BRIAN JACKSON: Absolutely. When
you have a sort of preexisting
breakdown in trust, these

40:22.754 --> 40:28.259
very serious incidents -- and a
police use of force is always a
serious incident when

40:28.259 --> 40:31.996
it results in loss of life of a
citizen. That's always something
that is a challenge in a

40:31.996 --> 40:33.464
democracy.

40:33.464 --> 40:36.834
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So how
do you see race fitting into
this?

40:36.834 --> 40:40.571
BRIAN JACKSON: Our country has a
very complex history around
race, to make a very sort of

40:40.571 --> 40:43.675
obvious and understated point.

40:43.675 --> 40:49.080
And so race is something that is
behind all of this. And it's not
that individuals are

40:49.080 --> 40:54.852
necessarily racist. There are
folks who study unconscious
stereotypes and how race can
affect

40:54.852 --> 40:57.922
the way that people make
judgments about another person.

40:57.922 --> 40:58.690
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Unconscious stereotypes?

40:58.690 --> 41:01.025
BRIAN JACKSON: Indeed.

41:01.025 --> 41:07.565
I mean, someone may view someone
else as a threat because of
stereotypes that exist around

41:07.565 --> 41:11.836
race, where they may not even
realize that that is what is
driving their decision. And

41:11.836 --> 41:16.007
so there are folks who are
looking at, OK, how do you train
people to recognize this,

41:16.007 --> 41:22.480
to understand that there are
stereotypes, to let people step
back from themselves as

41:22.480 --> 41:27.452
they're making these incredibly
important decisions, sometimes
in a very short time,

41:27.452 --> 41:31.689
and work through those issues to
make sure that they're making
the right decision for

41:31.689 --> 41:35.393
the right reasons, not because
of a stereotype that they have
learned overtime?

41:35.393 --> 41:39.063
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So are
you saying that this can be
fixed?

41:39.063 --> 41:42.867
BRIAN JACKSON: I'm an optimist
by nature, so, yes, I am saying
it can be fixed, although

41:42.867 --> 41:45.636
this is a training issue.

41:45.636 --> 41:51.142
It's about sort of teaching
people about other cultures.
It's -- this is embedded in sort

41:51.142 --> 41:55.813
of the notions that are behind
community policing, of police
departments, building
connections

41:55.813 --> 42:01.753
with the community, so they have
a way of understanding where
people are coming from,

42:01.753 --> 42:06.491
understanding what their needs
are, the problems that police
should be involved in solving.

42:06.491 --> 42:12.530
And part of that is about
building these person-to-person
relationships that mean people
are making

42:12.530 --> 42:17.268
judgments less on mental
shorthand, and more about, you
know, who is this person who is

42:17.268 --> 42:20.605
in from of me and understanding
what is going on.

42:20.605 --> 42:27.912
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: In your
report, you talk about narrowing
these gaps and divisions

42:27.912 --> 42:34.552
being a two-way street, that the
police have responsibilities and
the community has
responsibilities.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.889
How do you work that out?

42:37.889 --> 42:42.860
BRIAN JACKSON: When you look at
the rhetoric around sort of
challenges about police
oversight,

42:42.860 --> 42:49.767
police are concerned that
members of the public who don't
know what high-pressure
interactions

42:49.767 --> 42:55.206
where the police officers are at
risk work, and are concerned
that they're not going to

42:55.206 --> 42:59.177
make fair judgments about -- you
know, about the police officer's
decision-making after

42:59.177 --> 43:01.646
the fact.

43:01.646 --> 43:05.616
Members of the public are
obviously concerned about that
decision-making, because it's in

43:05.616 --> 43:09.220
that decision-making where we
get uses of force, where we get
decisions about who gets

43:09.220 --> 43:12.657
searched and who doesn't, who
gets stopped and who doesn't.

43:12.657 --> 43:17.695
And so there is an element in
this where, you know, increasing
transparency in those

43:17.695 --> 43:22.266
interactions to give the public
more data, more information --
I'm a researcher, so I

43:22.266 --> 43:25.002
go back the data and
information as a solution.

43:25.002 --> 43:28.339
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: So, it
sounds like that may be what is
happening in the Ferguson

43:28.339 --> 43:32.410
case, where we have just had a
report by a commission that
looked into those incidents

43:32.410 --> 43:34.912
there.

43:34.912 --> 43:40.985
And they said that people need
to engage with the report,
discuss, debate and argue about

43:40.985 --> 43:44.755
it, even though it is likely to
be difficult and take a long
time. Is that what we're looking

43:44.755 --> 43:46.591
at?

43:46.591 --> 43:50.761
BRIAN JACKSON: They are going in
the right direction. These are
not easy questions. I

43:50.761 --> 43:56.801
mean, we expect the police to
use force in situations to save
lives.

43:56.801 --> 44:01.272
And we expect -- but we expect
them to do it appropriately.
Where is the line? Well,

44:01.272 --> 44:06.177
that's a tough -- that's a tough
line to draw, and it varies
place to place. In a democracy,

44:06.177 --> 44:10.915
that's done by sort of people
coming together and having those
debates, having those
discussions.

44:10.915 --> 44:15.820
You know, broken windows
policing, or order maintenance
policing, as it's called, was

44:15.820 --> 44:21.926
a philosophy of trying to
control crime. But that approach
has a lot of impacts on the

44:21.926 --> 44:27.798
communities that are affected by
it. So, part of what needs to
happen there around a policing

44:27.798 --> 44:31.936
tactic is for people to come
together and say, well, do the
benefits that we think we're

44:31.936 --> 44:35.773
getting from reducing crime
worth the side effects that this
has on everybody in the

44:35.773 --> 44:38.142
community where it's done?

44:38.142 --> 44:43.180
Is there a right and a wrong
answer there? No, but the answer
for me there is going for

44:43.180 --> 44:47.952
more transparency, so these bad
incidents that happen -- and
there are terrible incidents

44:47.952 --> 44:51.622
that happen, where we get the
one cell phone video. They
travel the Internet. They have

44:51.622 --> 44:54.392
a very large effect.

44:54.392 --> 44:58.663
On that same day, a lot of
interactions between the police
and the public happened that
were

44:58.663 --> 45:04.168
very positive. Sometimes, those
go viral. For example, there was
the case of the African-American

45:04.168 --> 45:08.940
police officer who was helping a
white supremacist at a
Confederate Flag rally who was
being

45:08.940 --> 45:13.444
overcome by the heat. And a
picture of this officer leading
this gentleman away so he

45:13.444 --> 45:17.081
could sort of get water,
again, went viral.

45:17.081 --> 45:20.785
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Is there
anything in this whole equation
that gives you optimism

45:20.785 --> 45:25.122
that this fracture can be
narrowed and maybe even
resolved?

45:25.122 --> 45:27.291
BRIAN JACKSON: Yes, absolutely.

45:27.291 --> 45:32.229
I mean, we're seeing sort of
explorations with use of
technology like body cameras,

45:32.229 --> 45:38.069
although they're not the answer
to everything. We're seeing, you
know, police departments

45:38.069 --> 45:42.273
proactively sort of reach out to
communities. We're seeing the
public debate.

45:42.273 --> 45:47.478
And the public debate is part of
this, about, you know, what the
country wants from its

45:47.478 --> 45:53.451
police forces, what the right
balance to strike in a democracy
about the power given to police

45:53.451 --> 45:58.289
vs. citizen oversight. What the
society wanted from police 30
years ago is not the same as

45:58.289 --> 46:01.292
what society wants
from police now.

46:01.292 --> 46:04.362
And I don't know what the
changes will be, but I'm quite
sure that, in 30 years, there

46:04.362 --> 46:09.700
will be changes. And so what I'm
optimistic about is that we have
a process going now

46:09.700 --> 46:13.638
where people are focusing now on
this issue and where we will
sort of work through the

46:13.638 --> 46:16.741
problem set as a country to come
up with better solutions over
time.

46:16.741 --> 46:18.542
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Brian Jackson, thank you.

46:18.542 --> 46:21.012
BRIAN JACKSON: Thank
you very much.

46:21.012 --> 46:26.784
GWEN IFILL: On Monday, we will
expand on that conversation in a
PBS prime-time special,

46:26.784 --> 46:29.954
"America After Charleston."

46:29.954 --> 46:35.993
Join me as we explore the many
issues propelled into public
discourse after a white gunman

46:35.993 --> 46:54.445
shot and killed nine
African-American worshipers in
Charleston's Emanuel AME Church
last June.

46:54.445 --> 47:00.117
Fourteen-year-old Ahmed Mohamed,
who was suspended from an
Irving, Texas, school after
officials

47:00.117 --> 47:06.223
mistook his school project for a
bomb, spent another day out of
school today.

47:06.223 --> 47:09.593
Mohammed's arrest -- he'd
brought a homemade clock to
school -- stirred a global
social

47:09.593 --> 47:11.662
media frenzy.

47:11.662 --> 47:14.498
Hari's back with that.

47:14.498 --> 47:21.105
HARI SREENIVASAN: The hashtag
#IStandWithAhmed went viral for
a third straight day on
Facebook,

47:21.105 --> 47:26.143
Twitter and elsewhere. President
Obama jumped in yesterday, too,
inviting him to visit with

47:26.143 --> 47:30.214
a tweet that read: "Cool clock,
Ahmed. Want to bring it to the
White House? We should

47:30.214 --> 47:36.020
inspire more kids like you to
like science. It's what makes
America great."

47:36.020 --> 47:39.657
For his part, the teen said he
didn't plan to return to the
school and was grateful for

47:39.657 --> 47:42.259
overwhelming support.

47:42.259 --> 47:46.197
AHMED MOHAMED, Student: I
brought the clock to impress my
teacher. But when I showed it

47:46.197 --> 47:50.034
to her, she thought it
was a threat to her.

47:50.034 --> 47:55.106
So -- so, it was really sad that
she took the wrong impression of
it, and I got arrested

47:55.106 --> 47:58.042
for it later that day.

47:58.042 --> 48:02.079
Thank you to all my supporters
on Twitter, Facebook, all social
media. Thank you all

48:02.079 --> 48:04.915
for helping me. I would have
never got this far if it wasn't
for you guys, and not just

48:04.915 --> 48:07.818
you guys, everybody.

48:07.818 --> 48:12.590
HARI SREENIVASAN: Some
perspective from a part of the
American Muslim community.

48:12.590 --> 48:15.793
Nihad Awad is the executive
director of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations,
which

48:15.793 --> 48:17.895
has been working with
Ahmed and his family.

48:17.895 --> 48:20.064
Mr. Awad, thanks for joining us.

48:20.064 --> 48:23.134
So, tell me about your
contact with the family.

48:23.134 --> 48:25.035
NIHAD AWAD, Executive Director,
Council on American-Islamic
Relations: Yes.

48:25.035 --> 48:29.073
From the beginning, when this
happened to the family, the
family contacted our office

48:29.073 --> 48:37.448
in Dallas. And we recognized
that this was another case of
unfortunate Islamophobia and

48:37.448 --> 48:41.886
targeting of young people just
because of their faith
tradition, not because of their

48:41.886 --> 48:45.222
deeds or their behavior.

48:45.222 --> 48:51.896
And we managed to tell his
story. And his narrative now
dominated the story, because

48:51.896 --> 48:57.902
the school officials, I think,
failed him when they accused
him, when they called the

48:57.902 --> 49:04.141
police on him. He was arrested.
He was detained, interrogated
without the presence of his
parents.

49:04.141 --> 49:07.278
And this was totally
unnecessary.

49:07.278 --> 49:11.982
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mr. Awad, why
do you think this story is
resonating so much, even to

49:11.982 --> 49:14.151
non-Muslims around America?

49:14.151 --> 49:17.955
NIHAD AWAD: Well, I think
it's a human story.

49:17.955 --> 49:27.331
This is a young genius inventor
who wanted to impress everyone,
and he wanted to do better.

49:27.331 --> 49:33.404
He wanted to build things to
improve the world. I spoke to
him yesterday, and he told me
that

49:33.404 --> 49:36.774
he wants to create things. And
his father told me that he fixes
everything around the

49:36.774 --> 49:38.642
house.

49:38.642 --> 49:45.382
So, at this young age, to have a
brilliant teenager who is
involved and has a passion

49:45.382 --> 49:50.354
in science and innovation, we
should cherish this. And that's
why I believe he was able

49:50.354 --> 49:57.027
to tell his story through his
invention. He's young. He's
cute, adorable, intelligent. And

49:57.027 --> 50:01.432
I think that got him a lot of
support, definitely with the
help of an advocacy organization

50:01.432 --> 50:05.569
like ours. We managed to
also get his story out.

50:05.569 --> 50:09.874
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, are you
advocating or counseling him to
take legal action? And,

50:09.874 --> 50:12.509
if so, what's the basis of
that action, against whom?

50:12.509 --> 50:17.147
NIHAD AWAD: I think the most
important thing is to restore
his confidence.

50:17.147 --> 50:24.421
The president has supported him,
and he stood for him publicly.
And he led by example. Mark

50:24.421 --> 50:30.828
Zuckerberg and other leaders in
our society, in the industry, in
the faith tradition have

50:30.828 --> 50:35.833
stood by him. And that was the
most important thing, is to
restore and reinstate his
confidence

50:35.833 --> 50:40.237
and his dreams to change the
world to be a better world.

50:40.237 --> 50:44.475
The legal action, I think, is
being considered. We just want
to make sure that this story

50:44.475 --> 50:47.978
and this experience doesn't
happen to other people.

50:47.978 --> 50:55.319
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is this
indicative or emblematic of
actions against Muslims around
the United

50:55.319 --> 50:58.122
States? Is that one of the
reasons that people are paying
attention to this, where they
can

50:58.122 --> 51:00.691
see this in themselves?

51:00.691 --> 51:05.162
NIHAD AWAD: Unfortunately, I
have to say, yes, it is
widespread.

51:05.162 --> 51:12.436
There is a poisoned atmosphere
of Islamophobia that has plagued
our countries, cities and

51:12.436 --> 51:19.109
towns. It has filtered even
through the school system. We
hear many, many stories like
this.

51:19.109 --> 51:25.849
Luckily, Ahmed is clever. He was
able to tell his narrative. But
there are many untold stories

51:25.849 --> 51:31.221
nationwide. And we, as a nation,
have to start a frank
conversation.

51:31.221 --> 51:35.859
And I urge our national leaders,
religious leaders, at their
homes, in their places of

51:35.859 --> 51:43.000
worship, everywhere, we have to
fight against xenophobia, any
kind of phobia, and just reward

51:43.000 --> 51:48.005
diversity, but not punish
diversity or punish people just
because of their faith
traditions.

51:48.005 --> 51:50.774
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, what
would you like to see in -- what
would you like to see

51:50.774 --> 51:53.444
happen at the school, at the
local police department?

51:53.444 --> 51:58.248
NIHAD AWAD: I would like the
school to look really at what
happened.

51:58.248 --> 52:03.187
And they shouldn't justify what
they did. What they did was
wrong. And they have sent

52:03.187 --> 52:09.293
the wrong message to teenagers
nationwide, not only in their
school. And I would like

52:09.293 --> 52:13.897
that to be the last story. But,
unfortunately, knowing the
history of our society, we
learn,

52:13.897 --> 52:16.633
but sometimes slowly.

52:16.633 --> 52:20.671
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Nihad Awad, executive director
of the Council on
American-Islamic

52:20.671 --> 52:21.905
Relations, thanks so
much for joining us.

52:21.905 --> 52:27.711
NIHAD AWAD: Thank
you for having me.

52:27.711 --> 52:39.757
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: For the last two weeks,
we have been showing you

52:39.757 --> 52:45.396
some of the extreme conditions
faced by migrants and refugees
as they wind their way through

52:45.396 --> 52:49.867
Europe. Correspondent William
Brangham spoke to many of them
along the Hungarian border,

52:49.867 --> 52:53.871
as they tried to make their
way to a better life.

52:53.871 --> 52:58.375
He talks about what he saw on
the latest episode of our
podcast, Shortwave. Find a link
to

52:58.375 --> 53:01.879
listen on our home page.

53:01.879 --> 53:07.217
And we have the final
installment of our series by
cartoonist Jack Ohman. If you
have been

53:07.217 --> 53:12.222
following along, you know that,
ultimately, Jack's dad succumbs
to his illness, but, as

53:12.222 --> 53:15.926
he writes, his dad's death was
nothing like he had imagined.

53:15.926 --> 53:21.298
Find the cartoon on our home
page, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:21.298 --> 53:23.901
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:23.901 --> 53:27.971
On Friday, we reunite with
Syrian refugees in Germany we
first met on their journey
through

53:27.971 --> 53:29.073
Hungary.

53:29.073 --> 53:31.341
I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:31.341 --> 53:36.346
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening with Mark
Shields and David Brooks.

53:36.346 --> 53:38.449
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you, and good
night.
