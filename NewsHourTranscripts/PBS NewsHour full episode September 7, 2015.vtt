asylum-seekers have arrived in t
European Union already this year

Meanwhile, French President Fran

In Guatemala, there will be a ru
election after candidates split

of the country's leader amid a c

in an interview with ABC, after

has pledged to make campaign fin
and voting rights issues top pri

05:20.053 --> 05:22.222
And scientists in Britain announ
they believe they have found an

05:23.690 --> 05:29.296
prehistoric monument near the ru
but it's underground. University

05:30.764 --> 05:35.902
researchers used remote sensor t
to find about 100 stones toppled

05:37.370 --> 05:40.907
of a large arena. Some of them w
stood more than 15-feet high whe

05:42.375 --> 05:48.481
built around 4,500 years ago. Th
about two miles from Stonehenge.

05:49.950 --> 05:54.888
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
provide sanctuary for more migra

05:55.922 --> 06:11.071
debating raises to the minimum w
more.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.242
We return now to the migrant and
in Europe.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.813
Joining me to discuss the latest
and what they mean as the contin

06:21.214 --> 06:26.086
for a solution is Leonard Doyle
Organization for Migration.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.487
Leonard Doyle, welcome.

06:28.955 --> 06:35.462
So now, as we see more and more
offering to take in tens of thou

06:36.796 --> 06:38.698
migrants, is that going to be su
accommodate all of them?

06:40.166 --> 06:40.867
LEONARD DOYLE, International Org
for Migration: We will have to w

06:41.901 --> 06:43.470
First of all, thank you so much
me on.

06:44.938 --> 06:49.342
But the generosity that's been s
European public is extraordinary

06:50.810 --> 06:52.812
seeing that they're ahead of the
who quite often are fearful of t

06:54.281 --> 06:58.652
or indeed fearful of the cost, t
implications of bringing in migr

07:00.120 --> 07:03.456
But what we're seeing is encoura
it's also going to bring a tidal

07:04.924 --> 07:09.296
people from Syria. There are 11
people and word is out that they

07:10.430 --> 07:12.032
in Europe. So, let's expect to s
on the way.

07:13.500 --> 07:17.804
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in other word
idea that they're now accepting

07:18.672 --> 07:20.173
a signal it's OK for more to com

07:20.874 --> 07:21.574
LEONARD DOYLE: Indeed.

07:23.043 --> 07:27.180
And this has of course been the
the so-called pull factor, that

07:28.648 --> 07:30.950
the doors too wide and give too
wedge, you will encourage more a

07:32.419 --> 07:34.954
come. And, indeed, it's the pric
paying for the lack of decisions

07:36.423 --> 07:40.360
of a coherent policy and lack of
to bring people in, in an orderl

07:40.760 --> 07:41.561
way.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.665
Because it's so chaotic, you see
across in boats and indeed drown

07:47.133 --> 07:51.237
that tragic scene of the young S
that moved international hearts

07:52.105 --> 07:53.039
so much over the last couple of

07:54.507 --> 07:57.377
JUDY WOODRUFF: We know, Leonard
many, many of the migrants and r

07:58.845 --> 08:05.518
already left Syria, Afghanistan,
the African continent, to go to

08:06.586 --> 08:11.624
in the region, Turkey, Jordan, L
example.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.262
Why is it not sufficient for the
in some of these countries that

08:16.730 --> 08:17.197
to home?

08:18.064 --> 08:19.165
LEONARD DOYLE: Well, it's a good

08:20.633 --> 08:24.371
I think if they had any confiden
was any day soon going to return

08:25.839 --> 08:29.008
they would probably stay, becaus
It's -- refugees, displaced peop

08:30.477 --> 08:33.980
leaving home. They have got very
of kinship and bonds to their co

08:34.848 --> 08:35.615
don't want to leave that behind.

08:37.083 --> 08:41.020
But I think the despair of what'
in Syria, the lack of any politi

08:42.489 --> 08:45.258
means that they're moving on. An
want to stay in a camp in Jordan

08:46.726 --> 08:49.896
safe that camp may be? These are
want to raise their kids, want t

08:50.764 --> 08:51.898
for them and want to move on in

08:53.366 --> 08:55.435
So, even though they may be tech
where they are, they want to get

08:56.903 --> 08:59.139
security for their future. And I
is really what this is telling u

09:00.607 --> 09:03.977
proper indictment of the interna
really for not sorting out the p

09:05.078 --> 09:07.580
Syria to ensure that innocent pe
suffering.

09:09.048 --> 09:13.953
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why don't we see
like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahr

09:14.821 --> 09:16.289
taking in refugees? What's going

09:17.157 --> 09:18.291
LEONARD DOYLE: Well, that's a ve

09:19.759 --> 09:22.695
There's been a lot of criticism
the Gulf states, but some of it

09:24.164 --> 09:28.668
They have paid inordinate amount
towards the humanitarian cause o

09:30.136 --> 09:33.606
indeed of Syria. They have taken
of people. A key difference is t

09:35.074 --> 09:39.045
not offering them a track toward
They're not offering them asylum

09:40.513 --> 09:44.184
And refugees, they know what the
they want a secure place to be i

09:45.652 --> 09:47.554
And so I think they're voting wi
and going elsewhere, even though

09:49.022 --> 09:53.293
quite different for them perhaps
an indictment in a way of the la

09:54.761 --> 09:56.996
that they're now getting from th
And I think it's been a wakeup c

09:57.397 --> 09:57.430
too.

09:58.898 --> 10:01.734
JUDY WOODRUFF: Leonard Doyle, do
how we refer to these people, wh

10:02.769 --> 10:04.971
them migrants or refugees? How d
that?

10:05.839 --> 10:07.640
LEONARD DOYLE: Well, it is, inde

10:09.108 --> 10:12.979
You have -- the refugees are a s
those who are fleeing war or hum

10:14.447 --> 10:17.116
abuses, and they are entitled to
international law, under the Gen

10:18.585 --> 10:22.689
the convention in 1951. So, it's
to decide. It's an international

10:24.157 --> 10:27.494
Now, if everybody is going to be
refugee, then governments would

10:28.962 --> 10:31.531
to extend that welcome as they s
I think it's terribly important

10:32.999 --> 10:36.803
that the broad mass are called m
who are moving for all sorts of

10:37.937 --> 10:40.507
for human rights reasons or whet
improvement.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.512
They could also be people being
sex trafficking, labor trafficki

10:46.980 --> 10:49.215
unaccompanied minors, young chil
important to keep the distinctio

10:50.683 --> 10:52.852
all migrants, but within them th
specific categories who need pro

10:54.320 --> 10:57.590
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you have a goo
of what it is -- what kinds of s

10:59.058 --> 11:01.628
are going to be provided once th
in these destination countries,

11:03.096 --> 11:07.367
Germany or France or the U.K. or
else? What are they getting when

11:07.800 --> 11:07.867
there?

11:09.335 --> 11:12.238
LEONARD DOYLE: Well, I think one
happened is that these countries

11:13.706 --> 11:16.342
shamed really into opening their
into providing proper care and a

11:16.843 --> 11:17.577
for them.

11:19.045 --> 11:21.114
Whereas they may have been tryin
for budgetary reasons, their pub

11:22.582 --> 11:25.485
has said it's not good enough. S
can expect to be housed properly

11:26.953 --> 11:29.455
be in temporary housing like bar
they will be fed and clothed and

11:30.924 --> 11:33.393
be given integration packages to
learn about the new culture that

11:34.494 --> 11:36.829
language courses, clothing, care
children.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.333
Many of them need psychosocial h
have had horrific experiences wh

11:41.801 --> 11:45.772
come from. So, I think the ones
into the European Union are the

11:47.240 --> 11:49.943
those who perhaps stay in the re
in Jordan and Lebanon or, indeed

11:50.610 --> 11:50.910
maybe not so lucky.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.181
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just finally,
watching who want to help in som

11:56.516 --> 11:58.017
they're in the United States or
else, what can they do?

11:59.419 --> 12:02.388
LEONARD DOYLE: Well, there are m
can extend their generosity.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.826
And one way is of course to dona
organization, International Orga

12:08.294 --> 12:11.931
Migration, has a Web site called
there are many others where we w

12:13.399 --> 12:15.935
encourage people to contribute,
makes a big difference. Looking

12:17.337 --> 12:20.506
refugee family is a very costly
one migrant family equally.

12:21.975 --> 12:25.478
And it's not easy to do this. An
help them directly, well, let's

12:26.946 --> 12:30.617
indirectly, because to see innoc
suffering in this way is shockin

12:32.085 --> 12:35.622
JUDY WOODRUFF: Leonard Doyle wit
Organization for Migration, we t

12:36.856 --> 12:40.994
LEONARD DOYLE: Thank you very mu
for having me on.

12:42.462 --> 12:53.673
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was just three
when more than 100 fast food wor

12:55.141 --> 12:59.245
York City first began walking of
to demand higher wages and bette

13:00.713 --> 13:05.685
conditions. Now a $15-an-hour mi
is becoming a reality for many l

13:06.352 --> 13:07.286
across the country.

13:08.154 --> 13:09.055
Jeffrey Brown has our Labor Day

13:10.523 --> 13:12.892
JEFFREY BROWN: This summer has b
one for the movement. Los Angele

13:14.360 --> 13:18.598
agreed to raise the minimum wage
hour to $15. Mayors of eight oth

13:20.066 --> 13:24.003
near San Francisco, including Sa
expected to soon endorse a simil

13:25.471 --> 13:30.376
New York State is moving toward
wage for all fast food workers;

13:31.844 --> 13:35.848
been signed into law in other ci
Seattle, with wages hiked gradua

13:36.716 --> 13:40.019
on the city, between 2017 and 20

13:41.487 --> 13:43.856
We look at the movement's growin
and questions about its impact.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.527
Robert Reich is former secretary
and now professor of public poli

13:48.995 --> 13:52.565
University of California at Berk
a workers walkout at a McDonald'

13:54.033 --> 13:57.570
His new book is called "Saving C
For the Many, Not the Few." And

13:59.038 --> 14:03.142
is an economist who studies labo
wages. He's a scholar at the Ame

14:03.643 --> 14:03.409
Institute.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.044
And I want to welcome both of yo

14:05.912 --> 14:06.412
Robert Reich, let me start with

14:07.880 --> 14:12.351
Overview first. Is it fair to se
as taking real hold and why do y

14:13.219 --> 14:13.619
has picked up so much momentum?

14:15.088 --> 14:17.657
ROBERT REICH, Former U.S. Labor
Jeff, I do think that it is taki

14:19.125 --> 14:22.895
I think it's picked up momentum
one thing, the minimum wage in r

14:24.363 --> 14:29.469
adjusted for inflation, keeps on
If we had the same minimum wage

14:30.703 --> 14:32.371
in 1968, adjusted for inflation,
be over $10 today.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.710
I think a lot of people who are
lower middle class and poor are

14:39.178 --> 14:42.515
look, this is just simply unfair
you have got a lot of middle cla

14:43.983 --> 14:47.720
people are saying, we're paying
taxes to keep working people out

14:49.188 --> 14:51.858
which is effectively a subsidy t
low-wage employers. And that's n

14:53.326 --> 14:54.927
JEFFREY BROWN: Michael Strain, h
assess the strength of the movem

14:55.495 --> 14:55.495
is behind it?

14:56.963 --> 14:56.963
MICHAEL STRAIN, American Enterpr
Well, I think there's no questio

14:58.431 --> 15:02.402
movement is strong and seems to
stronger and, by their metrics o

15:03.269 --> 15:04.704
they have racked up some real vi

15:06.172 --> 15:10.243
I think if we raise the minimum
an hour or similar levels in the

15:11.711 --> 15:14.013
it will create winners, it will
In my judgment, there are going

15:15.481 --> 15:18.417
losers than winners. I think it'
strategy. But I certainly unders

15:19.886 --> 15:24.290
motivating these workers and the
and I admire the goal, which is

15:25.158 --> 15:26.859
working poor and working class A

15:28.327 --> 15:32.165
JEFFREY BROWN: Is there evidence
to support the losers propositio

15:33.432 --> 15:35.101
making? Do you see things, or is
you are speculating?

15:35.968 --> 15:36.135
MICHAEL STRAIN: Well, this is al

15:36.803 --> 15:36.803
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.841
MICHAEL STRAIN: And there have b
anecdotal pieces of evidence tha

15:42.542 --> 15:43.309
seen in the newspaper.

15:44.777 --> 15:49.115
It's much too early for any sort
economic study of the effects of

15:50.583 --> 15:53.252
we're all kind of flying blind,
increases the riskiness of the s

15:54.654 --> 15:56.489
makes it even less wise than if
a bit of evidence about it.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.258
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Robert Reic
still questions at this point ab

16:00.726 --> 16:05.631
of countereffects one might see
point it might kick in if you mo

16:06.499 --> 16:08.835
and very far. What do you see so

16:10.303 --> 16:13.773
ROBERT REICH: There's a lot of r
the country that has compared st

16:15.241 --> 16:19.879
you have the federal minimum wag
to states that have put their mi

16:21.347 --> 16:24.650
above the federal level -- and t
under federal law -- comparing o

16:25.518 --> 16:27.353
of border what's happened to lab

16:28.821 --> 16:31.557
And they have actually found tha
that have raised their minimum w

16:33.025 --> 16:37.897
has been little or no negative j
that is, no increase in unemploy

16:39.365 --> 16:43.302
for two reasons, one, because if
people more money, they will spe

16:44.770 --> 16:49.041
that creates jobs in that local
and, secondly, because a lot of

16:50.509 --> 16:53.145
attracted into the labor market
not otherwise look for a job whe

16:53.779 --> 16:54.747
wages are raised.

16:56.215 --> 17:02.788
And that gives employers more ch
to hire, meaning less turnover,

17:03.489 --> 17:03.623
Employers save money.

17:05.091 --> 17:06.993
JEFFREY BROWN: And what's the do
you're seeing, Michael Strain, o

17:07.526 --> 17:07.526
worry about?

17:08.995 --> 17:11.898
MICHAEL STRAIN: Well, I think th
Reich is correct that there are

17:13.366 --> 17:16.469
that show that there are not str
Some studies show there are stro

17:17.937 --> 17:20.373
It's worth noting that the nonpa
highly respected Congressional B

17:21.841 --> 17:24.977
thinks that, if we raise the fed
wage to $10.10, there will be hu

17:26.345 --> 17:29.081
thousands fewer jobs. So I don't
debate is settled on this.

17:30.549 --> 17:35.421
I'm worried about the magnitude
This minimum wage increase, $15

17:36.889 --> 17:40.359
big cities, will go very high up
distribution. It will cover a qu

17:41.827 --> 17:44.430
of workers in some of these citi
something to be concerned about.

17:45.064 --> 17:45.631
And in addition...

17:47.099 --> 17:48.868
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me just stop
Do you think it has a different

17:49.602 --> 17:49.468
different wage earners?

17:50.336 --> 17:50.736
MICHAEL STRAIN: Oh, I think so.

17:52.204 --> 17:56.943
I think the existing evidence lo
increases in the minimum wage an

17:58.411 --> 18:01.614
a broad class of workers. Going
know, $9 an hour or whatever it

18:02.481 --> 18:04.183
states to $15 is not a modest in

18:05.651 --> 18:11.023
And, in addition, doing this onl
causes problems, potential probl

18:12.491 --> 18:15.528
because it puts workers in that
comparative disadvantage to a ve

18:16.996 --> 18:20.666
suburb. And the question is, are
to see suburban businesses grow

18:22.134 --> 18:24.236
workers living inside the city l
to be being at a significant dis

18:25.705 --> 18:27.540
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Robert Reic
one I have heard and we have all

18:29.008 --> 18:32.378
the last couple of years, just t
that it creates even within a pa

18:33.212 --> 18:33.479
What's your response to that?

18:34.947 --> 18:38.451
ROBERT REICH: Well, it would be
the entire federal minimum wage

18:39.919 --> 18:44.557
uniformly across the country muc
it is right now and still allow

18:45.424 --> 18:47.426
raise their own state minimum wa

18:48.894 --> 18:51.597
But -- and I also think that Mic
good point about the possibility

18:53.065 --> 18:57.470
I mean, we just don't know. But
places that have increased their

18:58.738 --> 19:01.607
are phasing them in. They're not
suddenly overnight.

19:03.075 --> 19:08.414
We also have an ethical issue he
there are job losses, we -- you

19:09.882 --> 19:13.819
society, we have established min
of decency. We don't have child

19:15.287 --> 19:18.190
require employers to provide saf
even though that increased drama

19:19.025 --> 19:21.027
some cases the cost of labor.

19:22.495 --> 19:27.299
We simply don't say the market i
define everything about the way

19:28.734 --> 19:33.039
so decency, morality, kind of et
obviously do play a part here.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.608
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you bo
last couple of minutes -- I will

19:37.076 --> 19:40.212
you, Michael Strain -- the large
larger context, is that wage gro

19:41.080 --> 19:43.349
so flat over the -- and remains

19:44.817 --> 19:47.119
MICHAEL STRAIN: Well, I think th
question. Lots of possibilities.

19:47.653 --> 19:47.253
(CROSSTALK)

19:48.654 --> 19:49.622
JEFFREY BROWN: Of course it is.
about 30 -- I'm kidding you.

19:50.122 --> 19:49.789
(LAUGHTER)

19:51.257 --> 19:53.059
JEFFREY BROWN: But I know it's a
but it's one we have been asking

19:53.559 --> 19:53.225
years now.

19:53.893 --> 19:53.492
MICHAEL STRAIN: Yes.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.563
I subscribe to the simple answer
hit really hard in the great rec

19:59.031 --> 20:01.700
that we're still suffering from
demand, and that when demand com

20:03.169 --> 20:08.140
businesses will be faced with th
compete harder to attract worker

20:09.608 --> 20:12.244
workers, and that's going to cau
go up, and I think we're just no

20:13.646 --> 20:15.648
JEFFREY BROWN: Robert Reich, wha
to that hard, big question?

20:17.016 --> 20:19.385
ROBERT REICH: Yes, I will tell y
just the great recession.

20:20.853 --> 20:27.193
If you go back to 1978-'79, wage
flatten and diverge from product

20:28.661 --> 20:33.499
And really the typical wage earn
almost no increase in wages, adj

20:34.366 --> 20:35.468
inflation, since the late 1970s.

20:36.936 --> 20:42.374
I think the real reason is that
have really pushed wages down, u

20:43.843 --> 20:48.948
globalization, substituting tech
workers, and creating -- and bas

20:49.815 --> 20:53.385
unions. All of that has generate

20:54.854 --> 20:56.188
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Michae
you get a quick last word, since

20:57.656 --> 20:58.958
MICHAEL STRAIN: Well, I would li
something that he said earlier.

21:00.426 --> 21:04.430
I completely agree that this is
and the goal of helping low-wage

21:05.898 --> 21:09.101
workers is a very good goal and
be used, not just markets. I thi

21:10.569 --> 21:13.372
better alternatives to the minim
Earned Income Tax Credit puts mo

21:14.840 --> 21:17.643
in these workers' pockets. It do
the risk of putting workers out

21:18.511 --> 21:19.478
actually brings people into jobs

21:20.946 --> 21:25.484
And I think it's just a much sup
So, we don't disagree on the goa

21:26.952 --> 21:29.555
on the means to get there. And I
are just simply much better poli

21:30.189 --> 21:30.389
the minimum wage.

21:31.524 --> 21:32.391
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, we wil
right there.

31:34.126 --> 31:37.796
JUDY WOODRUFF: Other Republican
were out on the trail. But Donal

31:39.131 --> 31:43.068
is leading all national GOP poll
have any public events.

31:44.536 --> 31:49.441
As we enter this next phase of t
it's a particularly good Monday

31:49.908 --> 31:50.475
Monday.

31:51.943 --> 31:55.247
Joining me are Tamara Keith of N
Walter of The Cook Political Rep

31:56.248 --> 31:57.082
Welcome, and thank you for being
Day.

31:57.949 --> 31:58.083
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political R

31:59.551 --> 32:01.720
JUDY WOODRUFF: So we have been r
I know you have seen it as well

32:03.188 --> 32:06.558
refugee crisis in Europe. We hav
how the European countries are -

32:07.425 --> 32:09.327
them are offering to take in the

32:10.796 --> 32:14.299
Just in the last hour or so, Tam
the White House is now telling r

32:15.767 --> 32:19.204
they are looking seriously at wh
States can do. What are you hear

32:19.638 --> 32:19.204
that?

32:20.672 --> 32:20.972
TAMARA KEITH, National Public Ra
an administration official has c

32:22.440 --> 32:27.312
me that they are considering a w
of options in responding to the

32:28.180 --> 32:30.348
including possible refugee reset

32:31.817 --> 32:36.988
And I e-mailed back and said, in
And they said yes. So, that is a

32:38.456 --> 32:41.726
is a response that is clearly no
yet, but they're working on it a

32:42.594 --> 32:43.195
people to know that they're work

32:44.663 --> 32:46.698
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I was reading
already spends something like $4

32:48.099 --> 32:50.802
year in Syria, so they're lookin
also at spending more money.

32:52.270 --> 32:55.140
Amy, do you see this becoming an
is some talk about -- well, more

32:56.608 --> 32:57.576
-- about whether Congress is goi
at this when they come back into

32:59.044 --> 33:02.080
AMY WALTER: Well, and, certainly
now is saying we're looking at b

33:03.315 --> 33:04.349
refugees into the country, I thi
will be an issue.

33:05.817 --> 33:10.055
And you're seeing the Republican
up as a security issue, and the

33:11.523 --> 33:18.096
is being raised by many of the 2
at least is that a Syrian refuge

33:19.564 --> 33:21.700
terrorist. We may -- by letting
people in, we may be letting som

33:23.034 --> 33:26.404
in that are dangerous to the U.S
we screen them properly?

33:27.873 --> 33:30.542
So that, I think, will be brough
on the campaign trail and will b

33:31.142 --> 33:31.042
up in Congress.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.947
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do we see a diffe
know a couple of the Republicans

33:37.415 --> 33:41.953
I guess even Donald Trump, even
position on the border, on immig

33:43.121 --> 33:44.589
said, you know, possibly the U.S
to take in...

33:46.057 --> 33:48.660
TAMARA KEITH: And I think that i
all he has said thus far. It has

33:49.527 --> 33:50.996
detailed policy prescription or

33:52.464 --> 33:58.203
John Kasich also said possibly m
could be sent to help with the c

33:59.671 --> 34:02.107
then otherwise, the candidates h
-- the Republican candidates hav

34:03.575 --> 34:08.280
been saying this is a European p
trying to push that off and make

34:08.747 --> 34:08.647
problem.

34:10.115 --> 34:12.284
JUDY WOODRUFF: But pretty much,
the Democrats are saying, we wil

34:12.851 --> 34:12.918
we have to do.

34:14.386 --> 34:17.188
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. And Martin O'
is running for president, a Demo

34:18.657 --> 34:21.092
Maryland governor, has come out
he thinks that the U.S. needs to

34:22.560 --> 34:24.296
increase the number of Syrian re
into the country in the coming y

34:25.764 --> 34:28.133
AMY WALTER: But everybody has be
be clear, everyone's been very v

34:29.601 --> 34:34.773
wants to sort of step out on thi
the Martin O'Malley number. Even

34:35.640 --> 34:36.574
wasn't being very specific about

34:37.442 --> 34:38.109
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, I did notice

34:39.577 --> 34:42.447
So it is Labor Day. And, Amy, yo
-- I notice you have said that t

34:43.315 --> 34:45.216
traditional jumping off point fo

34:45.850 --> 34:45.450
AMY WALTER: Right.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.021
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have had these
running for months and months an

34:50.889 --> 34:51.356
But things are going to change.

34:51.890 --> 34:51.423
(CROSSTALK)

34:52.891 --> 34:55.126
AMY WALTER: Right. We have been
Monday now for a long time. And

34:55.894 --> 34:57.028
been a lot to talk about.

34:58.496 --> 35:01.266
But, believe it or not -- and I'
you people who live in the early

35:02.734 --> 35:06.271
this -- the money has not even b
spent yet. We're starting to see

35:07.739 --> 35:10.976
PACs and the candidates tell us
they're going to start advertisi

35:11.443 --> 35:11.543
states.

35:13.011 --> 35:17.048
They're putting big, big media b
New Hampshire, and South Carolin

35:18.516 --> 35:20.852
going to hear more about candida
going to see more issues being r

35:22.320 --> 35:25.256
have another debate coming up on
16 with the Republicans. Democra

35:26.725 --> 35:30.862
see until October. But there's g
a lot more in the mix now and a

35:31.730 --> 35:32.964
spent than we have seen up until

35:34.432 --> 35:36.201
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is advertising go
the main difference, do you thin

35:37.669 --> 35:39.204
TAMARA KEITH: Well, Hillary Clin
has announced that they're going

35:40.672 --> 35:44.509
in another $4.1 million for ads
keep the ads on the air through

35:45.744 --> 35:49.614
and October in New Hampshire and
that is a change.

35:51.082 --> 35:55.120
I mean, they have been on the ai
They will continue to be on the

see more of the candidates also.

to be crunch time.

36:04.429 --> 36:09.501
AMY WALTER: Yes. Hillary Clinton

DeGeneres show this week, which

36:16.207 --> 36:20.311
says television is a way for her
a larger audience. Certainly, El

has a large audience and sort of
audience than some other outlets

36:24.315 --> 36:24.282
AMY WALTER: Right.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.119
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it may also r
feeling that she needs to get he

36:28.987 --> 36:29.988
out there at a time when she's h

36:31.456 --> 36:36.895
There was yet another poll today
I guess, NBC poll showing she's

AMY WALTER: I think it's a combi
all of these things.

36:54.112 --> 36:55.880
Now, if you talk to the Hillary

Now, they said this at the very
But the one thing that we have t

37:16.835 --> 37:18.636
with Bernie Sanders, the questio
well is he going to do in Iowa,

37:20.105 --> 37:25.610
is, what happens next? Where Ber
does very well is with liberal v

37:27.078 --> 37:29.714
he has been doing really well in
that have a lot of liberal voter

37:30.181 --> 37:30.115
voters.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.152
The question for Bernie Sanders
do well among the minority voter

37:35.620 --> 37:40.391
up a very significant chunk of t
base? And the next polling I wou

37:41.860 --> 37:46.097
see is from South Carolina, a st
third in the map, but has an ele

37:47.332 --> 37:49.000
the Democratic side that's 50 pe
African-American.

37:50.468 --> 37:51.736
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Tamara, is t
going to shake out? Are we going

37:53.204 --> 37:56.007
-- are we going to see the conto
before we get to the South Carol

37:57.475 --> 38:00.945
TAMARA KEITH: I think that we wi
sense. Once some decent polling

38:02.046 --> 38:04.415
we will have a sense of how Sout
is going.

38:05.884 --> 38:09.821
He's back in the state again. He
is not taking it for granted, bu

38:11.289 --> 38:15.026
wants to work for it. But he has
that he has a great organization

38:16.494 --> 38:19.097
he has an OK organization on the
New Hampshire, and he has a lot

38:19.964 --> 38:21.499
do in South Carolina and Nevada.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.905
Meanwhile, Clinton's people are
we have got a 50-state strategy,

38:28.373 --> 38:32.810
sort of do. They had people orga

(LAUGHTER)

38:43.021 --> 38:46.024
TAMARA KEITH: And I have say tha
supporters are not saying they d

38:47.492 --> 38:50.128
Hillary Clinton. They are saying
Bernie Sanders, that he's saying

38:51.129 --> 38:53.264
that speaks to them. And that ca
off.

38:54.732 --> 38:56.000
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk quickl
Republicans. There are lot of th

38:56.434 --> 38:56.434
about.

38:57.902 --> 39:00.972
But, Amy, what do you make of th

Two big changes, though, is, in
not on the ballot, and, number t

39:32.704 --> 39:35.173
are on the ballot. This will be
of an Obama economy that the Dem

going to have to defend. And, fi
this is actually a good thing fo

39:41.079 --> 39:44.349
an opportunity for Scott Walker,
having a very difficult summer.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.653
His numbers dropped dramatically
in a place like Iowa, a state he

39:50.121 --> 39:55.226
win. Being able to be taken on b
and using that as a badge of hon

39:56.060 --> 39:56.294
particularly helpful for him.

39:57.428 --> 39:57.962
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just quickly,
his profile.

39:58.496 --> 39:58.229
(CROSSTALK)

39:58.863 --> 39:59.063
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

40:00.531 --> 40:03.434
And he put out a statement sayin
that Barack Obama is coming afte

40:04.502 --> 40:06.371
that the Democrats think that I
threat.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.975
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the one man
out on the trail today, we know

40:12.443 --> 40:13.745
was Donald Trump. So I guess we'
wait and talk about him next wee

40:14.612 --> 40:14.779
AMY WALTER: Yes. That will be...

40:15.280 --> 40:14.946

41:13.004 --> 41:18.076
STEPHANIE JOYCE: Erik Malmkvist'
to be a lot easier, before renew

41:19.544 --> 41:22.246
Malmkvist runs the power grid fo
an island of 40,000 people off t

41:23.548 --> 41:26.284
Denmark. The island's electricit
is fairly predictable.

41:27.752 --> 41:31.589
ERIK MALMKVIST, Denmark: You can
get up in the morning about half

41:33.057 --> 41:38.529
then make something. And then th
and then they just stop. And tha

41:39.397 --> 41:40.631
day. And that's the curves we ar

41:42.100 --> 41:45.803
STEPHANIE JOYCE: But the island'
supply is becoming less predicta

41:47.271 --> 41:51.175
most places, Bornholm used to ge
its power from coal and gas, but

41:52.477 --> 41:55.413
than half comes from wind and so
fluctuate constantly.

41:56.881 --> 42:00.184
ERIK MALMKVIST: You can see the
then suddenly it goes up and dow

42:01.052 --> 42:01.285
time. So, it's very, very unstab

42:02.754 --> 42:06.958
STEPHANIE JOYCE: As Denmark adds
energy, that mismatch between wh

42:08.192 --> 42:10.661
is being produced and when it's
a growing problem.

42:12.130 --> 42:15.733
But this sleepy fishing island i
a cutting-edge energy experiment

42:17.201 --> 42:20.805
make the variability of wind and
of a problem. Bornholm has brand

42:22.273 --> 42:25.810
the bright green test island and
a series of futuristic experimen

42:27.111 --> 42:31.282
on the electric grid. The most a
is called EcoGrid E.U.

42:32.750 --> 42:36.087
At the demonstration house, proj
Maja Bendtsen shows off how it w

42:37.555 --> 42:39.390
MAJA BENDTSEN, Project Leader: S
some of the equipment that we're

42:39.924 --> 42:40.124
the project.

42:41.592 --> 42:44.595
STEPHANIE JOYCE: The EcoGrid pro
up the traditional relationship

42:46.063 --> 42:50.334
supply and demand. It gets peopl
power when there's lots availabl

42:51.202 --> 42:59.544
when there isn't. It's called de

43:01.012 --> 43:04.081
Bendtsen uses a LEGO model to he
how demand response helps integr

43:05.550 --> 43:09.120
solar into the island's grid. It
she learned about as a kid, when

43:09.987 --> 43:11.022
installed a wind turbine on thei

MAJA BENDTSEN: When it was windy
up all the radiator valves full

43:18.563 --> 43:24.368

the wind turbine -- the wind tur

43:25.236 --> 43:27.705
anyway, the energy was free and

43:29.173 --> 43:32.677
STEPHANIE JOYCE: The EcoGrid exp
relies on using more power when

43:34.145 --> 43:38.216
renewable energy available, and
there isn't. But unlike when Ben

43:39.550 --> 43:41.586
a kid, no one has to run around
closing radiator valves.

43:43.054 --> 43:46.057
MAJA BENDTSEN: A signal goes thr
gateway, and then a signal to th

43:47.525 --> 43:50.228

MAJA BENDTSEN: Demand response h

44:12.884 --> 44:15.786
do with using the energy when it

44:17.088 --> 44:19.023
STEPHANIE JOYCE: Which helps wit
the grid, if it works.

44:20.491 --> 44:23.394

45:14.078 --> 45:17.148
STEPHANIE JOYCE: She's not the o
thinks so. Back on the mainland,

45:18.616 --> 45:21.852
Christensen, the chief technolog
Dansk Energi, the Danish energy

45:23.154 --> 45:25.923
He agrees it's a shame demand re
ready for prime time.

45:27.391 --> 45:29.594
JORGEN CHRISTENSEN, Dansk Energi
overinvesting because we are not

45:30.461 --> 45:32.129
the energy that we produce in a

45:33.598 --> 45:36.634
STEPHANIE JOYCE: Overinvesting i
transmission lines and backup po

45:38.102 --> 45:41.839
which wouldn't be necessary if d
worked better. Christensen is co

45:43.307 --> 45:46.377
technical problems with demand r
get sorted out. But he's worried

45:47.845 --> 45:52.083
take time to convince people of
maybe too much time, given the c

45:52.650 --> 45:53.084
energy goals.

45:54.552 --> 45:58.122
JORGEN CHRISTENSEN: If I would a
whether she would have a flexibl

45:59.590 --> 46:02.960
charging of her electric vehicle
pump today, she would say, well,

46:03.995 --> 46:05.663
heard about it today. So that's
there.

46:07.131 --> 46:09.166
JACOB OSTERGAARD, Danish Technic
On the left side you have a pict

46:10.034 --> 46:11.002
and the green dots are substatio

46:12.470 --> 46:15.873
STEPHANIE JOYCE: On the campus o
Technical University, researcher

46:17.341 --> 46:20.378
both the technological and the c
of the problem. They have been a

46:21.746 --> 46:24.048
results of the Bornholm experime
excited about its promise.

46:25.516 --> 46:29.186
But Jacob Ostergaard, who is in
the lab, says what they have don

46:30.588 --> 46:32.723
just the beginning, and compares
nascent cell phone industry.

46:34.191 --> 46:37.361
JACOB OSTERGAARD: You can say th
have developed is, basically, we

46:38.162 --> 46:38.696
the smartphone and one app.

46:39.563 --> 46:41.599
STEPHANIE JOYCE: The app being d

46:43.067 --> 46:47.538
Now, in the analogy, Ostergaard
other apps to transform electric

46:49.006 --> 46:52.943
same way the smartphone changed
He thinks, in a few years, we wo

46:53.811 --> 46:54.478
about electricity the same way.

46:55.946 --> 47:01.519
JACOB OSTERGAARD: Instead of buy
hours, which are very difficult

47:02.987 --> 47:08.259
how much is a kilowatt hour and
we could buy comfort, for instan

47:09.126 --> 47:11.395
buy 21 degrees Celsius in our ho

47:12.530 --> 47:15.733
STEPHANIE JOYCE: That's a comfor
Fahrenheit.

47:17.201 --> 47:19.970
Whatever those new ways of think
electricity end up being, more l

47:20.838 --> 47:22.473
not, you will find them on Bornh

47:23.774 --> 47:32.149
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Step
in Bornholm, Denmark.

47:33.617 --> 47:42.126
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
look at some interesting reporti

47:42.693 --> 47:43.327
Not Trending.

47:44.195 --> 47:46.497
Gwen Ifill recently recorded our

47:47.965 --> 47:51.902
GWEN IFILL: This week, we're loo
thinkers you may not have heard

47:53.370 --> 47:57.074
using advances in technology and
chart important new paths. That

47:58.542 --> 48:02.446
effort to create a kind of a bio
a new way of building an eco-fri

48:03.914 --> 48:08.786
made partially out of saltwater,
attracting new ballet lovers via

48:10.254 --> 48:12.923
Carlos Watson is the founder and
which has stories about all of t

48:13.691 --> 48:14.525
site. And he joins me now.

48:15.392 --> 48:15.760
All the tech all the time, Carlo

48:17.228 --> 48:18.796
CARLOS WATSON, CEO, OZY: Why not
you told me basketball was off t

48:19.864 --> 48:21.465
football, rather, was off the ta
go tech.

48:21.966 --> 48:21.565
(LAUGHTER)

48:23.033 --> 48:25.870
GWEN IFILL: Let's -- talking abo
idea of creating a working elect

48:26.437 --> 48:26.771
of the brain.

48:28.239 --> 48:31.308
CARLOS WATSON: It would be reall
would allow researchers to do al

48:32.777 --> 48:36.580
things to pursue cures for thing
and other things, instead of usi

48:38.048 --> 48:41.552
and other things, if you had a r
and well-functioning simulated e

48:41.986 --> 48:41.819
brain.

48:43.287 --> 48:47.224
So, they're starting to make pro
The U.S. has put $3 billion, Eur

48:48.092 --> 48:48.726
others, but still a little ways

48:50.194 --> 48:52.696
GWEN IFILL: But what does that m
it work? Exactly what are we tal

48:53.564 --> 48:54.799
An actual model that you plug in

48:55.299 --> 48:55.065
(LAUGHTER)

48:55.833 --> 48:56.200
GWEN IFILL: I don't know.

48:57.668 --> 48:59.170
CARLOS WATSON: There's all kinds
it could take. And that's kind o

49:00.638 --> 49:03.440
where it could live on a chip in
that looks a little more friendl

49:04.909 --> 49:08.345
You know what was interesting? O
researchers in Manchester, the U

49:09.814 --> 49:11.749
me that in order to power that -
it may come in a small case, wha

49:13.217 --> 49:16.020
case looks like, in order to pow
says the computer power would ta

49:17.388 --> 49:20.391
hangar. Like, that's how much po
need in order to do that.

49:21.458 --> 49:22.226
GWEN IFILL: And the practical ap
is what?

49:23.093 --> 49:24.295
CARLOS WATSON: So, two ones to t

49:25.763 --> 49:28.265
One idea is faster, better, more
which hopefully brings us cures

49:29.733 --> 49:32.703
like Alzheimer's and other thing
two, eventually -- and again, a

49:34.171 --> 49:36.307
these things are decades away, n
away, but they're not hundreds o

49:37.641 --> 49:40.144
-- might be helping you with sho
long-term memory lapses.

49:41.445 --> 49:42.780
GWEN IFILL: What did you say? I'
forgot what you said.

49:43.280 --> 49:43.147
(LAUGHTER)

49:44.481 --> 49:45.115
CARLOS WATSON: You know what? Yo
moment, as we call them.

49:45.850 --> 49:45.482
GWEN IFILL: Yes, I did.

49:46.150 --> 49:45.916
CARLOS WATSON: Yes.

49:47.384 --> 49:50.588
GWEN IFILL: So, let's talk about
of a battery that is powered by

49:51.455 --> 49:51.856
CARLOS WATSON: Don't you love th

49:52.456 --> 49:52.323
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

49:53.791 --> 49:54.825
CARLOS WATSON: Everything is goi
It's not just Whole Foods anymor

49:55.593 --> 49:55.860
GWEN IFILL: That's right.

49:57.328 --> 50:00.898
CARLOS WATSON: The idea was that
we start tapping sun and wind po

50:02.366 --> 50:04.768
whether it's panels on people's
sorts of other things, it's grea

50:06.237 --> 50:09.240
sun is out, but what about when
down? How do you store that ener

50:10.007 --> 50:10.140
fact being able to use it?

50:11.609 --> 50:13.811
And so a lot of folks have begun
different kinds of batteries, ki

50:15.279 --> 50:17.481
stable batteries, not the kind t
your car or go in your computer,

50:18.682 --> 50:20.451
of a battery that might be in yo
in a university.

50:21.318 --> 50:22.586
GWEN IFILL: Who is this guy Jay

50:24.054 --> 50:27.057
CARLOS WATSON: You have got to l
Mellon professor who a number of

50:28.525 --> 50:31.495
said that there is a better way
in fact can we create a batterie

50:32.963 --> 50:36.233
some of this sun and wind power,
have got to not admit kind of to

50:37.701 --> 50:40.638
So, they have go to be, if you w
eco-friendly? And in fact he wan

50:42.106 --> 50:45.509
that it was so eco-friendly and
to make it and all that, that, f

50:46.377 --> 50:47.244
or two, he actually bit into one

50:48.045 --> 50:47.945
GWEN IFILL: You're kidding?

50:49.413 --> 50:50.948
CARLOS WATSON: No, he's really n
eat it, instead of the good stuf

50:51.482 --> 50:51.248
(CROSSTALK)

50:52.116 --> 50:53.550
GWEN IFILL: But he's proving tha

50:55.019 --> 50:58.122
CARLOS WATSON: But he's proving
safer than the kind of toxic bat

50:58.989 --> 50:59.089
that you're used to thinking abo

50:59.957 --> 51:00.424
GWEN IFILL: And what would you u

51:01.292 --> 51:02.092
CARLOS WATSON: You would use the

51:03.560 --> 51:06.230
So, let's say you put solar pane
house. You generate a lot of ene

51:07.698 --> 51:09.833
the day, but you want to use som
energy at night. These batteries

51:11.302 --> 51:12.803
store it and allow you to use it
instead of using the electric gr

51:14.271 --> 51:18.409
GWEN IFILL: So, let's talk about
of this, which is a new venue pr

51:19.443 --> 51:22.012
old art, which is to say YouTube
Cote?

51:23.480 --> 51:27.151
CARLOS WATSON: Well, he's a Queb
those out there who are from Can

51:28.385 --> 51:31.755
a 33-year-old principal dancer a
Ballet of Canada.

51:33.223 --> 51:35.526
And while that, in and of itself
what's he's done is, he's kind o

51:36.994 --> 51:39.596
in an era of ballet on the Web.
you're thinking, well, isn't eve

51:40.064 --> 51:39.863
the Web?

51:40.464 --> 51:40.331
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

51:41.198 --> 51:41.832
CARLOS WATSON: And to some exten

51:43.300 --> 51:46.503
But he did that was really speci
to create these little two-minut

51:47.972 --> 51:51.976
gorgeous films of him and in som
doing ballet, and really brought

51:52.609 --> 51:53.043
100 or 200 people.

51:54.511 --> 51:57.181
GWEN IFILL: And gorgeous films a
man with the gorgeous films, whi

51:58.215 --> 51:58.716
people -- part of the reason peo
Right?

51:59.550 --> 51:59.383
CARLOS WATSON: You know what?

52:00.851 --> 52:03.754
As he said to me -- I was talkin
He said, the honest truth is tha

52:05.222 --> 52:07.925
naked, right? He said, I have go
on. But the truth of the matter

52:09.393 --> 52:13.731
a fit athlete who, for two minut
motion, with really clear facial

52:15.032 --> 52:16.367
that you wouldn't normally get i
sitting at the ballet.

52:17.835 --> 52:20.471
And so he's bringing in literall
of thousands, but millions of ne

52:21.939 --> 52:24.608
as he said himself, despite the
one of the world's best dancers,

52:25.209 --> 52:25.275
him much before.

52:26.744 --> 52:29.780
GWEN IFILL: Is there an economic
support reaching new audiences t

52:30.514 --> 52:31.782
CARLOS WATSON: Not yet.

52:33.250 --> 52:35.019
And that worries him, because ma
of these, even though they're on

52:36.487 --> 52:40.024
long, sometimes he will spend $2
$50,000 doing them. So, he's onl

52:41.325 --> 52:43.127
used a Kickstarter campaign. But
there's a way forward.

52:44.595 --> 52:47.264
Now, the exception to this are s
big ballet companies like the Ne

52:48.732 --> 52:51.702
Ballet and others, who are smart
these kind of films as ways to g

52:53.170 --> 52:57.441
Carlos to go to the ballet and t
$200, $300 -- I know you do the

52:58.142 --> 52:58.242
do the nicer tickets.

52:59.009 --> 52:59.243
GWEN IFILL: It's who I am.

53:00.711 --> 53:02.913
CARLOS WATSON: That's who you ar
knows. Maybe there's a way that

53:04.248 --> 53:07.051
GWEN IFILL: Well, the brain, bat
dance all in one place.

53:07.918 --> 53:09.219
Thank you very much, Carlos Wats

53:10.087 --> 53:17.394
CARLOS WATSON: Always good to be
