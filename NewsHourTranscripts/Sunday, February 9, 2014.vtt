IMPOSSIBLE FOR THAT COUNTRY TO

LEADING EXPERTS ON IRAN'

PROGRAM AND PRESIDENT OF SCIENCE

04:24.567 --> 04:25.767
AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY

04:25.767 --> 04:27.767
SO WITHOUT BEING TOO TECHNICAL

04:27.767 --> 04:30.600
FOR A WIDER AUDIENCE, WHAT'S

04:30.600 --> 04:31.633
NOTEWORTHY ABOUT THESE STEPS

04:31.633 --> 04:32.833
IRAN AGREED TO TAKE.

04:32.833 --> 04:34.033
>> THERE ARE SEVERAL STEPS THA

04:34.033 --> 04:35.067
ARE QUITE INTERESTING.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.667
ONE, THERE'S A COUPLE STEPS THAT

04:37.667 --> 04:38.900
HAVE TO DO WITH THIS IRAQ HEAV

04:38.900 --> 04:41.700
WATER REACTOR THAT'S BEEN IN THE

04:41.700 --> 04:41.900
SPOTLIGHT.

04:41.900 --> 04:44.633
IT APPEARS IAEA IS NOT GETTING

04:44.633 --> 04:46.500
THE INFORMATION IT NEEDS FRO

04:46.500 --> 04:47.200
IRAN YET

04:47.200 --> 04:48.733
TWO OF THE STEPS ARE SO THEY CAN

04:48.733 --> 04:51.267
GET THAT INFORMATION SO THEY CAN

04:51.267 --> 04:54.667
THEN INSPECT THE REACTOR

04:54.667 --> 04:54.933
EFFECTIVELY.

04:54.933 --> 04:56.800
THERE'S INFORMATION, ONE OF TH

04:56.800 --> 05:00.200
STEPS CENTERS ON WHAT WAS AN OLD

05:00.200 --> 05:02.733
SECRET LASER ENRICHMENT FACILITY

05:02.733 --> 05:05.933
IRAN SHUT DOWN PRIOR TO 2004

05:05.933 --> 05:09.333
OPERATED OUTSIDE OF THE IAEA'S

05:09.333 --> 05:10.733
INSPECTION SYSTEM AND

05:10.733 --> 05:12.900
VIOLATION OF THEIR SAFEGUARD

05:12.900 --> 05:13.367
OBLIGATIONS.

05:13.367 --> 05:14.833
THE FACILITY IS NOT THOUGHT TO

05:14.833 --> 05:17.500
BE INVOLVED IN LASER ENRICHMEN

05:17.500 --> 05:19.033
BUT THEY LIKE TO GO THERE TO SEE

05:19.033 --> 05:20.000
WHAT'S GOING ON.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.733
STILL DOES LASER RESEARCH AN

05:22.733 --> 05:25.000
DEVELOPMENT, SO IT'S GOING T

05:25.000 --> 05:27.167
GET INFORMATION ABOUT TH

05:27.167 --> 05:28.233
ACTIVITIES AND THEN VISIT TH

05:28.233 --> 05:31.200
SITE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINC

05:31.200 --> 05:31.467
2008

05:31.467 --> 05:32.567
PROBABLY THE MOST SIGNIFICAN

05:32.567 --> 05:35.067
STEP IS TO TRY TO OPEN THE DOO

05:35.067 --> 05:40.333
A LITTLE BIT ON GETTING IRAN'S

05:40.333 --> 05:43.667
COOPERATION ON THE MILITAR

05:43.667 --> 05:45.033
DIMENSIONS OR ALLEGED MILITARY

05:45.033 --> 05:45.533
DIMENSIONS

05:45.533 --> 05:50.500
IRAN HAS AGREED TO PROVIDE

05:50.500 --> 05:51.633
INFORMATION THEY NEED TO TAL

05:51.633 --> 05:53.933
ABOUT EXPLODING OR TRILLIO

05:53.933 --> 05:55.533
BRIDGE WIRE EXPERIMENTS AN

05:55.533 --> 05:56.567
DEVELOPMENTS

05:56.567 --> 05:58.333
AGAIN, THAT'S A PART THAT IF

05:58.333 --> 06:01.567
USED IN A CERTAIN WAY IS VER

06:01.567 --> 06:05.133
IMPORTANT IN THE DEVELOPMENT O

06:05.133 --> 06:06.467
A NUCLEAR WEAPON

06:06.467 --> 06:08.267
THEY HAVE INFORMATION THAT

06:08.267 --> 06:10.167
SUGGESTS THE MOST LIKELY PURPOSE

06:10.167 --> 06:11.200
OF THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT WERE

06:11.200 --> 06:13.367
DONE BY IRAN WERE RELATED TO A

06:13.367 --> 06:14.000
NUCLEAR WEAPON

06:14.000 --> 06:16.400
IRAN HAS DENIED THAT AND SAID,

06:16.400 --> 06:18.833
NO, NO, IT'S NONNUCLEA

06:18.833 --> 06:19.100
PURPOSES

06:19.100 --> 06:20.300
THEY HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

06:20.300 --> 06:22.167
THAT HAS CAST DOUBT IN THEIR

06:22.167 --> 06:23.967
MINDS ON IRAN'S STATEMENT SO

06:23.967 --> 06:25.400
IT'S AN OUTSTANDING ISSUE THAT

06:25.400 --> 06:27.967
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

06:27.967 --> 06:32.233
IF IRAN WANTS, IT COULD ACTUALLY

06:32.233 --> 06:33.967
USE THIS OPPORTUNITY IN THE NEXT

06:33.967 --> 06:37.567
COUPLE MONTHS TO CHANGE IT

06:37.567 --> 06:37.833
STORY.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.367
ONE POSSIBILITY COULD ACTUALLY

06:39.367 --> 06:42.600
SAY, YEAH, YEAH, WAS RELATED T

06:42.600 --> 06:44.833
NUCLEAR WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT AN

06:44.833 --> 06:46.467
OPEN THE DOOR TO A MORE FRUITFUL

06:46.467 --> 06:47.667
SET OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT

06:47.667 --> 06:50.233
MILITARY DIMENSIONS OF ITS

06:50.233 --> 06:50.367
PROGRAM.

06:50.367 --> 06:52.667
AT THE SAME TIME IT COULD DECIDE

06:52.667 --> 06:55.267
TO CONTINUE WITH ITS PREVIOU

06:55.267 --> 06:56.833
STORY, THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO

06:56.833 --> 06:58.500
WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND COULD

06:58.500 --> 07:00.000
AGAIN LEAD TO NOTHING.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.467
>> SO IT SEEMS THERE'S TWO

07:01.467 --> 07:02.033
TRACKS HERE.

07:02.033 --> 07:05.400
ONE IS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

07:05.400 --> 07:06.900
IRAN USED TO DO IN TERMS O

07:06.900 --> 07:08.267
TRYING TO DEVELOP A NUCLEA

07:08.267 --> 07:10.733
WEAPON OR WEAPONIZE IT

07:10.733 --> 07:12.100
THEN THERE'S ANOTHER TRACK ABOUT

07:12.100 --> 07:13.833
WHAT THEY COULD DO IN TH

07:13.833 --> 07:14.533
FUTURE

07:14.533 --> 07:17.433
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

07:17.433 --> 07:20.333
THEY ARE LINKED, THOUGH.

07:20.333 --> 07:21.933
IT'S VERY HARD IF YOU'RE A

07:21.933 --> 07:23.400
INSPECTOR OR ANALYST TO SAY WE

07:23.400 --> 07:25.033
CAN GIVE YOU CONFIDENCE THERE'

07:25.033 --> 07:27.467
NOT A NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRA

07:27.467 --> 07:28.267
TODAY, IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT

07:28.267 --> 07:29.433
THE PAST

07:29.433 --> 07:30.533
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS DONE

07:30.533 --> 07:32.233
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY

07:32.233 --> 07:32.533
ACCOMPLISHED

07:32.533 --> 07:34.533
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY DI

07:34.533 --> 07:36.933
IT, WHO DID IT

07:36.933 --> 07:37.900
THEREFORE THAT WHOLE

07:37.900 --> 07:39.400
INFRASTRUCTURE CREATED COULD POP

07:39.400 --> 07:41.267
BACK INTO EXISTENCE IN SECRE

07:41.267 --> 07:42.733
AND MOVE FORWARD ON NUCLEA

07:42.733 --> 07:43.033
WEAPONS.

07:43.033 --> 07:44.967
SO THE HISTORY IS VERY

07:44.967 --> 07:45.300
IMPORTANT.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.567
I THINK THEY HAVE MADE IT CLEA

07:46.567 --> 07:48.700
IN THIS CASE AND OTHERS THAT I

07:48.700 --> 07:50.567
REALLY CAN'T GIVE IRAN A CLEAN

07:50.567 --> 07:52.800
BILL OF HEALTH UNTIL I

07:52.800 --> 07:53.867
UNDERSTANDS THE HISTORY.

07:53.867 --> 07:55.767
>> IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP T

07:55.767 --> 07:57.567
THESE TALKS, IT SEEMS POSITION

07:57.567 --> 07:59.867
HAVE GOTTEN MORE HARDENED IN

07:59.867 --> 08:02.567
TERMS OF THE U.S. WANTS TH

08:02.567 --> 08:04.533
ENTIRE NUCLEAR PROGRAM

08:04.533 --> 08:08.900
DISMANTLED AND IRANIANS WANT ALL

08:08.900 --> 08:09.867
THE SANCTIONS GONE

08:09.867 --> 08:11.767
>> THE U.S. IS WILLING TO GIVE

08:11.767 --> 08:13.633
ON THE SIZE OF THE PROGRAM

08:13.633 --> 08:16.500
IT'S WILLING TO ACCEPT THE SIZ

08:16.500 --> 08:17.667
OF THE PROGRAM THAT ACCEPT

08:17.667 --> 08:18.800
NUCLEAR REACTORS

08:18.800 --> 08:20.267
THAT'S A MAJOR CONCESSION ON THE

08:20.267 --> 08:21.833
PART OF THE UNITED STATES.

08:21.833 --> 08:26.733
CERTAINLY THE IRANIANS WANT AL

08:26.733 --> 08:29.933
SANCTIONS REMOVED.

08:29.933 --> 08:31.467
BUT THE TROUBLE IS THAT'S NO

08:31.467 --> 08:33.133
GOING TO HAPPEN UNLESS THEY MAKE

08:33.133 --> 08:34.833
CONCESSIONS ON THE U.S. SIDE AND

08:34.833 --> 08:36.700
HAVEN'T SHOWN WILLINGNESS TO D

21:12.067 --> 21:13.000
GROW THAT FAST

21:13.000 --> 21:15.567
LETS SAY THE ECONOMY IS GROWIN

21:15.567 --> 21:17.100
2%, WHICH ISN'T ENOUGH TO BRIN

21:17.100 --> 21:18.600
DOWN UNEMPLOYMENT VERY

21:18.600 --> 21:18.833
SUBSTANTIALLY.

21:18.833 --> 21:21.133
IT CAN GROW AT THAT PACE

21:21.133 --> 21:24.367
WE'D LIKE TO SEE GROWTH AT 3

21:24.367 --> 21:27.467
3.5% LIKE WE SAW IN THE '90s

21:27.467 --> 21:31.467

21:46.600 --> 21:48.200
LOOKED AT HOW MUCH O

21:48.200 --> 21:49.467
CONSUMPTION GROWTH CAME FROM

21:49.467 --> 21:51.500
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, BASICALL

21:51.500 --> 21:54.400
THE TOP 20% CONSUMPTIO

21:54.400 --> 21:56.433
INCREASED ABOUT 17% WHEREA

21:56.433 --> 21:58.500
CONSUMPTION HAS ONLY GROWN ABOUT

21:58.500 --> 22:01.067
1% FROM THE BOTTOM 80.

22:01.067 --> 22:06.967
THAT INCREASE IS REALLY DRIVEN
