JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to
the day's other major story.

00:03.466 --> 00:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is in London, where a
fast-moving fire engulfed a
high-rise apartment building.

00:09.666 --> 00:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It killed at least 12
people and injured scores.

00:11.666 --> 00:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a report from Dan
Rivers of Independent Television
News, and with a warning: Some

00:14.733 --> 00:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the images and sounds
may be disturbing.

00:17.766 --> 00:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: With horrifying
ferocity, the fire consumed
Grenfell Tower in minutes, a

00:21.533 --> 00:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
24-floor inferno from which
there was no escape for some.

00:23.533 --> 00:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trapped by smoke and flames,
residents signaled their plight
from on high as the building

00:29.133 --> 00:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disintegrated around them.

00:30.633 --> 00:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On this mobile phone footage,
the cries for help are chilling.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Help!

00:35.200 --> 00:37.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Help!

00:37.333 --> 00:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We saw people looking out
of the windows, screaming help,
screaming, help, help, flashing

00:38.700 --> 00:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their lights and everything.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now all those windows,
people are gone, literally gone.

00:41.433 --> 00:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: I saw one person
trying to jump out.

00:44.133 --> 00:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One actually jumped out,
and obviously what happened.

00:46.700 --> 00:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just a nightmare.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: The streets around
Grenfell Tower were soon full
of those who escaped its flames,

00:51.733 --> 00:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children among those suffering
from the acrid fumes.

00:54.133 --> 00:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An exhausted little girl
is cradled as the shock
and bewilderment sink in.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many here have lost everything.

00:57.733 --> 00:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some are still unsure what's
happened to neighbors,
friends, loved ones.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, above them,
the fire raged on.

01:00.700 --> 01:04.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As the sky lightened,
the flames continued
to devour the building.

01:04.166 --> 01:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was the view from the
SOUTH BANK, the plume of
smoke visible for 20 miles.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
With daylight, stories
of extraordinary escape
started to emerge.

01:12.733 --> 01:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMIRA LAMRANI, Witness: A
lady appeared at the window,
gesturing, body language, from

01:14.433 --> 01:16.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what she was saying, I'm
about to throw my baby,
please catch the baby.

01:16.100 --> 01:19.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the baby, I think,
was wrapped in some sort
of bed sheet, blanket.

01:19.066 --> 01:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she threw the baby.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the baby came down -- and
this was about approximately
from the ninth or 10th floor

01:23.266 --> 01:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - a member of the public,
a gentleman ran forward and
miraculously grabbed the baby.

01:25.366 --> 01:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, like I said, above you,
from the left, from the right,
mostly kids, it was harrowing,

01:26.566 --> 01:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
torturing screams
for help, young kids.

01:28.733 --> 01:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think also, where
the fire was now spread,
people were reaching out
from the front window,

01:33.300 --> 01:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to grasp a bit of
fresh air, trying to breathe
in like they were struggling.

01:38.433 --> 01:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there were, at one point,
one window about four or five
heads all squeezing their heads

01:43.233 --> 01:44.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
through.

01:44.466 --> 01:46.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was honestly
like a horror movie.

01:46.333 --> 01:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS: Some had
knotted sheets together
in an attempt to escape.

01:50.966 --> 01:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But even this left them
several floors short of safety.

01:54.866 --> 01:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: People were
jumping off buildings.

01:56.933 --> 02:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People were screaming, saying,
help me, help me, help me.

02:00.166 --> 02:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS: The cause
of the fire is unknown,
but one resident claims
it spread from her

02:06.466 --> 02:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neighbor's flat, possibly
a faulty appliance.

02:08.566 --> 02:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The fire started from
the kitchen, but I don't know
exactly -- from which problem,

02:13.533 --> 02:15.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it was from the kitchen,
because the flat door was open.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS: It's already
clear the death toll
will be significant.

02:23.633 --> 02:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Up to 600 people lived in
Grenfell House in 120 flats.

02:25.866 --> 02:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For those who were on the
very upper floors, the
odds of survival seem slim.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those fighting the fire
confirmed today how challenging
it's been to extinguish.

02:30.533 --> 02:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: This was an unprecedented
fire in terms of scale,
speed, and spread.

02:32.533 --> 02:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just to reiterate that
point, the incident continues
to be a challenging incident for

02:34.633 --> 02:36.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

02:36.633 --> 02:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: There is speculation
a gap behind a recently added
external cladding may have

02:38.100 --> 02:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
created a chimney effect,
allowing the flames to spread.

02:39.533 --> 02:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some had to wait all
night before they escaped.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This man was still
calling for help six hours
after the fire started.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At times, he disappeared
into clouds of smoke,
but, incredibly, he did
finally make it out,

02:44.866 --> 02:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of 65 rescued from
Grenfell Tower today.

02:46.900 --> 02:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, while most of the
flames have been put out, the
charred shell of the tower block

02:47.733 --> 02:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
continues to smolder.

02:49.800 --> 02:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It may be days before the
final death toll is known, and
much longer before the cause

02:50.766 --> 02:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this tragedy is pinpointed.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Prime Minister
Theresa May promised a full
investigation, and the British

02:55.033 --> 02:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government ordered safety
checks at other high-rises
undergoing renovations.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
Leaders of the Senate
Intelligence Committee
held their first meeting

02:59.300 --> 03:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Robert Mueller, the special
counsel investigating Russian
meddling in the 2016 election.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That followed 24 hours
of speculation about
Mueller's future.

03:03.033 --> 03:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Last night, White
House spokeswoman Sarah
Huckabee Sanders told
reporters: "While the

03:05.100 --> 03:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president has the right
to fire Mueller, he has
no intention of doing so."

03:07.033 --> 03:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The New York Times reported that
Mr. Trump began contemplating
his dismissal shortly

03:07.833 --> 03:09.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after he was appointed.

03:09.900 --> 03:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly
approved new sanctions on
Russia today over its election

03:10.433 --> 03:12.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hacking.

03:12.466 --> 03:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The penalties target those
involving human rights
abuses and cyber-crime.

03:14.566 --> 03:16.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The bill also blocks the
president from removing
sanctions without
congressional approval.

03:16.666 --> 03:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ahead of the vote, Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson warned
a House panel against limiting

03:17.466 --> 03:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the president's options.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary
of State: I would urge Congress
to ensure any legislation

03:21.500 --> 03:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allows the president to have the
flexibility to adjust sanctions
to meet the needs of what

03:22.766 --> 03:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is always an evolving
diplomatic situation.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Essentially, we would ask for
the flexibility to turn the heat
up when we need to, but also

03:26.500 --> 03:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to ensure that we have
the ability to maintain
a constructive dialogue.

03:28.466 --> 03:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The amendment
is part of a broader bill
dealing with sanctions on Iran.

03:30.066 --> 03:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If it clears the Senate,
the measure still
needs House approval.

03:32.100 --> 03:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump has now handed
off authority over troop levels
in Afghanistan to Secretary

03:32.900 --> 03:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Defense James Mattis.

03:35.433 --> 03:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mattis confirmed it today,
but said it doesn't mean
an immediate increase
in U.S. deployments.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the U.N.
secretary-general, Antonio
Guterres, visited Kabul today.

03:39.366 --> 03:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said there was -- quote
-- "no military solution" for
that country's long-running

03:39.900 --> 03:42.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

03:42.466 --> 03:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a
gunman in San Francisco
shot three people to
death at a UPS warehouse,

03:43.700 --> 03:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before turning the
gun on himself.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Police say the man was
a UPS employee armed
with an assault pistol.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heavily armed officers searched
the sprawling complex after
the shooting started, as dozens

03:48.666 --> 03:50.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of employees poured
out of the building.

03:50.666 --> 03:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five people were charged
with involuntary manslaughter
today in connection with the

03:52.166 --> 03:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lead-contaminated water
crisis in Flint, Michigan.

03:54.700 --> 03:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The case involves the
death of an elderly
man from Legionnaires'
disease allegedly brought

03:55.533 --> 03:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on by the tainted water.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those charged today include Nick
Lyon, a Michigan state health
and human services director.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He could get up to 15 years
in prison if he's convicted.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Federal Reserve Board has
raised a key short-term interest
rate again, meaning that

04:02.733 --> 04:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rates for credit cards and
similar debt are going up.

04:04.233 --> 04:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The quarter-point hike is
the third in six months.

04:06.266 --> 04:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Washington today, Fed
Chair Janet Yellen suggested
it's a vote of confidence.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: The economy is doing
well, is showing resilience.

04:10.766 --> 04:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a very strong labor
market, an unemployment
rate that's declined
to levels we have not

04:11.433 --> 04:13.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
seen since 2001.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Fed
also announced plans to
gradually start scaling
back its bond holdings.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That could cause long-term
interest rates to rise.

04:17.033 --> 04:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly 200 Democratic lawmakers
are suing President Trump
over foreign money ties to

04:17.833 --> 04:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his business empire.

04:19.933 --> 04:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say that he never divested
from his far-flung interests, so
he is violating, they say, the

04:21.133 --> 04:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Constitution's
Emoluments Clause.

04:22.533 --> 04:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It restricts gifts and
benefits from foreign leaders.

04:24.566 --> 04:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attorneys general from
Maryland and the District of
Columbia filed a similar suit

04:25.233 --> 04:27.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this week.

04:27.266 --> 04:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street today, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained
46 points to close at 21374.

04:28.766 --> 04:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 25 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 slipped two.

04:30.666 --> 04:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a French pilot successfully
crossed the English Channel
in a flying car today.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The machine was part dune
buggy and part paraglider.

04:34.266 --> 04:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took off from an abandoned
runway near Calais, France,
and took just under an hour

04:35.066 --> 04:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make the crossing.

04:37.066 --> 04:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The pilot and car landed
safely near Dover, a
