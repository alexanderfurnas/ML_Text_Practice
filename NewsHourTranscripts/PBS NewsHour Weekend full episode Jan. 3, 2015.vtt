00:42.876 --> 00:44.144

00:44.144 --> 00:45.178
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:45.178 --> 00:46.947
WE BEGIN TONIGHT IN INDONESIA,

00:46.947 --> 00:48.148
WHERE SEARCH TEAMS HAVE FOUND

00:48.148 --> 00:50.317
FOUR LARGE OBJECTS ON THE SEA

00:50.317 --> 00:51.318
FLOOR.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.619
THE OBJECTS ARE BELIEVED TO BE

00:52.619 --> 00:54.655
PARTS OF AIR ASIA FLIGHT 8501,

00:54.655 --> 00:56.023

THE AIRBUS A320, TRAVELING FROM

01:00.260 --> 01:01.662
SURABAYA, INDONESIA, TO

01:01.662 --> 01:03.130
SINGAPORE DISAPPEARED LESS THAN

01:03.130 --> 01:04.798
HALF WAY INTO WHAT WAS SUPPOSED

01:04.798 --> 01:06.333
TO HAVE BEEN JUST UNDER A

01:06.333 --> 01:07.701
TWO-HOUR FLIGHT.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.569
SO FAR, AT LEAST 30 BODIES HAVE

01:09.569 --> 01:10.637
BEEN RECOVERED.

01:10.637 --> 01:12.139
DIFFICULT WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE

01:12.139 --> 01:13.640
SLOWING THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCH

01:13.640 --> 01:14.741
EFFORT.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.376
WAVES AS HIGH AS 16 FEET HAVE

01:16.376 --> 01:18.078
BEEN REPORTED IN THE AREA.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.346

01:20.781 --> 01:21.715
TOMORROW.

01:21.715 --> 01:22.950
THE CURRENTS IN THE SEA ARE VERY

01:22.950 --> 01:23.984
STRONG.

01:23.984 --> 01:24.985
>> Sreenivasan: TODAY'S

01:24.985 --> 01:26.386
DISCOVERY OF THE WRECKAGE CAME

01:26.386 --> 01:27.621
AS INDONESIAN TRANSPORT

01:27.621 --> 01:29.389
OFFICIALS SAID AIRASIA DID NOT

01:29.389 --> 01:31.191
HAVE PERMISSION TO FLY THE

01:31.191 --> 01:33.160
PLANNED ROUTE ON SUNDAYS.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.429
A CARGO SHIP WITH 360 SYRIAN

01:35.429 --> 01:36.997
MIGRANTS ON BOARD DOCKED IN

01:36.997 --> 01:38.765
ITALY TODAY, DAYS AFTER BEING

01:38.765 --> 01:40.667
ABANDONED BY ITS CREW.

01:40.667 --> 01:41.835
AUTHORITIES DESCRIBED THE

01:41.835 --> 01:43.804
RESCUED PASSENGERS AS BEING IN

01:43.804 --> 01:45.372
RELATIVELY GOOD CONDITION AFTER

01:45.372 --> 01:47.240
A THREE-DAY ORDEAL AT SEA.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.976
MIGRANTS OFTEN PAY HUNDREDS OR

01:48.976 --> 01:50.644
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO TRY TO

01:50.644 --> 01:52.946
ESCAPE THE VIOLENCE IN SYRIA.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.247
THE UNITED NATIONS ESTIMATES

01:54.247 --> 01:56.850
THAT 160,000 MIGRANTS ARRIVED IN

01:56.850 --> 01:58.785
ITALY BY SEA DURING THE FIRST 11

01:58.785 --> 02:01.054
MONTHS OF 2014.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.222
A SENIOR STATE DEPARTMENT

02:02.222 --> 02:03.824
OFFICIAL SUGGESTS THE U.S. MIGHT

02:03.824 --> 02:05.592
TRIM AID TO THE PALESTINIAN

02:05.592 --> 02:07.427
AUTHORITY LED BY MAHMOUD ABBAS

02:07.427 --> 02:09.429
IF IT CONTINUES EFFORTS TO JOIN

02:09.429 --> 02:10.697
THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL

02:10.697 --> 02:11.498
COURT.

02:11.498 --> 02:12.899
THAT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR

02:12.899 --> 02:14.634
THE PALESTINIANS TO PURSUE WAR

02:14.634 --> 02:16.403
CRIMES AGAINST ISRAEL.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.771
IN A SEPARATE INCIDENT

02:17.771 --> 02:18.972
YESTERDAY, A GROUP OF ISRAELI

02:20.273 --> 02:21.675
CONSULATE VEHICLES IN THE WEST

02:21.675 --> 02:22.876
BANK.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.311
THE AMERICANS WERE THERE TO

02:24.311 --> 02:25.579
INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS THAT

02:25.579 --> 02:26.847
OLIVE TREES BELONGING TO

02:26.847 --> 02:28.648
PALESTINIANS HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY

02:28.648 --> 02:29.816
JEWISH SETTLERS.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.284
NO ONE WAS INJURED.

02:31.284 --> 02:33.120
IN LIBYA, FOR THE SECOND TIME IN

02:33.120 --> 02:34.654
A WEEK, THERE'S BEEN AN ATTACK

02:34.654 --> 02:35.822
ON CHRISTIANS.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.025
15 ARMED MASKED MEN REPORTEDLY

02:38.025 --> 02:39.059
WENT ROOM TO ROOM IN A

02:39.059 --> 02:40.861
RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX, ASKING FOR

02:40.861 --> 02:42.195
IDENTIFICATION PAPERS.

02:42.195 --> 02:44.064
THEY REPORTEDLY LEFT MUSLIMS

02:44.064 --> 02:45.799
ALONE BUT HANDCUFFED AND THEN

02:45.799 --> 02:48.335
KIDNAPPED 13 EGYPTIAN COPTIC

02:48.335 --> 02:49.169
CHRISTIANS.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.570
A FEW DAYS AGO, SEVEN OTHER

02:50.570 --> 02:52.105
COPTIC CHRISTIANS WERE ABDUCTED

02:52.105 --> 02:54.307
BY ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS THERE.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.009
A SUSPECTED AL QAEDA LEADER SAID

02:56.009 --> 02:57.811
TO HAVE HELPED PLAN THE 1998

02:57.811 --> 02:59.312
BOMBINGS OF U.S. EMBASSIES IN

03:03.283 --> 03:04.851
THE CAUSE WAS LISTED AS

03:04.851 --> 03:06.453
COMPLICATIONS FROM LIVER

03:06.453 --> 03:07.287
SURGERY.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.789
THE MAN KNOWN AS ABU ANAS AL-

03:08.789 --> 03:10.023
LIBI HAD BEEN CAPTURED BY

03:10.023 --> 03:11.191
AMERICAN COMMANDOS IN OCTOBER

03:11.191 --> 03:13.393
2013 IN LIBYA.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.028
HE WAS TO HAVE STOOD TRIAL FOR

03:15.028 --> 03:16.563
THE EMBASSY BOMBINGS LATER THIS

03:16.563 --> 03:17.130
MONTH.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.666
224 PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THOSE

03:19.666 --> 03:20.801
BOMBINGS.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.169
A U.S. APPEALS COURT TODAY

03:22.169 --> 03:23.804
DENIED A DEFENSE REQUEST TO

03:23.804 --> 03:25.238
DELAY THE TRIAL OF ACCUSED

03:25.238 --> 03:27.074

03:27.908 --> 03:29.276
JURY SELECTION IS SET TO BEGIN

03:29.276 --> 03:30.077
MONDAY.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.779
HE IS ACCUSED OF THE APRIL 2013

03:32.779 --> 03:34.181
BOMBINGS THAT KILLED THREE

03:34.181 --> 03:36.616
PEOPLE AND INJURED SOME 260

03:36.616 --> 03:38.051
OTHERS, A NUMBER OF THEM

03:38.051 --> 03:39.886
SEVERELY.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.588
AN EARTHQUAKE MEASURING 4.9 ON

03:41.588 --> 03:42.589
THE RICHTER SCALE STRUCK A

03:42.589 --> 03:44.391
REMOTE AREA OF IDAHO TODAY,

03:44.391 --> 03:45.792
TRIGGERING ROCK SLIDES THAT

03:45.792 --> 03:47.394
BLOCKED ROADWAYS BUT CAUSING NO

03:47.394 --> 03:48.228
INJURIES.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.062
AUTHORITIES SAY THERE WERE

03:49.062 --> 03:50.597
SEVERAL SMALLER QUAKES IN THE

03:50.597 --> 03:51.965
AREA RECENTLY.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.366
IN CALIFORNIA, A NEW LAW HAS

03:53.366 --> 03:54.534
GONE INTO EFFECT MAKING IT

03:54.534 --> 03:56.002
POSSIBLE FOR UNDOCUMENTED

03:56.002 --> 03:57.771
IMMIGRANTS TO GET DRIVER'S

03:57.771 --> 03:59.439
LICENSES, AND, YESTERDAY,

03:59.439 --> 04:01.274
THOUSANDS WENT TO THE DEPARTMENT

04:01.274 --> 04:02.776
OF MOTOR VEHICLE OFFICES TO

04:02.776 --> 04:03.910
APPLY.

04:03.910 --> 04:04.911
THE NEW LAW, WHICH HAD BEEN

04:04.911 --> 04:06.146
SUPPORTED BY THE STATE'S POLICE

04:06.146 --> 04:07.147
CHIEFS AND INSURANCE

04:07.147 --> 04:08.682
COMMISSIONER, REQUIRES PROOF

04:08.682 --> 04:09.850
THAT APPLICANTS LIVE IN

04:09.850 --> 04:11.852
CALIFORNIA BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE

04:11.852 --> 04:13.587
PROOF OF LEGAL RESIDENCY.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.921
THERE ARE 2.4 MILLION

04:14.921 --> 04:16.723
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS THOUGHT

04:16.723 --> 04:17.991
TO BE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.392
IT BECOMES THE TENTH STATE IN

04:19.392 --> 04:21.194
THE NATION TO OFFER UNDOCUMENTED

04:21.194 --> 04:22.762
IMMIGRANTS LICENSES.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.997
AND THE F.B.I. REPORTS THAT THE

04:23.997 --> 04:25.499
NUMBER OF VIOLENT CRIMES

04:25.499 --> 04:26.533
COMMITTED IN THE UNITED STATES

04:26.533 --> 04:30.403
DROPPED BY 4.4% IN 2013 COMPARED

04:30.403 --> 04:31.671
TO THE YEAR BEFORE.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.306
SUCH CRIMES INCLUDE MURDER,

04:33.306 --> 04:34.908
RAPE, AGGRAVATED ASSAULT AND

04:34.908 --> 04:35.509
ROBBERY.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.910
LOUISIANA HAS THE NATION'S

04:36.910 --> 04:38.745
HIGHEST MURDER RATE, BUT ALASKA,

04:38.745 --> 04:40.680
NEW MEXICO AND NEVADA HAVE THE

04:40.680 --> 04:42.382
HIGHEST PER CAPITA RATE OF

04:42.382 --> 04:44.117
OVERALL VIOLENT CRIME.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.352
ACCORDING TO THIS REPORT,

04:45.352 --> 04:46.553
VERMONT AND MAINE ARE THE

04:46.553 --> 04:48.755
NATION'S TWO SAFEST STATES.

04:57.731 --> 04:58.765
>> Sreenivasan: CONGRESS RETURNS

04:58.765 --> 05:00.167
TO WORK TUESDAY, AND REPUBLICANS

05:00.167 --> 05:01.401
WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITIES

05:01.401 --> 05:02.302
IN BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE

05:02.302 --> 05:03.003
SENATE.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.271
REPUBLICAN LEADERS HAVE PROMISED

05:04.271 --> 05:05.939
THEY WILL INITIATE LEGISLATION,

05:05.939 --> 05:07.174
AND ONE OF THEIR FIRST EFFORTS

05:07.174 --> 05:09.042
MAY BE TO ROLL BACK PARTS OF NO

05:09.042 --> 05:11.011
CHILD LEFT BEHIND, THE EDUCATION

05:11.011 --> 05:12.245
LAW PASSED UNDER PRESIDENT

05:12.245 --> 05:13.413
GEORGE W. BUSH.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.614
STEPHANIE SIMON IS THE SENIOR

05:14.614 --> 05:15.916
EDUCATION REPORTER FOR POLITICO

05:15.916 --> 05:17.284
AND JOINS US NOW FROM BOSTON.

05:17.284 --> 05:18.985
SO, THIS WAS APPROVED IN A

05:18.985 --> 05:19.986
BIPARTISAN MANNER.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.389
WHAT'S WRONG NOW, TEN, 12 YEARS

05:22.389 --> 05:23.356
LATER?

05:23.356 --> 05:24.891
>> IT WAS A VERY BIPARTISAN BILL

05:24.891 --> 05:26.259
AS YOU SAID, HAD HUGE SUPPORT.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.627
TO GIVE YOU SOME IDEA, TED

05:27.627 --> 05:29.062
KENNEDY AND JOHN BOEHNER WERE

05:29.062 --> 05:30.997
COAUTHORS OF IT, SO THAT GIVES

05:30.997 --> 05:32.899
YOU A HINT OF HOW WIDELY IT WAS

05:32.899 --> 05:35.035
APPROVED.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.069
AND NOW, 12 YEARS LATER, PEOPLE

05:36.069 --> 05:37.137
ARE LOOKING BACK AND THINKING

05:37.137 --> 05:38.505
THAT THERE ARE HUGE PROBLEMS

05:38.505 --> 05:39.306
WITH THIS BILL.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.841
IT MANDATED ANNUAL TESTING IN

05:41.841 --> 05:43.276
READING AND MATH FOR STUDENTS IN

05:43.276 --> 05:44.778
GRADES 3-8, AND AGAIN IN HIGH

05:44.778 --> 05:46.179
SCHOOL, AND THERE'S A HUGE

05:46.179 --> 05:47.781
BACKLASH NOW AGAINST SO MUCH

05:47.781 --> 05:48.949
STANDARDIZED TESTING.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.685
AND IT ALSO SET OUT STRICT

05:51.685 --> 05:52.752
SANCTIONS FOR SCHOOLS THAT DID

05:52.752 --> 05:54.588
NOT CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THEIR

05:54.588 --> 05:55.855
STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE ON THOSE

05:55.855 --> 05:56.556
TESTS.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.058
AND THAT ALSO HAS CREATED A

05:58.058 --> 05:59.326
HUGE BACKLASH AND KIND OF AN

05:59.326 --> 06:01.027
IDEA THERE'S TOO MUCH FEDERAL

06:01.027 --> 06:03.463
INTERFERENCE IN LOCAL SCHOOLS.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.531
>> Sreenivasan: AND ONE OF THE

06:04.531 --> 06:05.665
CRITIQUES IN THE IN-BETWEEN

06:05.665 --> 06:06.866
PERIODS WERE THAT SCHOOLS

06:06.866 --> 06:08.034
WERE TRYING TO TEACH TO THE

06:08.034 --> 06:09.803
TEST JUST TO GET THOSE NUMBERS

06:09.803 --> 06:10.604
UP, RIGHT?

06:10.604 --> 06:11.671
>> EXACTLY, RIGHT.

06:11.671 --> 06:12.472
THERE WERE SORT OF TWO

06:12.472 --> 06:13.340
STRATEGIES.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.674
A NUMBER OF STATES ACTUALLY

06:14.674 --> 06:16.943
REDUCED THE RIGOR OF THEIR TEST,

06:16.943 --> 06:18.411
SORT OF A RACE TO THE BOTTOM TO

06:18.411 --> 06:19.980
TRY TO MAKE THE TEST EASIER SO

06:19.980 --> 06:21.314
MORE KIDS WOULD PASS THEM AND

06:21.314 --> 06:22.849
YOU WOULD LOOK BETTER AS A STATE

06:22.849 --> 06:25.318
OR A SCHOOL; AND THE OTHER

06:25.318 --> 06:27.387
STRATEGY WAS TO TEACH TO THE

06:27.387 --> 06:28.421
TEST, AND THAT CREATED A

06:28.421 --> 06:29.589
NARROWING OF THE CURRICULUM

06:29.589 --> 06:30.924
WHERE THERE WAS SO MUCH FOCUS ON

06:30.924 --> 06:32.325
GETTING THOSE MATH AND READING

06:32.325 --> 06:34.661
SCORES UP THAT SUBJECTS LIKE

06:34.661 --> 06:36.263
CIVICS AND SOCIAL STUDIES AND

06:36.263 --> 06:38.798
SCIENCE AND ELECTIVES LIKE ART

06:38.798 --> 06:39.966
AND P.E., KIND OF FELL BY THE

06:39.966 --> 06:41.368
WAYSIDE.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.869
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE SOME

06:42.869 --> 06:44.037
OF THE POSSIBLE LEGISLATIVE

06:44.037 --> 06:45.005
SOLUTIONS TO TRY TO ROLL BACK

06:45.005 --> 06:46.906
ELEMENTS OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND

06:46.906 --> 06:48.508
OR START FROM SCRATCH?

06:48.508 --> 06:51.011
>> WELL, THIS IS A GARGANTUAN

06:51.011 --> 06:51.811
BILL.

06:51.811 --> 06:52.746
IT'S ABOUT 600 PAGES.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.180
IT COVERS ABOUT $25 BILLION

06:54.180 --> 06:56.182
IN ANNUAL FEDERAL FUNDING.

06:56.182 --> 06:57.183
SO, IT'S NOT A SMALL TASK TO

06:57.183 --> 06:58.218
REWRITE IT.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.419
AND REALLY, THE KEY QUESTION

06:59.419 --> 07:00.720
WILL BE HOW FAR THE

07:00.720 --> 07:02.389
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PULL BACK

07:02.389 --> 07:03.690
FROM FEDERAL INVOLVEMENT IN

07:03.690 --> 07:05.592
EDUCATION POLICY.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.626
AND, YOU KNOW, THE ANSWER MIGHT

07:06.626 --> 07:08.094
SEEM "WAY BACK," YOU KNOW.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.229
IT MIGHT SEEM OBVIOUS THAT THEY

07:09.229 --> 07:10.730
WANT TO GO AS FAR-- PULL THE

07:10.730 --> 07:11.798
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS FAR AWAY

07:11.798 --> 07:13.233
AS POSSIBLE.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.467
BUT THERE'S A STRONG APPEAL TO

07:14.467 --> 07:15.902
MANY REPUBLICANS, TO THE CHAMBER

07:15.902 --> 07:17.203
OF COMMERCE, AND TO MANY

07:17.203 --> 07:19.272
DEMOCRATS AS WELL TO CONTINUING

07:19.272 --> 07:20.907
TO HAVE SOME FEDERAL ROLE SO

07:20.907 --> 07:23.310
THAT STATES ARE HELD TO ACCOUNT

07:23.310 --> 07:24.511
AND SCHOOLS ARE HELD TO ACCOUNT

07:24.511 --> 07:26.880
FOR ACTUALLY TEACHING KIDS AND

07:26.880 --> 07:27.580
MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE

07:27.580 --> 07:28.248
LEARNING.

07:28.248 --> 07:28.882
>> Sreenivasan: THE ANNUAL

07:28.882 --> 07:30.183
TESTING THAT'S BECOME SO

07:30.183 --> 07:31.151
CONTENTIOUS, IT SEEMS THAT WAS

07:31.151 --> 07:33.286
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT THE

07:33.286 --> 07:35.188
ADMINISTRATION OR ANY MEMBER OF

07:35.188 --> 07:36.423
CONGRESS COULD MEASURE THE

07:36.423 --> 07:38.224
DISPARITIES IN OUTCOMES THAT ARE

07:38.224 --> 07:39.159
HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE UNITED

07:39.159 --> 07:39.959
STATES.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.461
>> RIGHT, AND THAT REMAINS

07:41.461 --> 07:43.763
PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR PART

07:43.763 --> 07:45.432
OF THE BILL WAS THAT NOT THAT

07:45.432 --> 07:46.466
THE TESTING PART ISN'T POPULAR,

07:46.466 --> 07:49.002
BUT THE REQUIREMENT THAT STATES

07:49.002 --> 07:51.071
AND SCHOOLS REPORT THE RESULTS

07:51.071 --> 07:52.972
BY SUBGROUPS SO THAT YOU COULD

07:52.972 --> 07:54.708
SEE EXACTLY HOW WELL OR HOW

07:54.708 --> 07:56.109
POORLY CHILDREN WITH

07:56.109 --> 07:57.444
DISABILITIES, CHILDREN WHO ARE

07:57.444 --> 07:59.112
STILL LEARNING ENGLISH, CHILDREN

07:59.112 --> 08:01.314
OF LOW-INCOME FAMILIES ARE DOING

08:01.314 --> 08:02.449
ON THOSE TESTS.

08:02.449 --> 08:03.950
AND HAVING THAT REQUIREMENT IN

08:03.950 --> 08:05.151
PLACE WAS REALLY THE FIRST TIME

08:05.151 --> 08:07.053
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE AS A

08:07.053 --> 08:08.855
NATION HOW POORLY SOME OF THOSE

08:08.855 --> 08:11.157
SUBGROUPS WERE DOING BECAUSE IF

08:11.157 --> 08:12.592
YOU REPORT IN THE AGGREGATE, YOU

08:12.592 --> 08:13.626
KNOW, IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE YOU

08:13.626 --> 08:15.095
HAVE AN 80% PASS RATE AND THAT

08:15.095 --> 08:16.296
MIGHT SEEM GREAT, BUT THAT MIGHT

08:16.296 --> 08:18.465
BE BECAUSE 99% OF THE KIDS OF

08:18.465 --> 08:19.666
HIGH-INCOME FAMILIES ARE DOING

08:19.666 --> 08:21.368
GREAT AND ONLY 30% OF THE KIDS

08:21.368 --> 08:23.837
OF LOW-INCOME FAMILIES ARE DOING

08:23.837 --> 08:24.904
OKAY AND THAT'S CLEARLY A

08:24.904 --> 08:26.206
DISPARITY THAT HAS TO BE

08:26.206 --> 08:26.873
ADDRESSED.

08:26.873 --> 08:27.807
>> Sreenivasan: HEADING INTO

08:27.807 --> 08:29.142
THIS CONGRESS IS ALSO MAKING FOR

08:29.142 --> 08:30.343
SOME VERY STRANGE ALLIANCES.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.845
THE TEACHERS UNIONS ARE COMING

08:31.845 --> 08:32.979
OUT REALLY AGAINST THE

08:32.979 --> 08:34.414
ADMINISTRATION, WHICH IS NOT

08:34.414 --> 08:35.949
USUALLY A POSITION THAT YOU SEE.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.050
>> EXACTLY.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.017
THERE'S A LOT OF TENSION AND

08:38.017 --> 08:39.052
A LOT OF STRANGE BEDFELLOWS.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.553
THE NATIONAL EDUCATION

08:40.553 --> 08:41.688
ASSOCIATION, THE BIGGEST

08:41.688 --> 08:43.790
TEACHERS UNION, HAS BEEN ON A

08:43.790 --> 08:45.458
CAMPAIGN FOR OVER A YEAR NOW

08:45.458 --> 08:46.860
AGAINST WHAT THEY CALL TOXIC

08:46.860 --> 08:48.828
TESTING, TOO MUCH TESTING.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.163
AND THEY MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES

08:50.163 --> 08:51.264
ALIGNED WITH REPUBLICANS WHO

08:51.264 --> 08:52.599
WANT TO ROLL BACK THE TESTING,

08:52.599 --> 08:54.634
WHERE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

08:54.634 --> 08:55.769
VOWED NOT TO DO THAT.

08:55.769 --> 08:58.104
SO THAT'S ONE STRANGE ALLIANCE.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.973
THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO

08:59.973 --> 09:01.307
ALIGNED WITH REPUBLICANS ON

09:01.307 --> 09:02.809
WANTING MORE OF A ROLL FOR

09:02.809 --> 09:03.977
CHARTER SCHOOLS, AND THAT'S

09:03.977 --> 09:05.011
SOMETHING THAT THE TEACHERS

09:05.011 --> 09:06.279
UNION OPPOSES.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.147
SO THERE'S KIND OF SHIFTING

09:07.147 --> 09:08.047
ALLIANCES, AND IT WILL BE

09:08.047 --> 09:09.082
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT ALL

09:09.082 --> 09:09.949
SHAKES OUT.

09:09.949 --> 09:10.617
>> Sreenivasan: STEPHANIE

09:10.617 --> 09:12.185
SIMON, SENIOR EDUCATION REPORTER

09:12.185 --> 09:13.653
FOR POLITICO, THANKS SO MUCH.

09:13.653 --> 09:15.088
>> THANK YOU.

09:24.063 --> 09:24.998
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO OUR

09:24.998 --> 09:25.899
SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.267
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SIGN OF

09:27.267 --> 09:29.002
THE TIMES, CONSIDER THIS: A

09:29.002 --> 09:30.537
FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR,

09:30.537 --> 09:31.938
84-YEAR-OLD MIKE GRAVEL OF

09:31.938 --> 09:33.673
ALASKA, HAS A NEW JOB RUNNING A

09:33.673 --> 09:35.275
COMPANY THAT MANUFACTURES

09:35.275 --> 09:36.943
MARIJUANA PRODUCTS.

09:36.943 --> 09:38.344
THE MOVEMENT TO LEGALIZE

09:38.344 --> 09:39.946
MARIJUANA IS SPREADING RAPIDLY--

09:39.946 --> 09:41.014
NOWHERE MORE SO THAN IN

09:41.014 --> 09:42.949
COLORADO, WHERE THE LEGAL SALE

09:42.949 --> 09:44.350
OF MARIJUANA FOR RECREATIONAL

09:44.350 --> 09:45.985
USE IS BEGINNING ITS SECOND

09:45.985 --> 09:46.853
YEAR.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.188
IT'S CREATED THOUSANDS OF JOBS

09:48.188 --> 09:49.722
AND GENERATED MILLIONS IN TAX

09:49.722 --> 09:50.657
REVENUES.

09:50.657 --> 09:52.292
BUT SOME COLORADANS WORRY THAT

09:52.292 --> 09:54.027
THE LEGALIZATION OF THE DRUG HAS

09:54.027 --> 09:55.895
NOT ELIMINATED THE UNDERGROUND

09:55.895 --> 09:57.730
MARKET FOR IT, ESPECIALLY IN

09:57.730 --> 09:59.132
MINORITY COMMUNITIES.

NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

10:00.300 --> 10:01.568
RICK KARR UPDATES HIS REPORT

10:01.568 --> 10:03.703
THAT FIRST AIRED IN SEPTEMBER.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.073
>> Reporter: MARIJUANA GROWER

10:07.073 --> 10:08.541
AND RETAILER ANDY WILLIAMS CAN

10:08.541 --> 10:10.176
BARELY KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND

10:10.176 --> 10:12.178
FOR HIS PRODUCT THESE DAYS.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.247
HE SAYS HE CAN'T IMAGINE A MORE

10:14.247 --> 10:15.982
EXCITING AND LUCRATIVE INDUSTRY

10:15.982 --> 10:17.417
TO BE IN RIGHT NOW.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.918
BUT THE BUZZ IS ALL COMING FROM

10:18.918 --> 10:19.986
CAPITALISM.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.788
HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE CANNABIS.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.423
>> I TRIED EVERY FEW YEARS JUST

10:23.423 --> 10:24.624
TO PROVE TO MYSELF I STILL DON'T

10:24.624 --> 10:27.293
LIKE IT.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.162
YOU KNOW, IT JUST AFFECTS ME

10:29.162 --> 10:30.263
VERY POORLY.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.431
>> Reporter: WHEN HE STARTED HIS

10:31.431 --> 10:32.632
BUSINESS A FEW YEARS AGO,

10:32.632 --> 10:34.167
WILLIAMS COULD ONLY SELL MEDICAL

10:34.167 --> 10:35.201
MARIJUANA.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.469
THAT PUT HIM IN POSITION TO BE

10:36.469 --> 10:37.837
ONE OF THE FIRST TO SELL

10:37.837 --> 10:39.506
RECREATIONAL CANNABIS WHEN IT

10:39.506 --> 10:41.574
BECAME LEGAL LAST YEAR.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.543
BUSINESS HAS BEEN SO GOOD THAT

10:43.543 --> 10:46.112
WILLIAMS NOW EMPLOYS 75 PEOPLE

10:46.112 --> 10:48.114
AND EXPECTS TO HIRE MORE.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.716
AND THIS PAST AUGUST HE OPENED A

10:49.716 --> 10:51.584
NEW STATE-OF-THE ART FACILITY

10:51.584 --> 10:53.887
THAT WILL PRODUCE 7,000 POUNDS

10:53.887 --> 10:55.622
OF CANNABIS A YEAR.

10:55.622 --> 10:56.823
>> IT'S MANUFACTURING IS WHAT IT

10:56.823 --> 10:59.359
IS, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.628
YOU ARE MANUFACTURING MARIJUANA.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.229
THIS IS AN INDUSTRIAL

11:03.229 --> 11:06.165
MANUFACTURING PLANT THAT GROWS

11:06.165 --> 11:07.100
MARIJUANA.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.234
>> Reporter: STORES LIKE THESE

11:08.234 --> 11:09.869
CAN NOW SELL UP TO AN OUNCE OF

11:09.869 --> 11:11.437
MARIJUANA TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE

11:11.437 --> 11:12.805
21 AND OVER.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.574

11:34.027 --> 11:35.528
OF DOLLARS A MONTH ON THOSE

11:35.528 --> 11:37.297
PRODUCTS, BUT WILLIAMS IS SURE

11:37.297 --> 11:38.898
THERE'S A LOT MORE MONEY TO BE

11:38.898 --> 11:40.433
MADE IN HIS BUSINESS.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.669
>> YOU KNOW, I DID THIS SO THAT

MY FAMILY CAN BE SET UP FOR

11:44.404 --> 11:45.471
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.473
RIGHT NOW, I ALREADY KNOW OF

11:47.473 --> 11:49.709
SOME BLUE CHIP COMPANIES THAT

11:49.709 --> 11:51.177
ARE ON THE... ON THE START LINE.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.211
THEY'RE GOING TO COME AND BUY

11:52.211 --> 11:54.380
PEOPLE UP, AND QUITE HONESTLY, I

11:54.380 --> 11:55.615
WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE GUYS.

11:55.615 --> 11:56.449
>> Reporter: ONE OF THE BENEFITS

11:56.449 --> 11:57.850
ATTACHED TO LEGALIZATION WAS

11:57.850 --> 11:59.085
THAT IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE

11:59.085 --> 12:00.386
BLACK MARKET.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.754
BUT THAT MARKET IS STILL

12:01.754 --> 12:03.456
THRIVING, ACCORDING TO A 39-

12:03.456 --> 12:05.258
YEAR-OLD MARIJUANA GROWER WHO

12:05.258 --> 12:06.993
ASKED US TO CALL HIM JOHN DOE

12:06.993 --> 12:08.428
AND CONCEAL HIS IDENTITY

12:08.428 --> 12:09.662
BECAUSE HE SELLS ON THE

12:09.662 --> 12:11.397
UNDERGROUND MARKET.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.665
THE ILLEGAL TRADE IS DOING

12:12.665 --> 12:14.300
ESPECIALLY WELL IN BLACK AND

12:14.300 --> 12:16.269
LATINO COMMUNITIES, AND HE SAYS

12:16.269 --> 12:18.071
IT WORKS THE SAME WAY IT DID

12:18.071 --> 12:19.872
WHEN POT WAS ILLEGAL.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.274
>> YOU HAVE THAT ONE GUY, THAT

12:21.274 --> 12:22.976
GUY THAT SHINES, THAT'S THE

12:22.976 --> 12:24.544
ROBIN HOOD OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:24.544 --> 12:25.645
THIS MAN SUPPLIES A LITTLE

12:25.645 --> 12:27.113
GHETTO AREA.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.081
SIMPLE AS THAT.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.282
BREAKS HIS OWN POUND INTO LITTLE

12:29.282 --> 12:31.517
OUNCES AND HELPS EVERYBODY IN

12:31.517 --> 12:32.552
HIS COMMUNITY.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.820
SO THEY CAN AFFORD IT WITH HIM.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.254
THAT'S HOW IT'S HAPPENED.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.422
>> Reporter: YEAH.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.157
AND THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED

12:38.157 --> 12:39.225
BEFORE, TOO.

12:39.225 --> 12:39.859
>> YEAH.

12:39.859 --> 12:40.827
YEAH.

12:40.827 --> 12:41.494
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.428
>> Reporter: JOHN DOE SAYS LOW-

12:42.428 --> 12:43.963
INCOME BUYERS TURN TO THE BLACK

12:43.963 --> 12:45.832
MARKET BECAUSE PRICES ARE HIGHER

12:45.832 --> 12:47.767
AT LEGAL RETAIL STORES.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.636
THERE'S CONFLICTING INFORMATION,

12:49.636 --> 12:50.937
BUT AN OUNCE OF POT ON THE BLACK

12:50.937 --> 12:52.305
MARKET CAN COST AS LITTLE AS

12:52.305 --> 12:54.073
$180.

12:54.073 --> 12:55.608
AT THE STORE ANDY WILLIAMS OWNS,

12:55.608 --> 12:58.411
YOU HAVE TO PAY AROUND $240 FOR

12:58.411 --> 12:59.412
AN OUNCE.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.047
THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THE PRICE

13:01.047 --> 13:04.584
INCLUDES A 15% EXCISE TAX, A 10%

13:04.584 --> 13:06.686
MARIJUANA TAX, THE STATE SALES

13:06.686 --> 13:08.655
TAX, AND DENVER'S MARIJUANA

13:08.655 --> 13:09.889
SALES TAX.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.591
>> THE TAXES ARE AN OVERREACH

13:11.591 --> 13:13.026
AND EXCESSIVE.

13:13.026 --> 13:14.927
AND IT'S A REGRESSIVE TAX AND IT

13:14.927 --> 13:16.262
IMPACTS THE POOR THE MOST.

13:16.262 --> 13:17.430
>> Reporter: LARISA BOLIVAR WAS

13:17.430 --> 13:18.564
INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT TO MAKE

13:18.564 --> 13:20.199
MARIJUANA LEGAL FOR MEDICAL

13:20.199 --> 13:21.234
PURPOSES.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.769
SHE USES IT HERSELF TO TREAT

13:22.769 --> 13:23.970
STRESS.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.705
SHE CAMPAIGNED FOR LEGALIZATION,

13:25.705 --> 13:27.140
BUT SHE DOESN'T LIKE HOW IT'S

13:27.140 --> 13:28.174
WORKING OUT.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.776
SHE BELIEVES ALL THOSE TAXES

13:29.776 --> 13:31.844

13:33.980 --> 13:35.815
ACCORDING TO MASON TVERT, WHO

13:35.815 --> 13:37.550
ALSO CAMPAIGNED FOR LEGALIZATION

13:37.550 --> 13:39.419

13:39.419 --> 13:40.753
REGULATIONS.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.388
IN THE FIRST TEN MONTHS, THOSE

13:42.388 --> 13:44.424
TAXES HAVE GENERATED NEARLY $41

13:44.424 --> 13:46.059
MILLION.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.627
A CHUNK OF THAT IS SLATED FOR

13:53.032 --> 13:54.834
CONSUMERS FIND MORE IMPORTANT

14:05.111 --> 14:08.014
IF SOMEONE IS LOWER INCOME OR A

14:08.014 --> 14:09.882

14:09.882 --> 14:12.151
THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO A STORE

14:14.087 --> 14:15.054
SAFE.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.589
IT'LL BE CONVENIENT.

THE COURSE OF EIGHT, NINE

18:56.836 --> 18:58.804

18:58.804 --> 19:01.307

19:01.307 --> 19:02.808
MUCH LIKE WINNING IN THE

19:11.150 --> 19:12.852

19:15.388 --> 19:16.589
BOKO HARAM HAS KIDNAPPED.

19:16.589 --> 19:17.757
IT'S A SECT THAT CONTROLS A

19:25.965 --> 19:26.999
POINT.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.267
IT'S KIND OF A REALLY HARD THING

19:28.267 --> 19:29.668
TO FIND INDIVIDUAL GIRLS WHO

19:29.668 --> 19:30.903
HAVE ALL BEEN SPLIT UP AT THIS

19:30.903 --> 19:31.604

19:31.604 --> 19:36.175
EARLY ON IN MAY, THE U.S. SENT

19:36.175 --> 19:37.743
DRONES AND MANNED SURVEILLANCE

19:37.743 --> 19:40.579

19:40.579 --> 19:43.015
GROUPS OF GIRLS TWICE IN JUNE

19:43.015 --> 19:43.616
AND JULY.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.550
THEY HAVE NO IDEA IF THOSE ARE

19:44.550 --> 19:46.152

SEPARATE GROUP OF GIRLS THAT

19:47.653 --> 19:49.955

19:51.824 --> 19:55.061
OF GIRLS CAMPED OUT IN A FIELD.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.662
SINCE THEN, THE U.S. HAS SCALED

19:56.662 --> 19:57.163
BACK.

19:57.163 --> 19:58.464
THEY SENT THE DRONES ELSEWHERE,

WHERE THEY'RE NEEDED ELSEWHERE

19:59.298 --> 19:59.999
IN THE WORLD.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.634
THEY WERE FLYING JUST A FEW

20:01.634 --> 20:03.669
MANNED FLIGHTS A WEEK LAST TIME

20:03.669 --> 20:05.171
I CHECKED IN.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.172
THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT BY

GET THEM OUT.

>> Sreenivasan: WHAT'S

20:11.677 --> 20:13.112
HAPPENED TO THEM?

20:13.112 --> 20:15.081

20:15.081 --> 20:17.917
HAVING ANY VALUE TO THEM.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.452
THEY KIND OF AREN'T CUT OUT FOR

20:19.452 --> 20:22.388
LIFE IN A MILITANT GROUP.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.656
BUT, FRANKLY, THEY'RE NOT GOING

20:23.656 --> 20:24.723
TO GET RID OF THEM, EITHER.

20:24.723 --> 20:25.958
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SORT OF AN

20:25.958 --> 20:26.692
IMPASSE.

20:26.692 --> 20:27.660
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TRUST

20:27.660 --> 20:28.894
BETWEEN NIGERIA'S GOVERNMENT AND

20:28.894 --> 20:30.629
BOKO HARAM TO COME TO SOME SORT

20:30.629 --> 20:32.098
OF NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT,

20:32.098 --> 20:32.465
EITHER.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.966
>> Sreenivasan: SO, SORT OF TWO

20:33.966 --> 20:35.267
RELATIONSHIPS I WANT TO EXPLORE

20:35.267 --> 20:36.635
VERY BRIEFLY IS, ONE, THAT

20:36.635 --> 20:37.603
THE TENSIONS IN THOSE

20:37.603 --> 20:39.071
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN BOKO HARAM

20:39.071 --> 20:40.306
AND THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT, BUT

20:40.306 --> 20:41.474
THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE AN

20:41.474 --> 20:42.541
INCREASED AMOUNT OF TENSION

20:42.541 --> 20:43.609
BETWEEN THE NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT

20:43.609 --> 20:45.578
AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.846
>> THE FACT IS, WHEN IT COMES TO

20:46.846 --> 20:48.114
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN BOKO HARAM

20:48.114 --> 20:49.281
AND NIGERIA'S GOVERNMENT, IT'S

20:49.281 --> 20:50.483
ALL A LOT OF SPECULATION.

20:50.483 --> 20:53.519
IN FEBRUARY, THE PRESIDENT SAID

20:53.519 --> 20:54.320
HE DOESN'T TALK TO THEM.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.621
HE SAID THAT JOURNALISTS TALK TO

20:55.621 --> 20:57.356
THEM MORE THAN HE DOES.

20:57.356 --> 20:58.457
AND WHEN HE SAID THAT I KIND OF

20:58.457 --> 20:59.859
FURROWED MY BROW BECAUSE FRANKLY

20:59.859 --> 21:01.026
I DON'T KNOW A SINGLE JOURNALIST

21:01.026 --> 21:02.294
WHO HAS BEEN ABLE TO HAVE A

21:02.294 --> 21:03.796
CONFIRMED, VERIFIABLE

21:03.796 --> 21:05.297
CONVERSATION WITH BOKO HARAM

21:05.297 --> 21:08.167
IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.301
SINCE THEN, IN OCTOBER,

21:09.301 --> 21:10.302
NIGERIA'S GOVERNMENT SAID,

21:10.302 --> 21:11.137
"HEY, LOOK, WE'VE GOT THIS

21:11.137 --> 21:12.204
BREAKTHROUGH, WE'VE BEEN TALKING

21:12.204 --> 21:13.005
TO THEM.

21:13.005 --> 21:13.939
THEY'RE GOING TO RELEASE THESE

21:13.939 --> 21:15.474
GIRLS."

21:15.474 --> 21:16.942
IN FACT, THEY SAID THEY'RE GOING

21:16.942 --> 21:18.277
TO RELEASE ALL THE CAPTIVES BOKO

21:18.277 --> 21:19.345
HARAM HAS EVER TAKEN, WHICH IS

21:19.345 --> 21:21.347
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS IF NOT

21:21.347 --> 21:23.616
THOUSANDS OF MEN, BOYS, WOMEN

21:23.616 --> 21:25.050
AND CHILDREN.

21:25.050 --> 21:25.651
THEY NEVER DID.

21:25.651 --> 21:26.919
BOKO HARAM CAME OUT WITH A TAPE

21:26.919 --> 21:28.587
A FEW DAYS LATER SAYING, "JOKE'S

21:28.587 --> 21:29.789
ON YOU.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.157
WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF

21:31.157 --> 21:32.558
NEGOTIATING WITH YOU.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.527
YOU ARE AN INFIDEL GOVERNMENT,

21:34.527 --> 21:36.395
AND WE WILL CONTINUE WAGING

21:36.395 --> 21:37.563
JIHAD."

21:37.563 --> 21:38.697
THE NIGERIANS ARE FRUSTRATED BY

21:38.697 --> 21:39.031
THIS.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.166
AND I THINK SOME OF THAT ANGER

21:40.166 --> 21:41.667
IS BEING DEFLECTED AGAINST THE

21:41.667 --> 21:42.635
UNITED STATES.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.469
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

21:43.469 --> 21:44.637
COMMENTS LATELY LIKE, "WELL, WE

21:44.637 --> 21:45.838
COULD DEAL WITH BOKO HARAM, BUT

21:45.838 --> 21:48.440
THE FACT IS THIS BIG NEOCOLONIAL

21:48.440 --> 21:50.109
POWER, AMERICA, WON'T LET US BUY

21:50.109 --> 21:51.477
HELICOPTERS BECAUSE THEY SAY

21:51.477 --> 21:55.748
WE'RE ABUSING HUMAN RIGHTS."

21:55.748 --> 21:56.649
I THINK SOME OF THAT IS

21:56.649 --> 21:57.883
POLITICAL POSTURING.

21:57.883 --> 21:59.218
SOME OF THAT IS, BASICALLY,

21:59.218 --> 22:00.186
THERE'S AN ELECTION IN FEBRUARY,

22:00.186 --> 22:02.221
AND NIGERIA'S LOOKING FOR... THE

22:02.221 --> 22:03.022
GOVERNMENT'S LOOKING FOR A

22:03.022 --> 22:04.423
REASON WHY THEY HAVEN'T WRAPPED

22:04.423 --> 22:07.092
UP A NOW FIVE-YEAR-LONG CONFLICT

22:07.092 --> 22:08.127
WITH BOKO HARAM.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.161
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, DREW

VIEWERS LIKE YOU: YOUR FEEDBACK

22:26.779 --> 22:28.480
ABOUT SOME OF OUR RECENT WORK.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.115
MANY OF YOU COMMENTED ABOUT OUR

22:30.115 --> 22:32.017
UPDATED SIGNATURE SEGMENT LAST

22:32.017 --> 22:33.519
SUNDAY, DESCRIBING HOW SOME

22:33.519 --> 22:35.120
STRUGGLING TOWNS HAVE USED FOR-

22:35.120 --> 22:36.622
PROFIT COMPANIES TO COLLECT

22:36.622 --> 22:38.457
FINES AND THAT SOME POOR PEOPLE

22:38.457 --> 22:39.992
ARE BEING JAILED WHEN THEY CAN'T

22:39.992 --> 22:40.726
PAY.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.294
THIS, EVEN IF THEY'VE BEEN

22:42.294 --> 22:43.996
ACQUITTED OF THE CHARGES THEY

22:43.996 --> 22:44.697
FACED.

22:44.697 --> 22:45.731
>> I DIDN'T... I DIDN'T SELL

22:45.731 --> 22:47.132
DRUGS.

22:47.132 --> 22:48.100
I DIDN'T BREAK INTO ANYONE'S

22:48.100 --> 22:49.134
HOME.

22:49.134 --> 22:50.769
I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

22:50.769 --> 22:52.137
I HAD AN EXPIRED TAG.

22:52.137 --> 22:53.205
>> Sreenivasan: OVERWHELMINGLY,

22:53.205 --> 22:54.073
YOU THOUGHT THE PRACTICE WAS

22:54.073 --> 22:54.807
WRONG.

22:54.807 --> 22:55.841
ANGELA ERICHSEN WROTE US:

22:55.841 --> 22:57.009
"DEBTORS PRISON-- WE'VE

22:57.009 --> 22:58.978
REGRESSED 200 YEARS."

22:58.978 --> 23:00.679
FROM LINDA RUMMEL DEVENDORF:

23:00.679 --> 23:02.681
"PURELY DICKENSIAN TIMES WE'RE

23:02.681 --> 23:03.515
ENTERING."

23:03.515 --> 23:04.483
JANICE FRIEDMAN SAID:

23:04.483 --> 23:05.584
"RIDICULOUS!

23:05.584 --> 23:06.518
LET THEM WORK IT OFF WITH

23:06.518 --> 23:07.620
COMMUNITY SERVICE!"

23:07.620 --> 23:09.655
AND PATRICIA EVANS ADDED THIS:

23:09.655 --> 23:11.123
"DUE PROCESS REQUIRES AN

23:11.123 --> 23:12.858
IMPARTIAL DECISION MAKER;

23:12.858 --> 23:14.226
ANYTIME A PRIVATIZED SYSTEM IS

23:14.226 --> 23:16.695
USED, BY DEFINITION, DUE PROCESS

IS GONE."

23:17.730 --> 23:18.964
JEFF GOLDMAN WROTE:

23:18.964 --> 23:20.399
"BESIDES BEING OBVIOUSLY

23:20.399 --> 23:21.867
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, WHATEVER

23:21.867 --> 23:23.168
HAPPENED TO FAIR PLAY AND

23:23.168 --> 23:24.136
TREATING PEOPLE WHO ARE

23:24.136 --> 23:25.638
OTHERWISE GOOD PEOPLE WITH

23:25.638 --> 23:27.806
RESPECT AND RATIONAL PENALTIES

23:27.806 --> 23:29.708
FOR VERY MINOR OFFENSES?

23:29.708 --> 23:31.210
PARTICULARLY SINCE THEY WERE

23:31.210 --> 23:32.845
FOUND INNOCENT OF THE ORIGINAL

23:32.845 --> 23:33.712
CHARGES.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.347
THIS IS JUST ANOTHER CASE OF THE

23:35.347 --> 23:37.383
POOR OR WORKING POOR GETTING THE

23:37.383 --> 23:38.517
SHAFT, SO TO SPEAK.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.419
THIS STORY MAKES ME SICK TO MY

23:40.419 --> 23:41.220
STOMACH."

23:41.220 --> 23:42.354
AND STEVEN MITCHELL HAD THIS TO

23:42.354 --> 23:44.356
SAY: "OUR SYSTEM IS NO LONGER

23:44.356 --> 23:46.191
BASED ON JUSTICE, IT IS BASED ON

REVENUE.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.460
NO LONGER IS IT 'PROTECT AND

23:48.460 --> 23:50.329
SERVE'; IT'S 'HARASS AND

23:50.329 --> 23:50.963
EXTORT.'"

23:50.963 --> 23:52.965
JUDITH HARLAN SAID: "PRISONS ARE

23:52.965 --> 23:54.633
VERY EXPENSIVE, AND FUNDS ARE

23:54.633 --> 23:55.868
PROVIDED BY LOCAL AND

NATIONAL GOVERNMENT.
