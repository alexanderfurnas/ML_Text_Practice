GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.575 --> 00:13.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: We go to the community
of Flint, Michigan, where

00:13.046 --> 00:18.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a water crisis has the governor
on the defensive and residents
outraged.

00:18.185 --> 00:22.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday: the virus now found
in 20 countries and causing

00:22.956 --> 00:25.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
brain damage in infants.

00:25.826 --> 00:30.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Then, we catch up
with two reporters on the
campaign trail to go beyond the
polls

00:30.197 --> 00:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Iowa and New Hampshire.

00:33.500 --> 00:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the second
conversation in our series on
Understanding Autism, telling

00:38.238 --> 00:41.208 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the many stories
of the disorder.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER, Co-Author, "In a
Different Key: The Story of
Autism": Some guy stood up and

00:43.777 --> 00:49.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, "Hey, he's got autism.
What's your problem? What's your
reason for acting like a jerk?"

00:49.917 --> 00:53.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what happened is a
community formed around him.

00:53.186 --> 01:00.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:00.427 --> 01:04.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:04.631 --> 01:14.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street spent
another day on the downside, and
the only question was,

01:14.508 --> 01:22.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how low would they go? The Dow
Jones industrial average was off
550 points before a late rally.

01:22.249 --> 01:31.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It ended with a loss of 249
points to close at 15766. The
Nasdaq fell five and the S&amp;P

01:31.558 --> 01:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
500 dropped 22. All this was
driven by another sharp drop in
oil prices to just over $26.50

01:37.030 --> 01:40.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a barrel.

01:40.067 --> 01:47.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Numbers of a very
different sort are also in, and
they show 2015 was Earth's

01:47.140 --> 01:52.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
hottest year on record.
Scientists at NASA and NOAA, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric

01:52.312 --> 01:56.383 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Administration,
reported that today.

01:56.383 --> 02:02.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As this NASA animation shows,
the data show a steady
accumulation of heat in recent
decades.

02:02.456 --> 02:06.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the researchers say it
should make doubters of climate
change think twice.

02:06.560 --> 02:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COMPTON TUCKER, NASA: Fifteen of
the past 16 years have been the
warmest years on record.

02:12.666 --> 02:17.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you see a run like
this, this is not something
which people can easily dismiss

02:17.738 --> 02:22.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and say it isn't true; 15 out of
16 is a pretty good batting
average.

02:22.843 --> 02:27.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: NOAA had already
announced that 2015 was the
second warmest year in the
United

02:27.781 --> 02:33.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States since record-keeping
started 121 years ago.

02:33.286 --> 02:39.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Pakistan,
Islamist militants killed at
least 18 students and two
teachers

02:39.693 --> 02:45.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a university today and
wounded 23 others. The attackers
stormed the school in the
northwestern

02:45.132 --> 02:51.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city of Charsadda, before being
cornered and killed by soldiers.

02:51.772 --> 02:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ambulance sirens wailed outside
Bacha Khan University even as
the battle raged inside.

02:59.112 --> 03:04.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Four militants had sneaked in
under cover of early morning fog
and started shooting.

03:04.418 --> 03:08.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
heard firing from the back of
the campus. We thought maybe

03:08.255 --> 03:11.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some people were fighting. Then
the firing increased. Then he
said, get into the rooms.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't go out.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): There
was so much panic and fear that
a friend of mine jumped

03:16.830 --> 03:20.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the university building.
The building is very high, yet
he jumped from it in because

03:20.534 --> 03:25.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was so scared. We saw the
militants chanting, "Allah is
greatest."

03:25.205 --> 03:30.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Police and
military forces descended on the
campus and counterattacked.

03:30.310 --> 03:34.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington Post reporter Tim
Craig tracked the operation from
Islamabad.

03:34.681 --> 03:38.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM CRAIG, Washington Post: It
was quite foggy, so they
actually used helicopters to
sort

03:38.819 --> 03:44.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of see the ground of the campus,
because it was really foggy. So,
helicopters were used.

03:44.324 --> 03:48.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They rappelled commandos onto
the school grounds to sort of
fight the terrorists.

03:48.562 --> 03:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Friends and
family waited for news of loved
ones as a prolonged gun battle

03:53.100 --> 03:57.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
followed. Police say they had
to proceed with caution.

03:57.537 --> 04:00.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAEED KHAN WAZIR, Police Chief
(through translator): This was a
short lived operation,
approximately

04:00.941 --> 04:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two hours in duration, in which
time we finished the militants.
Two of them were on the hostel

04:05.912 --> 04:08.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
roof top, but there was some
confusion that they might be
students, as they were
young-looking.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, we could easily have
targeted them in the beginning.

04:12.619 --> 04:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A breakaway
faction of the Pakistani Taliban
claimed responsibility,

04:17.924 --> 04:26.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the main Taliban group
called it un-Islamic. The attack
echoed the 2014 massacre at a
grade

04:26.032 --> 04:33.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school in nearby Peshawar that
killed more than 150 people,
mostly children and teachers.

04:33.373 --> 04:37.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM CRAIG: Since then, the army
has really sort of stepped up
its response to this menace

04:37.444 --> 04:41.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and this threat. And terrorism
attacks went way down this year,
depending on what study

04:41.748 --> 04:45.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you are looking at, 50 percent
down, 70 percent down.

04:45.919 --> 04:50.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But clearly, as a resident of
Pakistan at the moment, I can
say it's a much safer place.

04:50.056 --> 04:56.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With that said, as everyone
around the world knows, it only
takes one time for a terrorist

04:56.029 --> 04:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be able to enter a location
to carry out a horrific attack.

04:59.966 --> 05:04.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After today's
attack, Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif vowed again to

05:04.771 --> 05:09.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wipe out the menace of
terrorism in his country.

05:09.643 --> 05:16.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, a
Taliban car bomber killed seven
people on a minibus in Kabul.

05:16.816 --> 05:21.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vehicle carried journalists
for Tolo News, a private TV
channel that's reported on
Taliban

05:21.388 --> 05:23.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
abuses.

05:23.690 --> 05:29.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Iran's supreme
leader has thanked the country's
Revolutionary Guards for
detaining

05:29.329 --> 05:35.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10 U.S. soldiers -- sailors,
that is, last week. The
Americans were held for 15 hours

05:35.068 --> 05:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after straying into Iranian
waters. On his Web site today,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised

05:40.874 --> 05:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the guard's action, and said:
"What they did in the Persian
Gulf was right."

05:45.845 --> 05:51.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Khamenei also said Iranian
protesters who stormed the Saudi
Arabian Embassy this month

05:51.585 --> 05:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had harmed Iran and Islam. The
Saudis severed diplomatic ties
after the attack.

05:57.457 --> 06:01.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's
confirmation today that Islamic
State militants have destroyed

06:01.795 --> 06:08.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Iraq's oldest Christian
monastery. Satellite photos
obtained by the Associated Press
show

06:08.068 --> 06:13.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
St. Elijah's Monastery in Mosul
was leveled in September of
2014. It had stood for 1,400

06:13.406 --> 06:15.575 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

06:15.575 --> 06:20.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REV. PAUL THABIT HABIB, Iraqi
Priest (through translator): It
became a spiritual place for

06:20.447 --> 06:24.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Christians to visit and to
have religious ceremonies there.
The monastery attracted

06:24.618 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the people from Mosul,
Christians and Muslims. All the
poets, historians and travelers

06:29.556 --> 06:31.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrote about this monastery. It
became a very important place
for the history of the church

06:31.858 --> 06:34.160 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Iraq.

06:34.160 --> 06:38.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the past 18
months, the Islamic State has
damaged or destroyed hundreds

06:38.832 --> 06:43.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of ancient cultural sites
in Syria and Iraq.

06:43.036 --> 06:48.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, Senate Democrats
blocked a Republican bill to
toughen screenings

06:48.008 --> 06:54.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Syrian and Iraqi refugees
entering the U.S. The two sides
jousted over whether it

06:54.014 --> 06:57.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would prevent Islamic State
militants from entering the
country or simply punish the

06:57.651 --> 06:59.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
innocent.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D),
Illinois: I don't understand why
the Republicans in the Senate

07:02.689 --> 07:07.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the Republican presidential
candidates have declared war on
these poor refugees.

07:07.694 --> 07:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't understand why they
ignore the fact that these
people are going through closer

07:13.500 --> 07:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scrutiny, more investigations,
more questions, and more delays
than any visitors to the United

07:18.271 --> 07:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
States from any other country.

07:21.341 --> 07:25.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas:
What this legislation is about,
though, is about national
security,

07:25.679 --> 07:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people who are refugees, whether
they're adequately vetted by the
appropriate authorities before

07:31.951 --> 07:34.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they come to the United States
and live in our communities.
This is not about banning

07:34.421 --> 07:36.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
refugees.

07:36.656 --> 07:42.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The bill cleared the
Republican-led House last fall
with a veto-proof majority.

07:42.662 --> 07:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nearly all of
Detroit's 100 public schools
were closed today, as teachers

07:48.535 --> 07:53.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
staged their latest and largest
sick-out. They're trying to draw
attention to a lack

07:53.473 --> 07:59.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of funding, low pay, crumbling
buildings and large class sizes.
The sick-out kept thousands

07:59.946 --> 08:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of students home and coincided
with President Obama's visit to
the city to tout the auto

08:04.417 --> 08:07.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
industry's recovery.

08:07.454 --> 08:14.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And an automobile
with special status is going on
the auction block in
Philadelphia.

08:14.227 --> 08:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pope Francis used the black Fiat
during his visit to the U.S.
last September. The auction

08:20.133 --> 08:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is set for January 29. Proceeds
will go to the Roman Catholic
archdiocese and the Children's

08:25.405 --> 08:28.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hospital of Philadelphia.

08:28.875 --> 08:36.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And coming up on
the "NewsHour": the latest on
Flint, Michigan's toxic water

08:36.282 --> 08:42.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crisis; warnings against a
spreading virus that causes
child deformities; a call to
de-emphasize

08:42.522 --> 08:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
test scores in college
applications; and much more.

08:53.066 --> 09:04.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Truth be told, the
water crisis in Flint, Michigan,
was a story that has been

09:04.911 --> 09:10.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unfolding for years, and has
only recently begun attracting
regional attention. But now

09:10.049 --> 09:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the massive lead contamination
of the city's drinking water is
very much on the national

09:14.020 --> 09:16.956 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
radar.

09:16.956 --> 09:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Children in Flint now have
double and in some cases triple
the levels of lead in their
blood,

09:20.827 --> 09:23.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and a federal emergency was
declared last weekend.

09:23.830 --> 09:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, in Detroit, President
Obama addressed the troubles in
Flint.

09:28.034 --> 09:31.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: I know that if I
was a parent up there, I

09:31.938 --> 09:45.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be beside myself that my
kids' health could be at risk.
It is a reminder of why

09:45.752 --> 09:53.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can't shortchange basic
services that we provide to our
people and that we together

09:53.526 --> 09:57.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
provide as a government to make
sure that public health and
safety is preserved.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

09:59.466 --> 10:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In fact, Michigan
Governor Rick Snyder has
apologized, and pledged to take

10:05.271 --> 10:09.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
new steps to protect the
community. Snyder himself is
under increasing pressure to
detail

10:09.309 --> 10:13.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what his administration
knew, and when.

10:13.046 --> 10:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Flint, there's plenty of
anger and questions over who is
to blame.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour"'s William
Brangham is just back from Flint
with this report.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This
is how bad it's gotten.

10:22.989 --> 10:25.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: A case of water.

10:25.492 --> 10:29.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: A case of water for this
house. Did she get a filter?

10:29.229 --> 10:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In Flint,
Michigan, the sheriff's
department is going
door-to-door,

10:31.464 --> 10:35.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
handing out bottled
water and filters.

10:35.435 --> 10:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fire stations are now water
distribution centers. The
National Guard's been deployed,
and last

10:41.140 --> 10:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night in his state of the state
address, Michigan Governor Rick
Snyder heard to apologize.

10:44.844 --> 10:49.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. RICK SNYDER (R), Michigan:
To you, the people of Flint, I
say tonight, as I have

10:49.048 --> 10:52.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before, I am sorry,
and I will fix it.

10:52.986 --> 10:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why? Because,
for a year-and-a-half, despite
repeated claims from officials
that

10:57.790 --> 11:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything was fine, people in
Flint were drinking water
poisoned with lead, a toxin

11:02.295 --> 11:05.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that causes irreversible
damage to the human body.

11:05.698 --> 11:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM STREBY, Mother: It's every
kid on the block, it's every
baby on the block, it's

11:08.668 --> 11:11.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
everybody, every old person.

11:11.738 --> 11:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of Kim
Streby's two sons, like
potentially thousands of other

11:15.441 --> 11:19.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kids in Flint, has elevated
levels of lead in his blood.

11:19.212 --> 11:27.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM STREBY: I was absolutely
disgusted to think that we are
paying an enormous price

11:27.921 --> 11:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for water that is dangerous,
that we can't use.

11:34.093 --> 11:38.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The crisis
began five years ago, because
the city of Flint was trying

11:38.064 --> 11:43.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to save money. This majority
black city has been in an
economic tailspin for decades,

11:43.937 --> 11:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever since General Motors cut
production here. Forty percent
of Flint's 100,000 residents

11:47.240 --> 11:51.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
live in poverty.

11:51.044 --> 11:55.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2011, Governor Rick Snyder
turned near total control of
Flint over to a series of

11:55.515 --> 11:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emergency managers. They began
major cost-cutting, including a
decision to try and save $5
million

11:59.986 --> 12:03.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by switching Flint's
water supply.

12:03.856 --> 12:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials decided said they
wanted to get water from Lake
Huron, which is 80 miles to

12:07.760 --> 12:11.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the east of us, but that
pipeline wasn't going to be
finished for two more years. And
so,

12:11.297 --> 12:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the interim, they decided
they were going to get their
water from right here, from the

12:12.865 --> 12:16.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Flint River.

12:16.135 --> 12:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as soon as the riverwater
began flowing into Flint in
April of 2014, red flags popped

12:21.374 --> 12:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up. The water smelled bad, and
it flowed in a startling array
of colors. E. coli and other

12:26.312 --> 12:31.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bacteria were discovered,
followed by chemicals that can
cause liver and kidney problems.

12:31.451 --> 12:35.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the fall of 2014, the local
GM plant stopped using Flint
water because it was corroding

12:35.021 --> 12:37.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their auto parts.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHONDA KELSO, Flint Resident: I
mean, you can see the
particulates in it. See it
floating?

12:40.593 --> 12:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
See the brown stuff in it?

12:43.229 --> 12:45.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Yes. Yes.

12:45.231 --> 12:49.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RHONDA KELSO: Yes, that's in
our -- my daughter's body.

12:49.135 --> 12:53.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lifetime Flint
resident Rhonda Kelso, like
thousands of other residents,

12:53.806 --> 12:58.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soon discovered there was also
poisonous lead in the water. The
whole problem occurred because

12:58.811 --> 13:03.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Flint River corroded the
city's old lead pipes, leaching
the toxic metal into the water

13:03.850 --> 13:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supply. Kelso's 12-year-old
daughter, Kaylynn (ph), who's
already developmentally delayed

13:07.920 --> 13:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and hearing impaired, has now
tested positive for lead in her
blood.

13:12.258 --> 13:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RHONDA KELSO: They kept telling
us something was safe, and it
was revealed that it wasn't

13:18.364 --> 13:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safe. We had to rely on outside
agencies to let us know that the
water was poison. And

13:24.671 --> 13:28.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we already knew it was,
but we had to prove it.

13:28.207 --> 13:32.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
people who helped prove it was
one of Kaylynn's doctors, Dr.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mona Hanna-Attisha. She's the
director of the pediatric
residency program at Hurley

13:35.715 --> 13:38.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Medical Center in Flint.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MONA HANNA-ATTISHA, Hurley
Medical Center: When
pediatricians hear anything
about lead,

13:41.788 --> 13:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we stand up straight and we
freak out, because we know lead.
And lead is a potent, known,

13:45.792 --> 13:48.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
irreversible neurotoxin.

13:48.394 --> 13:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Late last
summer, Dr. Hanna-Attisha tried
to get county and state data on
how

13:53.366 --> 13:58.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much lead Flint's kids had been
absorbing into their blood, but
she hit roadblocks.

13:58.438 --> 14:03.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So she then pulled data on
roughly 1,700 kids from her own
hospital and other local
pediatricians.

14:03.943 --> 14:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. MONA HANNA-ATTISHA: We
didn't sleep. We did this right
away. This was the fastest

14:07.346 --> 14:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
research project I have ever
done, because of kind of the
public health community
implications.

14:11.384 --> 14:16.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was one neighborhood, one
specific ward of a city where
the percentage of lead poisoning

14:16.556 --> 14:20.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually tripled. It went from
about 5 percent of kids to over
almost 16 percent of kids

14:20.793 --> 14:24.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who were tested who had
elevated blood lead levels.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: She released
her findings at a news
conference last September, but
her

14:26.599 --> 14:29.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
data was dismissed by
state health officials.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. MONA HANNA-ATTISHA: We were
attacked. So, we were told that
we were unfortunate

14:31.838 --> 14:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
researchers, that we were...

14:32.905 --> 14:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Unfortunate?

14:34.407 --> 14:37.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DR. MONA HANNA-ATTISHA:
Unfortunate researchers, that we
were causing near-hysteria.

14:37.343 --> 14:43.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But two weeks
later, officials acknowledged
her findings were correct. And,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
separately, researchers at
Virginia Tech had also confirmed
high levels of lead in Flint's

14:45.952 --> 14:48.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
water.

14:48.454 --> 14:53.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This contamination could've been
avoided if officials had only
added an anti-corrosion

14:53.259 --> 14:56.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agent to the water. In fact,
federal law requires it. But
they didn't do it in Flint, and
no

14:56.929 --> 15:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one has fully explained why.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. LAWRENCE REYNOLDS,
President, Mott Children's
Health Center: It's something
that no parent

15:03.136 --> 15:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would accept. It's something no
city, county, or state
government should accept. And
there's

15:08.007 --> 15:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
no way it can be justified.

15:10.543 --> 15:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Lawrence
Reynolds is a pediatrician and
president of Mott Children's

15:14.981 --> 15:19.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Health Center. He says lead
causes a litany of problems for
kids, among them, delayed

15:19.986 --> 15:23.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
mental development,
irritability, aggression and
learning problems.

15:23.990 --> 15:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. LAWRENCE REYNOLDS: If you
have seen those I.Q. curves
where there's the big hump and

15:29.462 --> 15:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the small tails, 5 percent on
either end, what lead exposure
does is it shifts the curve

15:36.469 --> 15:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the lower I.Q. score, so we
will have more kids with lower
I.Q. and perhaps more children

15:44.377 --> 15:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who will have learning problems
and require services. But then
start multiplying these

15:49.715 --> 15:55.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things by thousands and imagine
what a school district has to
deal with.

15:55.254 --> 15:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN WEAVER, Mayor of Flint,
Michigan: We're talking about a
whole generation of 5 and

15:56.756 --> 15:58.491 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
under.

15:58.491 --> 16:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Newly elected
Mayor Karen Weaver campaigned on
fixing the water crisis,

16:03.596 --> 16:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and shortly after taking office
and with limited powers, she
declared a state of emergency,

16:07.333 --> 16:09.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
trying to get her
city some help.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAREN WEAVER: People said that
was something that couldn't be
done, but I said that let

16:13.706 --> 16:19.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them tell us no. Let them tell
the people of Flint that we
don't deserve these financial

16:19.612 --> 16:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resources, these supports and
these services for our families.

16:23.349 --> 16:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM STREBY: We don't live in
Third World conditions, where we
should have safe drinking water,

16:28.888 --> 16:30.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and we don't.

16:30.923 --> 16:35.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Kim Streby's
two sons are Ronan, who's 13,
and Jude, who's 11. He's

16:35.661 --> 16:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the one whose blood test came
back with elevated lead levels.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you guys had been drinking
with it, cooking with it,
brushing your teeth in it,
taking

16:42.301 --> 16:44.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
baths in it, 100 percent?

16:44.070 --> 16:46.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RONAN STREBY, Flint
Resident: Yes.

16:46.038 --> 16:47.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And then when
you found out that there was
something wrong with that

16:47.607 --> 16:50.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
water, how did you
feel about that?

16:50.142 --> 16:54.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RONAN STREBY: I felt kind of
scared, like, to know that I was
using this water for pretty

16:54.747 --> 16:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much everything, and then I
found out that it could be
dangerous.

16:57.116 --> 17:03.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDE STREBY, Flint Resident: I
was kind of grossed out, because
imagine you drinking

17:03.623 --> 17:10.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
water for a year and knowing
that there's something that can
be life-threatening.

17:10.596 --> 17:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As a parent, I
couldn't imagine the feeling
that for over a year-and-a-half

17:14.934 --> 17:19.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my kids were drinking water that
somebody should've known was
poisonous.

17:19.405 --> 17:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM STREBY: There are no words.
I don't know what to say. It's
anger, frustration. And

17:30.049 --> 17:32.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you wonder what's next.

17:32.318 --> 17:36.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At least three
different class-action lawsuits
have now been filed,

17:36.055 --> 17:43.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
blaming local and state
officials, even the governor,
for negligence.

17:43.829 --> 17:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last night in Lansing, a crowd
gathered outside the capital,
demanding Governor Rick Snyder

17:47.767 --> 17:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resign for his role in the
crisis. Inside, Snyder focused
his speech on Flint and pledged

17:52.939 --> 17:56.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state officials would do all
they could to fix the problem.

17:56.142 --> 18:02.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GOV. RICK SNYDER: No citizen of
this great state should endure
this kind of catastrophe.

18:02.415 --> 18:06.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Government failed you, federal,
state and local leaders, by
breaking the trust you placed

18:06.786 --> 18:09.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in us.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But those
assurances aren't enough for
Rhonda Kelso. She's signed on to

18:12.525 --> 18:14.927 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
one of those
class-action lawsuits.

18:14.927 --> 18:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RHONDA KELSO: Oh, they think
that we're a permanent
underclass and they think that
we're

18:18.497 --> 18:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
uneducated and ignorant and that
we are the most violent city in
America, and people want

18:26.973 --> 18:30.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to dispose of people like that.

18:30.042 --> 18:33.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Flint, as you
know, is a majority black
community, and when we look

18:33.512 --> 18:37.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at who is exposed to lead around
the country, those are also
majority black communities.

18:37.483 --> 18:39.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. LAWRENCE REYNOLDS: Yes.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
that that's part of what's also
going on here?

18:42.421 --> 18:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. LAWRENCE REYNOLDS: Speaking
to me, as a person of color and
as a resident of the

18:48.861 --> 18:55.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city of Flint, I will ask the
other question: If this were a
Grand Blanc, Michigan,
Bloomfield

18:55.701 --> 19:01.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hills, St. Joseph, Michigan,
which are mostly white,
middle-class, would we have had
the

19:01.941 --> 19:05.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
same response if there
was a water issue?

19:05.511 --> 19:08.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And
what do you think?

19:08.781 --> 19:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. LAWRENCE REYNOLDS: There
would've been a completely
different response. It would

19:13.285 --> 19:19.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have been a more timely
response, and those complaints
would've been taken as
legitimate.

19:19.025 --> 19:23.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The city of
Flint has stopped using the
Flint River as its source, and
corrosion

19:23.162 --> 19:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
control is now being used.
People from across the United
States have been donating tens

19:27.666 --> 19:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of thousands of bottles of
water, and more National Guard
troops have arrived to help

19:30.102 --> 19:32.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
distribute them.

19:32.238 --> 19:37.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KIM STREBY: I love this city and
I love the people in this city
and it's a great city.

19:37.443 --> 19:46.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this water situation is just
absolutely devastating to me,
but it isn't the definition

19:46.152 --> 19:48.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the city.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Flint's
better than that.

19:49.922 --> 19:52.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KIM STREBY: Absolutely.
Absolutely.

19:52.625 --> 20:03.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm William Brangham
in Flint, Michigan.

20:03.702 --> 20:18.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: growing
concerns over a mosquito-borne
virus that is linked with

20:18.517 --> 20:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
birth defects and has moved into
South America, the Caribbean and
now the U.S. And, so far,

20:23.823 --> 20:25.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there's no treatment
for the virus.

20:25.558 --> 20:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

20:28.260 --> 20:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Zika virus
has been known of for decades.
But beginning last May in

20:33.466 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brazil, it's taken a frightening
turn, being linked for the first
time to babies born with

20:39.438 --> 20:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unusually small heads and brain
damage, more than 3,800 cases to
date.

20:46.011 --> 20:50.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Zika is transmitted by
mosquitoes. And government
workers have been checking house
to house

20:50.015 --> 20:52.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Brazil for breeding grounds.

20:52.885 --> 20:56.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCELO CASTRO, Health Minister
of Brazil (through translator):
We are in this battle,

20:56.755 --> 21:00.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this fight to do this
in a record time.

21:00.559 --> 21:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In most cases,
individuals who contract the
virus show few or no symptoms.

21:05.865 --> 21:10.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the virus is spreading,
already to a number of countries
and territories in South and

21:10.936 --> 21:13.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Central America and
the Caribbean.

21:13.873 --> 21:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have also been a handful
of positive tests confirmed in
the U.S. In each of these

21:19.645 --> 21:23.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases, the patient or mother is
believed to have picked up the
virus abroad.

21:23.516 --> 21:27.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE HUARD, Florida Health
Department: The individual went
to the doctor, had known about

21:27.153 --> 21:31.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Zika virus, let their
physician know that they were in
an area that had it. They
tested,

21:31.023 --> 21:32.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and came back positive.

21:32.658 --> 21:39.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The CDC recently
issued an advisory recommending
that pregnant women

21:39.665 --> 21:44.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
avoid travel to affected areas
and says those who have already
traveled to such areas and

21:44.803 --> 21:48.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are feeling sick should
be tested for infection.

21:48.507 --> 21:53.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke about all this yesterday
with CDC Director Dr. Thomas
Frieden, and asked first

21:53.712 --> 21:56.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
how serious a threat he
sees in the Zika virus.

21:56.882 --> 21:59.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN, Director,
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention: Zika is really

21:59.351 --> 22:06.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new in this form, although it's
been around, known since 1947.
It's only in the past eight

22:06.325 --> 22:11.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or nine years that we have seen
outbreaks of Zika, and only in
the past couple of months

22:11.530 --> 22:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have seen this large
number of cases of a serious
birth defect in Brazil which

22:17.336 --> 22:20.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
appears to be related to Zika.

22:20.873 --> 22:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why we're recommending
that if you're pregnant and
you're thinking about travel,

22:25.511 --> 22:30.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
check the CDC Web site to think
about whether you want to go to
that place or not.

22:30.716 --> 22:35.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're telling
people right now, pregnant
women, to think about
postponing.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not definitively saying
don't travel to these countries
yet?

22:38.857 --> 22:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: We're
advising pregnant women not to
travel to places that have Zika

22:44.096 --> 22:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transmission, because there is
just too much we don't know, so
if it's possible to avoid

22:47.099 --> 22:51.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that travel, that's
important to do.

22:51.203 --> 22:56.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For anyone who is in an area
with Zika, pregnant or not, or
if a pregnant woman goes to a
place

22:56.709 --> 23:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or is in a place that may have
Zika virus spreading, it's
spread by mosquitoes, and

23:02.147 --> 23:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are important things you
can do to reduce your risk of
getting a mosquito bite. You

23:07.586 --> 23:11.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can wear repellent. That works.
You have to wear it all day
long, because these are
mosquitoes

23:11.790 --> 23:14.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that bite during the day.

23:14.827 --> 23:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can also wear clothing that
has permethrin in it. These are
both safe in pregnancy. You

23:20.165 --> 23:26.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can wear long sleeves and long
pants to reduce your exposure,
and you can stay inside in

23:26.038 --> 23:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
air conditioning or screened
spaces. All of these things
really do reduce your risk of

23:30.576 --> 23:36.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mosquito bites. But we are
recommending at this point,
until we know more, just to be

23:36.115 --> 23:42.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
safer, that pregnant women, if
possible, avoid travel to places
that have Zika virus
transmission.

23:42.521 --> 23:44.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, you have
said several times there's too
much -- there is a lot we

23:44.089 --> 23:47.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just don't know.

23:47.092 --> 23:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's just go through what we
don't, what we do know, because
I gather that, until recently,

23:52.965 --> 23:57.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most cases involving Zika were
not very -- considered very
dangerous, right? Many of them
had no

23:57.469 --> 23:58.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
symptoms whatsoever.

23:58.737 --> 24:01.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: Absolutely.

24:01.807 --> 24:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have generally seen as many
as four out of five people who
get infected by Zika don't

24:07.046 --> 24:11.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know it. They don't have any
symptoms. And among those who
get infected, the symptoms

24:11.417 --> 24:16.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tend to be mild and go away
within about a week, a rash and
fever and not feeling well.

24:16.989 --> 24:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen some reports of
people who may have weakness or
paralysis temporarily after

24:22.661 --> 24:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Zika. Whether that's related or
not, we still don't know. That's
being investigated. But

24:27.566 --> 24:31.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what's really concerning is this
large number of birth defects
that have been identified

24:31.270 --> 24:33.405 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Brazil.

24:33.405 --> 24:39.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And studies in our CDC lab have
identified that, in some of the
infants and some of the

24:39.878 --> 24:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
miscarried fetuses, because
there were miscarriages, we have
identified the Zika virus. That
doesn't

24:45.084 --> 24:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say that it's the only cause or
the cause of all of them. There
may be other factors,

24:50.055 --> 24:55.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nutritional or other infections,
that are going into that, but
this is a very unusual

24:55.227 --> 25:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circumstance. It's very unusual
that we identify a new virus
that causes serious birth
defects.

25:01.533 --> 25:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There was a case
reported in Hawaii of a baby
born with brain damage. The

25:05.604 --> 25:08.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mother in that case
had lived in Brazil?

25:08.941 --> 25:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: That's
correct. The mother had lived in
Brazil, gotten Zika in Brazil,

25:13.412 --> 25:20.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then the baby, sadly, was
born with a malformation or
problems in Hawaii.

25:20.753 --> 25:26.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we have seen people,
travelers coming back from areas
with Zika, with Zika in the

25:26.592 --> 25:32.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. We have diagnosed a dozen
so far in our laboratory. And
this is not unexpected. When

25:32.498 --> 25:38.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Zika is in a community, it can
spread quite widely. But what we
have seen is that it tends

25:38.637 --> 25:42.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be associated with one
particular type of mosquito that
is only in certain parts

25:42.074 --> 25:44.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the U.S..

25:44.910 --> 25:51.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in those parts of the U.S.,
with the use of mosquito
repellent, air conditioning,
screens,

25:51.717 --> 25:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we haven't seen large-scale
transmission with viruses with
this type. But we're still
learning

25:56.455 --> 25:59.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more and working hard to
learn more about this virus.

25:59.958 --> 26:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But is it not
likely to spread into the U.S.,
given the pattern so far, and

26:04.797 --> 26:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as the weather warms
up come spring?

26:07.533 --> 26:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: I don't have
a crystal ball. I can't predict
what will happen.

26:11.804 --> 26:17.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can tell you what has happened
with other similar viruses. This
is spread by the mosquito

26:17.009 --> 26:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that spreads the dengue virus.
And there are some parts of
Florida and potentially some

26:22.748 --> 26:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parts of Texas where we have
seen transmission of that virus,
so it's possible that that

26:27.085 --> 26:29.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will occur.

26:29.755 --> 26:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, this virus is a little
different, in that it mostly
affects people, and so -- and

26:36.061 --> 26:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people only carry it for a few
days. So how widely it will
spread in an area where you're

26:41.667 --> 26:45.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not seeing people without air
conditioning, you're not seeing
people otherwise, we don't

26:45.604 --> 26:48.140 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
know.

26:48.140 --> 26:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it is certainly possible
that we will see cases in
certain parts of the U.S. and

26:53.879 --> 26:59.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
possible we might even see
clusters. But we don't predict
that we would see something

26:59.618 --> 27:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
widespread, as we saw, for
example, with West Nile virus,
where you have a bird reservoir

27:03.355 --> 27:06.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which can spread it
and perpetuate it.

27:06.792 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we can't say for sure. What
we can say for sure is that, if
you're pregnant, you

27:12.064 --> 27:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would think twice before you go
to a place with Zika. We advise
you not to. And for anyone

27:17.870 --> 27:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who is in a place with Zika or
other mosquito-borne diseases,
you can take practical steps to

27:23.575 --> 27:28.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greatly reduce your risk of
getting a mosquito bite, and
therefore a disease spread by
mosquitoes.

27:28.447 --> 27:30.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Dr.
Thomas Frieden of the CDC, thank
you so much.

27:30.682 --> 27:32.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. THOMAS FRIEDEN: Thank you.

27:32.851 --> 27:39.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The CDC also
launched its latest anti-smoking
campaign this week. We spoke

27:39.358 --> 27:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Dr. Frieden about its
impact. And we will show you
part of that conversation
tomorrow.

27:45.597 --> 27:56.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

27:56.174 --> 28:02.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":

28:07.386 --> 28:10.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
left behind.

28:10.222 --> 28:16.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, many high school
seniors have finished college
applications. And now they're

28:16.395 --> 28:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waiting to find out whether
taking advanced courses,
prepping for entrance exams and
agonizing

28:21.600 --> 28:25.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
over essays will all pay off.

28:25.070 --> 28:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new report from the Harvard
Graduate School of Education
calls on colleges to lower the

28:31.009 --> 28:37.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pressure on students to impress
admissions committees by racking
up achievements and

28:37.249 --> 28:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
accolades. The report, called
"Turning the Tide," recommends
limiting the number of advanced

28:42.588 --> 28:47.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
placement classes and
extracurricular activities that
students can list on
applications.

28:47.826 --> 28:53.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Instead, it emphasizes community
service and other changes.

28:53.465 --> 28:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richard Weissbourd is the lead
author of the report and he's a
senior lecturer at the Harvard

28:57.269 --> 29:00.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Graduate School of Education.

29:00.706 --> 29:03.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Richard Weissbourd, thank you
very much for joining us.

29:03.875 --> 29:07.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is it that's wrong with the
college application process
right now?

29:07.379 --> 29:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD WEISSBOURD, Harvard
Graduate School of Education:
Well, I think, right now, what

29:09.881 --> 29:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students are doing is they're --
some students are racking up
accomplishments. I think they

29:15.587 --> 29:20.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think, particularly in affluent
communities, that the goal is
long brag sheets.

29:20.726 --> 29:24.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the message we're trying to
send here is that the goal isn't
long brag sheets. The

29:24.696 --> 29:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goal is meaningful academic
engagement and spirited,
passionate learning, and it's
meaningful

29:30.335 --> 29:34.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ethical engagement. It's being
involved in your community,
concern for others, concern

29:34.339 --> 29:37.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the greater good,
for the public good.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So what is it
that students are emphasizing
that you would like to see

29:39.745 --> 29:42.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
less of?

29:42.481 --> 29:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD WEISSBOURD: Well, I
think one of the things that
they are very focused on is
creating

29:48.654 --> 29:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- accumulating extracurricular
activities, accumulating A.P.
courses.

29:54.626 --> 29:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what the admission deans who
have endorsed this report -- and
over 50 admission deans

29:58.997 --> 30:03.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have endorsed it -- what they're
saying, what they're saying
collectively, and it's very

30:03.168 --> 30:08.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important that they're saying it
collectively, you know, they're
on the same page about this,

30:08.306 --> 30:11.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're on the same highway --
what they're saying is, you
know, you're not going to be

30:11.743 --> 30:15.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
penalized if you take a lot of
A.P. courses, but you don't need
to. You're not going to

30:15.013 --> 30:19.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be penalized if you take
a few A.P. courses.

30:19.384 --> 30:25.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's fine. It's totally
appropriate to list a couple,
two or three extracurricular
activities

30:25.457 --> 30:28.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that have been meaningful to you
and to describe why they're
meaningful to you. We're not
looking

30:28.326 --> 30:31.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for long lists of
activities either.

30:31.830 --> 30:37.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as you said,
it is about 50 colleges and
universities that signed on.

30:37.135 --> 30:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were clearly some that
didn't sign on. Aren't there
going to be schools out there

30:41.373 --> 30:46.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that do care about some of the
ways these students perform in
ways that you're saying

30:46.912 --> 30:48.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should be de-emphasized?

30:48.814 --> 30:53.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Isn't there going to be a
different set of criteria now at
different schools?

30:53.285 --> 30:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD WEISSBOURD: Well, you
know, I think there's a few
different issues here.

30:56.621 --> 31:01.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All the Ivy League schools have
signed on. A lot of the very
selective schools have signed

31:01.259 --> 31:07.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on. And many non -- schools that
are not especially selective
have signed on. And I think, you

31:07.999 --> 31:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, the criteria are still
that they're looking for
students who are academically

31:12.304 --> 31:16.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rigorous, but they're also
saying we're looking for
students who lead well-balanced
lives,

31:16.441 --> 31:19.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who are involved in
their communities.

31:19.144 --> 31:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're not involved in
community service as an
accomplishment, as a way to
impress

31:24.416 --> 31:28.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
admissions officers. They are
involved in things that are
meaningful to them and
potentially

31:28.987 --> 31:33.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transformative to them and
enable them to have experiences
of diversity across race,

31:33.825 --> 31:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
class, culture, also political
and religious orientation.

31:37.696 --> 31:43.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a risk
there, though, Richard
Weissbourd, that you create a
different

31:43.068 --> 31:47.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of pressure on students, to
rack up the kind of community
service that you're saying

31:47.606 --> 31:50.976 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you and others want to
see them engage in?

31:50.976 --> 31:55.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD WEISSBOURD: Well, you
know, I think that there are
some students and parents who

31:55.313 --> 31:59.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are going to game the
system. That's always true.

31:59.050 --> 32:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But part of what we're saying is
-- or part of what we're
motiving them to do is to do

32:03.421 --> 32:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forms of community engagement
that we think will be
transformative for them.

32:08.527 --> 32:13.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the things about
community service and community
engagement is, if students have

32:13.064 --> 32:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authentic choices, and it's
well-structured,
well-supervised, they have time
for reflection

32:18.470 --> 32:24.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with adults and with peers, even
if it's mandatory, it tends to
be helpful and it often is
transformative.

32:24.810 --> 32:29.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's a powerful learning
experience. So you might even do
it for the wrong reason, but

32:29.281 --> 32:32.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
end up getting a lot
of benefit from it.

32:32.017 --> 32:35.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you think
that's the way it works, you
mandate somebody to do community

32:35.053 --> 32:39.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service and then you believe
they will get something out of
it?

32:39.491 --> 32:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD WEISSBOURD: Well, we're
not mandating it. We are
encouraging it. We are saying
that,

32:45.463 --> 32:51.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, it's not about doing a
brief stint overseas. It is
about doing something
meaningful,

32:51.937 --> 32:55.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doing something in a diverse
group, doing it for a year, nine
months to a year, doing

32:55.540 --> 32:59.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it for a sustained
period of time.

32:59.077 --> 33:02.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the chances are greater that
you're going to get something
out of that kind of experience,

33:02.914 --> 33:05.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you're going to be able to
describe in the application in a
way that's meaningful

33:05.717 --> 33:08.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and expresses what was
meaningful about it to you.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's a
report certainly worth looking
at.

33:12.257 --> 33:15.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richard Weissbourd at the
Harvard School of Education, we
thank you.

33:15.060 --> 33:25.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD WEISSBOURD: Well, thank
you. It's a pleasure to be here.

33:25.370 --> 33:31.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We turn now to the
race for the White House and a
familiar face on the campaign

33:31.710 --> 33:34.379 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
trail.

33:34.379 --> 33:39.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former Alaska Governor Sarah
Palin stumped for Republican
candidate Donald Trump today,

33:39.551 --> 33:44.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after giving him her official
blessing last night in Iowa. In
Tulsa, Oklahoma, she took

33:44.155 --> 33:48.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aim for the second day in a row
at the Republican establishment.

33:48.293 --> 33:53.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH PALIN (R), Former Alaska
Governor: Here we got a redhead
from the big red apple running

33:53.765 --> 34:00.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for president, and yet the GOP
machine, all of a sudden,
they're saying we're not red

34:00.672 --> 34:04.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough, we're not
conservative enough.

34:04.109 --> 34:08.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I say, what in the world do
they know about conservatism?

34:08.013 --> 34:12.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And with less than
two weeks to go before the first
voting begins, we get

34:12.450 --> 34:17.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the latest now from political
reporters in two key states.

34:17.155 --> 34:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Steinhauser, political
director for NH1 News Network,
joins us from Manchester, New

34:22.060 --> 34:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hampshire. And O. Kay Henderson
is news director at Radio Iowa.
She is in Des Moines, Iowa.

34:29.034 --> 34:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kay, what is the effect of the
Sarah Palin bombshell yesterday
in Iowa?

34:34.906 --> 34:38.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON, News Director,
Radio Iowa: Well, number one, it
plays into the Trump

34:38.376 --> 34:42.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
playbook. It steals all of the
oxygen from the room, and that's
all anyone is talking

34:42.580 --> 34:47.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about today, is Sarah
Palin and Donald Trump.

34:47.085 --> 34:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, she's kept in touch
with Tea Party activists here in
Iowa over the years. And,

34:51.556 --> 34:56.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
number three, I think it
amplifies the core message that
he has been spreading. And she

34:56.728 --> 35:03.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
uses a phrase typically called
crony capitalism up against what
she's been railing for years,

35:03.401 --> 35:08.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he is the embodiment of that
in terms of how he's motivating
people who are upset

35:08.540 --> 35:12.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the establishment and
the -- quote -- "crony
capitalists."

35:12.811 --> 35:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's no question
she can suck the air out of the
political room, and she's

35:17.882 --> 35:22.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also had the effect of getting
people elected, including Ted
Cruz to the United States
Senate,

35:22.954 --> 35:27.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who seems to have been the one
person really campaigning for
her endorsement.

35:27.158 --> 35:33.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: And, also, she
endorsed Terry Branstad here in
Iowa when he ran to

35:33.732 --> 35:39.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
return as governor in 2010. She
was an early endorser of Joni
Ernst, the U.S. senator from

35:39.838 --> 35:44.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iowa, who won in a surprise --
in a five-way primary in 2014
and then went on to win the

35:44.442 --> 35:47.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seat in the U.S. Senate.

35:47.178 --> 35:51.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Paul Steinhauser,
does it reverberate the same way
in New Hampshire?

35:51.249 --> 35:56.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER, NH1 News
Network: Maybe not as important
here in New Hampshire, but,

35:56.221 --> 35:59.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
yes, it's definitely an
endorsement that can't hurt
Donald Trump. It could only help
him

35:59.024 --> 36:00.859 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

36:00.859 --> 36:05.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was covering Ted Cruz. I was
speaking with the senator
minutes after the endorsement

36:05.630 --> 36:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened. I was able to talk to
him about that. And he
definitely downplayed the
endorsement.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he's still friends with
Sarah Palin. He recognized that
she helped him get elected

36:11.436 --> 36:14.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Senate in 2012.

36:14.372 --> 36:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then Ted Cruz looked me
straight in the eye and he said,
at the end of the day, it's

36:17.442 --> 36:20.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the voters who are going to
determine who's the real
conservative candidate in this
race.

36:20.779 --> 36:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it hurts his argument a
little bit, because he's been in
a war of words with Donald Trump

36:24.682 --> 36:29.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for two weeks now, arguing that
Trump is not the real
conservative. When Palin comes
and

36:29.120 --> 36:31.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endorses Trump, yes, its stings
a little bit. But, at the end of
the day, how much do
endorsements

36:31.689 --> 36:34.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
matter? I guess we will
find out in a few weeks.

36:34.392 --> 36:37.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, of course,
it's easy, especially leading up
to the voting in just a couple

36:37.462 --> 36:41.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of weeks, Paul, to get caught up
in the day-to-day polls, but
there are a couple of polls in

36:41.466 --> 36:45.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the past 24 hours which show
Donald Trump with a quite
definitive lead in New
Hampshire.

36:45.170 --> 36:47.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL STEINHAUSER: Yes.

36:47.939 --> 36:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that has been the case for
quite some time. Unlike Iowa,
where you have got a real

36:51.443 --> 36:55.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
horse race right now between
Trump and Cruz, here in the
Granite State, Trump has been

36:55.880 --> 36:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the front-runner, the clear
front-runner for quite some
time. The last two polls that
came

36:58.083 --> 37:01.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out in the last 24 hours
say the same thing.

37:01.186 --> 37:05.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, the battle is for
second place and we have two
polls out in the last two

37:05.490 --> 37:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days that are very different,
one saying that John Kasich is
the clear second-place standing

37:10.628 --> 37:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- in standing right now.
Another one shows Ted Cruz in
second place.

37:15.300 --> 37:19.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz hasn't been here a lot
until this week. He's doing a
five-day bus tour. He's getting

37:19.804 --> 37:24.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some pretty large crowds. Kasich
is also roaming around the state
with his bus. And he's getting

37:24.309 --> 37:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some pretty large crowds as
well. Don't count out Jeb Bush.
Don't count out Chris Christie.

37:29.180 --> 37:31.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't count out Marco Rubio. We
really have a five-way battle
right now for second and

37:31.983 --> 37:33.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
third places here in
New Hampshire, Gwen.

37:33.852 --> 37:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is it a five-way
battle in Iowa as well, Kay?

37:36.154 --> 37:41.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: It seems to be
two tiers of competition here.

37:41.526 --> 37:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have the Trump vs. Cruz
competing for number one, and
then you have Carson and Rubio

37:46.831 --> 37:52.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of positioned to be the
alternative in that second tier,
and then everybody else

37:52.604 --> 37:57.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is in that bottom tier, trying
to make their way to be a
competitor against Carson and

37:57.175 --> 38:00.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rubio, and maybe emerge as
the establishment candidate.

38:00.378 --> 38:04.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
Democratic side of this
equation, Paul, which has also

38:04.349 --> 38:08.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tightened up far more than a lot
of people expected, especially
in New Hampshire.

38:08.720 --> 38:12.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER: Yes, in New
Hampshire, it's been a very
different story than the rest

38:12.123 --> 38:14.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

38:14.259 --> 38:18.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had this great race
between Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders going back to
July.

38:18.730 --> 38:22.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That wasn't the case elsewhere.
I know now he has tightened up
the race in Iowa, but

38:22.634 --> 38:26.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sanders has been the
front-runner in all the polls
here, and a new one out just
yesterday

38:26.371 --> 38:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
indicated him up 27 points.

38:29.207 --> 38:33.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, I don't know if we believe
that, but he is the front-runner
here. Maybe it's only

38:33.545 --> 38:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by eight or 10 or 12, but he is
the front-runner here. And that
has put Hillary Clinton on

38:38.383 --> 38:41.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the defensive. You have seen her
step up her attacks against
Bernie Sanders over the last

38:41.986 --> 38:44.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two weeks. You saw the debate
the other night. And just in the
last day or two, it's getting

38:44.255 --> 38:46.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even uglier.

38:46.457 --> 38:50.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Listen, Sanders is popular here.
He's from the neighboring state
of Vermont. But I think

38:50.828 --> 38:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it also shows that, just like we
saw with Republican primary
voters in New Hampshire,

38:55.633 --> 38:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic primary voters, they
are frustrated, they're angry.
They're angry at politicians.

38:59.437 --> 39:02.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're angry at Washington.
They look at Bernie Sanders.
Even though he's a politician,

39:02.473 --> 39:06.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he looks like the
anti-politician. That's why he's
getting a lot of this excitement

39:06.144 --> 39:08.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that's why he's doing
well in the polls here.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Are the Clinton
folks getting nervous in Iowa,
Kay?

39:09.981 --> 39:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: Well, she is
dedicating a lot of her personal
time to come here in

39:14.552 --> 39:18.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Iowa and campaign
throughout the weekend.

39:18.723 --> 39:22.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I covered her in Toledo, Iowa,
earlier this weekend. And she
was telling voters that they

39:22.860 --> 39:27.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to choose someone who has a
sensible, achievable agenda. It
struck me that is sort

39:27.832 --> 39:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of like your parents telling you
that you have to choose the
practical. And that's the

39:32.971 --> 39:38.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
message that she's going out to
Iowans with to counter the
Bernie Sanders political
revolution

39:38.476 --> 39:43.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rhetoric that's really firing up
some of the Democrats in Iowa.

39:43.014 --> 39:46.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a real nail-biter here
in Iowa. It's hard to tell when
you're on the ground who

39:46.684 --> 39:48.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has the advantage.

39:48.853 --> 39:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, it's funny,
because people usually resist
what their parents tell them

39:52.490 --> 39:56.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about these kinds of things.
They love the insurgents, the
bad boy.

39:56.060 --> 40:00.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But both in Iowa and New
Hampshire, both of you sum this
up for me. What are voters
telling

40:00.632 --> 40:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you that explains what's driving
this kind of volatility at this
stage in the campaign,

40:05.069 --> 40:06.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
starting with you, Paul?

40:06.738 --> 40:11.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER: Well, again, I
think it's just you throw all
the rules out the window

40:11.576 --> 40:14.412 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
when it comes to
this election cycle.

40:14.412 --> 40:18.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Voters in both parties, they are
frustrated, they want something
different, they want change.

40:18.983 --> 40:22.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why you're seeing Bernie
Sanders and Donald Trump here in
New Hampshire resonating

40:22.420 --> 40:24.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so well and leading, and leading
by a lot in these latest polls,
Gwen.

40:24.522 --> 40:26.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Kay?

40:26.524 --> 40:30.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: If I could
quote Sarah Palin, last night,
she said, "We're mad because we

40:30.695 --> 40:33.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have been had."

40:33.531 --> 40:36.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that sums up what the
grassroots in both parties feels
like right now here on

40:36.734 --> 40:38.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the ground in Iowa.

40:38.870 --> 40:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, Kay, one of the
cliches of Iowa politics is, it
doesn't matter until

40:42.507 --> 40:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people will show up for these
very
difficult-to-manage-and-organize
caucuses.

40:49.247 --> 40:52.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does that, in the end,
still hold true this year?

40:52.617 --> 40:57.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: Clinton has an
advantage, in that she started
months before Sanders

40:57.588 --> 41:02.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and she had far more financial
resources to plow into an
organization that her people

41:02.193 --> 41:05.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think will turn people
out on caucus night.

41:05.697 --> 41:11.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both Sanders and Trump have the
problem of actually telling
people that they have to

41:11.469 --> 41:16.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go to a specific site at a
specific time and figure out the
caucus process. It's not like

41:16.908 --> 41:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the New Hampshire primary, which
is easy. You have to caucus at a
specific time and

41:21.312 --> 41:22.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a specific location.

41:22.747 --> 41:25.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Well, we
will be there with you.

41:25.116 --> 41:29.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
O. Kay Henderson of Radio Iowa
Network and Paul Steinhauser of
-- political director

41:29.854 --> 41:31.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of NH1, thank you
both very much.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
O. KAY HENDERSON: Thank you.

41:32.590 --> 41:34.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL STEINHAUSER: Thank you.

41:34.859 --> 41:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, of course, we
will always have the latest
political news for you here,

41:39.497 --> 41:43.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the "PBS NewsHour" hosts the
next Democratic presidential
debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

41:43.401 --> 41:45.436 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on February 11.

41:45.436 --> 41:49.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This will be the
first time the Democratic
candidates will meet after

41:49.874 --> 41:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
votes are cast in those Iowa
caucuses and just two days after
the New Hampshire primary.

41:54.979 --> 41:58.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We are working with
Facebook to start discussion
among voters now, inviting

41:58.950 --> 42:03.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
engaged voters who are still
deciding how to vote to join our
new Facebook group. You

42:03.588 --> 42:06.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can talk with the "PBS NewsHour"
politics team and possibly have
one of your questions

42:06.858 --> 42:09.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
asked during the debate.

42:09.894 --> 42:13.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You can find out
more about our debate on our
Facebook group on the "NewsHour"

42:13.598 --> 42:15.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Facebook page.

42:15.400 --> 42:22.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And we will see you
in Milwaukee on February 11.

42:22.673 --> 42:34.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we wrap up on
our series on Understanding
Autism.

42:34.852 --> 42:40.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we get the perspective
of two seasoned journalists,
John Donvan and Caren Zucker.

42:40.691 --> 42:45.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been reporting on
autism for years, particularly
on some of the people behind

42:45.296 --> 42:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fight to better understand
this disorder, from parents, to
doctors, to the afflicted

42:50.802 --> 42:53.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

42:53.504 --> 42:58.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's the main theme of their
new book, "In a Different Key:
The Story of Autism."

42:58.142 --> 43:00.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeff Brown talked
with them recently.

43:00.178 --> 43:03.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Caren Zucker,
John Donvan, welcome to you.

43:03.080 --> 43:03.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN, Co-Author, "In a
Different Key: The Story of
Autism": Thank you.

43:03.581 --> 43:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER, Co-Author, "In a
Different Key: The Story of
Autism": Hi.

43:04.048 --> 43:07.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You write in the
introduction the story of autism
is many -- actually many

43:07.151 --> 43:09.187 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stories.

43:09.187 --> 43:12.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Donvan, start. What does
that mean, when you look at the
kind of arc of the story you're

43:12.557 --> 43:14.192 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
telling?

43:14.192 --> 43:17.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Well, the arc is
that there's a very big picture,
like the tide moving in

43:17.228 --> 43:20.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and moving out, but there are
a lot of waves along the way.

43:20.097 --> 43:25.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The story of autism is made up
of so many people in so many
periods of time. And "In

43:25.002 --> 43:29.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Different Key" tries to bring
them all into one place to show
how this condition that

43:29.941 --> 43:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we had never heard of until
about 75 years ago came into
consciousness.

43:33.711 --> 43:36.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And many people
not even until much more
recently than that. Right?

43:36.581 --> 43:38.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Many people only
heard about it in the last 15
years or so, largely as

43:38.749 --> 43:41.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a result of controversy.

43:41.219 --> 43:44.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER: And also, in
autism, if you have met one
person with autism, you have

43:44.922 --> 43:47.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
met one person, because
the spectrum is so huge.

43:47.825 --> 43:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You both come to
this through personal
experience, right?

43:49.827 --> 43:52.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Yes.

43:52.196 --> 43:59.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER: Yes. I have a 21
year-old son with autism who's
now a young adult.

43:59.937 --> 44:05.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our book looks back at the
history at how far forward we
have gone, from being in
institutions

44:05.343 --> 44:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not having a place to go to
school. But it sort of stops at
adults.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Well, yes.

44:11.048 --> 44:15.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our thought is that the
people who fought battles over
the last 75 years to get their

44:15.152 --> 44:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids out of institutions and
into schools where legally they
were barred -- schools

44:18.623 --> 44:19.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could say, we're not going
to educate your kid.

44:19.690 --> 44:22.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes.

44:22.093 --> 44:26.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Things moved so
much, not perfectly, but they
moved so much that we want that
message

44:26.163 --> 44:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be an inspiration for the job
that's still there to done.

44:30.167 --> 44:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You talk about
things being shrouded in shame,
secrecy, and ignorance.

44:33.104 --> 44:36.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Give me an example. What
do you mean by that?

44:36.841 --> 44:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER: Well, parents were
told to put their children in
institutions. And that was

44:39.844 --> 44:42.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the thing that you did.

44:42.613 --> 44:47.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keeping them at home, nobody did
that. And if they did, they hid
them. And if they put

44:47.685 --> 44:52.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them in institutions, they
didn't tell anyone. It was what
doctors told you to do.

44:52.757 --> 44:56.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And to forget about
your kids. They would say, put
your kids there, go home,

44:56.327 --> 45:01.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take care of your kids who are
normal, and try to forget those
kids. And some parents,

45:01.098 --> 45:04.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many parents did that through
about the 1950s or '60s.

45:04.235 --> 45:08.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The whole history
you tell from back then, even
through to today, is

45:08.005 --> 45:12.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
filled with confusions,
arguments, counterarguments.

45:12.076 --> 45:19.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, everything seems to be on
the table, definitions,
responses, even to today,
whether there's

45:19.183 --> 45:22.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an actual epidemic,
all of this. Right?

45:22.620 --> 45:27.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Well, that's
because autism itself is
actually not a very clearly
defined concept.

45:27.858 --> 45:32.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the proof of that is, the
definition has changed again and
again and again over the

45:32.997 --> 45:39.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years. It's a condition where
there's no DNA test, there's no
cheek swab, biological marker.

45:39.704 --> 45:44.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Autism is defined by looking at
behaviors. And everybody looks
at behaviors differently.

45:44.442 --> 45:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, over the years, autism has
almost been a diagnosis in the
eye of the beholder, which

45:49.280 --> 45:53.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
allows for all kinds of
arguments and dissension and
theories and competing therapies
to come

45:53.618 --> 45:55.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into play.

45:55.853 --> 46:00.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER: But there's one
thing that's been a constant,
which is the parental love.

46:00.191 --> 46:04.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you read the stories in this
book, throughout all of the
battles, all of the fights, all

46:04.562 --> 46:08.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the controversies, it's all
about fighting for their kids.

46:08.165 --> 46:11.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's a story,
that runs through the book,
parents, and then activists, of

46:11.435 --> 46:12.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
course, but parents
really leading the way.

46:12.937 --> 46:12.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Parents were...

46:12.903 --> 46:14.338 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

46:14.338 --> 46:17.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER: Right, which is
why this is -- this isn't just
-- this isn't a book for

46:17.408 --> 46:22.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the autism community, per se.
It's for everybody who's ever
had a child, who's ever cared
about

46:22.279 --> 46:25.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
somebody. What wouldn't
you do for your child?

46:25.216 --> 46:28.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Was there a
character that jumps out at you
that you could tell us about?

46:28.419 --> 46:32.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Our friend Donald
Triplett was the first child
diagnosed with autism. Caren

46:32.056 --> 46:37.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
found him back in 2007.

46:37.228 --> 46:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You found a phone number that
you thought might be his, and
you called him up. And we

46:40.398 --> 46:43.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weren't sure it was the guy who
showed up in the medical
literature as case one, because

46:43.501 --> 46:45.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the only name was
given was Donald T.

46:45.670 --> 46:48.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what did you hear?

46:48.372 --> 46:54.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAREN ZUCKER: I got his
answering machine. And he
answered, "Hello, this is Donald
Triplett.

46:54.478 --> 46:59.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Happy June. Happy fall. Happy
Christmas. And a great 2007 to
you."

46:59.050 --> 47:02.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I knew as soon as -- it was,
like, John, it's -- we found
him. We got him. This is

47:02.586 --> 47:05.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald. We definitely
have Donald.

47:05.056 --> 47:08.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: He's such a
wonderful guy, Donald, but the
wonderful thing about his story,
a

47:08.859 --> 47:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
couple of things, one is that
who is and who he has turned out
to be. He was very, very

47:12.730 --> 47:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
severely disabled as a child.

47:15.433 --> 47:19.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the role model for the
diagnosis of autism. He couldn't
use language effectively, didn't

47:19.036 --> 47:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
connect with people. And, today,
he has a wonderful life as a man
in his 80s. He's living

47:25.276 --> 47:28.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alone in a little town in
Mississippi. He plays golf all
the time. He travels the world.

47:28.846 --> 47:31.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He has friends.

47:31.082 --> 47:34.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the other thing about that
story is his community and the
role they played in it.

47:34.885 --> 47:37.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER: They have totally
embraced him. They accepted him
for being different, so

47:37.555 --> 47:39.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he wasn't different.

47:39.390 --> 47:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Given this sort
of history of confusion,
counterarguments, what do you

47:42.560 --> 47:44.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
see happening now?

47:44.495 --> 47:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: We're at a point
now where things aren't perfect,
but we have at least tried

47:50.067 --> 47:53.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to address the challenges of
children with autism in ways
that we weren't doing nearly

47:53.104 --> 47:56.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sufficiently even 25 years ago.

47:56.407 --> 48:02.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're in public schools.
They're getting direct education
and direct therapy. But that's,

48:02.680 --> 48:06.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we think, the job only being
half-done, because there's a
whole -- something's going to
happen

48:06.584 --> 48:09.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to all of these kids, and
they're basically going to grow
up -- like, your son has just

48:09.120 --> 48:11.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
turned 21.

48:11.222 --> 48:14.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER: And his whole
life, he's had incredible
support and services, because of

48:14.825 --> 48:16.293 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
the parents that
fought for them.

48:16.293 --> 48:17.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You
see more acceptance.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Definitely.

48:18.562 --> 48:20.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You see more
understanding in the society.

48:20.898 --> 48:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: For children.

48:22.767 --> 48:26.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For children. But
you still see many problems.

48:26.403 --> 48:29.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Well, there's a lot
of dissension and controversy of
all kinds. There always

48:29.106 --> 48:31.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been in the autism community.

48:31.475 --> 48:35.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have lived through some of
them. The whole vaccine debate
has been one of them. There

48:35.579 --> 48:40.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are disagreements over whether
autism is something that should
be always and all the time
embraced

48:40.284 --> 48:44.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and celebrated as just a
different way to be human, or
whether autism sometimes can

48:44.789 --> 48:50.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be really so debilitating to
individuals that you want to do
something to change those
disabilities

48:50.494 --> 48:53.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in them.

48:53.164 --> 48:56.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are fault lines all of the
time. But I don't think there's
a fault line on this

48:56.534 --> 49:00.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question of, what do we do about
adults? I think everybody agrees
it's a problem, but

49:00.504 --> 49:06.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nobody really has a solution.
And I don't sense that people
are loving the adults the

49:06.610 --> 49:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way they have learned to love
kids, because the truth is,
they're not going to be cute

49:11.182 --> 49:14.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the same as kids are. And
they shouldn't have to be cute
to deserve and merit our
attention

49:14.218 --> 49:16.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and support.

49:16.353 --> 49:18.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you have a
last word on that? Is it a
cultural issue? A political

49:18.322 --> 49:20.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issue? Or what do see?

49:20.658 --> 49:28.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER: I think it's
cultural first, that some adults
are -- they're not embraced,

49:28.432 --> 49:31.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people -- they're unknown
still. People aren't used to
having adults with autism
around.

49:31.902 --> 49:35.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: A little story we
tell in our book is the perfect
thing.

49:35.239 --> 49:38.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened a few years ago on a
bus in New Jersey. There was a
kid sitting on a bus.

49:38.576 --> 49:44.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was about 19 years old -- 17
years old. He's learning how to
ride the bus. His teacher

49:44.248 --> 49:47.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is in the back of the bus. He's
been for weeks showing him how
to ride the bus, and he's

49:47.551 --> 49:51.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been fading himself
farther and farther back.

49:51.155 --> 49:55.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the kid starts making some
noises and flipping his fingers
and rocking in an odd

49:55.025 --> 49:59.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way. And two passengers behind
him start getting agitated about
this. And they start saying

49:59.396 --> 50:03.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to this kid, "Hey, weirdo,
what's you're problem?"

50:03.868 --> 50:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the great -- yes, the great
thing is what happened next.

50:07.438 --> 50:10.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CAREN ZUCKER: Is that he had
been riding a bus for a few
weeks. So the people on the

50:10.674 --> 50:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bus were used to him. And some
guy stood up and said, "Hey,
he's got autism. What's your

50:17.882 --> 50:20.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem? What's your reason
for acting like a jerk?"

50:20.951 --> 50:24.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what happened is a
community formed around him.

50:24.321 --> 50:26.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Both the problem
was there and the solution was
there.

50:26.790 --> 50:28.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right. That's
one of the many stories told in
the book.

50:28.826 --> 50:31.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the book is "In a Different
Key: The Story of Autism."

50:31.462 --> 50:37.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Caren Zucker, John
Donvan, thank you both.

50:37.067 --> 50:41.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Thanks,
Jeff, very much.

50:41.805 --> 50:48.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CAREN ZUCKER: Thank
you for having us.

50:48.345 --> 50:53.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight, a
young life dedicated to
capturing beauty cut short by

50:53.150 --> 50:55.452 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
violence.

50:55.452 --> 51:00.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Al-Qaida militants attacked a
hotel in Burkina Faso on Friday.
Thirty people were killed,

51:00.691 --> 51:05.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including two who worked
for Amnesty International.

51:05.195 --> 51:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the amnesty workers was a
French-Moroccan photographer
named Leila Alaoui.

51:10.000 --> 51:15.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Earlier today, we spoke with one
of Alaoui's closest friends,
Aida Alami, who is also a

51:15.406 --> 51:20.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalist. We reached her by
phone at Alaoui's funeral in
Marrakesh, Morocco.

51:20.377 --> 51:26.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AIDA ALAMI, Friend of Leila
Alaoui: She was a luminous,
really vibrant person. She was

51:26.116 --> 51:30.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really positive. She loved her
job. She loved her friends.

51:30.521 --> 51:37.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she was a very active young
woman, traveling all the time,
working on topics she really

51:37.227 --> 51:41.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loved. She was very focused,
very dedicated to her work and
her subject.

51:41.565 --> 51:47.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, there's an anecdote I have
heard her say a lot, is that she
was French-Moroccan,

51:47.871 --> 51:53.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so, because of her French
passport, she could travel
everywhere, and she was always
really

51:53.777 --> 52:00.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interested in all these people
who could not cross borders and
so on. And she was wondering

52:00.017 --> 52:04.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why they were trying -- they
were risking their lives to go
to the other side.

52:04.621 --> 52:12.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She had a way of photographing
people like not many people, I
think, can do it. And so

52:12.896 --> 52:17.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she started getting to the
portraits -- into doing
portraits all over the world.
She did

52:17.434 --> 52:20.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of human rights
campaigns for free.

52:20.437 --> 52:26.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was just interested in
capturing people and capturing
people who were going through

52:26.276 --> 52:31.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hard times. And the reason she
was in Burkina is I know that
she was taking photos of
powerful

52:31.515 --> 52:35.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women. And she was actually
sending me once she was there a
lot of pictures of these women

52:35.386 --> 52:39.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that she was photographing, and
reported on subjects where she
was embedded for a long

52:39.990 --> 52:45.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, for example, the plight of
Sub-Saharan Africans in Morocco.

52:45.329 --> 52:51.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was so into it that I
couldn't see Leila without her
getting tons of phone calls of

52:51.669 --> 52:55.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
undocumented people telling her
they were trying to cross, and
her giving them advice

52:55.572 --> 52:59.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and tell them, "No, don't
risk your life, don't cross."

She was constantly trying to
help them find a doctor, find
money for them. One day, I

53:05.783 --> 53:10.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was reporting on sub-Saharan
migrants in Morocco, and she
said told me, "Oh, well, this

subjects, just come
over to my place."

53:17.227 --> 53:21.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I walked in, and there were,
like, 40 people in her living
room, and she was making

53:21.298 --> 53:37.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dinner for -- I mean, lunch for
them. I mean, she was just very
intense about all her subjects.

And scientists at Caltech have
found evidence of a massive
faraway planet. If true, it
would

our solar system, an honor once
